https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05851v1,Distribution Hub Optimization: Application of Conditional P-Median Using Road Network Distances,"This paper explores a GIS-based application of the conditional p-median problem (where p=1) in last-mile delivery logistics. The rapid growth of e-commerce in Pakistan has primarily benefited logistics companies, which face the challenge of resolving inefficiencies in the existing infrastructure and scaling effectively to meet increasing demand. Addressing these challenges would not only reduce operational costs but also lower carbon footprints. We present an algorithm that utilizes road-network-based distances to determine the optimal location for a new hub facility, a problem known in operations research as the conditional p-median problem. The algorithm optimizes the placement of a new facility, given q existing facilities. The past delivery data for this research was provided by Muller and Phipps Logistics Pakistan. Our method involves constructing a distance matrix between candidate hub locations and past delivery points, followed by a grid search to identify the optimal hub location. To simulate the absence of past delivery data, we repeated the process using the population distribution of Lahore. Our results demonstrate a 16% reduction in average delivery distance with the addition of a new hub.","With the rise in smartphone accessibility and improved internet connectivity in Pakistan, e-commerce has experienced rapid growth over the past decade. In addition, the advent of COVID-19 led to a 76% increase in the number of e-commerce merchants—from 1,707 in 2019–20 to 3,003 in 2020–21. The e-commerce market is further projected to grow from $7.7 billion in 2022 to $9.1 billion by 2025, representing an annual growth rate of 6% [1]. Pakistan’s logistics market is estimated at $35 billion annually, and global freight transport is expected to grow 2.6-fold by 2050 compared to 2015 levels [2]. Rapid urbanization in developing economies like Pakistan has led to the emergence of large, dense cities such as Lahore. This urban growth has placed considerable strain on infrastructure and transport planning, as seen in the sharp rise in vehicle ownership [3]. The resulting increase in traffic congestion, loss of green spaces, and higher vehicle emissions underscore the need for sustainable urban logistics [4]. Effective management of these challenges is crucial to ensure the efficient distribution of goods, maintain service reliability, and uphold an appropriate level of service [5]. The p-median problem aims to identify the optimal locations for p new facilities to serve a set of demand points, minimizing the distance between the demand points and their nearest facility. When q facilities already exist in the area and the goal is to add p additional facilities, the problem is known as the conditional p-median problem [6]. After determining the positions of the p new facilities, demand will be served by the nearest facility, whether existing or new. In this context, the facilities are distribution hubs responsible for dispatching couriers for last-mile delivery, while past deliveries represent the demand points. In this paper, we propose a method to optimize the location of one additional facility (p=1), given that three facilities already exist. This is referred to as the conditional 1-median problem, or (1,q)-median problem."
