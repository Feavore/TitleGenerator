https://arxiv.org/html/2411.02882v1,Approximation Algorithms for the Freeze Tag Problem inside Polygons,"The freeze tag problem (FTP) aims to awaken a swarm of robots with one or more initial awake robots as soon as possible. Each awake robot must touch a sleeping robot to wake it up. Once a robot is awakened, it can assist in awakening other sleeping robots. We study this problem inside a polygonal domain and present approximation algorithms for it.Keywords: Freeze tag problem; Swarm robotics; Polygonal domain; t-spanner; Geodesic graphs","Swarm robotics (SR) aims at coordinating multiple robots towards cooperatively performing a particular job. SR has various applications for example in target search and tracking [1, 2], medicine [3], agricultural mechanization [4], road freight [5], and autonomous underwater vehicles [6]. For more discussion, see [7]. Consider the following problem from SR. Given a set of robots denoted by S={s0,…,sn}𝑆subscript𝑠0…subscript𝑠𝑛S=\{s_{0},\dots,s_{n}\}italic_S = { italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , … , italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } with a single initial awake robot s0subscript𝑠0s_{0}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the remaining asleep robots, in the freeze tag problem (FTP), we study how to awaken all robots as soon as possible. Note that once an asleep robot has been awakened, it can assist in awakening other asleep robots. Each awake robot should move next to an asleep robot to awaken it. Observe that S𝑆Sitalic_S can be modeled as points in some metric space such as vertices of a graph with weighted edges. It is proved that the FTP is NP-hard even on star graphs with an equal number of robots at each leaf, however, a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) and a greedy approximation algorithm (GA) are given for this case [8]. It is also proved that the approximation factor of the GA, where each robot arriving at the root awakens the unawakened robot at the shortest edge, has a lower bound of 7/3737/37 / 3, moreover, a 14141414-approximation algorithm was proposed for the FTP on star graphs with different numbers of robots at each leaf [8]. Some heuristics are studied in [9]. If there exist more than one initial awake robot, we denote the problem by k𝑘kitalic_k-FTP, where k𝑘kitalic_k is the number of initially awake robots. A PTAS is presented for the 2222-FTP in Euclidean space [10]. It is proved that the FTP in the 2222 and 3333 dimensional Euclidean spaces is NP-hard in [11] and [12], respectively. An O⁢(1)𝑂1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )-approximation algorithm and a PTAS are given for the FTP in Euclidean space in [8]. The FTP inside simple polygons was studied in [13]. Depending on the metric used for the distance between robots inside a polygonal domain P𝑃Pitalic_P, we consider two versions for the FTP: the geodesic FTP (GFTP) and visibility FTP (VFTP). In the GFTP inside P𝑃Pitalic_P, the distance between every pair of robots sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and sjsubscript𝑠𝑗s_{j}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for 0≤i,j≤nformulae-sequence0𝑖𝑗𝑛0\leq i,j\leq n0 ≤ italic_i , italic_j ≤ italic_n is the geodesic distance between sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and sjsubscript𝑠𝑗s_{j}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, i.e. the length of the shortest path between two robots sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and sjsubscript𝑠𝑗s_{j}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT inside P𝑃Pitalic_P denoted by π⁢(si,sj)𝜋subscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑠𝑗\pi(s_{i},s_{j})italic_π ( italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) (Figure 1). For the VFTP, the distance between any two robots sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and sjsubscript𝑠𝑗s_{j}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is not symmetric; the distance from sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to sjsubscript𝑠𝑗s_{j}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, called the geodesic visibility distance (GVD) from sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to sjsubscript𝑠𝑗s_{j}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, is the shortest path that sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT should travel inside P𝑃Pitalic_P such that sjsubscript𝑠𝑗s_{j}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can be visible from sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (Figure 2). Lubiw and Zeng [13] proved that the GFTP and VFTP are NP-hard. In this paper, we give approximation algorithms for the GFTP and VFTP.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.03037v1,Top-k Stabbing Interval Queries,"We investigate a weighted variant of the interval stabbing problem, where the goal is to design an efficient data structure for a given set ℐℐ\mathcal{I}caligraphic_I of weighted intervals such that, for a query point q𝑞qitalic_q and an integer k>0𝑘0k>0italic_k > 0, we can report the k𝑘kitalic_k intervals with largest weights among those stabbed by q𝑞qitalic_q. In this paper, we present a linear space solution with O⁢(log⁡n+k)𝑂𝑛𝑘O(\log n+k)italic_O ( roman_log italic_n + italic_k ) query time. Moreover, we also present another trade-off for the problem.","The interval stabbing problem is an important problem in computational geometry [2, 1, 4], which asks to compute all intervals stabbed by a query point. In this paper, we study a natural variant of this problem where, instead of computing all stabbed intervals, the goal is to find a subset of the stabbed intervals that “best” represent them [1]. Formally, the problem is defined as follows. Let ℐℐ\mathcal{I}caligraphic_I be a set of n𝑛nitalic_n intervals on the real line, each with a real valued weight. The set ℐℐ\mathcal{I}caligraphic_I is static. The goal is to preprocess ℐℐ\mathcal{I}caligraphic_I so that, for a query value q𝑞qitalic_q and a positive integer k𝑘kitalic_k, the k𝑘kitalic_k intervals stabbed by q𝑞qitalic_q with largest weights can be reported efficiently. An interval [si,ei]∈ℐsubscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑒𝑖ℐ[s_{i},e_{i}]\in\mathcal{I}[ italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ] ∈ caligraphic_I is stabbed by q𝑞qitalic_q if and only if si≤q≤eisubscript𝑠𝑖𝑞subscript𝑒𝑖s_{i}\leq q\leq e_{i}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≤ italic_q ≤ italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. The problem is useful in cryptocurrency and stock applications [6, 7]. We will refer this variant as the top-k𝑘kitalic_k interval stabbing problem. In this paper, we present a linear space solution with O⁢(log⁡n+k)𝑂𝑛𝑘O(\log n+k)italic_O ( roman_log italic_n + italic_k ) query time. In the rank space, the query time can be reduced to O⁢(k)𝑂𝑘O(k)italic_O ( italic_k ). Moreover, we also present a solution that uses only segment tree structure. It takes O⁢(n⁢log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\log n)italic_O ( italic_n roman_log italic_n ) space and time to build, and O⁢(log⁡n+k⁢log⁡log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑘𝑛O(\log n+k\log\log n)italic_O ( roman_log italic_n + italic_k roman_log roman_log italic_n ) time to answer a query. In rank space, the query time can be improved to O⁢(log⁡n+k)𝑂𝑛𝑘O(\log n+k)italic_O ( roman_log italic_n + italic_k ). Amagata et al. [1] has proposed two algorithms for the problem; one algorithm uses interval tree structure while the other one employs segment tree structure. The algorithm based on interval tree structure takes linear space and O⁢(n⁢log⁡n+k)𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑘O(\sqrt{n}\log n+k)italic_O ( square-root start_ARG italic_n end_ARG roman_log italic_n + italic_k ) time to answer a query. The preprocessing takes O⁢(n⁢log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\log n)italic_O ( italic_n roman_log italic_n ) time. The other algorithm based on segment tree achieves O⁢(log⁡n+k)𝑂𝑛𝑘O(\log n+k)italic_O ( roman_log italic_n + italic_k ) query time, the preprocessing takes O⁢(n⁢log⁡n⁢log⁡log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑛O(n\log n\log\log n)italic_O ( italic_n roman_log italic_n roman_log roman_log italic_n ) time and O⁢(n⁢log2⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript2𝑛O(n\log^{2}n)italic_O ( italic_n roman_log start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_n ) space."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.02685v1,Geometry of naturalistic object representations in recurrent neural network models of working memory,"Working memory is a central cognitive ability crucial for intelligent decision-making. Recent experimental and computational work studying working memory has primarily used categorical (i.e., one-hot) inputs, rather than ecologically-relevant, multidimensional naturalistic ones. Moreover, studies have primarily investigated working memory during single or few number of cognitive tasks. As a result, an understanding of how naturalistic object information is maintained in working memory in neural networks is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we developed sensory-cognitive models, comprising of a convolutional neural network (CNN) coupled with a recurrent neural network (RNN), and trained them on nine distinct N-back tasks using naturalistic stimuli. By examining the RNN’s latent space, we found that: 1) Multi-task RNNs represent both task-relevant and irrelevant information simultaneously while performing tasks; 2) While the latent subspaces used to maintain specific object properties in vanilla RNNs are largely shared across tasks, they are highly task-specific in gated RNNs such as GRU and LSTM; 3) Surprisingly, RNNs embed objects in new representational spaces in which individual object features are less orthogonalized relative to the perceptual space; 4) Interestingly, the transformation of WM encodings (i.e., embedding of visual inputs in the RNN latent space) into memory was shared across stimuli, yet the transformations governing the retention of a memory in the face of incoming distractor stimuli were distinct across time. Our findings indicate that goal-driven RNNs employ chronological memory subspaces to track information over short time spans, enabling testable predictions with neural data.","Working memory (WM) – the ability to store and manipulate information over short periods – is a central cognitive capability that enables a wide spectrum of behaviors (Baddeley, 1992). Over the past few decades, various experimental, computational, and theoretical techniques have been adopted to study WM from both cognitive and neural perspectives. However, several fundamental issues remain unresolved, including the key question of how high-dimensional sensory information is encoded, maintained, and modulated according to specific task demands. A significant body of work has been dedicated to modelling the computations underlying WM. These include many classic models from cognitive science (Meyer and Kieras, 1997a; Ritter et al., 2019; Baddeley et al., 2021), neuroscience (Miller et al., 1996; Wang, 1999; Emrich et al., 2013), and more recently deep learning (Yang et al., 2019; Ehrlich and Murray, 2022). Recent approaches have focused on using artificial neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to understand and model WM due to their ability to learn the complex cognitive tasks that are commonly used to study WM in humans. However, prior studies were limited in three aspects. First, most works used abstract categorical inputs, such as color and location of moving dots that are represented as binary (or one-hot vector) inputs (Panichello and Buschman, 2021; Yang et al., 2019; Piwek et al., 2023). While training models with such categorical inputs is easier in practice, the resulting models offer limited insights into how real world, naturalistic stimuli (which are embedded in high-dimensional spaces) are processed. Second, most prior work has considered single or a few cognitive tasks (Xie et al., 2022; Mante et al., 2013; Piwek et al., 2023), limiting the generality of these models in explaining the neural computations underlying working memory. Lastly, while some prior work has explored how object features are encoded into population activity (Xie et al., 2022), it remains unclear how information in working memory is sustained across time to support concurrent encoding, retention, and retrieval during a dynamic task—and how these processes might align with classic cognitive theories (Luck and Vogel, 1997; Alvarez and Cavanagh, 2004; Franconeri et al., 2013). To address these limitations, we investigated how task-optimized RNNs manipulate the multidimensional properties of naturalistic visual inputs during different stages of WM (Figure 1d). Specifically, we examined: 1) How do task-optimized RNNs select task-relevant properties of naturalistic objects during WM? 2) What computational strategies do RNNs employ to dynamically maintain object properties in the face of incoming (distractor) information? To address these questions, we trained multi-task models on a collection of N-back tasks using naturalistic stimuli, and analyzed the RNNs’ latent space during concurrent encoding, retention, and retrieval of information. We specifically chose the N-back task, given that it requires the dynamic encoding, retention, and retrieval of information in the face of incoming distractor information. This is in contrast to prior studies, which primarily studied WM tasks such as delayed-match-to-sample tasks, which focus on WM maintenance during stable fixation periods. The nature of the N-back task makes it an excellent testbed to evaluate how naturalistic object features are maintained in a dynamic environment that requires on-the-fly WM updates and decision-making. Our main contributions are as follows: • We trained different classes of gated and gateless RNN models on a suite of WM tasks and developed decoder-based analyses to study the geometry of naturalistic object representations during different stages of WM. • We found that task-relevant and -irrelevant object properties are simultaneously encoded in multi-task RNN models, while only gateless RNNs produced shared and reusable representations across tasks. • We found that object features are less orthogonalized in the RNNs’ hidden dynamics compared to perceptual representations. • We found that RNNs solve the N-back task by using chronological memory subspaces to separate object representations presented across time. This finding supports resource-based models of working memory (Alvarez and Cavanagh, 2004; Franconeri et al., 2013) and challenges the classic slot-based model (Luck and Vogel, 1997)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.01482v1,Membership queries for convex floating bodies via Hilbert geometry,"We propose the convex floating body membership problem, which consists of efficiently determining when a query point a∈ℝd𝑎superscriptℝ𝑑a\in\mathbb{R}^{d}italic_a ∈ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT belongs to the so-called ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-convex floating body of a given bounded convex domain K⊂ℝd𝐾superscriptℝ𝑑K\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}italic_K ⊂ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. We consider this problem in an approximate setting, i.e., given a parameter δ>0𝛿0\delta>0italic_δ > 0, the query can be answered either way if the Hilbert distance in K𝐾Kitalic_K of a𝑎aitalic_a from the boundary of a relatively-scaled ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-convex floating body is less than δ𝛿\deltaitalic_δ.

Our construction is motivated by a recent work of Abdelkader and Mount on APM queries, and relies on a comparison of convex floating bodies with balls in the Hilbert metric on K𝐾Kitalic_K.","The problem of testing membership in convex bodies, especially polytopes, has been studied extensively (see [16, 10, 5, 6, 7, 1, 4, 8, 2]), and has many applications. In this paper, we consider the problem of querying from a convex floating body of a given bounded convex domain in ℝd,d≥2superscriptℝ𝑑𝑑2\mathbb{R}^{d},d\geq 2blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_d ≥ 2. See the Sections 1.1 and 1.2 for the definition and relevance of convex floating bodies. Given a bounded convex domain K⊂ℝd𝐾superscriptℝ𝑑K\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}italic_K ⊂ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and an ε>0𝜀0\varepsilon>0italic_ε > 0, let Kεsubscript𝐾𝜀K_{\varepsilon}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT denote the ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-convex floating body (ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-CFB) of K𝐾Kitalic_K. We consider the approximate membership query, which given a query point a∈ℝd𝑎superscriptℝ𝑑a\in\mathbb{R}^{d}italic_a ∈ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, asserts that a∈Kε𝑎subscript𝐾𝜀a\in K_{\varepsilon}italic_a ∈ italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, or asserts that a∉K𝑎𝐾a\notin Kitalic_a ∉ italic_K. Since the Hausdorff distance between Kεsubscript𝐾𝜀K_{\varepsilon}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and K𝐾Kitalic_K may be as large as Ω⁢(ε1/d)Ωsuperscript𝜀1𝑑\Omega(\varepsilon^{1/d})roman_Ω ( italic_ε start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 / italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), we consider a refined membership problem where the region of ambiguity is smaller, and is measured in terms of the (affine-invariant) Hilbert metric on K𝐾Kitalic_K; see Section 1.3 for the precise query problem. As far as we know, data structures for this problem have not been considered in the literature. It is shown in [21] that there exists a polytope P𝑃Pitalic_P with at most O⁢(ε−(d−1)/(d+1))𝑂superscript𝜀𝑑1𝑑1O\left(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/(d+1)}\right)italic_O ( italic_ε start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - ( italic_d - 1 ) / ( italic_d + 1 ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) facets such that Kε⊂P⊂Ksubscript𝐾𝜀𝑃𝐾K_{\varepsilon}\subset P\subset Kitalic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊂ italic_P ⊂ italic_K. Using halfspace querying, this gives a data structure with space and query time of O⁢(ε−(d−1)/(d+1))𝑂superscript𝜀𝑑1𝑑1O\left(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/(d+1)}\right)italic_O ( italic_ε start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - ( italic_d - 1 ) / ( italic_d + 1 ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Motivated by the algorithm of Abdelkader and Mount in [2], we construct a data structure to answer approximate membership queries for relative ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-CFBs with storage space O⁢(ε−(d−1)/2)𝑂superscript𝜀𝑑12O(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2})italic_O ( italic_ε start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - ( italic_d - 1 ) / 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) and query time O⁢(ln⁡1/ε)𝑂1𝜀O(\ln 1/\varepsilon)italic_O ( roman_ln 1 / italic_ε ). We do not cover the question of pre-processing time in this paper. 1.1. Convex floating bodies Given a bounded convex domain K⊂ℝd𝐾superscriptℝ𝑑K\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}italic_K ⊂ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and a parameter ε>0𝜀0\varepsilon>0italic_ε > 0, the ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-convex floating body (ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-CFB) Kεsubscript𝐾𝜀K_{\varepsilon}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT of K𝐾Kitalic_K is the convex set given by the intersection of all the closed halfspaces of ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\mathbb{R}^{d}blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT that cut off a set of volume ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε from K𝐾Kitalic_K. Convex floating bodies have appeared extensively in the literature; see [18, 26] and the references therein. In [9], Bárány and Larman show that if K⁢(n)𝐾𝑛K(n)italic_K ( italic_n ) is the convex hull of n𝑛nitalic_n random points chosen independently according to the uniform distribution on K𝐾Kitalic_K, then 𝔼⁢[vol⁢(K∖K⁢(n))]=Θ⁢(vol⁢(K∖K1/n)).𝔼delimited-[]vol𝐾𝐾𝑛Θvol𝐾subscript𝐾1𝑛\mathbb{E}\left[\text{vol}(K\setminus K(n))\right]=\Theta(\text{vol}(K% \setminus K_{1/n})).blackboard_E [ vol ( italic_K ∖ italic_K ( italic_n ) ) ] = roman_Θ ( vol ( italic_K ∖ italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 / italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ) . Moreover, they show that there is an ε0subscript𝜀0\varepsilon_{0}italic_ε start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT depending on K𝐾Kitalic_K, such that for ε<ε0𝜀subscript𝜀0\varepsilon<\varepsilon_{0}italic_ε < italic_ε start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, Ω⁢(ε⁢(ln⁡1/ε)d−1)≤vol⁢(K∖Kε)≤O⁢(ε2/(d+1)).Ω𝜀superscript1𝜀𝑑1vol𝐾subscript𝐾𝜀𝑂superscript𝜀2𝑑1\Omega\left(\varepsilon\left(\ln 1/\varepsilon\right)^{d-1}\right)\leq\text{% vol}(K\setminus K_{\varepsilon})\leq O(\varepsilon^{2/(d+1)}).roman_Ω ( italic_ε ( roman_ln 1 / italic_ε ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) ≤ vol ( italic_K ∖ italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ≤ italic_O ( italic_ε start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 / ( italic_d + 1 ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) . The upper bound is attained when K𝐾Kitalic_K is smooth, and the lower bound is attained by polytopes. In fact, Schütt and Werner [22] show that there is a constant cd>0subscript𝑐𝑑0c_{d}>0italic_c start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > 0 such that limε→0cd⁢vol⁢(K∖Kε)ε2d+1=as⁢(K),subscript→𝜀0subscript𝑐𝑑vol𝐾subscript𝐾𝜀superscript𝜀2𝑑1as𝐾\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0}c_{d}\frac{\text{vol}(K\setminus K_{\varepsilon% })}{\varepsilon^{\frac{2}{d+1}}}=\text{as}(K),roman_lim start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε → 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT divide start_ARG vol ( italic_K ∖ italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) end_ARG start_ARG italic_ε start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG 2 end_ARG start_ARG italic_d + 1 end_ARG end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG = as ( italic_K ) , where as⁢(K)as𝐾\text{as}(K)as ( italic_K ) is the affine surface area measure of K𝐾Kitalic_K; see [20].

On the other hand, the asymptotic behaviour of the Busemann volume of Hilbert metric balls in K𝐾Kitalic_K is also determined by the total number of complete flags of K𝐾Kitalic_K; see [25] and [13]. This motivates us to compare convex floating bodies with Hilbert metric balls in K𝐾Kitalic_K; see Theorem 1.2 below. 1.2. Connection to Tukey depth and quantiles of distributions Convex floating bodies have also appeared in the study of the shape and statistics of large multi-variate datasets; see [18].

Alternately, this set also coincides with set of points of Tukey depth at least 1−q1𝑞1-q1 - italic_q, and is referred to as a depth-trimmed region or central region of the probability distribution μ𝜇\muitalic_μ. When μ𝜇\muitalic_μ is the uniform measure supported on a bounded convex domain K𝐾Kitalic_K, then Fq⁢(μ)subscript𝐹𝑞𝜇F_{q}(\mu)italic_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_q end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_μ ) coincides with the (1−q)1𝑞(1-q)( 1 - italic_q )-CFB of K𝐾Kitalic_K.

Querying from convex floating bodies Given a bounded convex domain K⊂ℝd𝐾superscriptℝ𝑑K\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}italic_K ⊂ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, a convex subset A⊂K𝐴𝐾A\subset Kitalic_A ⊂ italic_K and δ>0𝛿0\delta>0italic_δ > 0, we define the Hilbert outer parallel body Aδsuperscript𝐴𝛿A^{\delta}italic_A start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_δ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT as the set Aδ={x∈K:dK⁢(x,y)<δ⁢for some ⁢y∈A}.superscript𝐴𝛿conditional-set𝑥𝐾subscript𝑑𝐾𝑥𝑦𝛿for some 𝑦𝐴A^{\delta}=\{x\in K:d_{K}(x,y)<\delta\ \text{for some }y\in A\}.italic_A start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_δ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = { italic_x ∈ italic_K : italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_y ) < italic_δ for some italic_y ∈ italic_A } . Here, dKsubscript𝑑𝐾d_{K}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUBSCRIPT denotes the Hilbert metric on K𝐾Kitalic_K; see Section 1.4 for the definition. Let JKsubscript𝐽𝐾J_{K}italic_J start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUBSCRIPT denote the inner John ellipsoid of K.𝐾K.italic_K . Set v⁢(K)=vol⁢(JK)𝑣𝐾volsubscript𝐽𝐾v(K)=\text{vol}(J_{K})italic_v ( italic_K ) = vol ( italic_J start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). Let ε∈(0,vol⁢(K)/2)𝜀0vol𝐾2\varepsilon\in(0,\text{vol}(K)/2)italic_ε ∈ ( 0 , vol ( italic_K ) / 2 ) be sufficiently small such that Kε≠∅.subscript𝐾𝜀K_{\varepsilon}\neq\emptyset.italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≠ ∅ . Let δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\delta\in(0,1)italic_δ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) be fixed. Given a query point a∈ℝd𝑎superscriptℝ𝑑a\in\mathbb{R}^{d}italic_a ∈ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, define the δ𝛿\deltaitalic_δ-approximate membership query for the relative ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-convex floating body (δ𝛿\deltaitalic_δ-AMQ for the relative ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-CFB) as a query that yields a positive result if a∈Kε⁢v⁢(K),𝑎subscript𝐾𝜀𝑣𝐾a\in K_{\varepsilon v(K)},italic_a ∈ italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε italic_v ( italic_K ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , a negative result if a∉(Kε⁢v⁢(K))δ,𝑎superscriptsubscript𝐾𝜀𝑣𝐾𝛿a\notin\left(K_{\varepsilon v(K)}\right)^{\delta},italic_a ∉ ( italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε italic_v ( italic_K ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_δ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , and either result, otherwise. In particular, answering the δ𝛿\deltaitalic_δ-AMQ for the relative ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-CFB also answers the (coarser) query problem which gives a “yes” when a∈Kε⁢v⁢(K)𝑎subscript𝐾𝜀𝑣𝐾a\in K_{\varepsilon v(K)}italic_a ∈ italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε italic_v ( italic_K ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, a “no” when a∉K𝑎𝐾a\notin Kitalic_a ∉ italic_K, and either result, otherwise. The latter is referred to as the AMQ for the relative ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-CFB. Theorem 1.1. Given a bounded convex domain K⊂ℝd𝐾superscriptℝ𝑑K\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}italic_K ⊂ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\delta\in(0,1)italic_δ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ), and an ε>0𝜀0\varepsilon>0italic_ε > 0 sufficiently small such that Kε≠∅,subscript𝐾𝜀K_{\varepsilon}\neq\emptyset,italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≠ ∅ , there exists a data structure of space O⁢(δ−d⁢ε−(d−1)/2)𝑂superscript𝛿𝑑superscript𝜀𝑑12O(\delta^{-d}\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2})italic_O ( italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ε start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - ( italic_d - 1 ) / 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) that answers the δ𝛿\deltaitalic_δ-AMQ for the relative ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-CFB in O⁢(δ−1⁢ln⁡1/ε)𝑂superscript𝛿11𝜀O({\delta^{-1}}\ln 1/\varepsilon)italic_O ( italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_ln 1 / italic_ε ) time. In particular, there exists a data structure of space O⁢(ε−(d−1)/2)𝑂superscript𝜀𝑑12O(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2})italic_O ( italic_ε start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - ( italic_d - 1 ) / 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) and query time O⁢(ln⁡1/ε)𝑂1𝜀O(\ln 1/\varepsilon)italic_O ( roman_ln 1 / italic_ε ) for answering the AMQ for the relative ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-CFB. The constant factors in the space and query time depend only on d𝑑ditalic_d (not on K𝐾Kitalic_K, ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε, or δ𝛿\deltaitalic_δ). This result is entirely motivated by the work of Abdelkader and Mount in [2], where they consider the ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-approximate polytope membership (ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-APM) query which yields “yes” when the query point is in K⁢[δ]={x∈K:dist⁢(x,b⁢K)>δ⁢diam⁢(K)}𝐾delimited-[]𝛿conditional-set𝑥𝐾dist𝑥𝑏𝐾𝛿diam𝐾K[\delta]=\left\{x\in K:{\text{dist}(x,bK)}>\delta\,\text{diam}(K)\right\}italic_K [ italic_δ ] = { italic_x ∈ italic_K : dist ( italic_x , italic_b italic_K ) > italic_δ diam ( italic_K ) }, “no” when it is outside K𝐾Kitalic_K, and may give either response otherwise. We compare our query problem to theirs in Section 1.5. 1.4. Convex floating bodies and the Hilbert metric The proof of Theorem 1.1 relies on a comparison between the Hilbert metric balls and the convex floating bodies of K𝐾Kitalic_K. The former are invariant under affine maps, whereas the latter satisfy a transformation rule under affine maps; see Lemma 2.1. We state this result separately, as it may be of independent interest. Theorem 1.2. Let K⊂ℝd𝐾superscriptℝ𝑑K\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}italic_K ⊂ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT be a bounded convex domain, and x∈K𝑥𝐾x\in Kitalic_x ∈ italic_K. Suppose that 𝔹⁢(x,r)⊂K⊂𝔹⁢(x,R)𝔹𝑥𝑟𝐾𝔹𝑥𝑅\mathbb{B}(x,r)\subset K\subset\mathbb{B}(x,R)blackboard_B ( italic_x , italic_r ) ⊂ italic_K ⊂ blackboard_B ( italic_x , italic_R ) for some 0<r≤R.0𝑟𝑅0<r\leq R.0 < italic_r ≤ italic_R . Let ε∈(0,vol⁢(K)/2)𝜀0volK2\varepsilon\in(0,{\text{vol}}(K)/2)italic_ε ∈ ( 0 , vol ( roman_K ) / 2 ) be sufficiently small such that Kε≠∅.subscript𝐾𝜀K_{\varepsilon}\neq\emptyset.italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≠ ∅ . Then, the following holds.

(i⁢i)𝑖𝑖(ii)( italic_i italic_i ) There exists a constant ν𝜈\nuitalic_ν, depending only on r,R𝑟𝑅r,Ritalic_r , italic_R and d,𝑑d,italic_d , and a point xε∈Kεsubscript𝑥𝜀subscript𝐾𝜀x_{\varepsilon}\in K_{\varepsilon}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT such that, Kε⊂BK⁢(xε,12⁢ln⁡1ε+ν).subscript𝐾𝜀subscript𝐵𝐾subscript𝑥𝜀121𝜀𝜈K_{\varepsilon}\subset B_{K}\left(x_{\varepsilon},\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{1}{% \varepsilon}+\nu\right).italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊂ italic_B start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG roman_ln divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_ε end_ARG + italic_ν ) . (1.2) Note that since 𝔹⁢(x,r)⊂K𝔹𝑥𝑟𝐾\mathbb{B}(x,r)\subset Kblackboard_B ( italic_x , italic_r ) ⊂ italic_K in the hypothesis above, every hyperplane through x𝑥xitalic_x necessarily cuts off a cap of volume at least rd⁢ωd/2superscript𝑟𝑑subscript𝜔𝑑2r^{d}\omega_{d}/2italic_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / 2 from K𝐾Kitalic_K. Thus, (1.1) always holds if 0<ε<rd⁢ωd/20𝜀superscript𝑟𝑑subscript𝜔𝑑20<\varepsilon<r^{d}\omega_{d}/20 < italic_ε < italic_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / 2. We comment on the sharpness of (1.1) in Section 1.5. 1.5. Some remarks We gather some remarks on Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 here. (1)1(1)( 1 ) The constant v⁢(K)𝑣𝐾v(K)italic_v ( italic_K ) in our query problem plays the same role as diam⁢(K)diam𝐾\text{diam}(K)diam ( italic_K ) in ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-APM queries. (2)2(2)( 2 ) By Lemma 4.1, we may assume that K𝐾Kitalic_K is in canonical form. Then, by (3.4) and (2.3), Kε⊂K⁢[(3/2⁢d3)⁢ε]subscript𝐾𝜀𝐾delimited-[]32superscript𝑑3𝜀K_{\varepsilon}\subset K[(\sqrt{3}/2d^{3})\varepsilon]italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊂ italic_K [ ( square-root start_ARG 3 end_ARG / 2 italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) italic_ε ]. Thus, the data structure constructed in [2] answers the AMQ for the ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-CFB of K𝐾Kitalic_K, and has the same storage space and query time as the one given by Theorem 1.1. However, the Hilbert distance between Kεsubscript𝐾𝜀K_{\varepsilon}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the smallest K⁢[σ]𝐾delimited-[]𝜎K[\sigma]italic_K [ italic_σ ] containing Kεsubscript𝐾𝜀K_{\varepsilon}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is positive, in general. Thus, for every ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε for which o∈int⁢Kε𝑜intsubscript𝐾𝜀o\in\text{int}\,K_{\varepsilon}italic_o ∈ int italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, there is some δ>0𝛿0\delta>0italic_δ > 0 for which the data structure constructed in [2] does not answer the δ𝛿\deltaitalic_δ-AMQ for the relative ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-CFB for all convex bodies. (3)3(3)( 3 ) Let K𝐾Kitalic_K be the unit Euclidean ball in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\mathbb{R}^{d}blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. The data structure for answering the ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-APM query constructed in [2] has size Θ⁢(volK⁢BK⁢(o,12⁢ln⁡1ε))=Θ⁢(ε−(d−1)/2)Θsubscriptvol𝐾subscript𝐵𝐾𝑜121𝜀Θsuperscript𝜀𝑑12\Theta\left(\text{vol}_{K}B_{K}\left(o,\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}% \right)\right)=\Theta(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2})roman_Θ ( vol start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_B start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_o , divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG roman_ln divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_ε end_ARG ) ) = roman_Θ ( italic_ε start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - ( italic_d - 1 ) / 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Note that Kε=K⁢[cd⁢ε2/(d+1)]subscript𝐾𝜀𝐾delimited-[]subscript𝑐𝑑superscript𝜀2𝑑1K_{\varepsilon}=K\left[c_{d}\varepsilon^{2/(d+1)}\right]italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_K [ italic_c start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 / ( italic_d + 1 ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ], for some cd>0subscript𝑐𝑑0c_{d}>0italic_c start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > 0. Thus, in this case, the AMQ for the relative ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε-CFB coincides (up to a constant factor) with the (ε2/(d+1)superscript𝜀2𝑑1\varepsilon^{2/(d+1)}italic_ε start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 / ( italic_d + 1 ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT)-APM query. Moreover, our data structure coincides with the one constructed in [2]. Therefore, it has size Θ(ε−(d−1)/(d+1)\Theta(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/(d+1)}roman_Θ ( italic_ε start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - ( italic_d - 1 ) / ( italic_d + 1 ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT). In fact, we do not have any example of a convex domain K𝐾Kitalic_K where the data structure given by Theorem 1.1 must be of size Ω⁢(ε−(d−1)/2)Ωsuperscript𝜀𝑑12\Omega(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2})roman_Ω ( italic_ε start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - ( italic_d - 1 ) / 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and we suspect that our upper bound is not sharp. (4)4(4)( 4 ) Let 𝒫msubscript𝒫𝑚\mathcal{P}_{m}caligraphic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT denote the class of polytopes in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\mathbb{R}^{d}blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT whose total number of complete flags is bounded above by a fixed number m𝑚mitalic_m. Then, if K∈𝒫m𝐾subscript𝒫𝑚K\in\mathcal{P}_{m}italic_K ∈ caligraphic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is in canonical form, volK⁢BK⁢(o,R)=O⁢(Rd)subscriptvol𝐾subscript𝐵𝐾𝑜𝑅𝑂superscript𝑅𝑑\text{vol}_{K}B_{K}(o,R)=O(R^{d})vol start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_B start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_o , italic_R ) = italic_O ( italic_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) for all R>0𝑅0R>0italic_R > 0, where the constants only depend on m𝑚mitalic_m and d𝑑ditalic_d; see [25, Theorem 19191919]. By the proof of Theorem 1.2 (i⁢i)𝑖𝑖(ii)( italic_i italic_i ), there is an εd>0subscript𝜀𝑑0\varepsilon_{d}>0italic_ε start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > 0 such that xεsubscript𝑥𝜀x_{\varepsilon}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in Lemma 4.2 can be chosen to be o𝑜oitalic_o for all ε<εd𝜀subscript𝜀𝑑\varepsilon<\varepsilon_{d}italic_ε < italic_ε start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Thus, the data structure given by Theorem 1.1 has storage size at most cm,d⁢(ln⁡1/ε)dsubscript𝑐𝑚𝑑superscript1𝜀𝑑c_{m,d}(\ln 1/\varepsilon)^{d}italic_c start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m , italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( roman_ln 1 / italic_ε ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT for all ε<εd𝜀subscript𝜀𝑑\varepsilon<\varepsilon_{d}italic_ε < italic_ε start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and some cm,d>0subscript𝑐𝑚𝑑0c_{m,d}>0italic_c start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m , italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > 0, depending only on m𝑚mitalic_m and d𝑑ditalic_d. (5)5(5)( 5 ) Owing to the relationship between Hilbert metric balls and dilates of K𝐾Kitalic_K (see Lemma 2.2), Theorem 1.2 (i)𝑖(i)( italic_i ) reduces to a relationship between Kεsubscript𝐾𝜀K_{\varepsilon}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and appropriate dilates of K𝐾Kitalic_K. This is obtained in (3.7) in the special case where x=o𝑥𝑜x=oitalic_x = italic_o, r=γ∈(0,1/2]𝑟𝛾012r=\gamma\in(0,1/2]italic_r = italic_γ ∈ ( 0 , 1 / 2 ], and R=1/2𝑅12R=1/2italic_R = 1 / 2. The containments in (3.7) (and, therefore, in (1.1)) are sharp in the order of ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε. For instance, consider the d𝑑ditalic_d-dimensional cube K=(−12,12)d𝐾superscript1212𝑑K=\left(-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)^{d}italic_K = ( - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG , divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. Since K𝐾Kitalic_K is centrally-symmetric, its convex floating bodies coincide with its (Dupin) floating bodies; see [17]. Thus, for ε∈(0,1/2)𝜀012\varepsilon\in(0,1/2)italic_ε ∈ ( 0 , 1 / 2 ), the centroid of the base of every cap of volume ε𝜀\varepsilonitalic_ε is an element of b⁢Kε𝑏subscript𝐾𝜀bK_{\varepsilon}italic_b italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ε end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.

This theory unifies two established theories: for p=∞,𝑝p=\infty,italic_p = ∞ , this is the classical theory of Vietoris-Rips complexes, and for p=1,𝑝1p=1,italic_p = 1 , this corresponds to the blurred magnitude homology theory. We prove several results that are known for the Vietoris-Rips complex in the general case: (1) we prove a stability theorem for the corresponding version of the persistent homology; (2) we show that, for a compact Riemannian manifold and a sufficiently small scale parameter, all the “ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\ell_{p}roman_ℓ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-Vietoris-Rips spaces” are homotopy equivalent to the manifold; (3) we demonstrate that the ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\ell_{p}roman_ℓ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-Vietoris-Rips spaces are invariant (up to homotopy) under taking the metric completion.

Carlsson-Carlsson-De Silva applied the Vietoris-Rips complex in topological data analysis [3], and Chazal with his coauthors proved the stability theorem for the Vietoris-Rips complex [5] (see also [4]). The magnitude function of a compact metric space was introduced by Leinster [24]. It was treated as an analog of the Euler characteristic of a topological space. The corresponding (co)homology theory was developed by Hepworth and Willerton for the case of graphs [17], and extended to all metric spaces by Leinster, Shulman [25] and Hepworth [16] under the name of magnitude (co)homology theory. Otter introduced a persistent version of the magnitude homology under the name of blurred magnitude homology [28]. She proved that the homology groups of the Vietoris-Rips complex and the blurred magnitude homology have the same limit, as the scale parameter tends to zero. Govc and Hepworth [12] showed that the magnitude function of a finite metric space can be also recovered from the blurred magnitude homology. In an unpublished preprint [6], Cho used the language of enriched categories over quantales to develop a theory that includes the Vietoris-Rips complex and the blurred homology theory as special cases. For each 1≤p≤∞,1𝑝1\leq p\leq\infty,1 ≤ italic_p ≤ ∞ , a metric space X𝑋Xitalic_X and a real number r>0,𝑟0r>0,italic_r > 0 , he defines a simplicial set which we call the ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\ell_{p}roman_ℓ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-Vietoris-Rips simplicial set. For p=∞,𝑝p=\infty,italic_p = ∞ , the geometric realization of the simplicial set is homotopy equivalent to the geometric realization of the classical Vietoris-Rips complex, and for p=1,𝑝1p=1,italic_p = 1 , its homology is the blurred magnitude homology. We provide an alternative definition of the ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\ell_{p}roman_ℓ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-Vietoris-Rips simplicial sets in terms of the ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\ell_{p}roman_ℓ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-weight of a tuple of points in a metric space. Our definition is shown to be equivalent to the definition of Cho (Proposition 2.6). Since simplicial complexes are more convenient for data analysis, we also define ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\ell_{p}roman_ℓ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-Vietoris-Rips complexes in terms of ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\ell_{p}roman_ℓ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-weights of finite subsets. We develop a theory that works in both of these two settings — the setting of simplicial sets and the setting of simplicial complexes. In particular, we prove the stability theorem, the result about Riemannian manifolds, the result about metric completions, the result about limit homology and commutativity with filtered colimits for both of these two settings. More precisely, we introduce a general framework that includes both of these two settings and prove the results in this general framework. The general framework is based on a general concept we introduce called a distance matrix norm. Roughly speaking, a distance matrix norm ν𝜈\nuitalic_ν is a norm defined on the “space” of all distance matrices of all tuples. A distance matrix norm ν𝜈\nuitalic_ν defines a ν𝜈\nuitalic_ν-weight of a tuple of points in a metric space, which is used to define the ν𝜈\nuitalic_ν-Vietoris-Rips simplicial set. We show that the theory of both ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\ell_{p}roman_ℓ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-Vietoris-Rips simplicial sets and ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\ell_{p}roman_ℓ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-Vietoris-Rips complexes can be reduced to the theory of ν𝜈\nuitalic_ν-Vietoris-Rips simplicial sets for appropriate distance matrix norms ν𝜈\nuitalic_ν, and prove all relevant statements in the general context of any distance matrix norm. 1.1.

In order to unify the cases of simplicial sets and simplicial complexes, we define a general notion of distance matrix norm.

We generalize this theorem by showing that the geometric realization of 𝒱⁢ℛ<rν⁢M𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈absent𝑟𝑀\mathscr{VR}^{\nu}_{<r}Mscript_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_M is homotopy equivalent to M𝑀Mitalic_M for a sufficiently small r>0𝑟0r>0italic_r > 0 and any ν.𝜈\nu.italic_ν . In particular, we obtain that the blurred magnitude homology of M𝑀Mitalic_M is isomorphic to the ordinary homology of M𝑀Mitalic_M for a sufficiently small r.𝑟r.italic_r . Moreover, we prove a more general version of this theorem for geodesic spaces (Theorem 7.1). For any 1≤p≤∞,1𝑝1\leq p\leq\infty,1 ≤ italic_p ≤ ∞ , we define rp⁢(M)subscript𝑟𝑝𝑀r_{p}(M)italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_M ) as the infimum of r>0𝑟0r>0italic_r > 0 such that the geometric realization of 𝒱⁢ℛ<rp⁢M𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑝absent𝑟𝑀\mathscr{VR}^{p}_{<r}Mscript_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_M is not homotopy equivalent to M.𝑀M.italic_M . We compute this number for the circle of perimeter one S1superscript𝑆1S^{1}italic_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT: (1.10) rp⁢(S1)=21p2+21p.subscript𝑟𝑝superscript𝑆1superscript21𝑝2superscript21𝑝r_{p}(S^{1})=\frac{2^{\frac{1}{p}}}{2+2^{\frac{1}{p}}}.italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) = divide start_ARG 2 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_p end_ARG end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 + 2 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_p end_ARG end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG . In particular, we obtain r∞⁢(S1)=13,subscript𝑟superscript𝑆113r_{\infty}(S^{1})=\frac{1}{3},italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∞ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) = divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 3 end_ARG , which coincides with the result of Adamaszek and Adams [1]. 1.4. Metric completions and shortly contractible spaces We prove a general theorem (Theorem 5.4) which states that under certain conditions an embedding of metric spaces A↪X↪𝐴𝑋A\hookrightarrow Xitalic_A ↪ italic_X induces a weak equivalence of simplicial sets (1.11) 𝒱⁢ℛ<rν⁢A⁢⟶∼⁢𝒱⁢ℛ<rν⁢X𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈absent𝑟𝐴similar-to⟶𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈absent𝑟𝑋\mathscr{VR}^{\nu}_{<r}A\overset{\sim}{\longrightarrow}\mathscr{VR}^{\nu}_{<r}Xscript_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_A over∼ start_ARG ⟶ end_ARG script_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X for any distance matrix norm ν𝜈\nuitalic_ν and any r>0.𝑟0r>0.italic_r > 0 . As a corollary we show that the homotopy type of the strict ν𝜈\nuitalic_ν-Vietoris-Rips simplicial set does not change after taking the metric completion: (1.12) |𝒱⁢ℛ<rν⁢X|≃|𝒱⁢ℛ<rν⁢X^|.similar-to-or-equals𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈absent𝑟𝑋𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈absent𝑟^𝑋|\mathscr{VR}^{\nu}_{<r}X|\simeq|\mathscr{VR}^{\nu}_{<r}\hat{X}|.| script_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X | ≃ | script_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT over^ start_ARG italic_X end_ARG | . In particular, we obtain 𝖬𝖧n,<r⁢(X)≅𝖬𝖧n,<r⁢(X^).subscript𝖬𝖧𝑛absent𝑟𝑋subscript𝖬𝖧𝑛absent𝑟^𝑋\mathsf{MH}_{n,<r}(X)\cong\mathsf{MH}_{n,<r}(\hat{X}).sansserif_MH start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n , < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_X ) ≅ sansserif_MH start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n , < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( over^ start_ARG italic_X end_ARG ) . We say that a metric space X𝑋Xitalic_X is shortly contractible if there exists a contracting homotopy to the point h:X×[0,c]→X,:ℎ→𝑋0𝑐𝑋h:X\times[0,c]\to X,italic_h : italic_X × [ 0 , italic_c ] → italic_X , which is a short map (Definition 5.9). For example, bounded convex subsets, bounded star domains and the semicircle are shortly contractible. As a corollary of the general theorem, we obtain that for a shortly contractible metric space X𝑋Xitalic_X the simplicial set 𝒱⁢ℛ<rν⁢X𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈absent𝑟𝑋\mathscr{VR}^{\nu}_{<r}Xscript_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X is weakly contractible. In particular, we have 𝖬𝖧n,<r⁢(X)=0subscript𝖬𝖧𝑛absent𝑟𝑋0\mathsf{MH}_{n,<r}(X)=0sansserif_MH start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n , < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_X ) = 0 for n≥1.𝑛1n\geq 1.italic_n ≥ 1 . Note that these results hold only for the strict versions of the simplicial sets 𝒱⁢ℛ<rν⁢X𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈absent𝑟𝑋\mathscr{VR}^{\nu}_{<r}Xscript_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X and do not hold for the non-strict versions 𝒱⁢ℛ≤rν⁢X.𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈absent𝑟𝑋\mathscr{VR}^{\nu}_{\leq r}X.script_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≤ italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X . There is an example of a metric space X𝑋Xitalic_X such that 𝖬𝖧1,≤r⁢(X)≇𝖬𝖧1,≤r⁢(X^)subscript𝖬𝖧1absent𝑟𝑋subscript𝖬𝖧1absent𝑟^𝑋\mathsf{MH}_{1,\leq r}(X)\not\cong\mathsf{MH}_{1,\leq r}(\hat{X})sansserif_MH start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 , ≤ italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_X ) ≇ sansserif_MH start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 , ≤ italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( over^ start_ARG italic_X end_ARG ) (Remark 5.8), and there is also an example of a shortly contractible metric space X𝑋Xitalic_X such that 𝖬𝖧1,≤r⁢(X)≠0subscript𝖬𝖧1absent𝑟𝑋0\mathsf{MH}_{1,\leq r}(X)\neq 0sansserif_MH start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 , ≤ italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_X ) ≠ 0 (Remark 5.15). 1.5. Pro-simplicial sets and limit homology Despite the fact that for different distance matrix norms ν𝜈\nuitalic_ν the simplicial sets 𝒱⁢ℛ<rν⁢X𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈absent𝑟𝑋\mathscr{VR}^{\nu}_{<r}Xscript_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X are usually different, all of them are similar for small r.𝑟r.italic_r . This observation can be formalized in terms of pro-simplicial sets, which can be understood as “formal cofiltered limits” of simplicial sets. We denote by 𝒱⁢ℛ<rν,n⁢X𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈𝑛absent𝑟𝑋\mathscr{VR}^{\nu,n}_{<r}Xscript_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν , italic_n end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X the n𝑛nitalic_n-skeleton of the ν𝜈\nuitalic_ν-Vietoris-Rips simplicial set. Then the functor (0,∞)→𝗌𝖲𝖾𝗍→0𝗌𝖲𝖾𝗍(0,\infty)\to{\sf sSet}( 0 , ∞ ) → sansserif_sSet sending r𝑟ritalic_r to 𝒱⁢ℛ<rν,n⁢X𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈𝑛absent𝑟𝑋\mathscr{VR}^{\nu,n}_{<r}Xscript_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν , italic_n end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X defines a pro-simplicial set that we denote by 𝒱⁢ℛ𝗉𝗋𝗈ν,n⁢X.𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈𝑛𝗉𝗋𝗈𝑋\mathscr{VR}^{\nu,n}_{\sf pro}X.script_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν , italic_n end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT sansserif_pro end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X . We prove that this pro-simplicial set does not depend on ν𝜈\nuitalic_ν (1.13) 𝒱⁢ℛ𝗉𝗋𝗈ν,n⁢X≅𝒱⁢ℛ𝗉𝗋𝗈∞,n⁢X.𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈𝑛𝗉𝗋𝗈𝑋𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑛𝗉𝗋𝗈𝑋\mathscr{VR}^{\nu,n}_{\sf pro}X\cong\mathscr{VR}^{\infty,n}_{\sf pro}X.script_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν , italic_n end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT sansserif_pro end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X ≅ script_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∞ , italic_n end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT sansserif_pro end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X . In particular, we obtain that the limits of homology groups coincide (1.14) limr→0Hn⁢(𝒱⁢ℛ<rν⁢X)≅limr→0Hn⁢(VR<r⁢X).subscript→𝑟0subscript𝐻𝑛𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈absent𝑟𝑋subscript→𝑟0subscript𝐻𝑛subscriptVRabsent𝑟𝑋\lim_{r\to 0}H_{n}(\mathscr{VR}^{\nu}_{<r}X)\cong\lim_{r\to 0}H_{n}(\scalebox{% 0.8}[1.0]{\tt VR}_{<r}X).roman_lim start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_r → 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( script_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X ) ≅ roman_lim start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_r → 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( VR start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X ) . 1.6. Filtered colimits of metric spaces A disadvantage of the ordinary magnitude homology is that it does not commute with filtered colimits of metric spaces and short maps. However, we show that the strict versions of the ν𝜈\nuitalic_ν-Vietoris-Rips simplicial sets 𝒱⁢ℛ<rν⁢X𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈absent𝑟𝑋\mathscr{VR}^{\nu}_{<r}Xscript_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X commute with filtered colimits of metric spaces up to homotopy. More precisely, for any filtered category I𝐼Iitalic_I and any I𝐼Iitalic_I-diagram Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in the category of metric spaces and short maps the map (1.15) colim⁡(𝒱⁢ℛ<rν⁢Xi)⁢⟶∼⁢𝒱⁢ℛ<rν⁢(colim⁡Xi)colim𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈absent𝑟subscript𝑋𝑖similar-to⟶𝒱subscriptsuperscriptℛ𝜈absent𝑟colimsubscript𝑋𝑖\operatorname{\mathrm{colim}}(\mathscr{VR}^{\nu}_{<r}X_{i})\overset{\sim}{% \longrightarrow}\mathscr{VR}^{\nu}_{<r}(\operatorname{\mathrm{colim}}X_{i})roman_colim ( script_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) over∼ start_ARG ⟶ end_ARG script_V script_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( roman_colim italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) is a weak equivalence (Theorem 10.3). In particular, the strictly blurred magnitude homology commutes with filtered colimits of metric spaces and short maps (1.16) colim⁡𝖬𝖧n,<r⁢(Xi)≅𝖬𝖧n,<r⁢(colim⁡Xi).colimsubscript𝖬𝖧𝑛absent𝑟subscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝖬𝖧𝑛absent𝑟colimsubscript𝑋𝑖\operatorname{\mathrm{colim}}\mathsf{MH}_{n,<r}(X_{i})\cong\mathsf{MH}_{n,<r}(% \operatorname{\mathrm{colim}}X_{i}).roman_colim sansserif_MH start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n , < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ≅ sansserif_MH start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n , < italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( roman_colim italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) . 1.7.
