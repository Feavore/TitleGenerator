https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10409v1,Design of Dedicated Tilt-to-Length Calibration Maneuvers for LISA,"Tilts of certain elements within a laser interferometer can undesirably couple into measurements as a form of noise, known as Tilt-To-Length (TTL) coupling. This TTL coupling is anticipated to be one of the primary noise sources in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, after Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) is applied. Despite the careful interferometer design and calibration on the ground, TTL is likely to require in-flight mitigation through post-processing subtraction to achieve the necessary sensitivity. Past research has demonstrated TTL subtraction in simulations through the estimation of 24 linear coupling coefficients using a noise minimization approach. This paper investigates an approach based on performing rotation maneuvers for estimating coupling coefficients with low uncertainties. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility and optimal configurations of such maneuvers to identify the most efficient solutions. We assess the efficacy of TTL calibration maneuvers by modulating either the spacecraft (SC) attitude or the Moving Optical Sub-Assembly (MOSA) yaw angle. We found that sinusoidal signals with amplitudes of around 30\text{\,}\mathrm{nrad}\text{/} and frequencies near 43\text{\,}\mathrm{mHz}\text{/} are practical and nearly optimal choices for such modulations. Employing different frequencies generates uncorrelated signals, allowing for multiple maneuvers to be executed simultaneously. Our simulations enable us to estimate the TTL coefficients with precision below 15\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\text{/}\mathrm{rad} (1-\sigma, in free space) after a total maneuver time of 20 minutes. The results are compared to the estimation uncertainties that can be achieved without using maneuvers.","LISA is a space-based Gravitational Wave (GW) detector that will operate within a measurement band ranging from approximately 0.1\text{\,}\mathrm{mHz}\text{/} to 1\text{\,}\mathrm{Hz}\text{/} [1]. The detector is composed of three SC, arranged in an almost equilateral triangle with 2.5 million \mathrm{km}\text{/} arm length, that will trail behind the Earth in a heliocentric orbit. The LISA mission is led by the European Space Agency (ESA) and was recently adopted for an expected launch in the 2030s. Each SC will host two MOSA, each comprising a telescope, an Optical Bench (OB) and a Test Mass (TM). Each MOSA will be pointed towards one of the two remote SC. The MOSA will be designated using the notation shown in Fig. 1, where MOSA ij refers to the assembly on SC i facing SC j. The lengths of the three arms of the LISA constellation will vary with time, unlike ground-based GW detectors. This leads to the interferometric measurements being highly affected by laser frequency noise. To mitigate this noise, the TDI [2] algorithm will be applied to generate TDI output variables, which mimic three virtual equal-arm interferometers. In this study we examine the second generation Michelson X,Y,Z combinations. These variables will be affected by TTL coupling, i.e. they contain error terms which depend on the MOSA tilt angles with respect to (w.r.t.) the incident beam. This TTL should be estimated and subtracted from the measurements in post-processing. In this paper we investigate the possibility of using rotation maneuvers to estimate the TTL coefficients, i.e. the parameters of the TTL model. By injecting a modulation signal into the angles that cause TTL, the signal for the fit is enhanced. This can reduce the uncertainty in the TTL coefficient estimation. This option could be used if TTL is less well separable from other noise terms or GW signals than anticipated. In such a case, the maneuvers could serve as a beneficial backup plan. It may also be decided to perform such maneuvers once within the commissioning phase. TTL maneuvers have already been performed in the LISA Pathfinder (LPF) mission, cf. [3, 4]. A comparable approach has successfully been used in the GRACE Follow-On (GFO) mission and is considered for future geodesy missions as well [wegener_phd, wegener_2020]. Other sources addressing TTL in LISA include [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Wanner et al. [5] provide a comprehensive analytical description of TTL in the individual interferometers of LISA as well as in the TDI Michelson variables. In [6] and [7], it is described how the TTL error can be estimated through noise minimization and subtracted from the TDI variables, utilizing pointing angles measured by Differential Wavefront Sensing (DWS) [11]. George et al. [8] apply a Fisher information matrix analysis to derive lower bounds for the uncertainty with which the TTL coefficients can be estimated and use these to analyze the residual TTL noise after post-processing subtraction. Figure 1: LISA SC constellation, MOSA index notation. Image credit: [6]. In [9], the observability of TTL in the TDI Michelson variables is shown by propagating the TTL contributions through the TDI algorithm. The two options of estimating the TTL coefficients with or without rotation maneuvers are discussed. Periodic maneuvers at frequencies outside the LISA measurement band are considered, in order not to degrade the science measurements. Thus, large amplitudes are required, however, the feasibility of such maneuvers is not discussed. This study is extended in [10] by additionally considering GW signals in the measurements and introducing a separation of TDI variables that allows performing TTL maneuvers without disturbing science operations. The maneuvers discussed in [10] are stochastically generated, instead of periodic stimuli. A quantitative analysis of the estimation error is performed, however, a rather long integration time of 15 hours was assumed. This paper follows a different approach of designing dedicated TTL maneuvers, focussing on sinusoidal stimuli at frequencies within the LISA measurement band. We investigate what angular amplitudes are achievable when implemented via SC or MOSA rotations. A detailed analysis of the estimation uncertainty shows a strong dependency on the maneuver frequency, which can be optimized subsequently. In order to maximize the efficiency, we develop a plan to perform several maneuvers simultaneously. This facilitates very good estimation of the TTL coefficients after an integration time of merely 20 minutes. With simulations we quantify the improvement that such maneuvers provide over the noise minimization approach. The notation and the TTL model are defined in Sec. II. In Sec. III, the simulator settings are specified. The parameter estimation method is briefly described in Sec. IV. Section V on the maneuver design is the main part of this paper. In particular, we discuss the optimal maneuver frequency, and how multiple maneuvers can be performed simultaneously. The simulation results are reported in Sec. VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09673v1,FANSIC: a Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit for the readout of large silicon photomultipliers,"Silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM) have been replacing traditional photomultiplier tubes in most light sensing applications. However, when large detection surface coverage is needed, photomultipliers (PMTs) are still the preferred choice. The main reasons are the sensor thermal noise and the duration of the fast component of its signal, both increasing with the sensor surface. In this work we propose an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), called Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit (FANSIC), for the readout of large SiPMs addressing these limitations. The ASIC has an active summation stage, which allows to divide a large detection surface into smaller ones offering faster response both in single ended and differential outputs. The high input bandwith allows to reach full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) signals or the order of 3–5 ns which limits the impact of internal and external uncorrelated noise. The results of the first implementation of FANSIC, designed in CMOS 65 nm technology, is described in this paper.","FANSIC is a fully analog front-end ASIC with 32 input channels designed to readout and process the signals of large SiPM sensors with single-photon resolution, 1 ns peaking time, and dynamic range in hundreds of photo-electrons. The main features of the chip are reported in Table 1. The chip is a prototype intended to confirm the performance achievable on a standard CMOS 65 nm technology node. The aim is to guarantee a short output signal and low noise levels while being compatible with input capacitance values up to 1 nF. This is a key requirement for many applications that handle signals with GHz rate and duration in the nanosecond range. Moreover, processing the signal of large arrays of sensors (bigger than 6\times 6 mm2) is a common need for many experiments that require covering large surfaces. The application target of FANSIC is in cameras of gamma-ray telescopes, like Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) which detect the Cherenkov light produced by atmospheric showers triggered by interaction of atmospheric nuclei with gamma and cosmic rays. This light is produced in flashes with a typical duration shorter than 5-10 ns and most of this signal light is emitted in wavelengths between 320 nm and 550 nm. IACTs employ cameras with hundreds to several thousands of photo-sensors clustered into pixels and located in their focal plane. Most cameras still adopt photomultipliers (PMTs) because their larger size compared to SiPMs allows to cover square-meter surfaces with less complexity and number of components. Recently, the ETH in Zürich and the University of Geneva have pioneered the adoption of SiPMs in IACTs cameras through the construction and operation of the FACT [1] and SST-1M [2]. The SST-1M camera has 1286 pixels and a linear dimension of about 1 m and is now in operation at the Ondřejov site in Czeck Republic [3]. FANSIC has been designed to be compatible with the requirements of a further evolution to larger dimension cameras with diameters of about 2 m. These Advanced Cameras are intended for the upgrade of the Large-Sized Telescope (LST) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) [4] during the 30 years of operation foreseen for this new generation of gamma-ray observatory [5].

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09474v1,Electrospray Propulsion Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry Diagnostic,"The design and capability of a novel time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry electrospray propulsion diagnostic is presented to investigate secondary species emission from surface impingement of high-velocity, energetic molecular ion plumes. Designed on the basis of traditional Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) principles, this diagnostic provides information on the relative intensity and chemical composition of secondary species given electrospray operational parameters like incident angle, primary ion energy, and target surface composition. The system consists of an externally-wetted tungsten ion source operating with room temperature ionic liquid propellant, a target with a secondary species extraction mesh, and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer featuring an electrostatic deflection gate and a multichannel plate detector. Results show that energetic primary plume impacts with metallic surfaces induce molecular secondary ion emission in both positive and negative polarities. Likely sources of these secondary ions are considered – including hydrocarbon contamination of the target surface and charged fragments of the molecular primary ionic liquid ions. For electrospray propulsion, these secondary species contribute not only to lifetime limiting processes intrinsic to thruster operation like impingement and thus degradation of electrodes and emitters, but also contribute to facility effects corrupting ground-based testing and thruster flight qualification.","Electric space propulsion systems produce thrust via accelerating propellant through a combination of electric and magnetic fields. The appeal of electric propulsion (EP) lies in that propellant exhaust velocity is determined by input power rather than intrinsic chemical bond energy, thus enabling highly fuel-efficient systems for lower spacecraft propellant mass fractions Goebel et al. (2023). Electrospray micropropulsion thrusters are a subset of electric propulsion systems that utilize electrostatic fields to extract and accelerate charged particles from a liquid propellant on a either a sharp emitter tip or capillary meniscus Lozano et al. (2010). When a potential difference on the order of a few kilovolts is applied between the emitter a downstream extractor electrode, a Taylor cone is formed from a combination of surface tension, electric, and hydrodynamic stresses Petro et al. (a); Gallud and Lozano (2022). Ion emission is thus induced through field-emission evaporation, where ions are subsequently accelerated to velocities exceeding 10,000 m/s Petro et al. (a). This process forms polydisperse plumes (\sum_{i=1}q_{i}/m_{i}) that generate thrust on the level of nano to a few millinewtons per emitter Petro et al. (b). Plume composition ranges from pure ion emission Lozano and Martínez-Sánchez to larger multiply-charged droplets Hruby et al. (2004) depending on emitter type and operating modes. A subset of electrospray devices utilize chemically complex molten salt propellants known as room temperature ionic liquids (RTILS), comprised of organic cations and anions. For example, common propellants include 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMI-BF4) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMI-Im) as shown in Fig. 1, where the EMI+ cation is composed of an imidazolium ring with alkyl functional groups. These propellants are attractive for electrospray propulsion devices given that they are nonvolatile and can be operated in either polarity, eliminating the need for an external neutralizer Lozano et al. . The combination of these properties make RTIL electrospray thrusters attractive for missions requiring efficient, compact, and low-mass and power propulsion systems. Such examples include small satellite propulsion Mier-Hicks and Lozano , as well precise spacecraft control like the LISA Pathfinder technology demonstration mission which tested EMI-Im colloid thrusters Ziemer et al. (2010). Figure 1: Structural formulas for common ionic liquid propellants, the cation 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMI+), and anions tetraflouroborate (BF{}_{4}^{-}), and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Im-).

However, complex organic RTILs have vastly different chemical properties compared to inert noble gas electric propulsion propellants like xenon and krypton employed in ion and Hall thrusters Goebel et al. (2023). While noble gas ion-surface interactions have decades of research due their nearly ubiquitous use among EP systems, the surface interactions of complex ions are hypothesized to be much different Kolasinski . For example, they may deposit at low energies or form new fragment product ions at high energies Bendimerad and Petro . Both experiments Krejci et al. (2017) and simulation Petro et al. (b) indicate that particles from the plume impact thruster and spacecraft surfaces like the extractor electrode, resulting in propellant accumulation and eventual device failure Thuppul et al. . However, there is a wide gap in the knowledge of the fundamental physics of these molecular ion-surface collisions at the nanoscale and how they ultimately impact thruster lifetime and performance. Moreover, these systems are tested and validated in ground-based vacuum testing environments where secondary species from plume-surface impacts are known to affect diagnostics Ma et al. ; Uchizono et al. . Thus, it is important to know the chemical composition of secondary species not only for system modeling and lifetime considerations – but for facility effects of electrospray testing. The uncertainty of collision products makes it difficult to predict, correct for, and model these discrepancies. Both numerical simulations and experimental investigations have been conducted to characterize electrospray plume-surface interactions. Molecular dynamics (MD) studies have been performed both with non-reactive Takahashi and Lozano (2009); Cidoncha et al. (2022) and reactive force fields Bendimerad and Petro with EMI-BF4 impacting various target surfaces. Bendimerad, et al. Bendimerad and Petro produced pseudo-mass spectra of EMI-BF4 impacting a potential wall with a reactive force field showing the relation between relative intensity of fragmentation products and impact energy. Experimental efforts from Uchizono et al. Uchizono et al. (2022); Uchizono and Wirz (2022) and Klosterman et al. Klosterman et al. (2022) have quantified secondary species yields and Uchizono et al. has examined the role of secondary species on experimental testing. Shaik et al. Shaik et al. employed a residual gas analyzer (RGA) to identify secondary species from an electrospray thruster plume impinging on stainless steel. However, both MD and experimental efforts lack in determining the chemical composition of charged secondary species that arise from plume-surface interactions across the permutation of thruster operation variables (target surface composition, primary beam energy and current, background pressure). Figure 2: Simplified kinetically-assisted potential sputtering of a metallic target with a representative adsorbed monolayer (oxides, hydrocarbons, etc). Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) is a standard surface composition characterization technique, commonly used either in static mode to non-destructively characterize the outermost monolayer of a sample, or in dynamic mode to probe depth-based composition Van der Heide . The general premise is to fire a high energy ion beam (1-100 keV) at an incidence angle upon the surface of interest. This induces sputtering, where a fraction of sputtered species exist as low energy ions Van der Heide . To form the secondary ion beam, these sputtered secondary ions are extracted and accelerated down a time-of-flight tube to a detector, where a mass spectrum of secondary ions is generated based on conservation of energy principles Lozano and Martínez-Sánchez . The resulting spectrum gives insight into the atomic and molecular features of the sample of interest. Canonically, SIMS is employed with high energy large atomic primary ion beams [Cs+, Ga+, etc], and sputtering is most generally modeled via purely kinetic momentum transfer from isotropic collision cascades Van der Heide . The energy of the sputtered population is generally modeled as Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions with peak energies below 10 eV and tails extending to a few hundred eV Van der Heide . Alternatively, current research shows that small molecular primary ion beams (Bi{}_{n}^{+}, SF{}_{5}^{+}, In{}_{n}^{+}, etc) induce kinetically-assisted sputtering as shown in Fig. 2 Van Ham et al. ; Fuoco et al. ; Townes et al. . This type of sputtering removes surface atoms, molecules, or ions from overlapping collisions from a singular initial collision event that induces thermal evaporation of substrate atoms and ions Van der Heide . This method has not only proven increased sputter yields but also the ability to detect intact large organic molecules from the target surface Gillen and Roberson . The difference between a traditional TOF-SIMS primary ion beam and an electrospray beam lies in both the complex organic molecular composition of RTIL electrospray plumes and the typical experimental vacuum environments. These complex plumes give rise to multiple processes like deposition and fragmentation both in the plume and upon impact Petro et al. (b); Bendimerad and Petro . However, work by Fujiwara, et al Fujiwara and Saito has proven that ionic liquids (EMI-Im) can be effective as TOF-SIMS primary ion beams. In addition, commercial TOF-SIMS are ultra-high vacuum systems (< 10-9 Torr) in order to mitigate background gas adsorbing onto the target surface and interfering with the signal Van der Heide . Electrospray systems are tested in a range of vacuum environments, with some facility pressures orders of magnitude higher than that of commercial TOF-SIMS. This implies that in nominal test environments, an electrospray plume is impacting not only bare surfaces but also those coated with a monolayer of adsorbed background gas contaminants and oxide/hydrocarbon layers Klosterman et al. (2022), thus further convoluting device performance and diagnostic evaluation. Electrospray plumes impact surfaces at high energies ( > 1 keV) and thus induce sputtering, with some portion of the sputtered population composed of secondary ions. These secondary ions will interact with the electrostatic fields in thruster operation and testing, and thus it is important to characterize their chemical composition. To accomplish this, a novel ESI TOF-SIMS diagnostic has been developed to characterize plume-surface interactions of electrospray systems. This diagnostic will inform the relevant impact secondary ion products from given electrospray operating conditions – including impact energy, propellant choice and target surface composition. The design of the experimental diagnostic is detailed in Section II, with secondary ion mass spectra of both polarities from an ionic liquid primary beam impacting metallic samples presented and discussed in Section III. Finally, conclusions and future work is detailed in Section IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09384v1,Radon emanation rate measurements using liquid scintillation counting,"This article describes a radon emanation measurement technique using liquid scintillator counting. A model for radon loading and transport is described, along with its calibration. Detector background and blank have been studied and quantified. The Minimal detectable activity has been determined for the counting setup using a toy Monte Carlo simulation. The measurement technique is validated using a butyl rubber sample previously used for cross-calibration between different radon counting facilities.","Radon and its progeny are important sources of background events in low-energy rare-event-searches, such as experiments studying solar neutrinos, double beta decay, and dark matter. Being a noble gas with a mean lifetime of \rm\tau_{Rn}=5.5143\;d, 222Rn can travel relatively large distances before decaying into chemically more active, immobile nuclides. Even within large detectors, radon can diffuse from external components toward the sensitive region, particularly through gas-filled voids in the shielding. It can diffuse through membranes [1, 2, 3] and constantly emanates in trace amounts from uranium-containing detector components. Radon released from materials is driven by nuclear recoil and diffusion. Radon emanation from these components contributes to the overall background rate in low background experiments and must be accounted for in modeling. Different techniques are being used for the measurement of radon at low concentrations, typically by detecting its \alpha-decay or the various other decay modes of its progeny [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Here, we describe a liquid scintillator-based detector setup using time-correlated decays of the radon progeny 214Bi and 214Po. This approach utilizes the good solubility of radon in aromatic and long-chain aliphatic organic materials, as found in liquid scintillator. The approach is simple and cost-effective. The setup, and methods similar to what is described here, have been used during the preparation of the LZ dark matter search, with results reported in reference [10]. This paper gives a detailed account of the technical and data analysis approach and improvements made to it."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09358v1,Microlens-enhanced SiPMs,"A novel concept to enhance the photo-detection efficiency (PDE) of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) has been applied and remarkable positive results can be reported. This concept uses arrays of microlenses to cover every second SiPM pixel in a checkerboard arrangement and aims to deflect the light from the dead region of the pixelised structure towards the active region in the center of the pixel. The PDE is improved up to 24%, external cross-talk is reduced by 40% compared to a flat epoxy layer, and single photon time resolution is improved. This detector development is conducted in the context of the next generation LHCb scintillating fibre tracker located in a high radiation environment with a total of 700’000 detector channels. The simulation and measurement results are in good agreement and will be discussed in this work.","In the context of the scintillating fibre tracker (SciFi Tracker) [1], our group, the High Energy Physics Laboratory (LPHE) at EPFL, is working to improve the silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) photodetectors in order to overcome the challenges imposed by radiation, detector size, and the low material budget requirement for the next upgrade in 2034. The ultimate goal for this development is to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We found that the enhancement of the SiPM with microlenses not only significantly increases the signal but also reduces external cross-talk and has the potential to reduce noise. The choice of the ideal SiPM pixel size for a custom design is typically guided by the compromise between high geometrical fill factor (GFF) and the resulting high photo-detection efficiency (PDE) for large pixels and the manifold disadvantages resulting from higher gain and therefore higher correlated noise, longer recovery time, lower dynamic range, larger bias current. Adding the radiation environment as an additional criterion, small pixel size and low excess bias voltage (over-voltage, \Delta V) are also favoured in order to limit the effect of increasing dark count rate (DCR) and correlated noise. As a summary, small pixel size and low \Delta V are advantageous in all aspects except for PDE. The hit detection efficiency of the scintillating fibre tracker technology depends on the actual signal (scintillating light) produced and the PDE of the photodetector. At a given fibre technology and fibre length, stacking several layers of fibres is used to increase the signal for a traversing particle. This comes at the cost of higher material budget, large signal spread for incident particles with large angle and last but not least, higher cost for more scintillating fibres. The implementation of microlens arrays (MLAs) aligned with the pixel structure has been successfully tested and the results are presented in the following."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08940v1,X-ray measurements of gas distribution in a zero gap alkaline water electrolyzer,"X-ray radioscopy was used to measure the 2D projected dynamic void fraction in a zero/narrow gap alkaline water electrolyzer at a spatial resolution of 15 \mum, for narrow gap sizes up to 300 \mum and current densities up to 0.54 A/cm2. As expected, the void fraction in the bulk was found to increase along the cell height and with increasing current density. The void fraction measured in the gap region (the space between the diaphragm and the electrode and its holes) was always larger than in the bulk. It hardly depended on the gap size at current densities below 0.3 A/cm2. The lowest cell potential was measured for zero gap. No evidence of isolating gas pockets/films in the gaps was found. Liquid crossover and oxygen void fraction exceeding the hydrogen void fraction occurred for porous plate electrodes, but these phenomena were suppressed for perforated foil electrodes.","Water electrolysis to generate hydrogen with renewable energy is a key technology towards a carbon-free society. Among different types of technology, alkaline water electrolysis is cost-effective and of reasonably good efficiency (see e.g. [1]). The efficiency can be further improved if ohmic losses are reduced. Zero gap between electrodes and the diaphragm is considered to minimize ohmic losses (e.g. see [2]). However, the ohmic/area resistance in zero gap cells is often found much higher than expected, i.e. the much higher than the diaphragm/separator resistance [3]. It is well-known that the hydrodynamics of the electrogenerated bubbles inside the cell can affect the cell potential in nonzero gap (flat plate) electrolyzers [4]. In water electrolysis, dissolved hydrogen and oxygen gases are produced separately at the cathode and anode respectively. Upon supersaturation of the dissolved gases, H2 and O2 bubbles are formed [4]. Bubbles between electrodes can act as electric insulators amd lengthen the path needed for the ions to travel from one electrode to another [5], thus increasing the cell resistance while electrode coverage by bubbles can reduce the active surface area of the electrode [4]. On the other hand, as mentioned in Ref. [6], when bubbles detach from the electrode surfaces, a microconvection at the boundary layer is induced, enhancing the mass transfer and thus also the cell efficiency [7, 8]. In particular, for the zero-gap (or narrow gap) configuration, the origin of the high area resistance was speculated to be caused by bubbles or a gas film trapped in the gap as practically it is almost impossible to reach a true zero gap (see also [9, 10, 11, 12]). It is expected that the void fraction at the gap increases with decreasing gap size. Therefore there might exist an optimal distance between the electrodes for optimal cell efficiency while the area resistance contributed by the solution is still significantly reduced [9]. The existence of the optimal gap size is experimentally found in Ref. [11, 13]. Furthermore, recently, experiments were reported by Haverkort & Rajaei [13], in which a gap width of 200\text{\,}\mu\mathrm{m} led to a substantially lower cell voltage than a gap width of zero, suggesting that introducing a deliberate gap allows bubbles or gas films to escape more easily. Nevertheless, the presence of gas bubbles/films in ‘zero’ gap remains still a hypothesis to date. To clear up the speculations in literature and the mystery of bubble/gas effects on the cell resistance in zero/narrow gap configurations, it is of primary interest to visualize and measure the gas distribution. Measuring the gas distribution in electrolyzers is challenging due to opaque dense bubbly flows and the required high spatial resolution. As mentioned in Ref. [4], the attempts to measure the void fraction in which the bubbles produced by vertical plane electrodes are via image analysis (e.g. Ref. [14, 15] employed high speed camera) and local intrusive probes to measure the resistivity of the bubbly electrolyte solution [16, 14]. The image analysis method can yield significant error near the electrode due to bubble shadowing effect and the resistivity method assumes homogeneity of void fraction in depth [4]. In short, measuring the void fraction in narrow-gap cells poses practical challenges due to limited optical access and spatial resolution. In this work, we employ 2D X-ray radioscopy to measure the void fraction in an electrolyzer, including the gap region with a resolution down to 15\text{\,}\mu\mathrm{m}. In the past, X-ray radioscopy and tomography have been employed to study bubbly flows in porous transport layers of polymer electrolyte water electrolyzer (summarized in [17]) and proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (summarized in Ref. [18]). X-ray measurements have also been extensively employed to dense bubbly flows in many other engineering applications [19]. To the best of our knowledge, no attempt before the current work has utilized X-ray scanning to measure the gas volume fraction in zero/narrow gap electrolyzers. Another phenomenon that will be addressed in this paper is the liquid crossover through the diaphragm. Liquid crossover is a cause of dissolved gas crossover. Gas crossover has become an ongoing industrial challenge due to the resulted risk in safety and the gas purity. Yet very limited research on this phenomenon is available in open literature [20, 21, 22]. One transport mechanism is through the electro-osmotic flow induced by the electric potential difference across the diaphragm, which is observed in Ref. [23, 24]. In this work, we try to determine and understand the crossover in a zero-gap cell using electrodes with different porosity and surface wettability. The experimental setup and method is elaborated in Sec. 2. Then, the overall structure of the bubbly flows and the typical current-voltage curve are illustrated in Sec. 3.1. After that, the effect of gap size and current densities on the measured void fraction are uncovered quantitatively in Sec. 3.2. This is followed by a further analysis on the gas contribution to the cell voltage in Sec. 3.3. In Sec. 3.4 the crossover phenomenon is addressed by comparing the different hydrodynamic behaviors in zero-gap configurations using two different electrodes."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09611v1,"An Improved Bound on Nonlinear Quantum Mechanics using a
Cryogenic Radio Frequency Experiment","There are strong arguments that quantum mechanics may be nonlinear in its dynamics. A discovery of nonlinearity would hint at a novel understanding of the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory, for example. As such, experiments searching for potential nonlinear effects in the electromagnetic sector are important. Here we outline such an experiment, consisting of a stream of random bits (which were generated using Rigetti’s Aspen-M-3 chip) as input to an RF signal generator coupled to a cryogenic detector. Projective measurements of the qubit state, which is originally prepared in an equal superposition, serve as the random binary output of a signal generator. Thereafter, spectral analysis of the RF detector would yield a detectable excess signal predicted to arise from such a nonlinear effect. A comparison between the projective measurements of the quantum bits vs the classical baseline showed no power excess. This sets a new limit on the electromagnetic nonlinearity parameter |\epsilon|\lessapprox 1.15\times 10^{-12}, at a 90.0% confidence level. This is the most stringent limit on nonlinear quantum mechanics thus far and an improvement by nearly a factor of 50 over the previous experimental limit.","Linearity of time evolution is a fundamental axiom of quantum mechanics. However, in physical systems linearity is typically an approximation to a more complete description of the system. The full evolution of the system can be viewed in terms of a power series, where the linear terms are observationally prominent with nonlinear terms suppressed by energy scales. Recent theoretical work [1], building on prior insights [2, 3], has shown that a similar structure is possible in the time evolution of quantum mechanics itself. It has been shown that there is a broad class of consistent (causal and gauge invariant) extensions of quantum mechanics where the time evolution of the system is nonlinear. In this class of theories, one can view the time evolution equation of a quantum field theory as a power series expansion in the quantum states. The term that is linear in the quantum state is simply the first term in this expansion and is observationally dominant. This results in linear evolution emerging as the leading order approximation of a more complex time evolution. The main observation of Ref. [1] is that the Hamiltonian that describes the time evolution of a quantum state |\Psi\rangle of a quantum field theory can be made state-dependent – thus leading to nonlinear time evolution – by shifting various bosonic field operators in the Hamiltonian by a small amount proportional to the expectation value of the operator in the full quantum state |\Psi\rangle. In quantum electrodynamics, these nonlinear terms effectively shift the conventional Lagrangian A_{\mu}J^{\mu} to the term \left(A_{\mu}+\epsilon\langle\Psi|A_{\mu}|\Psi\rangle\right)J^{\mu}. Here A_{\mu} is the electromagnetic 4-vector potential, J^{\mu} a 4-vector current and \epsilon parametrizes the magnitude of the nonlinear term. Thus, the current J^{\mu} effectively sees a modified 4-vector potential \left(A_{\mu}+\epsilon\langle\Psi|A_{\mu}|\Psi\rangle\right). It was shown in Ref. [1] that despite over a century of precise quantum mechanical measurements (for example, in atomic, optical, nuclear and collider experiments), observational limits on causal nonlinear quantum mechanical evolution were weak, but that nevertheless, potent experimental probes of such nonlinearities are possible with dedicated experiments. Figure 1: A schematic of our test of nonlinear quantum mechanics (NLQM). A qubit is prepared in a superposition state and measured, creating a macroscopic superposition, two worlds. In the world in which the qubit is measured to be in the |1\rangle state an electric circuit is powered with a voltage of V_{0} during a predetermined time. In the world in which the qubit is measured to be |0\rangle, the source is kept off, but the voltage of the same circuit is measured to high precision in the same predetermined time. Because the expectation value of the voltage, averaged over both worlds is V_{0}/2, NLQM will effectively lead to a leakage of voltage of size \epsilon V_{0}/2 from the source world to the measurement world. The experimental protocols to test Ref. [1] relied on the following fact: nonlinear evolution leads to interactions of the quantum state with itself. This manifests itself in the form of interactions between different “branches” or “arms” of the wave function, also referred to as “worlds”. Each branch corresponds to one possible outcome of the measurement of the quantum system, and all branches coexist after the measurement [4]. Based on this, there are two kinds of experiments that can probe nonlinear quantum mechanics. First, one can consider interferometric experiments where a quantum system is placed in a superposition and anomalous interactions between the arms of the superposition manifest as a phase shift in the interferometer. This protocol was implemented in an ion interferometer [5] which searched for the Coulomb field of one arm of the ion interferometer interacting with the other arm. In these interferometric experiments, it is essential to maintain quantum coherence of the superposition. Surprisingly, causal nonlinear quantum mechanics leads can lead to effects that persist even when the arms of the superposition get entangled with an environment and decohere. This phenomenon, dubbed the “Everett Phone” [3], gives rise to a second class of potent experimental probes. A search relying on this is sketched schematically in Figure 1. First, a macroscopic quantum superposition is created. Since the superposition need not be coherent, it is easily created by performing a measurement on a quantum system such as a spin or a qubit. The many-worlds interpretation suggests that this measurement, which is simply an interaction between the quantum system and the measuring device, creates a macroscopic superposition of two worlds: one in which the qubit was measured to be |0\rangle and another where it was measured to be |1\rangle. At a fixed location L in the laboratory, we turn on a voltage V_{0} if the qubit is measured in |1\rangle. In the case of |0\rangle , we use a voltmeter to measure the voltage signal with no voltage source turned on at location L. The Schrödinger equation predicts that the full quantum state |\Psi\rangle is the superposition of both these worlds, and thus it can be verified that \langle\Psi|A_{\mu}|\Psi\rangle is non-zero at L. In the presence of the nonlinear term \epsilon\langle\Psi|A_{\mu}|\Psi\rangle J^{\mu}, the current J^{\mu} will respond to an additional voltage \epsilon V_{0}/2 irrespective of the qubit outcome that the current is entangled with. That is, the voltage that was turned on in the world when the qubit was |1\rangle leaks into the world where it is |0\rangle. This phenomenon, a robust consequence of any causal nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics [3, 1], is thus once again simply the interaction between two arms of a superposition that nonlinearities would enable. However, its persistence, even in the presence of decoherence, could enable much more potent experimental probes of this scenario than is possible with quantum coherent interferometric probes, as in Ref. [5]. The first experiment implementing this protocol was performed in Ref. [6], obtaining a bound of |\epsilon|\lessapprox 4.7\times 10^{-11}. The purpose of the present paper is to report on an experiment that implemented this protocol using a high-power radio frequency (RF) setup, which improved the bound to |\epsilon|\lessapprox 1.15\times 10^{-12}. Here again, we measure a qubit system. If a |1\rangle measurement is obtained, we turned on an RF source with applied power P_{A} at a fixed location L in the laboratory. If |0\rangle was obtained, we turned on a device that measured RF power without any RF source being turned on. In the presence of the nonlinear term \epsilon\langle\Psi|A_{\mu}|\Psi\rangle, the detectors will experience an additional power \epsilon^{2}P_{A}/4 irrespective of the qubit outcome they are entangled with. Thus, in the world where the qubit was in the 0 state and there was no power source, the detector will see RF power \epsilon^{2}P_{A}/4. If P_{M} is the smallest power that can be experimentally measured, then the corresponding value of \epsilon that the experiment is sensitive to is given by \displaystyle|\epsilon_{\textrm{lim}}|=2\times\sqrt{P_{M}/P_{A}} (1)"
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09562v1,Likelihood and Deep Learning Analysis of the electron neutrino event sample at Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) of the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment,"Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) is a next-generation long baseline neutrino experiment. One of its primary physics goals is to measure neutrino oscillation parameters precisely, including the Dirac CP violating phase. As conventional \nu_{\mu} beam generates from the J-PARC neutrino baseline contains only 1.5\% of \nu_{e} interaction of total, it is challenging to measure \nu_{e}/\bar{\nu}_{e} scattering cross-section on nuclei. To reduce these systematic uncertainties, IWCD will be built to study neutrino interaction rates with higher precision. Simulated data comprise \nu_{e}CC0\pi as the main signal with NC\pi^{0} and \nu_{\mu}CC are major background events. To reduce the backgrounds initially, a log-likelihood-based reconstruction algorithm to select candidate events was used. However, this method sometimes struggles to distinguish \pi^{0} events properly from electron-like events. Thus, a Machine Learning-based framework has been developed and implemented to enhance the purity and efficiency of \nu_{e} events.","Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) is a next-generation underground water Cherenkov detector, with a fiducial volume of eight times that of the existing Super-Kamiokande detector [1] and an upgraded neutrino beam power of \sim1300 kW [2]. Its primary aim is to measure neutrino oscillation [3] by observing neutrinos from accelerator, atmospheric, solar, supernova and other astrophysical sources. One of the key physics goals of this long-baseline (L = 295 km) experiment is to investigate matter-antimatter asymmetry by measuring CP violation (CPV) in the neutrino sector [4]. A major challenge of this experiment lies in the precise measurement of electron neutrino cross-sections, which account for only 1.5\% of those created by conventional muon neutrino (\nu_{\mu}) beam. To reduce these systematic uncertainties, an Intermediate Water Cherenkov detector (IWCD) [5] will be positioned about \sim 750 m downstream from the J-PARC neutrino source. The IWCD comprises an inner detector (ID) radius of 400 cm, and height of 300 cm, representing a fiducial volume of \sim 600 ton and equipped with \sim 500 high-resolution multi-PMT (mPMT) [2] modules, each consisting of an array of 19 smaller 8 cm diameter PMTs. This provides a granularity comparable to that of Hyper-K’s far detector (FD). The detector volume of IWCD can move vertically within a 50 m tall pit, allowing the neutrino spectra to span 1^{\circ}-4^{\circ} off-axis angle [2] to study neutrino interaction rate at different peak energies with high accuracy. With its new detector technologies, IWCD will be capable of measuring the percent level electron neutrino (anti) (\nu_{e} or {\bar{\nu}_{e}}) contribution within \nu_{\mu} beam, as well as measuring cross-section ratios (\sigma_{\nu_{e}}/\sigma_{\nu_{\mu}}, \sigma_{{\bar{\nu}_{e}}}/\sigma_{{\bar{\nu}_{\mu}}}). This will significantly improve the CPV sensitivity by reducing the associated systematic uncertainties. To achieve these goals, advanced event reconstruction algorithms are essential for accurate particle identification (PID) and for the measurement of \nu_{e} cross-sections. This work explores the \nu_{e} event selection using both the traditional event reconstruction algorithm (fiTQun) and the advanced Machine Learning (ML) tool. The analysis presented here demonstrates how the ML techniques improve event selection, signal purity, and its efficiency, surpassing fiTQun."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08823v1,Vertically stacked amorphous selenium based VUV photodetectors for use in liquid noble detectors,We present results from the characterization of a vertically stacked amorphous selenium (aSe)-based photodetector for use in cryogenic environments. aSe has been identified as an ideal photoconductor that can efficiently convert vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light to charges even at cryogenic temperatures. We have designed and fabricated an aSe device in vertical geometry with top and bottom metal electrodes that produces an electric field perpendicular to the substrate. The top-metal contact has an open design that results in a large fraction of the aSe thin film surface to be active for photodetection. Our experiments show that the vertically stacked aSe device detects light from a Xenon flash lamp in a vacuum environment and can produce measurable signals at \sim130K. We also demonstrate a significant enhancement in the amplitude of the photoinduced signal by growing graphene on the top-metal contact and the aSe thin film. Our results provide the first demonstration of a vertical aSe based VUV photodetector that utilizes the wide-band optical transparency of graphene top-electrode. Our results could open the doorway to a potentially game-changing solution of an integrated charge and light sensor that can be employed in future large-scale time projection chambers with pixelated anode planes.,"Liquid argon (LAr) and xenon (LXe), two commonly used noble elements in time projection chambers (TPCs), act as both the detection medium and scintillation medium, offering high scintillation yields in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) range. However, detecting VUV photons with common photosensors such as SiPMs and PMTs is difficult, leading to the use of wavelength-shifting materials like tetraphenyl butadiene and polyethylene naphthalate, which shift the scintillation light into the longer wavelength region [1]. However, these materials have low conversion efficiencies [2] and deteriorate quickly under harsh environmental conditions, such as cryogenic temperatures [3]. This has led to research into alternative materials, such as amorphous selenium (aSe), which has been well studied for applications in X-ray imaging [4, 5]. Due to its unique electronic structure, aSe can efficiently convert VUV photons into electron-hole pairs [6]. Its good effective hole mobility and the potential for impact ionization-induced hole multiplication at large applied fields make aSe an excellent candidate for detecting events with low photon yields at cryogenic temperatures. Rooks et al. [7] recently demonstrated, using a horizontal device geometry, that an aSe-based device remains robust under cryogenic conditions and produces a response at temperatures relevant to liquid noble detectors commonly used in high-energy physics. This demonstration by our group, using a novel windowless horizontal geometry with aSe coated over interdigitated metal electrodes, provides a pathway to implementing a fully pixelated anode plane capable of detecting both charge and light. However, the electric field and the subsequent carrier transport in aSe, achieved with the interdigitated electrodes in horizontal geometry, are non-uniform and non-trivial to investigate, making full optimization of the detector difficult. Additionally, the side-by-side arrangement of interdigitated metal electrodes necessitates that the hole-blocking layer, essential for operation in the avalanche regime, be selectively coated only on the anode to avoid carrier-induced heating of the hole-blocking layer if it is also present on the cathode. Here, we explore an aSe-based device with a vertical geometry, i.e., aSe placed between two charge-collecting conductors, but with a top metal electrode design that allows for a large aSe active region. We compare the signal obtained from this novel detector to one where a VUV-transparent graphene [8] top electrode is grown on aSe to make the electric field in aSe more uniform."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08740v1,"Characterisation of analogue MAPS produced in
the 65 nm TPSCo process","Within the context of the ALICE ITS3 collaboration, a set of MAPS small-scale test structures were developed using the 65 nm TPSCo CMOS imaging process with the upgrade of the ALICE inner tracking system as its primary focus. One such sensor, the Circuit Exploratoire 65 nm (CE-65), and its evolution the CE-65v2, were developed to explore charge collection properties for varying configurations including collection layer process (standard, blanket, modified with gap), pixel pitch (15, 18, 22.5\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}), and pixel geometry (square vs hexagonal/staggered). In this work the characterisation of the CE-65v2 chip, based on 55Fe lab measurements and test beams at CERN SPS, is presented. Matrix gain uniformity up to the \mathcal{O}(5%) level was demonstrated for all considered chip configurations. The CE-65v2 chip achieves a spatial resolution of under 2\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m} during beam tests. Process modifications allowing for faster charge collection and less charge sharing result in decreased spatial resolution, but a considerably wider range of operation, with both the 15\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m} and 22.5\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m} chips achieving over 99% efficiency up to a \sim180 e- seed threshold. The results serve to validate the 65 nm TPSCo CMOS process, as well as to motivate design choices in future particle detection experiments.","Monolitihic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) combine the passive sensor and active readout chip onto the same silicon die. MAPS offer a variety of advantages with respect to their hybrid counterparts, including a lower material budget, cost, reduced power consumption, and smaller pitch as bump bonding is not needed. MAPS have already seen adoption by a wide variety of ongoing and proposed (collider) physics experiments including the STAR Experiment [1], the ALICE Experiment [2], the EIC [3], and the FCC-ee [4]. The ALICE experiment implemented a full MAPS-based tracking detector, consisting of 7 concentric layers, during its Inner Tracking System (ITS) upgrade during the second long shutdown of the LHC, denoted ITS2 [2], in the first adoption of MAPS at the LHC. To further improve tracking and vertexing performance, the ITS3 upgrade [5] seeks to replace the three innermost layers of the ITS2 with three fully cylindrical layers consisting of wafer-scale bent sensors, targeting an excellent spatial resolution of the chips (5\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}) and low material budget (0.09% X0/layer). The layers will rely on the stitching technique supported in the commercially available TPSco 65 nm CMOS imaging process. In the context of the ITS3 upgrade, a set of small-scale test structures were produced in a submission in December 2020: Analogue Pixel Test Structure (APTS [6]), Digital Pixel Test Structure (DPTS [7]), and the Circuit Exploratoire 65 nm (CE-65 [8]). A second submission at the beginning of 2023 allowed for the evolution of some of the small-scale test structures, including the CE-65v2: the evolution of CE-65. The CE-65v2 chip was developed to investigate the charge collection and electrical properties of the 65 nm CMOS process through a selection of chip variants. The chip consists of a matrix of 1152 pixels organised in 48 columns and 24 rows, with a rolling-shutter readout. The in-pixel electronics consists of a AC-coupled amplifier that is DC-separated from the input stage of the readout electronics, allowing for the application of a resetting voltage for the reverse biasing of the sensor to the reset node. A resetting voltage of 10 V was applied throughout these studies in order to achieve full depletion. In total, there are 15 variants of the CE-65v2 chip targeting the exploration of 3 main axes: • Process variation: Standard, Modified, Modified with Gap • Pitch variation: 15\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}, 18\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}, 22.5\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m} • Matrix geometry: square vs hexagonal In this work, the first two axes are explored. A total of four chips corresponding to the 15\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m} and 22.5\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m} chips in the Standard process and the 15\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m} and 22.5\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m} chips in the Modified with Gap process were considered in these studies. Adopting a smaller pitch allows for an improvement in spatial resolution, but comes with significant drawbacks with respect to power consumption, readout-rate, as well as difficulties during manufacturing. Thus it becomes necessary to explore the pitch size at which the desired spatial resolution can be achieved, without compromising other aspects of the chip and system design. The process variations are detailed in Ref. [9]. Figure 1a depicts the Standard process consisting of an n-well collection electrode, and in-pixel CMOS circuitry that is isolated from the epitaxial layer by a deep p-well. The depletion region begins to develop at the n-well collection electrode and follows a balloon shape in the epitaxial layer until the p+ substrate is reached. Due to the limited depth of the epitaxial region of \mathcal{O}(10\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}), the lateral region remains undepleted, resulting in diffusion-dominated charge collection. In effect, charge collection is slow and subject to charge trapping, whilst exhibiting high charge sharing between pixels. Figure 1b depicts the Modified with Gap process which has, in addition, a deep low-dose n-type implant between the epitaxial layer and the CMOS circuitry, with gaps at the pixel edges. The depletion region in the Modified with Gap process extends laterally, as the gaps allow for the development of the electric field. The lateral electric field induces drift-dominated charge collection even at the edges, resulting in faster charge collection and reduced charge sharing.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08604v1,Production of GEM-like structures using laser-cutting techniques,"It has previously been proposed to enhance the ionization yield of liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPC) used in dark matter and neutrino experiments by loading LAr with dopants with ionization energies below the energy of LAr scintillation photons. While dual-phase LArTPCs have excellent sensitivity to single ionization electrons, granting some sub-keV thresholds, their compatibility with photosensitive dopants is hindered by gas-phase electroluminescence photons re-ionizing the dopants, creating a positive feedback loop. This challenge can be addressed by optically decoupling the gaseous and liquid phases with a barrier that transmits electrons. One potential way to do this uses a pair of structures based on Gaseous Electron Multipliers (GEMs) with mis-aligned holes. Rather than amplifying electron signals in gas pockets within their holes, their holes will be filled with LAr and a lower bias voltage will be applied, so that incident drifting electrons are drawn into the holes but not amplified. Instead, amplification will occur in the gas phase above the structures, as typical for dual-phase TPCs. Its core element is a GEM-like structure machined from polyethylene naphthalate (PEN). Since PEN scintillates in the visible spectrum, the risk of increased radioactivity due to the larger mass compared to traditional wire grids is negated by the potential to veto its own radioactivity. As such, these structures may also be a useful alternative to wire grids. In this work, we report the newest developments on the production of GEM-like structures using laser-based techniques, namely the manufacture of the first batch PEN and PMMA-based GEM-like structures. This process allows low-cost, reproducible fabrication of a high volume of such structures. In addition to being a low radioactive technique, we expect that it will allow the scaling up of the production of these structures at a reduced cost. First tests indicate good electrical stability, while the performance assessment is still ongoing.","WIMPs can be directly detected by dual-phase Ar-based TPCs, such as those developed by the DarkSide collaboration [1]. Future detectors will search in the lower energy region and focus on increasing the sensitivity, by relying on S2 signals and by improving S2 amplification. A possible improvement, currently being studied at the University of California, Riverside is the use of dopants with very low ionization energies, which may enhance the medium’s ionization yield. “Photosensitive dopants” with ionization energies below the energy of scintillation photons can also convert S1 into additional S2. However, S2 photons may leak back into the LAr and cause additional ionization, resulting in a positive feedback loop. To prevent this feedback, one possibility is to construct a structure similar to a gaseous electron multiplier (GEM) [2] that transmits electrons but blocks VUV photons. This can be done with two stacked GEMs with offset patterns, operated fully in the liquid phase, beneath a gas pocket in traditional dual-phase LArTPCs, with applied voltage too small to induce electroluminescence. To self-veto radiogenic backgrounds from the GEMs, 125 \mum-thick polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), which scintillates, was used. The first batch used a hexagonal hole pattern, which optimizes surface coverage (higher hole density and hence better transparency) with 200 \mum-diameter holes, and 1000 \mum pitch. A PEDOT:PSS (Clevios™) transparent conductive coating produced the electrodes, improving light collection of the readout plane while blocking VUV photons that may induce feedback. To improve the gain and minimize re-ionization, two such structures can be used. By shifting the holes’ positions (misalignment), these structures prevent electroluminescence photons from the gas pocket above them from entering the LAr. Nevertheless, cost-effective, radiopure, and scalable production of these solutions poses additional challenges. Despite recent advances observed in the development of MPGD technology, in particular of GEM-like structures, the methods of fabricating GEMs are limited [2, 3]. GEM production can be divided into two main approaches: 1) micro-hole production via photolithography and chemical etching or 2) mechanical hole drilling [3]. While the former may exhibit problems due to displacement of the holes in the dielectric and electrode layers due to alignment inaccuracies, the latter may result in metal burrs during drilling, which may cause electronic discharge [3]. An alternative approach was developed at the University of Tokyo [4], using doped photosensitive etchings (e.g. PEG and PEG3C), and a process similar to the lift-off method in the metal deposition step. Since the hole drilling relies entirely on photolithography, this approach displays two major challenges: First, uneven doping leads to rough hole walls, which manifest as tip structures in the holes, resulting in a greater discharge probability. Second, etching processes that rely on the photosensitive properties of special doped materials (such as Ag) cannot be applied to other glass materials with lower radioactive background and high-dielectric-strength. In addition, processes such as lift-off will cause curling, difficult to eliminate, and which can increase the electrical discharge probability. In this work, the production of PEN-based GEM structures using laser-cutting techniques is presented. A novel GEM fabrication method is proposed to solve the technical limitations of current approaches, namely in what concerns the producing of conical (or bi-conical) GEM-holes in thick structures, that will allow to improve the electron transparency while minimizing possible problems from charge-buildup in the GEM-like holes. Due to its characteristics, this technique is expected to allow the development of large area solutions, and easy production scaling, being adequate for the production requirements of dark matter experiments as an alternative radiopure technique."

Here, we report the first high-resolution recoil spectroscopy of a single, selected nuclear state using superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors. The STJ sensors were used to measure the eV-scale nuclear recoils produced in 7Be electron capture decay in coincidence with the 478 keV \gamma-ray emitted in decays to the excited nuclear state in 7Li. Details of the Doppler broadened recoil spectrum depend on the slow-down dynamics of the recoil ion and can constrain the interaction potential between the recoiling Li and the Ta matrix of the STJ sensor. The results have implications in several areas from nuclear structure and stopping powers at eV-scale energies to direct searches for dark matter, neutrino mass measurements, and other physics beyond the standard model.","References Kolos et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08170v2,Simulation of Solar Wind Charged Particle Energy Deposited and Particle Identification by \DeltaE-E Discrimination in the SNAPPY Cubesat Detector,The Solar Neutrino and Astro-Particle PhYsics (SNAPPY) Cubesat is expected to launch in 2025 and it will carry into a polar orbit a prototype test detector for solar neutrino background studies while over the Earth’s poles for the neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory future project (\nuSOL). During this flight it is possible to do other science measurements. One of these is an improved study of the solar wind particles through better particle identification and high resolution energy measurements. This study aimed to understand how well could the solar wind particles be identified using the planned detector but instead of using the veto array as an anti-coincidence it would be used as a \DeltaE energy sampling of a phoswich particle ID system.,"As a NASA Jump Start undergraduate at Wichita State University, double majoring in Aerospace Engineering and Physics, I am conducting research on the particle discrimination capabilities of the CubeSat detector using the \DeltaE-E method and measuring the energy spectrum. The focus of the \textnuSOL project is the detection and study of neutrinos, primarily from the Sun. The research goals of the \textnuSOL project is to utilize the 1/r^{2} neutrino flux with the Sun, determining the neutrino gravitational focus to the Sun, and observing dark matter candidates [1]. The CubeSat detector design features two different detector materials: Polyvinyltoluene (the Veto) and gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet (called GAGG). Both detector materials are scintillators. The whole detector includes four GAGG crystals that are enclosed within the Veto. The purpose of the GAGG is to measure the neutrino interaction on 71Ga that is characterized by a double pulse [1]. The purpose of the Veto is to act as a filter for the GAGG. Neutrinos likely will not interact with the Veto’s material, and in principle, any particles detected by the Veto should not be neutrinos. Therefore, any double pulse detected in the GAGG that occurs simultaneously with a pulse from the Veto is not considered as a neutrino interaction. The current plan is for the CubSsat detector prototype to go into low altitude Polar Earth orbit, with an orbital period of 90 minutes, attached to a CubeSat nanosatellite. The detector will be turned on in fifteen minute intervals while the CubeSat is oriented over Earth’s north and south poles. Eventually \textnuSOL plans to go into orbit around the Sun, within a distance of seven solar radii at perihelion. The purpose of the solar orbit is to take advantage of the higher flux of neutrinos at closer distances to the Sun. The overall goal of the \textnuSOL project is to present a new and innovative way of studying the Sun’s fusion core and the particle physics of neutrinos. The CubeSat is a test of the detector, but we can use it to study solar wind at Earth and near the Sun in final mission."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08022v1,Commissioning of the 2.6 m tall two-phase xenon time projection chamber of Xenoscope,"Xenoscope is a demonstrator for a next-generation xenon-based observatory for astroparticle physics, as proposed by the XLZD (XENON-LUX-ZEPLIN-DARWIN) collaboration. It houses a \qty2.6m tall, two-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC), in a cryostat filled with \qty∼360kg of liquid xenon. The main goals of the facility are to demonstrate electron drift in liquid xenon over this distance, to measure the electron cloud transversal and longitudinal diffusion, as well as the optical properties of the medium. In this work, we describe in detail the construction and commissioning of the TPC and report on the observation of light and charge signals with cosmic muons.","Two-phase (liquid and gas) xenon time projection chambers (TPCs) are powerful detectors in the fields of astroparticle physics and rare-event searches [1, 2]. Ongoing experiments based on this technology have reached the multi-tonne scale and ultra-low background rates [3, 4, 5]. Next-generation detectors plan to further increase the xenon target mass and thus the linear dimensions of the TPCs, in order to house several tens of tonnes of liquid xenon (LXe) [6, 7, 8, 9]. At the same time, the backgrounds will be reduced such that interaction rates will be dominated by cosmic and solar neutrinos [10, 11, 12] and by second-order weak decays [13]. The XENON-LUX-ZEPLIN-DARWIN (XLZD) experiment will operate a TPC with an active mass of \qtyrange6080t [8, 9]. This scale-up imposes a series of technological challenges to be addressed with large-scale demonstrators, such as PANCAKE [14] and Xenoscope [15]. The PANCAKE facility can house a TPC with a \qty2.6m diameter, while Xenoscope was constructed to operate a \qty2.6m tall TPC. The design and construction of Xenoscope, without the TPC, are detailed in ref. [15], and first results with a \qty53cm tall purity monitor were published in ref. [16]. In this work, the focus is on the new systems, in particular the \qty2.6m tall TPC, and on its commissioning phases with gaseous xenon (GXe) and LXe. We also show first scintillation and electroluminescence signals acquired from cosmic muons. The paper is organised as follows: section 2 gives an overview of the entire facility, section 3 details the \qty2.6m tall TPC and the systems designed and installed for its operation, section 4 describes the commissioning of the different systems, the first run of Xenoscope with the dual- phase TPC and the data acquired with cosmic muons. section 5 provides a summary of the results and an outlook towards the next steps of the project. Additionally, a new gas-extraction line was added and commissioned during the run and is reported in Appendix A."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07996v1,A computer-vision aided Compton-imaging system for radioactive waste characterization and decommissioning of nuclear power plants,"Nuclear energy production is inherently tied to the management and disposal of radioactive waste. Enhancing classification and monitoring tools is therefore crucial, with significant socioeconomic implications. This paper reports on the applicability and performance of a high-efficiency, cost-effective and portable Compton camera for detecting and visualizing low- and medium-level radioactive waste from the decommissioning and regular operation of nuclear power plants. The results demonstrate the good performance of Compton imaging for this type of application, both in terms of image resolution and reduced measuring time. A technical readiness level of TRL7 has been thus achieved with this system prototype, as demonstrated with dedicated field measurements carried out at the radioactive-waste disposal plant of El Cabril (Spain) utilizing a pluarility of radioactive-waste drums from decomissioned nuclear power plants. The performance of the system has been enhanced by means of computer-vision techniques in combination with advanced Compton-image reconstruction algorithms based on Maximum-Likelihood Expectation Maximization. Finally, we also show the feasibility of 3D tomographic reconstruction from a series of relatively short measurements around the objects of interest. The potential of this imaging system to enhance nuclear waste management makes it a promising innovation for the nuclear industry.","The growth of electricity production based primarily on uranium fission has been steady since the 1950s, with approximately 440 nuclear power reactors currently operating in 32 countries, boasting a combined capacity of about 390 GWe [1]. The main advantage of using this technology for electricity production is the drastic reduction of harmful emissions [2, 3]. In contrast, the generation of electricity from a typical 1000 MW nuclear power station produces around three cubic meters of vitrified high-level waste per year [4]. The production and subsequent disposal of radioactive waste is the main drawback of nuclear-energy-based electricity production. Consequently, some countries, such as Spain, Switzerland or Germany, have opted to phase out nuclear power. This leads to the decommissioning of the existing nuclear plants and the management of all associated nuclear residues and activated structural materials. Both regular operation and decommissioning of nuclear plants constitute the primary sources of radioactive waste that must be classified and safely disposed. The classification of radioactive material mainly depends on its activity concentration111Except for the very-short-lived waste (VSLW), which can generate high-level activity but does not require special disposal facilities, since it will become regular waste within a short time period of a few years.. From highest to lowest activity, the classification would be: high-, intermediate-, low- and very-low-level waste (HLW, ILW, LLW and VLLW). The first two categories primarily consist of spent fuel. On the contrary, LLW and VLLW, such as protective shoe covers and clothing, wiping rags, mops, filters, reactor water treatment waste, equipment and tools, etc, mainly originate from reactor operations and typically exhibit radioactivity just above background levels found in nature [5]. The disposal of radioactive waste varies according to the classification criteria exposed above. Therefore, VLLW and LLW are commonly disposed of in near-surface facilities until they decay sufficiently to be considered common waste, while ILW and HLW must be disposed long time in underground facilities specially designed for this purpose. In the case of HLW, special treatment is necessary due to the significant amount of heat produced by the radioactive decay process, in comparison to ILW. Given the cost, duration and limited space for radioactive waste disposal, effective management is essential to minimize the amount of material classified, which necessitates dedicated disposal centers as explained earlier. This management process involves not only measuring the activity but also assessing the homogeneity and distribution of contaminants throughout the materials. To address these challenges, research groups worldwide are actively developing and applying new detection devices and techniques [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, one of the limitations of most detection systems is the rather low detection efficiency and the relatively long characterization times. An alternative to overcome such limiations is to use electronically collimated (Compton) cameras, which can provide a large field of view (FOV), detection sensitivity and portability [12, 13, 14, 15]. In this work, we present the results of several field measurements for radioactive waste characterization using a RGB-camera coupled to a high-efficiency \gamma-ray Compton imager, thereby enabling hybrid \gamma-ray and visible-image reconstruction. The hardware elements of the detection system itself are detailed in Sec. 2. The \gamma-ray imager provides a graphical representation of the spatial distribution of the radioactive waste or source by means of the Compton imaging technique, which is explained later in Sec. 3.1.1. Field-measurements were carried out at the disposal plant of El Cabril (ENRESA), thereby utilizing the methodology reported in Sec. 3. Sec. 3.1 describes the baseline scenario for demonstrating the technique, consisting of the measurement and analysis of one single barrel, which we also use to introduce the computer-vision technique implemented in this work (Sec. 3.1.2). After validating the full image-reconstruction technique we apply it to a more complex scenario consisting of an array or ensemble of drums with different activity levels and configurations. Finally, Sec. 4 provides a summary of the main conclusions and the future perspective."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07877v1,A fast plastic scintillator for low intensity proton beam monitoring,"In the context of particle therapy monitoring, we are developing a gamma-ray detector to determine the ion range in vivo from the measurement of particle time-of-flight. For this application, a beam monitor capable to tag in time the incident ion with a time resolution below 235 ps FWHM (100 ps rms) is required to provide a start signal for the acquisition. We have therefore developed a dedicated detector based on a fast organic scintillator (EJ-204) of 25 \times25 \times1 mm3 coupled to four SiPM strips that allow measuring the particle incident position by scintillation light sharing. The prototype was characterised with single protons of energies between 63 and 225 MeV at the MEDICYC and ProteusONE facilities of the Antoine Lacassagne proton therapy centre in Nice. We obtained a time resolution of 120 ps FWHM at 63 MeV, and a spatial resolution of \sim2 mm rms for single particles. Two identical detectors also allowed to measure the MEDICYC proton energy with 0.3% accuracy.","Compared to conventional X-ray radiotherapy, Particle Therapy (PT) provides a high ballistic precision with limited irradiation of healthy tissue, thanks to a sharp maximum of the dose deposition at the end of the particle range (Bragg peak). However, PT accuracy may be limited by numerous sources of uncertainties such as patient mispositioning, transient modifications of the anatomy and errors in the determination of tissue stopping powers from X-ray images. In order to reduce the safety margins imposed by these uncertainties and improve the technique specificity, particle range has to be measured on-line with millimetric precision[1]. Several groups worldwide are developing different techniques for PT monitoring, taking advantage of the spatial and/or temporal correlation between the dose and the emission vertices of secondary particles like Prompt Gammas (PGs)[2]. In this context, we are developing a PG detection system that exploits the PG Timing (PGT) technique to determine the ion range from an exclusive measurement of particles Time-Of-Flight (TOF)[3]. The system consists of a multi-channel PG detectors array (TIARA for Tof Imaging ARrRay) arranged around the target/patient to measure the PG time of arrival t_{stop}, which are read-out in coincidence with a fast beam monitor that tags in time the incident ions t_{start}. The overall TOF measured (TOF=t_{stop}-t_{start}) is equal to the ion transit time in the patient up to the PG vertex, plus the PG TOF from the vertex to the gamma detector. The PG vertex coordinates and subsequently the ion range in the patient can be retrieved from direct measurements of the TOFs as a solution of a non-trivial inverse problem [4]. For the PGT technique, the higher the system time resolution, the higher the accuracy achieved on the determination of the particle range. We have already demonstrated that a Coincidence Time Resolution (CTR) between the beam monitor and TIARA of 235 ps FWHM allows a proton range accuracy of a few millimeters with a limited statistics of \sim107 protons, equivalent to an average irradiation spot in PT treatments[4, 5]. Here we describe the development and characterisation of the beam monitor we have conceived for this application. The monitor must have a time resolution well below the 235 ps FWHM targeted for the whole system CTR for single ions; a detection surface large enough to cover the section of a typical pencil beam (more than 1 cm FWHM at lower proton energies[6]); a nearly perfect detection efficiency; a good energy resolution to count incident protons (at least at low intensities). Moreover it must be capable of measuring the beam incident position with an accuracy of the order of the millimeter. Several proton beam monitors of this kind are under development. They are based on Ultra Fast Silicon Detectors (UFSD) (1.2 \times 1.2 mm2 and 50 µm thick) [7], small plastic scintillators (3 \times 3 \times 3 mm3) coupled to Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM) by optical fibres [8] and diamonds (9 \times 9 \times 0.5 mm3) [9, 10], but their limited size is not adapted to clinical beams. A large-area, high time resolution counter based on a plastic scintillator (60 \times 30 \times 5 mm3) read-out by SiPMs was proposed, instead by Cattaneo et al.[11]: they achieved a time resolution of 42 \pm 2 ps rms with electrons, which approximately deposit 1 MeV in the detector. The detector we have developed is also based on a fast plastic scintillator coupled to SiPMs and is position-sensitive. Its design is described in section II. It was recently tested on the two accelerators of the Centre Antoine Lacassagne (CAL) in Nice: the MEDICYC cyclotron provides 63 MeV protons within a bunch of 4 ns width delivered every 40 ns [12] and the IBA synchrocyclotron S2C2 (ProteusONE) provides protons with an energy ranging from 100 to 225 MeV within bunches of 16 ns period and 50% duty cycle [6]. Given the pulsed time structure of CAL accelerators, the overall CTR is a convolution of the intrinsic system CTR and the proton bunch width. Actually, at clinical intensities, where thousands of protons may be delivered within each bunch, it is impossible to identify the true proton-gamma coincidences and only the proton bunch can be tagged in time. Therefore, in order to fully exploit the potential of our detector, we propose to reduce the beam current to \sim1 proton/bunch during the first irradiation spot(s) [13]. This approach will allow to verify patient positioning as well as to assess the absence of anatomical modifications occurring before the treatment session with the highest accuracy. Preliminary experiments carried out at cyclotron, synchrotron and synchro-cyclotron facilities have shown that the implementation of this regime presents no technical barrier, but the use of a dedicated, high sensitivity beam detector as the one proposed is required to monitor the delivered dose and cope with beam intensity fluctuations at low fluxes. Notwithstanding, the TOF measurement of single protons of 100-200 MeV are especially challenging because of their limited ionisation capabilities. In this work, the beam monitor performance is thus evaluated at low beam intensities in terms of Detector Time Resolution (DTR), detection efficiency and spatial resolution (section III). Two identical prototypes were also used to determine the beam energy from particle TOF[14] (section IV)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07620v1,Investigation and optimization of the deconvolution method for PMT waveform reconstruction,"Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are extensively employed as photosensors in neutrino and dark matter detection. The precise charge and timing information extracted from the PMT waveform plays a crucial role in energy and vertex reconstruction. In this study, we investigate the deconvolution algorithm utilized for PMT waveform reconstruction, while enhancing the timing separation ability for pile-up hits by redesigning filters based on the time-frequency uncertainty principle. This filter design sacrifices signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to achieve narrower pulse widths. Furthermore, we optimize the selection of signal pulses in the case of low SNR based on Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Monte Carlo data confirms that our optimization yields enhanced reconstruction performance: improving timing separation ability for pile-up hits from \sim10 ns to 3\sim 5 ns, while controlling residual nonlinearity of charge reconstruction within 1%.","Neutrino and dark matter experiments widely use PMT as the detection unit [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In order to carry out accurate physical measurements, high-precision energy and vertex reconstruction is indispensable, and they are mainly obtained using accurate PMT charge and hit time information [9, 10, 11, 12]. For example, accurate spectral measurements helped the Daya Bay experiment to study the anomaly (“5-MeV bump”) in the reactor neutrino spectrum [13]. To extract charge and hit time information from PMT waveforms, various commonly used methods have been developed, including simple charge integral method, CR-(RC)4 method, waveform fitting method, and PMT waveform reconstruction methods based on the deconvolution technique [14] or machine learning [15]. The performance and characteristics of several PMT waveform reconstruction methods were summarized in [14]. The simple charge integral and CR-(RC)4 methods are fast and robust. However, in the case of PMT waveforms that exhibit overshoot and reflection components due to impedance mismatch in the coupled circuit, the reconstructed charge may be underestimated. This resulting charge nonlinearity poses a challenge for precision energy reconstruction and physical measurements. Additionally, the capability to separate pile-up hits is limited to approximately 20 ns to 40 ns. The deconvolution method was first proposed in the Daya Bay experiment for PMT waveform reconstruction and direct measurement of electronics nonlinearity [16], and it has been further applied in experiments such as JUNO [17, 18]. With the deconvolution method, the overshoot was naturally handled, overlapping hits were better separated, and the peak’s integral was the number of photoelectrons (PEs). In recent years, the advancement of storage and computational resources has prompted an increased demand for PMT waveform analysis in neutrino and dark matter experiments. (1) The smearing effect of the PMT charge needs to be improved. For example, the JUNO experiment aims to conduct a precise measurement of energy spectrum derived from reactor neutrinos in order to determine the mass ordering of neutrinos, and the energy resolution is one of the key technical parameters to achieve this goal [19]. A machine-learning-based PE counting method was proposed to directly predict the number of PEs from PMT waveforms, it can partially mitigate the impact of PMT charge resolution on energy reconstruction and ultimately leading to improved energy resolution [15]. (2) The PMT waveform reconstruction method needs to be applicable for a large dynamic range of several PEs to hundreds of PEs. (3) For the capability to separate pile-up hits, there is still a great potential for improvements. This improvements are expected to be advantageous for particle identification research which utilizes the charge and hit time of each PE. In this paper, we propose an enhanced deconvolution method for PMT waveform reconstruction. The enhanced method improves the noise filter and optimizes the selection of signal pulses through STFT. As a result, PMT hits separated by more than 3\sim 5 ns can be discriminated, and the residual nonlinearity of charge reconstruction is less than 1%. In the rest of the paper, the details of our work will be presented as follows: First, Sec. 2 introduces the simulation samples of PMT waveform used in this paper. Then, we review the deconvolution method in Sec. 3. Subsequently, an investigation will be conducted in Sec. 4.1 to explore the influential factors affecting the separation of pile-up hits. In Sec. 4.2, optimization and performance of the deconvolution algorithm will be shown. Finally, a summary will be provided in Sec. 5"
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07270v1,Sensorless Measurement of Solenoid Stroke and Temperature using Convolution Neural Network with Two Points of PWM Driving Current,"In this paper, we describe the algorithm to measure the stroke and the temperature of solenoid using PWM driving current at two points based on the electric characteristics of the solenoid with CNN, without mechanical attachments. We describe the evaluation experimental results of the stroke and the temperature prediction. We also describe the preliminary experimental results of controlling the solenoid stroke at intermediate position.","Solenoid is the actuator composed of the coil and the plunger. Solenoid is used to push or pull the object, and the stroke is controlled in two states; ON and OFF, in usual cases. From the viewpoint of electrical characteristics of the solenoid, its inductance changes according to the plunger position, and we can measure the plunger position using the electrical characteristics of the solenoid. We’ve already reported the method of measuring the solenoid stroke (plunger’s position) by using electric characteristics, without mechanical attachments[1]. However, it has restrictions on the target solenoid’s electric characteristics, and the solenoid where it can be applied. In this paper, we propose to method to measure the stroke and the temperature of the solenoid using convolution neural network (CNN) for two measured values of driving current, as well as its evaluation on the accuracy. We also describe the preliminary experimental results of the plunger’s position control without mechanical attachments."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07709v1,"FELIX-MROD, a FELIX-based data acquisition system for the ATLAS Muon Drift Tubes","The ATLAS Muon Drift Tube (MDT) ReadOut Drivers (MROD), 204 VME modules that are an essential part of the readout chain of the 1,150 MDT chambers, have been in operation for more than 15 years and are expected to remain in operation until about 2026. In the event of extensive failures the number of spare MROD modules may be insufficient. However, deployment of an adapted version of the Front-End LInk eXchange (FELIX) system, a new component of the ATLAS data acquisition (DAQ) infrastructure, may overcome potential MROD failures. This paper describes the design, functionality and performance of this adapted version, referred to as FELIX-MROD, and the test results of its integration into the ATLAS DAQ system","This document describes the FELIX-MROD data acquisition (DAQ) system for ATLAS Muon Drift Tube (MDT) chambers [1]. FELIX-MROD, that is based on the Front-End LInk eXchange (FELIX) [2] and SoftWare ROD (SWROD) [3] systems, provides an alternative to the legacy readout architecture used in ATLAS since Run 1. This document is organised as follows. The remainder of this section reviews the current MDT readout chain and introduces the main components of the FELIX-MROD project. Section 2 describes the MDT ReadOut Driver (MROD) functionality and data structures. Section 3 is dedicated to the FELIX-MROD firmware, Section 4 to the FELIX-MROD software. Sections 5 and 6 report on the testing of FELIX-MROD in various test setups. Conclusions are drawn in Section 7. 1.1 MROD: legacy readout of ATLAS Muon Drift Tube chambers The MDT chambers are the main component of the precision tracking system in the ATLAS muon spectrometer [1]. An MDT chamber consists of assemblies of drift tubes of diameter 29.97\text{\,}\mathrm{m}\mathrm{m} filled with \text{Ar/CO}_{2}. The electrical signals generated by ionising particles crossing the tubes, are routed to on-detector mezzanines once decoupled from high continuous voltage. Each mezzanine can serve up to 24 drift tubes and is equipped with three custom-designed monolithic Amplifier/Shaper/Discriminator (ASD) chips and one Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) chip [4]. The ASD transforms the raw input from a tube into a pulse whose length is proportional to the charge. The TDC digitizes the ASD signals and associates them to a Level-1 accept signal (L1A) coming from the ATLAS trigger system: buffered hits are associated to a L1A signal according to a configurable time window. TDC output signals are transmitted via twisted pair cables to Chamber Service Modules (CSMs). A CSM [4] is a board that incorporates one FPGA, one optical receiver for ATLAS trigger, timing, and control (TTC) signals, one gigabit optical encoder chip and a VCSEL laser diode optical transmitter. One CSM can serve up 18 TDCs and acts as a multiplexer that serialises the electric TDC data streams into a single optical stream run over a Gigabit Optical Link (GOL) [5]. The multiplexer operates as a simple rotating multiplexer that is continuously checking each input TDC link for data present. In addition, a CSM receives and delivers the TTC signals to all the mezzanines. The CSM board also interfaces to an Embedded Local Monitor Board (ELMB) [6], in the form of a so-called MDT-DCS module (MDM), used to communicate with the ATLAS Detector Control System via CAN Bus. A GOL link connects a CSM to an MDT ReadOut Driver (MROD) hosted in a counting room (called USA15) next to the experimental cavern. The GOL runs at 2 Gbit/s, using a low-level protocol in which 32-bit words are sent in a fixed length cycle of at maximum 21 8B/10B coded words. The first word is a cycle start word (“Separator word”) that has a fixed bit pattern (0xd0000000 before 8B/10B coding). The Separator word is required to identify the data of the first TDC (number 0). It is followed by 18 words, one for each TDC. These cycles continue until all of the TDCs have delivered their data to the CSM. Each of these words is either a word coming from the TDC or an “Empty word” indicating that the TDC has no more data. The last two words in the cycle are encoded as 8B/10B comma patterns (IDLE words) to ensure the byte and 32-bit word alignment of the data on the optical link. An MROD [7, 4] is a 9U VME module whose task is building event fragments from the incoming time division multiplexed sequences sent by the CSMs, reporting and correcting errors in the data and reducing the data size. One MROD module can receive the data streams from up to six CSMs, is interfaced to the TTC system and the output is transferred via a ReadOut Link implemented as an S-Link [8]. On the other end, the S-Link is connected to the ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) System. More specifically, the S-Link is connected to a RobinNP PCIe board hosted on a ReadOut System (ROS) server [9, 10]. The RobinNPs and therefore also the ROS servers are not detector specific. The task of a ROS server is to aggregate data coming from up to 24 S-Links and transmit that data on demand to the High Level Trigger (HLT) via commercial 10 Gigabit Ethernet links. A sketch of this legacy readout architecture is shown in the left part of Figure 1. MROD modules have originally been produced and installed in 2006. By the end of Run 3, now expected for 2026, most modules will have been in continuous operation for twenty years. It is difficult to estimate the lifespan of an MROD module. So far, of 204 MROD modules, 26 had to be replaced and at the end of 2022 the number of MROD spares was 21. In case of extensive failures, or damage to an entire crate or rack, the number of spare modules might be insufficient. New modules cannot be produced due to the obsolescence of components and a different solution would be necessary. In such exceptional case, FELIX-MROD could be deployed. FELIX-MROD makes use of the two new components of the recently upgraded ATLAS DAQ system: FELIX and SoftWare ROD (SWROD). 1.2 Readout architecture based on FELIX and SWROD During the second long shutdown (LS2), the ATLAS detector was upgraded with new sub-detectors (NSW, BIS7/8) and an improved TDAQ system [11]. The trigger system was enhanced by increasing the readout granularity of the Liquid Argon (LAr) calorimeter and including feature extractors that target specific objects. The DAQ system was also upgraded with new components, the new FELIX and SWROD, in order to support the new sub-detector and trigger systems [12]. A FELIX unit consists of one server equipped with a multi-Gigabit Ethernet adapter and one or two custom PCIe cards, called FLX-712, suitable for all sub-detectors. A single FLX-712 card can serve up to 48 channels (thus corresponding to 8 MRODs) and can handle messages from the L1 trigger. FELIX acts only as a router that forwards incoming data, without any alteration, to the SWROD units over an Ethernet network. A SWROD unit, equipped with a dedicated plug-in application to deal with CSM data, consists of a commodity server running software that performs data processing and aggregation. SWROD servers are interfaced with HLT and provide it with data information on demand, similarly to what is done by the ROS component of the legacy architecture. As shown in Figure 1, the only custom component in the FELIX-MROD architecture is in fact the FELIX PCIe card, universal for all the detector systems. Having decoupled the data transport and processing, and making use of industry standard data networks earlier in the readout chain, the new architecture is also more modular and flexible and has a much lower hardware and firmware development and maintenance cost than the legacy one. During Run 3, ATLAS uses 60 FELIX servers, 96 FELIX cards and 30 SWROD servers. In the High-Luminosity phase of LHC, FELIX will be adopted by all ATLAS sub-detectors.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07313v1,Quantum Metrology for Gravitational Wave Astronomy,"Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity predicts that accelerating mass distributions produce gravitational radiation, analogous to electromagnetic radiation from accelerating charges. These gravitational waves have not been directly detected to date, but are expected to open a new window to the Universe in the near future. Suitable telescopes are kilometre-scale laser interferometers measuring the distance between quasi free-falling mirrors. Recent advances in quantum metrology may now provide the required sensitivity boost. So-called squeezed light is able to quantum entangle the high-power laser fields in the interferometer arms, and could play a key role in the realization of gravitational wave astronomy.","I Gravitational waves Gravitational waves are ripples in space-time, i.e. dynamic changes in space curvature that propagate at the speed of light. According to GR they are transverse and quadrupolar in nature, have two polarization states, and are extremely weak. GWs of detectable amplitude cannot be generated on Earth, but a variety of known astrophysical and cosmological sources are predicted to emit gravitational radiation that should reach the Earth with a strength within reach SSc09 ; GWICweb . Whilst GWs have not yet been directly observed their existence is beyond doubt. A binary system of compact objects, such as neutron stars (as depicted in Figure 1) or black holes, emit GWs at twice their orbital frequency . The energy carried away by the GWs leads to a precisely predictable decay in the orbital period of the binary. Hulse and Taylor verified this mechanism for orbital decay to exquisite precision with observations of the binary pulsar system PSR1913+16, WTa05 . Their discovery is regarded as unequivocal, albeit indirect, proof of the existence of GWs that led to the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics. GWs from complex astrophysical sources carry a plethora of information that will have a major impact on gravitational physics, astrophysics and cosmology. GW signals are typically distinguished in one of four broad and often overlapping classes SSc09 ; GWICweb , based on expected waveforms, and hence optimal search techniques. They are: binary inspirals and mergers, burst sources, periodic sources, and stochastic sources. In the following we briefly review the physics and astrophysics that can be extracted from the observation of GWs emitted by these sources. Binary inspirals and mergers The final stages of life of neutron star binaries will provide the richest signals, see Fig. 1. As the binary loses energy, the orbital period decreases and enters the human audio frequency band. After another \approx 100 cycles the stars merge in a catastrophic explosion providing a GW burst signal of a few hundred Hertz up to a kiloHertz. The merger is expected to produce a black hole surrounded by a torus which will release a giant burst of gamma rays. Simultaneous observation of GWs and gamma rays would confirm that the merger of neutron stars is the engine of many of the observed short, hard gamma ray bursts AbbottETAL08a . Recent advances in numerical relativity now make it possible to make predictions of the waveforms generated around the merger BGR08 . Comparison with observed waveforms will provide accurate tests of GR in the hitherto untested strong-field regime. The imprint of tidal distortions on the GW waveform from a binary system with at least one neutron star will constrain the equation of state of the nuclear matter making up the star. Independent of the nature of the binary, the final state of the merger will be a perturbed black hole, whose oscillation modes will decay in time producing more gravitational radiation. Such observations offer a striking confirmation of the existence of black holes. The famous “no-hair” theorem says that black holes are completely characterized by their mass and angular momentum Chandrasekhar98 . Measuring the GWs emitted by black hole binary systems where the mass ratio of the components is large, the “no-hair” theorem can be tested. Direct observation of the gravitational waveforms from inspiralling black holes and neutron stars can also provide the luminosity distance to the source without any complex calibrations SSc09 . If, in addition, the redshift can be measured (via the identification of electro-magnetic counterparts), the Hubble parameter Sch86 , the dark energy and dark matter content of the Universe and the dark energy equation of state can be determined. Figure 2: Gravitational waves GWs are dynamical deformations of space-time perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. As a result, distances between free-falling test masses in a transverse plane will change with a strain h=\Delta L/L with quantities defined as shown. For a black hole or neutron star binary system with orbital frequency f_{\rm{BS}} distances will oscillate at twice that frequency f=f_{\rm{BS}}. The wavelength of this oscillation is given by \lambda=c/f with c the speed of light. Burst sources Burst sources refer to short-lived GW transients, the main known candidates being core-collapse supernovae and collapses to black holes DFM01 ; BRe06 . Observation of GWs will open a way to extract information about the dynamics occurring in the core of the supernova, and should complement and enhance the understanding gained from electromagnetic observations. Periodic sources Spinning compact objects will generate periodic GW signals depending on the degree of non-axisymmetric deformations OGu69 (departure from rotational symmetry is a necessary ingredient for generation of quadrupolar moments). Detection of GWs from such sources will confirm models of the underlying physics which might allow the growth of a “mountain” on a neutron star. The lack of observation of GWs from the Crab Pulsar at the sensitivity of current ground based detectors has already constrained its deviation from rotational symmetry AbbottETAL08a . The distribution of neutron stars in the Galaxy could be mapped out using GW observations. Spinning neutron stars currently invisible on Earth could be detected via their GW emission Abb09 . Stochastic sources Stochastic sources have both astrophysical and cosmological origins Peebles93 ; Mag00 . The “holy grail” is the Big Bang itself. In principle, we should be able to observe a relic background of GWs from the very early Universe, some time between 10-18 seconds and 10-9 seconds after the Big Bang, when light did not even exist. The electromagnetic analogue of this radiation is the cosmic microwave background, which gives information about conditions in the Universe 385,000 years after the Big Bang BenETAL03 ; SpeETAL03 . Gravitational radiation is the only way to observe the conditions in a much earlier epoch. Absence of a detectable stochastic background signal in current GW detectors has constrained certain models of the early Universe based on cosmic superstring population LIGO-Nat09 . Of course the most tantalizing sources are those we do not yet know exist. The opening of every major new electro-magnetic window to the Universe has revealed major surprises that have revolutionized our understanding of the Universe. Observing the Universe with an entirely new messenger will very likely continue this tradition. Frequencies of GWs GW astronomy targets phenomena that involve astronomically large masses in acceleration. This, in turn, leads to the expectation that GW emission frequencies will be low, typically below a few tens of kiloHertz. A black hole binary system, for example, has to have an orbital period of just 0.02 s in order to produce GWs at f=100 Hz (Fig. 2). Supernova explosions are expected to have a broad spectral emission, with components that may reach kiloHertz frequencies. However, the strongest detectable GWs are expected at lower frequencies, all the way down to the millihertz or even nanohertz regime. Strength of GWs Gravitational waves that reach the Earth are extremely weak. For example, the merger of two neutron stars at the other end of our galaxy (D\approx 50,000 light years away) would produce a GW strain amplitude of about h\approx 10^{-19} SSc09 . The same source at the distance of about 60 million light years, where the Virgo cluster which comprises up to 2000 Galaxies are located, would result in a corresponding strain amplitude of only h\approx 10^{-22}. With the sophisticated technology now available, such tiny strains of space-time can be detected and it is very probable that there will be numerous direct detections in the coming decade."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07197v1,MEOP based He polarization and injection system for experiments below 1K,"Metastability exchange optical pumping (MEOP) is a widely used technique for producing polarized 3He. In connection with an experiment to search for the electric dipole moment of the neutron (nEDM) we have built a MEOP based 3He polarization and injection system to prepare 80 % polarized 3He at room temperature which will be injected into a 400 mK measurement cell filled with superfluid 4He. We describe the polarization and injection system, which is designed to allow for final concentrations of 10^{-8}-10^{-10} of 80 % polarized 3He in the superfluid filled measurement cell. Only \approx 0.72\% polarization loss due to gradients is expected during injection","One of the most common ways of polarizing 3He is metastability exchange optical pumping (MEOP). In MEOP, an RF discharge is used to excite 3He atoms into a metastable state which can be polarized via optical pumping by a laser. This polarization is then transferred to ground state atoms through metastability-exchange collisions. MEOP is typically performed at pressures around 1\text{\,}\mathrm{mbar}. See [1] for a general review of 3He optical pumping methods such as MEOP. The polarized 3He produced by MEOP has applications in a variety of fields from medical magnetic resonance imaging to axion searches [1]. In a high precision neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) searches polarized 3He found its use in magnetometers [2, 3]. In nEDM experiments co-magnetometry is used to understand the field gradients in the measurement cell and correct a Larmor precession signal for the magnetic field instabilities [4]. Mentioned above magnetometers operate at room temperature. A low temperature polarized 3He magnetometer has been used to measure the field gradients inside cryostats [5]. MEOP has additionally been used in NMR studies of the spin dynamics of liquid 3He–4He mixtures as well as pure 3He. The work of [6] involves a room temperature 3He polarization cell connected to a loop that goes down to a temperature below 1\text{\,}\mathrm{K} which is partially filled with a 3He–4He mixture. A heater is used to drive the circulation 3He keeping a constant concentration of 3He in the 4He (a few percent) while the cell maintains 3He polarization. A similar method was used in [7] where a room temperature cell is connected to a 1\text{\,}\mathrm{K} NMR cell and the concentration of 3He is controlled using a mass flow controller. This system is capable of maintaining polarized 3He concentrations of a 1-5 %. Injection methods of delivering room temperature polarized 3He produced via MEOP into a sub 1\text{\,}\mathrm{K} measurement cell for NMR studies have also been achieved. In [8][9] a closed pure 3He (or mixed 3He–4He) system connecting room temperature polarization cell and a measurement cell submerged in a liquid 3He bath is used. Cooling the 3He bath from 1.5\text{\,}\mathrm{K} to 400\text{\,}\mathrm{mK} condenses the 3He into the measurement cell. The 3He polarization delivered to the measurement cell was 50\text{\,}\mathrm{\char 37\relax} or less. While [10] describes a system where 3He is polarized at room temperature, the injected into a cell filled with liquid 3He. This system can achieved a minimum concentration of approximately 10^{-4}, with polarization estimated to be 10%. The minimum concentration is set by pressure of the polarization cell needed for MEOP, volume of the superfluid filled measurement cell. The entire experiment is enclosed in a uniform holding field. Additionally, low temperature NMR of polarized 3He is used in the nEDM experiment design described in [11]. This experiment utilizes a cryogenic 3He co-magnetometer diluted in superfluid liquid 4He at temperatures below 500\text{\,}\mathrm{mK}. In this design the co-magnetometer doubles as a detection mechanism for the neutron spin precession. An apparatus to measure the nEDM using a cryogenic environment of polarized 3He and neutrons in superfluid 4He is described in [12]. The described experiment aims at an unprecedented ultimate statistical uncertainty of 3\text{\times}{10}^{-28}. As part of this proposal a Systematic and Operations Studies (SOS) apparatus is being developed at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL). This apparatus is a scaled down version of the main experiment apparatus without the high voltage systems needed to measure an EDM. The main design goal of SOS apparatus is to allow precise and effective spin manipulation of both polarized 3He and neutrons in a highly homogeneous weak magnetic field of 3\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro T} using NMR. Such apparatus will allow us to verify the experimental techniques required for the proposed nEDM measurement and to study different phase shifting systematic effects. MEOP technique will be used to produce the polarized 3He for the SOS. 1.1 Overview of the MEOP assembly design The MEOP based 3He polarization system of SOS apparatus is designed to be capable of producing 80\text{\,}\mathrm{\char 37\relax} polarized 3He at room temperature and delivering the polarized gas into a superfluid filled measurement cell of the SOS apparatus at temperature range of 0.3\text{\,}\mathrm{K} – 0.5\text{\,}\mathrm{K} and a wide range of relative concentrations from {10}^{-8} to {10}^{-10}. The entire MEOP assembly is enclosed inside a cosine theta holding field magnetic coil. The present publication describes in detail design and testing of the gas handling system and 3He friendliness of the pneumatic valves (Sections 2 and 3); as well as the design and results of field mapping of the magnetic coil (Section 4). Injection of polarized 3He into the superfluid helium and procedures for preserving polarization during injection are described in Section 5. This system is unique in that we can achieve ultra low concentrations where the dynamics of the 3He is completely governed by interactions with the phonons. At the higher concentrations studied in [10] and others 3He–3He interactions are relevant. Additionally, the work in [10] was limited to low polarization, while the work described in [8, 9] was limited to polarizations up to 50\text{\,}\mathrm{\char 37\relax}. Due to the low concentrations being studied at the SOS the NMR signal will be comparatively quite small and it will be critical to have has high as concentration as possible to maximize our signal to noise. The design of this apparatus presents us with the unique challenge of a developing high polarization (80\text{\,}\mathrm{\char 37\relax}) room temperature polarization system capable of delivering ultra low concentrations of 3He (10^{-10}) into a superfluid measurement cell with minimal loss of polarization during injection. To achieve these goals three ""dilution volumes"" can be used to reduce the amount of 3He injected into the measurement cell. This allows measurements at the 10^{-8}, 10^{-9}, and 10^{-10} concentration level in the 3\text{\,}\mathrm{L} measurement cell. 3\times 10^{-10} will be 3He concentration in the proposed nEDM experiment. Additionally, the system is designed so that after polarization the 3He can be pressured with 4He preventing depolarization between dilution stages and injection. Finally, the gas handling system and holding field used for polarizing the gas is designed to allow for T_{1}>1000 s in the MEOP cell. Figure 1: Model of MEOP coil, manifold, dilution volumes, and laser optics. The main body of the coil is rendered invisible to make manifold visible. Only the top and bottom of the coil are visible. Figure 1 shows a model of the room temperature polarization and injection system as well as the optical pumping laser optics, polarimeter, and top and bottom end caps of the holding field coil that encloses it. The main body of the coil is not shown so that the manifold is visible. The laser is a 1083 nm CYFL-GIGA series Ytterbium-doped fiber laser. The polarimeter operates by measuring the circular polarization of the 668 nm fluorescence light from the polarization cell."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06977v1,Exploring Scintillators and Cherenkov Radiators for MIP Timing Detectors,"This article presents the timing performance of materials with fast light emission, tested as Minimum Ionizing Particle detectors using 150 GeV hadron beams in Monte Carlo simulations and at the CERN SPS North Area. Pixels of cross-section 2 \times 2 mm2 or 3 \times 3 mm2 and length of 3 or 10 mm were coupled to Hamamatsu SiPM and read out by fast high-frequency electronics. Materials whose timing performance relies on Cherenkov emission, namely BGSO, PWO, and PbF2, achieved time resolutions in the range 24-36 ps. Scintillators as L(Y)SO:Ce, GAGG, and BaF2 reached below 15 ps, the best topping at 12.1 \pm 0.4 ps. These fast materials are compared to LYSO and their additional benefit is discussed. Given the promising results of \ceBaF2, the study is completed with measurements of the scintillation properties of a set doped with yttrium to quench the slow light emission.","Timing is going to be crucial for particle detection at future high energy physics experiments [1, 2]. Precise physics measurements require larger datasets and colliders must run at higher instantaneous luminosity to provide them. The consequent density of tracks and pile-up of events will pose a difficult challenge to the reconstruction algorithms, which will suffer from combinatorial background. Time acts as an additional dimension to mitigate the challenges of increased luminosity and disentangle the multitude of hits in the subdetectors, assigning them to the correct track. The precision required is normally a few tens of picoseconds [3, 4, 5, 6]; therefore, the community is exploring solutions to integrate the time information into future detectors, be it in the calorimeter [7] or through ad hoc timing layer for minimum ionizing particles (MIP) [8]. This article focuses on the latter. R&D is ongoing to investigate new materials and processes capable of fulfilling the demand for fast detectors both in medical imaging and high energy physics applications [9]. The possibility to approach a precision of a few tens of picoseconds was already demonstrated using fast inorganic scintillators – e.g. L(Y)SO and aluminium garnet crystals – coupled to silicon photomultiplier devices (SiPMs) [10, 11, 12]. This work studies the timing capabilities of attractive novel materials coupled to SiPMs under 150 GeV pion irradiation at SPS proton accelerator facility at CERN. Sec. 3 and 5 investigate multiple light-emission processes via testbeam and Monte Carlo simulations, including scintillation, Cherenkov emission, and cross-luminescence. Fast amplifiers based on state-of-the-art high-frequency electronics were employed [13]. Moreover, we explore the effect of time-walk for different materials and the relation between time resolution and scintillation characteristics. Finally, given the promising performance of the cross-luminescent BaF2 , we dedicate Sec. 6 to the laboratory characterisation of a set of \ceBaF2 with various yttrium doping, measuring their time and scintillation characteristics."

This system-level testing of the all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk) pixel detector for the ATLAS experiment at CERN’s HL-LHC encompasses a wide array of system components, which is essential for managing the increased luminosity and radiation levels expected at HL-LHC, thereby enhancing tracking performance. Utilizing advanced silicon sensor technologies, serial powering, and lightweight carbon fiber structures, the demonstrator and assembled components on the support structure will undergo several studies for verification and commissioning. Extensive tests on serial powering, monitoring, and data acquisition were conducted, ensuring the system’s robustness and reliability for future high-energy physics experiments. Additionally, three different sub-components will be introduced for the novel ITk pixel detector, specifically designed for the outer barrel (OB), outer end caps (OEC), and inner system (IS) sections.","The integrated luminosity of the LHC will be increased tenfold over its original design threshold, for the transition into the High Luminosity-LHC (HL-LHC) [1]. This will significantly increase the LHC collision reach, leading to higher detector occupancy and accelerated radiation damage. To address these challenges, the current detectors must be replaced and upgraded to cope with the new requirements and demands of the HL-LHC, with faster readout detectors, and with higher granularity. Specifically, the ATLAS experiment will upgrade its Inner Detector (ID) to a new all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk) system [2]. The ITk comprises of a four-layer strip detector with planar sensors and a five-layer hybrid pixel detector which is the focus of our paper, covering approximately 13m² and featuring around 10,000 hybrid modules. The inner layer are equipped with 3D sensors, while planar sensors are deployed on the outer layers. This new design promises enhanced performance but also presents complex operational demands, requiring extensive system testing and integration studies to mitigate the system complexities. Three demonstrator systems are under development as proof-of-concept platforms to validate the full ITk pixel detector production workflow. These demonstrators integrate key subsystems, including silicon sensors with RD53A quad modules, on- and off-detector services, multi-module readout, signal aggregation, optical conversion over a 65m fiber and trunk system, and operation of detector control systems. This paper presents the pixel system, which interfaces the complete detector system, covering on- and off-detector services, data transmission, DAQ/DCS, integration, common electronics, and module-based RD53A quads."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05319v2,Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation,"Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a {}^{87}\mathrm{Rb}-{}^{129}\mathrm{Xe} cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of 0.2\pm 0.1\muHz/pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.","Atomic sensors based on spin polarised ensembles have long been used for precision measurement. This includes measurements of magnetic fields, rotation, tests of fundamental physics [1, 2, 3], medical imaging [4] and device characterisation [5]. In all these applications, an alkali species is optically pumped to polarise the spin. The precession of this ensemble can then be measured with an optical probe. The large gyromagnetic ratio of alkali species means that alkali ensembles are particularly excellent sensors of magnetic fields. Indeed, modern atomic magnetometers based on spin polarised alkali atoms reach state of the art sensitivity, comparable to to Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) [6, 7]. An advantage over SQUIDs is that atomic magnetometers do not require cryogenic cooling, enabling cheaper and wider deployment in applications like magnetoencephalography [4]. The highest sensitivity atomic magnetometers rely on the Spin-Exchange Relaxation-Free (SERF) regime [8], which requires operating in a low-field environment. It has also been shown that full 3-axis readout is possible with SERF magnetometers via the application of magnetic field modulations [9, 10]. Atomic gyroscopes on the other hand, promise sensitivity comparable to the best optical systems, but with smaller volumes and lower power consumption. The gyromagnetic ratio of alkali atoms is problematic here though: they respond much more strongly to magnetic fields than any other effect. The best known method to improve non-magnetic sensing in these systems is to introduce a noble-gas with a long-lived nuclear spin into the same cell to make a ‘comagnetometer’ [11, 12]. Optical pumping of the alkali electron spin polarisation, \mathbf{P^{e}}, pumps the noble gas nuclear spin polarisation, \mathbf{P^{n}}, via spin-exchanging collisions. The polarised noble gas has three important properties. First, the gyromagnetic ratio is up to 1000 times smaller than that of alkali atoms, so it has a much smaller response to magnetic noise. Second, due to the much (>10^{4}\times) higher number density of the noble gas, the effective magnetisation of \mathbf{P^{n}} is typically much stronger than that of \mathbf{P^{e}}. Third, the coherence- and life-times of \mathbf{P^{n}} (seconds to hours) are much longer than those of \mathbf{P^{e}} (\simms). This combination of properties mean that \mathbf{P^{n}} will provide a strong, stable polarisation that is less sensitive to magnetic fields and thus better suited to sensing non-magnetic effects. What it lacks, however, is a suitable optical transition that allows direct measurement of \mathbf{P^{n}}. In a comagnetometer, we use the fact that \mathbf{P^{n}} provides strong magnetic driving of \mathbf{P^{e}}. Provided external magnetic noise can be sufficiently suppressed, an optical measurement of \mathbf{P^{e}} may provide a precise readout of \mathbf{P^{n}}. To distinguish the target signal from external magnetic noise, a common method is the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) gyroscope which uses two noble gas species with different nuclear gyromagnetic ratios [13]. The two species make nominally independent measurements of the effective magnetic fields they see, and a discrepancy in the measurements reveals the rotation rate. The role of the alkali atoms in this scheme is to pump the noble gas species and measure their dynamics, via the magnetic interaction between \mathbf{P^{n}} and \mathbf{P^{e}}. Recent work has also shown that modulation of the pump and applied bias field in NMR systems may be useful for reducing technical noise [14, 15]. The alkali in an NMR gyroscope does not work in the SERF regime, however, so spin relaxation noise limits how well an alkali species can measure the precession of the noble gas. To partly mitigate spin relaxation, pump pulses with alternating polarisation [16] and magnetic pulses [17] have shown promise. The scheme that we have developed is most closely related to the ‘self-compensated comagnetometer’ (SCC) [11, 12, 18] where co-magnetometry is between a single noble gas species and the alkali itself. In the SCC, a magnetic bias field is applied along the pump axis. The bias is tuned to precisely counteract the combined magnetisation of the alkali and noble gas spins in the cell. Under these conditions it will also be the case that the Larmor frequencies of the alkali and noble gas will be near-equal so the ensembles are strongly coupled. Under these conditions it can be shown that low frequency magnetic noise drives \mathbf{P^{n}} in a way that leads to cancellation of the external field, so that magnetic noise on \mathbf{P^{e}} is suppressed. Non-magnetic influences such as rotation, on the other hand, will not be suppressed and can even be enhanced by the strong coupling between species. A significant advantage of the SCC is that it can use high density alkali in the SERF regime, improving the sensitivity of the readout. This technique has been instrumental in setting new limits in various anomalous physics searches, including searches for a 5th force [19], violations of Lorentz invariance [18] and dark matter [20, 21, 22]. The gyroscopic performance of the SCC has shown excellent levels of sensitivity. For example Kornack et al. [12] found a noise floor \mathrm{5\!\times\!10^{-7}\,rad\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1/2}}, which was recently surpassed by Wei et al. [23] with \mathrm{3\!\times\!10^{-8}\,rad\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1/2}}. While impressive, these results are still over an order of magnitude above the atomic shot noise limit set by the alkali, and particularly limited at low frequencies where magnetic noise is typically largest. While some progress has been made reducing magnetic and other technical noise sources [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], a remaining challenge is that increased suppression of magnetic noise is not only hard to achieve, it is also difficult to maintain this suppression due to drifts in the operating point. In this work, we introduce a Perturbed Alkali-Noble Comagnetometer (PANCo) scheme. It may may be considered an evolution of a SCC, although self-compensation is no longer required. Figure 1: a) The essential components of the new scheme. A gas cell containing a mixture of noble gas and alkali metal is periodically pumped by strong laser pulses along the z-axis. This pumping creates a strong average alkali polarisation along z, which in turn also polarises the noble gas via spin exchanging collisions. A probe beam along the x-axis reads out the x component of the alkali spin. A perturbation of the system by a magnetic field or rotation means that the noble gas polarisation is tilted away from the z-axis. In this case, after excitation with the pump pulse, the alkali polarisation will precess around the total magnetic field in the cell, that will be a combination of the noble gas magnetisation, any external fields and the bias field applied along the z-axis. This leads to a signal on the polarimeter to be analysed. b) The pulse sequence used in our scheme. The \pi/2 magnetic pulses rotate the noble gas polarisation around the z-axis with alternating phase, causing any deviation of the noble gas away from z will cause a modulated field seen by the alkali. The optical pump pulses polarise the alkali atoms along the z axis. The precession of the alkali atoms is measured in the the intervals between pulses. The essential changes are the use of synchronous optical pump and magnetic pulses along the z-axis, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The magnetic pulses perturb \mathbf{P^{n}}, yet largely preserve its long-term average evolution. However the magnetic pulses do not affect \mathbf{P^{e}} as it is reset at the start of each measurement cycle by the optical pump. We will show that the controlled perturbation of \mathbf{P^{n}} enables our scheme to separate the influence of magnetic and non-magnetic driving. Meanwhile the pulsed optical pump and readout of each period of free precession of \mathbf{P^{e}} reduces the impact of laser intensity noise and means that we also gain sensitivity along the two axis perpendicular to the pump [26, 27]. The net result is that our scheme provides four output channels consisting of two rotational and two magnetic signals along axes perpendicular to the pump. We note that pulsed pumping [26, 27] and magnetic modulation [30, 28, 31] have been used previously to achieve dual-axis readout of rotations. Our work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first that combines dual-axis magnetic and rotational readout in a comagnetometer device. By transforming magnetic fields from a noise source into a distinguishable signal, the scheme can further reduce contamination of the rotation signal by magnetic noise. Our scheme also works over a wide range of bias field values, not just at the self-compensation point. The pulsed readout of the system also allows monitoring and suppression of other noise sources [26, 27], such as pointing error."
