https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10125v1,Energy-GNoME: A Living Database of Selected Materials for Energy Applications,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) in materials science is driving significant advancements in the discovery of advanced materials for energy applications. The recent GNoME protocol identifies over 380,000 novel stable crystals. From this, we identify over 33,000 materials with potential as energy materials forming the Energy-GNoME database. Leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) tools, our protocol mitigates cross-domain data bias using feature spaces to identify potential candidates for thermoelectric materials, novel battery cathodes, and novel perovskites. Classifiers with both structural and compositional features identify domains of applicability, where we expect enhanced accuracy of the regressors. Such regressors are trained to predict key materials properties like, thermoelectric figure of merit (zT), band gap (E_{\mathrm{g}}), and cathode voltage (\Delta V_{\mathrm{c}}). This method significantly narrows the pool of potential candidates, serving as an efficient guide for experimental and computational chemistry investigations and accelerating the discovery of materials suited for electricity generation, energy storage and conversion.","The growing commitment to environmental sustainability and preservation has catalyzed a shift towards a green economy, emphasizing usage of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), decarbonization strategies, and sustainable resource management to ensure long-term ecological balance and economic resilience [1]. In this context, energy-related materials play a central role in driving the transition to a new, eco-friendly industrial paradigm. Materials for renewable energy conversion — such as perovskites for photovoltaic (PV) solar cells [2, 3], materials for efficient energy usage — such as thermoelectric [4, 5] materials, along with materials for energy storage devices — like cathode materials for batteries [6, 7, 8] — are the key to attenuate the intermittent nature of RES, unlocking the full potential of clean energy and achieving the overarching goal of minimizing our environmental footprint while shifting to a sustainable green economy [9, 10, 11]. Advancements in these fields are strictly correlated to the discovery of novel materials with enhanced properties. Most of these physical and chemical properties can be accurately determined by first principles methods based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) [12, 13] However, an exhaustive screening of such innovative materials with traditional strategies is to date impractical due to the high-dimensional composition spaces and the often unaffordable computational cost of DFT simulations. Furthermore, efforts in investigating hypothetical materials typically rely heavily on the intuition of the researcher for identifying promising candidates, as well as on heuristics with limited extrapolation capacities on unseen samples [14, 15, 16]. Despite these difficulties, the efforts required to address the task of materials discovery have been greatly reduced over the last years by the development of high-throughput platforms and of data-driven Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Indeed, in recent years, ML techniques have greatly impacted the way research [17, 18] and industry [19, 20, 21] approach to several applications, including those in the energy field [22, 23, 24]. Coupled with the creation of extensive materials databases such as Materials Project (MP) [25], the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) [26], the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) [27], NOMAD [28], and AFLOWLIB [29], these advanced tools have matured to unlock new potential in the materials discovery process [30, 31]. The combination of high-throughput computational methods and ML approaches has been successfully applied in recent research to predict novel materials and determine key properties, driving innovation in energy storage, generation, and conversion. Fanourgakis et al. [32] applied ML methodologies to screen a wide virtual space of hypothetical Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), introducing a universal strategy employing the “atom types” as the only descriptors to predict the MOFs’ adsorption capacities. A similar work was carried out by Trezza et al. [33]: the authors exploited ML regressors trained to predict MOFs’ adsorption capacities to establish a minimal set of important crystallographic features, and investigated the role of such “genetic code” when using Sequential Learning (SL) algorithms. Nandy et al. [14] exploited Natural Language Processing (NLP) procedures to leverage the available MOF literature, obtaining stability measures and thermal decomposition temperatures for structurally characterized MOFs. Furthermore, the authors trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to predict solvent removal stability and thermal stability. Cerqueira et al. [34] created a computational dataset for conventional, i.e. Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer, superconductors containing ab initio electron-phonon calculations, which was also used for training a ML model to identify superconducting compounds with a critical temperature T_{\mathrm{c}} greater than 5\text{\,}\mathrm{K}, taking as input features the compositional, structural, and ground-state properties. Moses et al. [35] leveraged data retrieved from the MP database to train deep Neural Network (DNN) models able to predict the change in volume and the average voltage of battery electrode materials during the charging and discharging processes. The authors also investigated the screening capabilities outside of the training dataset. Rutt et al. [36] applied a computational screening approach to identify promising multivalent cathodes, demonstrating the importance of evaluating both relative stability and ion mobility in materials not initially containing the working ion of interest. Here a high-throughput material exploration strategy was applied, in which the MP crystal candidates were iteratively defined in 4 steps, starting by screening the materials with relative stability above 0.2\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}\text{\,}{\mathrm{\text{atom}}}^{-1}, and selecting the crystals showing reducible potential with respect to Mg ions. The authors then proceeded with insertion site identification, and finally measured the migration path using approximate Nudged Elastic Band (ApproxNEB) algorithms [37]. Wang et al. [38] developed a computational band gap database of single and double perovskites based on highly accurate DFT calculations, and used it to identify an accurate expression to predict the band gap. This model was then employed to screen Pb-free perovskites in the MP database, finding 14 unreported crystals potentially suitable for PV applications. Kim et al. [39] trained a Random Forest (RF) based ML model on the whole OQMD to identify novel quaternary Heusler compounds. The model was employed to screen 3.2 million possible structures, predicting their stability and identifying 303 promising compositions, of which 55 were confirmed to yield stable compounds through DFT calculations. Kang et al. [40] used ML to characterize the heat of explosion of potential candidates of energetic materials, based on the constituent elements-averaged cohesive energy and on the oxygen balance. The authors applied the model to perform a high-level screening of over 140 million molecules in the PubChem database [41], followed by a theoretical fine-level screening which eventually identified 262 molecular candidates with the required properties. Rao et al. [42] investigated the compositional design of high-entropy alloys, proposing an active learning framework which combines a generative model, regression ensemble, physics-driven learning, and experiments. The authors demonstrated the framework’s capabilities in the design of high-entropy Invar alloys with low thermal expansion coefficient. In addition to these previous screening material successes, the application of ML in materials science has unlocked a vast and largely untapped resource: the Graph Networks for Materials Exploration (GNoME) database [43]. GNoME is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven platform designed to explore the vast chemical space through an iterative pipeline that combines active learning algorithms and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This process generates and filters numerous candidate solid state materials using a GNN trained and validated with DFT to predict formation energies. This active learning framework enables GNoME to continuously refine its predictions, culminating in the discovery of over 2.2 million stable materials. Remarkably, it has identified over 380,000 novel stable crystals, which reside on the updated convex hull of formation energies. To the best of our knowledge, this vast database of materials has not yet been screened to identify potential materials for disparate energy applications. Therefore, in this study, we aim to perform a preliminary screening of the GNoME database to identify potential materials for further numerical or experimental investigation within three relevant domains in the energy field: thermoelectric materials, perovskites, and batteries. Specifically, we adopt specialized datasets available in the literature for training, validating and testing proper ML regressors towards the prediction of relevant properties of interest across the above four domains. A straightforward practice would consist in using those models to directly predict such properties of interest over the GNoME materials. However, the specialized datasets utilized for training represent only a localized subset of the entire materials space. As a consequence, the trained ML models – being not extrapolative [16] – are able to reliably forecast the corresponding property of interest only for those GNoME samples that fall within the same localized subset as the training materials. To take into account this biased nature of specialized datasets, we adopt the protocol recently proposed and validated by some of the authors of this work [44]. Specifically, it consists of a set of binary classifier-based filters, trained over samples from the specialized dataset (class 1) and random subsets from a less biased general-purpose database like MP (class 0). By applying these classifiers to the GNoME materials, we can effectively rule out samples for which the regression models are likely to provide unreliable predictions, thereby we expect an enhanced reliability and accuracy of our screening process. The protocol identified 7,530 thermoelectric candidate materials, 4,259 perovskite candidates for PV applications, and 21,243 cathode material candidates for lithium and eight post-lithium kind batteries. This article is structured as follows: Section 2 includes a brief overview of the proposed protocol and workflow and presents the findings of our AI-driven screening process for various energy-related materials, including candidates for thermoelectric, perovskites, and cathodes applications. Section 3 discusses the significance and limitations of these results, their potential applications in the energy sector, and the further development of these methods. Section 4 details the computational approaches, data handling, and ML protocols used to predict material properties and identify promising candidates within the GNoME database."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09876v1,Visualization of atomistic optical waves in crystals,"The refractive index of a matter is foundational to quantify the light-matter interaction of the medium. However, the classical description of refractive index is based on macroscopic homogenization and is limited to describing the local optical response of materials. A complete quantum description of light-matter interaction should consider nonlocality and multiple-scattering of optical responses at the atomistic lattice level. Recently, the deep microscopic optical band structure was introduced as a quantum generalization of refractive index of a medium. This quantum description unveils multiple optical eigenmodes in crystalline solids and hidden microscopic optical waves at the lattice level. In this work, we unravel the microscopic optical waves in silicon carbide. We predict and visualize hidden microscopic optical eigenwaves, which can be nonplanar and inhomogeneous even near the optical limit. Also, the nonlocal macroscopic dielectric constant of the crystal is analyzed using the microscopic optical waves as the basis. Our work establishes a general framework for picoscale electrodynamics applicable to other materials including two-dimensional materials.","Refractive index has long been used to characterize the optical properties of materials [1] (Fig. 1a). In other words, the quest of finding a novel optical material is equivalent to tuning the refractive index [2, 3]. For instance, metamaterials with artificial optical properties, such as negative index [4], artificial-chiral [5], hyperbolic [6], epsilon-near-zero [7], have been realized by engineering subwavelength structural compositions. This classical concept of refractive index has been successful in not only classical optics and nanophotonics, but also in quantum optics, where the spontaneous emission rates of quantum emitters have been predicted using refractive index of various electromagnetic environment [8, 9]. However, recent advances on photonic crystals, resonant and nonlocal meta-optics, and nanoscale optics have reached regimes with strong nonlocality or spatial dispersion where the classical homogenization and conventional effective medium theories fail [10]; inevitably, the concept of refractive index needs to be generalized beyond the local, continuum, and homogeneous limit [11, 12, 13]. The effect of nonlocality is especially pronounced in plasmonics, which has become one of the most active research areas in nano-optics. For its extreme light localization and electric field amplification, plasmonics with nano-gaps can strongly enhance light-matter interactions at the nanoscale [9]. However, the length scale of plasmonic modes become highly subwavelength in such pico- or nano-structured plasmonic systems, so the classical macroscopic homogenization does not hold [14]. As a quantum correction of dielectric constant by considering the electron spill-out at the metal surfaces, the nonlocal hydrodynamic model has been proposed [15, 16]. This model considers mostly surface effects and is limited to macroscopic continuum limit. Classical description of macroscopic polarization has been related to the density of dipole moment, but this description fails to explain the polarization in periodic crystals without considering surfaces, because the dipole moment in the periodic lattice is arbitrary depending on the choice of the origin in the lattice. This discrepancy was remedied by the so-called modern theory of polarization [17, 18], which defines macroscopic polarization through topological argument. Still, this theory does not apply to the dynamic optical refractive index of crystals. Refractive index relates to macroscopic fields by macroscopic Maxwell’s equations. This description does not consider microscopic fields that are rapidly varying at the atomic scales, where atoms or molecules in the media experience microscopic fields, or the local fields. The connection between macroscopic and microscopic quantities has been explained by the Claussius-Mossotti (Lorentz-Lorenz) equation that relates the bulk refractive index to the molecular (microscopic) polarizability [19], but this description is classical and only applies to isotropic or simple cubic lattices.

(b) Generalized refractive index with nonlocal, inhomogeneous optical response of atomic lattices. Figure 2: Light inside lattices of a crystalline solid.

(e) The deep microscopic optical band structure \pi_{\lambda}(\mathbf{q},\omega) of SiC. The band structure consists of the dominant band (\lambda=0, red solid line) and higher-order bands (\lambda>0, blue solid lines). The real-space distributions of some selected bands are visualized in Fig. 3. The yellow shaded region indicates the classical optical regime with small momentum |\mathbf{q}|. The frequency is \omega = 10 THz. The phonon band structure result was taken from Ref. [20] The optical properties of real crystals have also been calculated via full quantum theories, such as density functional theory, considering nonlocality, atomistic inhomogeneity or local field effect, and finite photon frequency [21, 22, 23]. These calculations have allowed the numerical investigation of optical properties of crystals including optical measurements and electron energy loss spectra, but mostly limited to macroscopic properties and at the optical limit. Recent investigations on the atomistic electrodynamics inside crystals incorporate microscopic [24] and multiple-scattering optical responses [25]. Along these lines, the concept of deep microscopic optical waves in crystals at finite photon momentum and the relevant software Purdue-PicoMax is under development [26]. In this work, we investigate the optical responses and hidden polarization waves of SiC in the atomistic nonlocal regime, where the nonlocal, inhomogeneous, and multiple-scattering optical responses are considered (Fig. 1b). We introduce the deep microscopic optical band structure of SiC as a quantum generalization of refractive index of the medium. Contrary to the classical refractive index with single-modal nature, multiple-scattering due to atomic inhomogeneities allow multi-modal optical responses [25]. Also, the effective optical response, or the effective screening strength, experienced by an arbitrary field inside the crystal is introduced. This effective screening is obtained by decomposing the field into a set of deep microscopic optical eigenwaves with distinct screening strengths. Our framework provides the fundamental understanding of the refractive index and the light-matter interaction inside crystalline solids. Also, the existence of hidden or dark eigenwaves is predicted, which may exhibit topologically nontrivial properties. As a practical example, we investigate this atomistic photonic eigenwaves in a zincblende semiconductor SiC, which has been widely studied for multiple applications, such as CMOS compatible single-photon quantum sources [27, 28, 29]. Our study of the microscopic optical responses inside semiconductors is crucial for light-emitting applications at the nanoscale and emerging light-based quantum technologies."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09161v1,Nonlinear Hall Effect in KTaO Two-Dimensional Electron Gases,"The observation of a Hall effect, a finite transverse voltage induced by a longitudinal current, usually requires the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, for example through the application of an external magnetic field or the presence of long range magnetic order in a sample. Recently it was suggested that under certain symmetry conditions, the presence of finite Berry curvatures in the band structure of a system with time-reversal symmetry but without inversion symmetry can give rise to a nonlinear Hall effect in the presence of a probe current. In order to observe the nonlinear Hall effect, one requires a finite component of a so-called Berry dipole along the direction of the probe current. We report here measurements of the nonlinear Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases fabricated on the surface of KTaO3 with different surface crystal orientations as a function of the probe current, a transverse electric field and back gate voltage. For all three crystal orientations, the transverse electric field modifies the nonlinear Hall effect. We discuss our results in the context of the current understanding of the nonlinear Hall effect as well as potential experimental artifacts that may give rise to the same effects.","The Hall effect is one of the best-known phenomena in condensed matter physics, having been discovered by Edwin Hall more than 140 years ago. It manifests itself in simple conductors as a transverse voltage in response to a driving current and a perpendicular magnetic field. It can also be observed in magnetic materials in the absence of an external magnetic field, the so-called anomalous Hall effect [1]. Since its discovery, the Hall effect has been studied intensely both experimentally and theoretically in a variety of materials [2], with quantized versions of both the ordinary Hall effect[3] and the anomalous Hall effect [4] now well established. A unified picture of these various Hall effects can now be understood based on the underlying topology of the band structure of a material in the presence of external fields and currents [5]. In this picture, the nature of the Berry curvature \bm{\Omega}_{n}=\nabla\times\bm{A}_{n} of the bands is particularly important. Here \bm{A}_{n}(\bm{k})=i<u_{n\bm{k}}|\nabla_{\bm{k}}|u_{n\bm{k}}> is the so-called Berry connection [6], with u_{n\bm{k}} being the Bloch wavefunction of the band with index n and crystal momentum \bm{k}. The Hall response is related to the integral of the Berry curvature \bm{\Omega}(\bm{k}) over the entire Brillouin zone. In a system with time reversal symmetry, one can show that the Berry curvature is an odd function of \bm{k}, \bm{\Omega}(\bm{k})=-\bm{\Omega}(-\bm{k}), while in a system with space inversion symmetry, the Berry curvature is an even function of \bm{k}, \bm{\Omega}(\bm{k})=\bm{\Omega}(-\bm{k}).[6] Consequently, in a system with both time reversal and space inversion symmetry, \bm{\Omega}(\bm{k}) identically vanishes over the entire Brillouin zone, and there is no Hall response. In a system with time reversal symmetry, but broken space inversion symmetry, the Berry curvature is odd in \bm{k} so that its integral over the Brillouin zone again vanishes and there is no resulting Hall voltage. Thus, broken time-reversal symmetry appears to required be to observe a finite Hall voltage. The situation is different if there is an electric field \bm{E} applied to the sample, as might be generated by a measurement current. In this case one obtains a Hall response that is quadratic in E, i.e., a nonlinear Hall effect.[7] The velocity of an electron in a band with index n is given by[8] v_{n}(\bm{k})=\frac{1}{\hbar}\nabla_{\bm{k}}\mathcal{E}_{n}-\frac{d\bm{k}}{dt}% \times\bm{\Omega}_{n}(\bm{k}) (1) where the first term is the usual Bloch velocity of a band electron, and the second term is the anomalous velocity due to the Berry curvature. In a 2D crystal, \bm{\Omega} points out of the 2D plane, so that the anomalous velocity is in the plane of the crystal in a direction perpendicular to d\bm{k}/dt. In the presence of an electric field \bm{E}, the time evolution of \bm{k} is given by d\bm{k}/dt=-e\bm{E} in the semiclassical approximation. The current arising from the anomalous velocity is given by [9] \bm{j}=\frac{e^{2}}{\hbar}\int\frac{d^{2}k}{4\pi^{2}}\bigl{(}\bm{E}\times\bm{% \Omega}(\bm{k})\bigr{)}g(\bm{k}) (2) where g(\bm{k})=f(\bm{k})-f_{0}(\bm{k}) is the deviation of the electron distribution function f(\bm{k}) from its equilibrium value f_{0}(\bm{k}) due to perturbations from the driving field, \bm{E}. To first order in the low frequency limit, g(\bm{k}) is given by [10] g(\bm{k})=\left(-\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial\mathcal{E}}\right)\tau v_{\bm{% k}}\cdot e\bm{E} (3) where \tau is the scattering time and v_{\bm{k}} is the first term in Eqn. (1). The derivative of the electron distribution function ensures that the primary contribution to the current in Eqn. (2) comes from the Fermi surface. We have also dropped the band index in the equations above, simplifying to the case where only one band is important. One can see immediately that the current arising from the anomalous velocity is perpendicular (transverse) to \bm{E}, and that it is quadratic in \bm{E}, as noted earlier. Recalling that v_{\bm{k}}=(1/\hbar)\nabla_{\bm{k}}\mathcal{E}, we can rewrite -(\partial f_{0}/\partial\mathcal{E})v_{\bm{k}} as -(1/\hbar)\nabla_{\bm{k}}f_{0}. Taking all the k independent terms of Eqn. (2) out from under the integral, and writing it in scalar form, we obtain an expression for the transverse current in response to the electric field E \bm{j}=\frac{e^{3}\tau}{\hbar^{2}}E^{2}\int\frac{d^{2}k}{4\pi^{2}}(\nabla_{\bm% {k}}f_{0})\Omega_{k}. (4) Integrating by parts, one obtains \bm{j}=\frac{e^{3}\tau}{\hbar^{2}}E^{2}\int\frac{d^{2}k}{4\pi^{2}}f_{0}(\nabla% _{\bm{k}}\Omega_{k}) (5) assuming that \Omega_{k} is odd in k. Sodemann and Fu [7] identify the integral in Eq. 5 as the dipole moment of the Berry curvature, or Berry dipole. The resulting current is proportional to the Berry dipole, and responds to experimental handles that modify the stength of the dipole. Sodemann and Fu also note that the symmetry considerations for such a Berry dipole to exist (and hence for a nonlinear Hall effect to be observable) in a two-dimensional (2D) crystal are rather stringent: the crystal must have only a single mirror line, hosting the dipole perpendicular to that line [7]. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a putative Berry curvature in two different 2D crystals. The first one shown in Fig. 1(a) represents a crystal that has a single mirror line with a finite Berry curvature and a Berry dipole aligned along the k_{y} axis. The schematic of Fig. 1(b) represents a crystal with a three-fold rotation symmetry and three mirror lines, similar to the (111) KTO surface. Taking the integral over the full Brillouin zone as described in Eq. 5 yields no net Berry dipole in any direction. Thus the crystal of Fig. 1(a) will show a nonlinear Hall effect if an external electric field \bm{E} is applied in the direction shown, while the crystal of Fig. 1(b) will not. Figure 1: Schematic of a Berry curvature in a 2D crystal. Red denotes a positive Berry curvature, while blue denotes a negative Berry curvature. (a) A crystal with C_{2} symmetry with a single mirror line along k_{y}, with the electric field \bm{E} applied along k_{y}. (b) A crystal with C_{6} symmetry with three mirror lines, shown as the dotted lines (one is along the k_{y} axis). Modification of the Berry curvature of (a) with an additional electric field \bm{E}_{T} applied along the k_{x} direction, perpendicular to \bm{E}. (d) Similar modification of the Berry curvature of (b) with \bm{E}_{T}. The application of \bm{E}_{T} destroys the mirror symmetries. The application of an additional electrical field \bm{E}_{T} will modify an existing Berry dipole, as shown in Fig. 1(c). In a system where there is no net Berry dipole due to the existence of multiple mirror symmetry lines, the application of \bm{E}_{T} along one of these mirror symmetry lines can result in a net Berry dipole by effectively removing the remaining mirror symmetries, as shown schematically in Fig. 1(d) for the crystal of Fig. 1(b). Consequently, one expects to observe a nonlinear Hall effect in such a system that depends on the magnitude of the transverse electric field \bm{E}_{T}. Such a field dependent nonlinear Hall effect has recently been reported in WTe2 [11]. For devices in which a nonlinear Hall effect is observed in the absence of \bm{E}_{T}, the application of a transverse field might be expected to modify the magnitude of the observed effect, as shown schematically in Fig. 1(c). Note that even if \bm{E} and \bm{E}_{T} are not along the crystal axes of the crystal, one would still expect to observe a nonlinear Hall effect, although its dependence on \bm{E}_{T} might be more complicated. The quadratic dependence of the transverse current on the driving electric field enables an elegant way to isolate the nonlinear Hall effect, as emphasized by Sodemann and Fu [7]. If an ac measuring current I_{\omega} is used at a (low) frequency \omega, then the resulting nonlinear Hall voltage V_{T} will have components at dc and 2\omega. As thermoelectric and other effects may also result in dc contributions that are difficult to isolate, it is easier to focus on the 2\omega component of the Hall voltage, V^{2\omega}, which should have a quadratic dependence on the measuring current, V^{2\omega}\propto I_{\omega}^{2} for low values of I_{\omega}. However, it is important to note that there are other contributions that may result in a 2\omega signal that is quadratic in I_{\omega}. In particular, if the response V_{T}(I) is nonlinear in I, then a standard ac lock-in measurement will result in a 2\omega signal that is quadratic in I_{\omega}. Many materials that are not necessarily topological might have nonlinear current-voltage characteristics. Indeed, as observed by Webb, Washburn and Umbach [12] almost four decades ago, even devices made from conventional metals such as gold have significant response at harmonics of the probe current frequency. Thus it is important to identify characteristics of the second harmonic response that relate the observed signal to Berry curvature effects. We describe below the results of our measurements of the nonlinear Hall effect in KTaO3 (KTO) two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) with three different crystal surface orientations: (001), (110) and (111). We report measurements of both the first harmonic (V^{\omega}) and the second harmonic (V^{2\omega}) longitudinal and transverse voltage responses as a function of the ac drive current I_{\omega}, backgate voltage V_{g} as well as an additional dc current I_{dc} applied between the transverse voltage probes. The (001) and (111) crystal orientations nominally have more than one mirror line, so that according to the discussion above, no nonlinear Hall effect should be observed in the absence of the transverse current. For all three crystal orientations, however, we observe a second harmonic transverse voltage that is modified by I_{dc}. This transverse second harmonic signal is smallest for the (001) oriented sample, larger for the (110) sample and largest for the (111) sample. We discuss our results in terms of the current understanding of the nonlinear Hall effect and potential experimental artifacts."

In this work, we derive a general expression for the polaritonic linear spectra that reveal previously overlooked finite-size quantum corrections due to vacuum-mediated molecular Raman processes. Using a 1/N expansion, we demonstrate that these nonlinearities are suppressed in typical low-Q cavities due to an emergent timescale separation in polariton dynamics yet manifest in high-Q single-mode cavities where the photon loss is comparable to the single-molecule light-matter coupling strength.","References Coles et al.

We investigate this model by means of a Gaussian variational ansatz and numerically prove that the steady-state solution is stabilized by an inhomogeneous profile of the driving amplitude, which damps out boundary effects. Our calculations unveil a non-equilibrium phase diagram showing low- and high-density phases for photons separated by a phase coexistence region in which the system exhibits the phenomenon of topological amplification and is characterized by a finite non-Hermitian winding number. Our work shows the emergence of non-Hermitian topological phases in an interacting model that can be naturally implemented with superconducting circuits.","References Klitzing et al. [1980] K. v.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08942v1,Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality in superfluid vortex reconnections,"The minimum separation between reconnecting vortices in fluids and superfluids obeys a universal scaling law with respect to time. The pre-reconnection and the post-reconnection prefactors of this scaling law are different, a property related to irreversibility and to energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms. In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and post-reconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behaviour independent of the small-scale regularising dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.","Introduction.— Reconnections are the fundamental events that change the topology of the field lines in fluids and plasmas during their time evolution. Reconnections thus determine important physical properties, such as mixing and inter-scale energy transfer in fluids [1], or solar flares and tokamak instabilities in plasmas [2]. The nature of reconnections is more clearly studied if the field lines are concentrated in well-separated filamentary structures: vortices in fluids and magnetic flux tubes in plasmas. In superfluid helium this concentration is extreme, providing an ideal context: superfluid vorticity is confined to vortex lines of atomic thickness (approximately a_{0}\approx 10^{-10}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm m); a further simplification is that, unlike what happens in ordinary fluids, the circulation of a superfluid vortex is constrained to the quantized value \kappa=h/m=9.97\times 10^{-8}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm m^{2}/s, where m is the mass of one helium atom and h is Planck’s constant. It was in this superfluid context that it was theoretically and experimentally recognized [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] that reconnections share a universal property irrespective of the initial condition: the minimum distance between reconnecting vortices, \delta^{\pm}, scales with time, t, according to the form \delta^{\pm}(t)=A^{\pm}(\kappa|t-t_{0}|)^{1/2}, (1) where t_{0} is the reconnection time, and the dimensionless prefactors A^{-} and A^{+} refer respectively to before (t<t_{0}) and after (t>t_{0}) the reconnection. The same scaling law was then found for reconnections in ordinary viscous fluids [9]. In the case of a pure superfluid at temperature T=0\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm K, theoretical work based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) has shown that A^{+}>A^{-}, that is, after the reconnection, vortex lines move away from each others faster than in the initial approach; this result has been related to irreversibility [10, 11]. Indeed, a geometrical constraint imposes [11] that a piece of vortex length needs to be “deleted” during the reconnection process. In the GP model, this loss is possible by the emission of a rarefaction pulse created immediately after the reconnection [12, 6] which removes some of the kinetic energy and momentum of the vortex configuration. This vortex energy loss depends on the ratio A^{+}/A^{-}, which in turns defines the approaching angle of collision between the vortices, together with other several geometrical quantities [7, 11]. The temporal asymmetry A^{+}>A^{-} can be thus interpreted as a non-trivial manifestation of irreversibility, as it originates from an ideal hydrodynamic process independent of the small-scale regularisation mechanism of the fluid. Indeed, in classical fluid vortex reconnections, although the definition of A^{+} is more delicate as circulation is not necessarily conserved, the same asymmetry A^{+}>A^{-} was reported [9]. Instead of the generation of rarefaction pulses, like in the case of T=0 superfluids, close to the reconnection, the classical fluid creates a series of thin secondary structures that can be then efficiently dissipated by viscous dissipation. The case of superfluid helium at non-zero temperatures is more intriguing. Most experiments are performed at T>1\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm K, a regime in which in addition to quantum vortices, thermal excitations constitute a viscous liquid called the normal fluid. The normal fluid can steal energy from filaments and dissipate it by viscous effects, opening in that way more routes towards irreversibility. Modern visualisation techniques rely on hydrogen/deuterium tracer particles to decorate superfluid vortices [13, 4, 14, 15]. Numerous studies have provided insight into the post-reconnection dynamics and the prefactor A^{+}, but much less is known about A^{-} from experiments due to the challenges of visualising vortices approaching a reconnection. The aim of this Letter is to investigate the role played by the normal fluid in the reconnection dynamics. In particular, given the temperature dependence of the normal fluid’s properties, we study experimentally and numerically the temperature dependence of the prefactors A^{+} and A^{-} and numerically investigate the energy injected in the normal fluid. To achieve this aim we need a more powerful model than the GPE to account not only for the dynamics of the superfluid vortices, but also for the dynamics of the normal fluid. We show that at non-zero temperatures Eq. (1) and the relation A^{+}>A^{-} hold true, in agreement with experiments, revealing, for the first time, a temperature dependence of A^{+}/A^{-}. In addition, we show that a vortex reconnection represents an unusual kind of punctuated energy injection into the normal fluid which acts alongside the well-known (continual) friction. When applied to superfluid turbulence, this last result implies that, if the vortex line density (hence the frequency of reconnections) is large enough, vortex reconnections can maintain the normal fluid in a perturbed state."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08394v1,Hidden quantum correlations in the ground states of quasiclassical spin systems,"Frustrated spin models may lead to the formation of both classical non-collinear spin structures and unique quantum phases including highly entangled quantum spin liquids. Here, we study the entanglement and spatial quantum correlations in linear spin-wave theory around a classical spin-spiral ground state. We find that the entanglement between pairs of sites is short-ranged, and is completely absent in certain cases. In contrast, the entanglement hidden in multi-site clusters is peaked close to phase transitions and shows an asymptotic behavior modulated by the period of the magnetic structure. These findings motivate further exploring the connection in the entanglement properties of fully quantum and of quasiclassical spin models.","References White (1992) S. R. White, Phys. Rev.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07522v1,Protected chaos in a topological lattice,"The erratic nature of chaotic behavior is thought to erode the stability of periodic behavior, including topological oscillations. However, we discover that in the presence of chaos, non-trivial topology not only endures but also provides robust protection to chaotic dynamics within a topological lattice hosting non-linear oscillators. Despite the difficulty in defining topological invariants in non-linear settings, non-trivial topological robustness still persists in the parametric state of chaotic boundary oscillations. We demonstrate this interplay between chaos and topology by incorporating chaotic Chua’s circuits into a topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit. By extrapolating from the linear limit to deep into the non-linear regime, we find that distinctive correlations in the bulk and edge scroll dynamics effectively capture the topological origin of the protected chaos. Our findings suggest that topologically protected chaos can be robustly achieved across a broad spectrum of periodically-driven systems, thereby offering new avenues for the design of resilient and adaptable non-linear networks.","Chaotic dynamics, despite being notoriously unpredictable and sensitive to initial conditions [1], govern the behavior of many complex systems [2, 3] such as networks of coupled oscillators and dynamical non-linear lattices [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In such coupled dynamical networks, even small perturbations are amplified rapidly, leading to complex global behaviors [4, 9, 10]. While synchronization can appear at times, chaos, with its inherent unpredictability, disrupts this order and makes the system decidedly irregular in the long run. However, we discover that this well-established pattern of behavior may no longer hold when a network of coupled chaotic oscillators is arranged in a topological manner. Despite the lack of well-defined band topological invariants in non-linear systems, we find that topological robustness potently persists, even as chaotic behavior introduces randomness that would erode the bulk periodicity and threaten any semblance of topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Surprisingly, not only can topological robustness be well-preserved in certain chaotic systems, it even protects chaotic oscillations from strong perturbations, demonstrating a parametric robustness inherited from band topology. This protection stems from the stability of non-trivial edge oscillations, whose absence would lead to the rapid decay of bulk chaotic attractors, as observed in the case of trivial edge oscillations. In this work, we choose chaotic Chua circuits among various potential candidates to implement the Lorenz system, as they offer an experimentally accessible and easily tunable platform for investigating chaotic dynamics [11, 12, 13]. Identical Chua circuits are coupled such that they form a one-dimensional topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit array with onsite chaotic Chua oscillators [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. In our setup, the degree of non-linearity can be adjusted by tuning the current-voltage characteristics of the Chua diodes, with high non-linearity typically expected to substantially distort linear eigenstates. In non-linear systems, a key challenge in attributing robustness to band topology is the difficulty in defining bulk topological invariants [23], which are inherently properties of linear band structures. To overcome this, we continuously deform the Chua circuit array from its linear SSH limit by tuning its non-linear Chua diodes. Notably, the topological edge oscillations are preserved remarkably well even deep into the non-linear regime. This allows for the identification of non-linear topological boundaries, which can be made further precise with the aid of machine learning techniques. Importantly, we emphasize that although we shall demonstrate topologically protected chaos only with Chua circuits, this novel form of robustness is not specific to the Lorenz equations, and extends generally to chaotic attractors with well-defined bounded oscillations. Furthermore, the physical implementation is applicable to any medium which can host the requisite non-linear dynamics, not just electronic circuit metamaterials. As such, our discovery of topologically protected chaos also opens up new possibilities in fields as diverse as neural networks [24, 25], chaotic quantum dynamics [26] and mechanical metamaterials [27]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06495v1,"Chiral quantum optics: recent developments, and future directions","Chiral quantum optics is a growing field of research where light-matter interactions become asymmetrically dependent on momentum and spin, offering novel control over photonic and electronic degrees of freedom. Recently, the platforms for investigating chiral light-matter interactions have expanded from laser-cooled atoms and quantum dots to various solid-state systems, such as microcavity polaritons and two-dimensional layered materials, integrated into photonic structures like waveguides, cavities, and ring resonators. In this perspective, we begin by establishing the foundation for understanding and engineering these chiral light-matter regimes. We review the cutting-edge platforms that have enabled their successful realization in recent years, focusing on solid-state platforms, and discuss the most relevant experimental challenges to fully harness their potential. Finally, we explore the vast opportunities these chiral light-matter interfaces present, particularly their ability to reveal exotic quantum many-body phenomena, such as chiral many-body superradiance and fractional quantum Hall physics.","Generally speaking in physics, chirality refers to situations where the mirror image of a physical state does not possess the same properties as the original. This feature has many intriguing manifestations in the context of light-matter interactions, leading to various momentum- and spin-dependent phenomena in both photonic and electronic degrees of freedom. The definition of what is chiral varies across different fields. Therefore, in the next Section II, we begin by introducing the basic definitions and concepts that we will use later in this Perspective. The mechanisms section provides a concise introduction to the key concepts required to study chiral quantum optics. We then discuss recent developments in experimental platforms in Section III. In Section IV, we present our view on potential future directions in the field of chiral quantum optics, ranging from single particles to many-body phenomena. We believe such a Perspective is timely, given the rapid evolution of this field since the visionary article by P. Lodahl et al. from 2017 [1]. This evolution has occurred not only in experimental platforms but also conceptually, with new types of chiral light-matter interactions emerging beyond what was referenced. Figure 1: Basic concepts in chiral quantum optics systems. Upper panel: Spin-momentum locking. An electromagnetic mode propagating in the +z direction of a dielectric waveguide (panel a) has a distribution of electric field intensity shown in panel b. For concreteness, the waveguide’s height and width are chosen to be 140 nm and 280 nm, respectively, and the electric field propagation of wavelength \lambda\!=\!940 nm is considered. The polarization of such a mode is determined by a position-dependent superposition of its transversal and longitudinal field components with a relative phase that varies from 0 to 2\pi. This leads to regions where the direction of propagation and the circular degree of polarization are locked, as shown in panel c. S_{3}\!=\!2\rm{Im}\{E_{x}E_{y}^{*}\}/|E|^{2} is the degree of circular polarization for the mode shown in b. In the presence of an external magnetic field that is perpendicular to the propagation direction, the circularly polarized transitions of the emitter are split. In this scenario, spin-momentum locking manifests as directional emission for each transition depending on the emitter’s position. (d) For a \sigma^{+}-polarized point source positioned in the upper (lower) part of the waveguide indicated by the dashed circle, the emission is preferentially in the right (left) direction of the waveguide. The emission direction will be reversed for \sigma^{-}-polarized point source (not shown)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06434v1,Tuning the band topology and topological Hall effect in skyrmion crystals via the spin-orbit coupling,"The topological Hall effect (THE) is the result of spin-asymmetric deflection of charge carriers flowing through a non-collinear spin system. Effective manipulation of the topological Hall conductivity (THC) in skyrmions is currently a vigorous area of research with an eye towards potential spintronics application. Here, we show that the band topology and the THC in a skyrmion crystal can be tuned by changing the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can be accomplished via a perpendicular electric field. This results in the change of the subband Chern numbers and a transition between ordinary insulator and Chern insulator as the Rashba SOC is varied. For partially filled subbands, the Rashba SOC can tune the THC and reverse its sign, so that the direction of the Hall current is flipped. The critical Rashba strength for this depends on the skyrmion type and the carrier density. We extend our analysis to the cases of Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC as well, and show that they can be directly mapped to the Rashba SOC case and therefore lead to similar results. Our work suggests new avenues for the control of charge transport in skyrmion crystals.","Skyrmions are topologically protected structures that have garnered significant attention in recent years for the fundamental science as well as for potential application in spintronics devices[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Originally proposed by Skyrme[1] as a model for baryons in particle physics in the 1960s, they have found widespread application in condensed matter physics including Bose-Einstein condensates[10, 11], liquid crystals[12], quantum Hall magnets[13, 14], and helimagnets[2, 15]. The magnetic skyrmions that form in the solid are nanometer-size twirling spin structures, which are metastable due to the topological protection with a fixed quantized winding number. Since the prediction of the stable skyrmion state in magnetic solids[2], skyrmions have been observed in a plethora of materials [7] such as the ferromagnetic semiconductors with B20 structure such as MnSi and FeGe[16, 17], transition metal oxides [18, 19], Heusler alloys [20], Janus materials [21], moiré heterostructures [22], intermetallic compounds [23], and magnetic multilayers [24]. Skyrmion crystals, the ordered arrays of skyrmions, have been suggested theoretically[25] in magnets as well as in two-dimensional electron gas[26]. Several theoretical studies have also examined the energetics of the formation of stable skyrmion crystals via Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction, magnetic frustration, anisotropy, etc.[27, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35] Experimentally, skyrmion crystals have been observed in several systems using neutron scattering and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. A hexagonal skyrmion lattice was first observed in MnSi [16] and later in other intermetallics such as FeCoSi, FeGe, and Co8Zn10Mn2 [36, 37, 38, 39]. Other types of lattices have been found as well, viz., the triangular lattice in Gd2PdSi3, Gd3Ru4Al12, and the CoZnMn alloy system[40, 41, 42], as well as the square lattice in GdRu2Si2, EuAl4, and in monolayer Fe/Ir(111) [43, 44, 45]. The transport of electrons in the presence of skyrmions has emerged as an important area of research. Included in this are the topological Hall effect (THE) and the spin Hall effect (SHE) as well as the skyrmion Hall effect, which concerns the transport of the skyrmions themselves[46]. THE arises from the transverse motion of electrons due to the emergent magnetic field of the noncollinear spin texture, an effect akin to the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the collinear spin system. Figure 1: Topological Hall effect in the skyrmion crystal. The magnitude of the Hall current can be changed and its sign can be reversed by tuning the Rashba SOC through a critical value \alpha_{R}^{c}. The Rashba strength \alpha_{R} can be modified via a perpendicular electric field E_{\perp} or by growing an overlayer. Similar effects can be obtained with the Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC also as discussed in the text. Figure 2: Illustration of the skyrmion spin texture using field lines. The tangent indicates the planar component of the local skyrmion spin, while the color indicates the component normal to the plane. The spin at the origin is pointed down, changing gradually to the spin up orientation at the skyrmion boundary, as indicated by the color coding. There has been mounting interest in the electrical field control of the Hall effects because it would enable spin manipulation without an external magnetic ﬁeld or a large current injection. However, there has been limited success in this direction using conventional field-effect structures involving magnetic materials adjacent to gate dielectrics. More recently, it has been suggested that this may be achieved through the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, which may be modified by an applied electric field. In a recent experiment, it was found that both the AHE and the THE (arising from the interfacial skyrmions) can be tuned by an applied electric field in the oxide heterostructure via the SOC effect of an inserted layer[47, 48]. In this work, we study the THE in the skyrmion crystal in the presence of three types of SOC, viz., the Rashba, Dresselhaus, or the Weyl type. The Rashba case is studied in some detail, while we show that the other two cases can be mapped to the Rashba case for the skyrmion types we have considered here. Quite remarkably, we find that not only can the magnitude of the THC be significantly changed by varying the strength of the Rashba SOC via an applied electric field, but also that the sign of the Hall conductivity can be reversed by varying the Rashba SOC around a critical value. The band topology in the skyrmion crystal can also be changed by varying the strength of the SOC term, resulting in a change in the subband Chern numbers, which can lead to a flipping of the direction of the topological edge current."
