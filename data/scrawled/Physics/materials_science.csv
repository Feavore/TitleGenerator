https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10390v1,The electronic structure of (MnPb)BiTe: experimental evidence of topological phase transition,"The investigation of methods to control and optimize the physical properties of the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator (TI) MnBi2Te4 is a critical challenge for the development of functional materials for quantum technologies and spintronics. The promising approach is to substitute Mn atoms with Ge, Sn or Pb atoms in the (Mn1-xA{}^{\rm IV}_{x})Bi2Te4 (AIV = Ge, Sn, Pb) solid solutions. This substitution enables manageable tuning of the system’s magnetic and electronic properties. In this study, we present a detailed investigation of the electronic structure evolution in (Mn1-xPbx)Bi2Te4 as a function of Pb concentration, using a variety of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy based techniques, including photon-energy-dependent studies, spin resolved and circular dichroism (CD) measurements. Special emphasis was placed on identifying experimental evidence of the theoretically predicted topological phase transitions (TPTs) in (Mn1-xPbx)Bi2Te4 near x\approx 50 %. The criteria for detecting TPT include the presence or absence of topological surface states (TSS) in the electronic structure, which can be identified by their characteristic helical spin structure in spin-resolved or CD spectra, as well as the closure of the bulk band gap. Our results show that the bulk gap in the MnBi2Te4-like electronic structure decreases gradually with increasing Pb concentration up to 40 %, where it almost closes. From 40 % to 60 %, the band gap remains unchanged, and above 80 %, the PbBi2Te4-like electronic structure emerges, with the bulk gap reopening. Additionally, the TSS were detected in (Mn1-xPbx)Bi2Te4 samples with Pb concentrations up to at least 30 % and beyond 80 %, correlating with the regions where the bulk gap is open. However, no TSS were observed at x\approx 55 %, indicating that the system is in topologically distinct phase compared to MnBi2Te4 or PbBi2Te4. At this concentration, the system may be in a semi-metallic state or a trivial insulator phase with a very narrow bulk gap. The demonstrated tunability of the electronic structure in (Mn1-xPbx)Bi2Te4 highlights its potential for further exploration in topological and spintronic applications.","The potential for controlling the physical properties of the magnetic topological insulator (TI) MnBi2Te4 is currently actively investigated [1]. This TI belongs to the family of layered van der Waals materials with the spatial symmetry group R\bar{3}m and the general stoichiometric formula MePn2Ch4 (Me = Ge, Sn, Pb, Mn; Pn = Sb, Bi; Ch = Se, Te) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In addition to the quantum anomalous Hall and axion phases predicted and observed in MnBi2Te4 [8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], it is feasible to achieve the Dirac and Weyl semi-metallic states [20], as well as topological superconductivity [13], in other members of MePn2Ch4 series. The substitution of structural elements, including Mn, Bi, and Te, with analogous elements has demonstrated the potential for fine-tuning the properties of mixed crystals (Mn1-xA{}^{\rm IV}_{x})Bi2Te4 (Mn\rightarrowAIV = Ge, Sn, Pb) or Mn(BixSb1-x)2Te4 (Bi\rightarrowSb) or MnBi2(TexSe1-x)4 (Te\rightarrowSe) [21]. It is of particular significance to consider the substitution of Mn by non-magnetic elements AIV = Ge, Sn, Pb. Theoretical calculations indicate that such a substitution will result in at least one topological phase transition (TPT). This is due to the fact that although MnBi2Te4 and AIVBi2Te4 are both strong TIs, their full topological \mathbb{Z}_{2} invariants are different: (1;000) for MnBi2Te4 and (1;111) for AIVBi2Te4 [5, 22, 12]. In the case of MnBi2Te4, inversion of the states of the bulk valence band (BVB) and bulk conduction band (BCB) is observed at the \Gamma-point of the Brillouin zone (BZ), while in the case of AIVBi2Te4 compounds, this inversion occurs at the Z-point. Generally it is known from the literature that the changes in physical properties turn out to be almost the same for mixed crystals in which Mn is replaced by AIV [23, 24, 25, 26, 22, 27, 28]. It is therefore possible to consider these three systems together. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, as presented by T. Qian et al. [24], for (Mn1-xPbx)Bi2Te4 (Mn\rightarrowPb) a state with zero bulk band gap at x\approx 44% and 66% is expected. However, the electronic structure between these concentrations has not been investigated and, therefore, a detailed DFT and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study is required to fully elucidate the effect of Mn substitution. Further, for (Mn1-xGex)Bi2Te4 (Mn\rightarrowGe) [22], calculations carried out within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) approach, which enables the calculation of a solid solution with an arbitrary distribution and degree of atom substitution, have also proposed the closure of the bulk gap at the \Gamma-point at x\approx 40%. A. Frolov et al. [22] have observed that as the Ge concentration increases, the BVB and BCB edges merge along the entire path from the \Gamma-point to the Z-point, with the opening of the bulk band gap at x>60% and parity inversion at the Z-point. The authors assumed the potential existence of a semi-metallic or trivial insulator state within the concentration range of 40 to 60%, which was also explored in [28]. Considering (Mn1-xSnx)Bi2Te4 (Mn\rightarrowSn) a similar change in the electronic structure with merging of the edges of BVB and BCB at the \Gamma and Z-points at certain concentrations of substitution was shown [27]. Apart from that, the Weyl semi-metal state can be expected in (Mn1-xA{}^{\rm IV}_{x})Bi2Te4, but only in the case of forced ferromagnetic order in the system (the ground state has antiferromagnetic order [23]) at almost all substitution concentrations [28]. Accordingly, a number of potential scenarios for electronic structure modifications under the increase of the substituent atom concentration (x) can be assumed: 1. At a certain concentration x, the inversion of the CB and VB states at the \Gamma-point vanishes, but it does not yet appear at the Z-point. Here, the system undergoes two TPTs through the trivial insulator phase \mathbb{Z}_{2}=(0;000). 2. The inversion of states simultaneously exists both at the \Gamma-point and at the Z-point within some range of concentrations x. This scenario implies two TPTs through the phase of weak TI with \mathbb{Z}_{2} = (0;111). 3. The inversion of the CB and VB states vanishes at the \Gamma point and simultaneously appears at the Z-point. Thus only one TPT is expected and the transition should be observed in a narrow range of concentrations. Currently, there are already a large number of papers in the literature where the TPT in (Mn1-xA{}^{\rm IV}_{x})Bi2Te4 materials is predicted and analyzed by means of theoretical calculations. In this paper, we focus on the detailed analysis of the electronic structure changes of (Mn1-xPbx)Bi2Te4 at different x from experimental side. Particular attention is paid to experimental evidence of the TPT in (Mn1-xPbx)Bi2Te4 near the Pb concentrations of x\approx 50 %. The presence or absence of the topological surface states (TSS) in the electronic structure of the material was employed as an experimentally measurable indicator of the topological or trivial phases respectively. In order to identify the TSS, we will analyzed circular dichroism spectra and spin-resolved spectra, in which the TSS exhibits a distinctive pattern. Moreover, the TPT criterion is the closure of the bulk band gap. Analysis of the gap for (Mn1-xPbx)Bi2Te4 samples at different x was carried out on the basis of spectra measured at different photon energies. These allowed us to consistently estimate the bulk band gap across the entire Brillouin zone (BZ)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10238v1,First principles investigation of phase stability in the B-Pt alloy system,"The B-Pt alloy system contains several Pt-rich phases exhibiting complex structures, many with partial site occupation. It also exhibits a deep (nearly 1000 degrees C) eutectic. We evaluate the ab-initio total energies of the crystalline solids to clarify the identity and character of the phases. Our work identifies inconsistencies in materials databases such as the Inorganic Crystallographic Structure Database and the ASM Phase Diagram Database, but our total energy calculations allow us to match up experimentally reported stable phases with specific structures. High temperature Gibbs free energy calculations in the liquid and solid states at the composition Pt2B reveal that the depth of the eutectic arises from the low energy and high entropy of the liquid state.","The identities of phases in the boron-platinum system has been the subject of conflicting reports dating back to the 1950’s [1, 2, 3] and extending to the present day. Wald and Rosenberg [4] published a phase diagram showing three solid binary phases, Pt3B2, Pt2B, and Pt3B, along with their x-ray diffraction patterns but without definite structures. Matching phases identified in composition vs. temperature (x,T) phase diagrams with structures as reported in crystallographic databases is an important task in general, and it is the primary goal for our present study of the B-Pt alloy system. A striking feature in the phase diagram is a eutectic of nearly 1000∘C deep. This eutectic has been utilized for the synthesis of elemental \alpha-boron [5]. As our second goal, we will extend our first principles study to include entropic effects at high temperature in order to explore the origin of the eutectic. The assessed alloy phase diagram as reported by the ASM [6] is based primarily on the work of Wald and Rosenberg [4]. In this assessment, the phases were identified as having structure of Pearson type oS8 with space group Cmcm (phase name Pt3B2, formula PtB0.67, Reference [7]); Pearson type hP6 with space group P63/mmc and prototype anti-MoS2 (phase name Pt2B, formula Pt2B, Reference [7]); unknown cubic (phase name Pt3B, formula Pt4B, Reference [8]). The Pearson type oS8 phase is shown as a line compound and is stable only above 600∘C. The other two have composition ranges at high temperatures but approach stoichiometric compositions in the limit of low temperatures. The Inorganic Crystallographic Structure Database (ICSD) lists four alloy structures: Pearson type oS5 with space group Cmcm (formula Pt3B1.94, Reference [7]); Pearson type mS18 with space group C12/m1 (formula Pt12B5.86, Reference [9]); Pearson type hP4 with space group P63/mmc and prototype NiAs (formula PtB, Reference [2, 3]); Pearson type hP6 with space group P63/mmc (formula Pt2B, Reference [8]). Presumably the phases with space group Cmcm match up, despite slightly conflicting Pearson types and formulas, and likewise the phases of space group P63/mmc. However, the ASM lists a phase of unknown cubic structure, and omits the structures of Pearson type mS18 and hP4. First principles total energy calculations for all reported structures reveal their thermodynamic stability in the limit of low temperature, as well as their plausible stability at elevated temperatures. In several cases we explore stability over ranges of composition to account for partially occupied crystallographic sites. Once the structure of the Pt2B solid phase is confirmed (as Pearson type mS18), we turn our attention to the origin of the deep eutectic. Through ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) together with recently developed methods of entropy calculation [10, 11, 12, 13], we estimate the temperature at which solid Pt2B would melt congruently, and show that its low value is due to the low enthalpy and high entropy of the liquid."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10177v1,Dissociative photoionization of EUV lithography photoresist models,"The dissociative photoionization of tert-butyl methyl methacrylate, a monomer unit found in many ESCAP resists, was investigated in a gas phase photoelectron photoion coincidence experiment employing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) synchrotron radiation at 13.5 nm. It was found that the interaction of EUV photons with the molecules leads almost exclusively to dissociation. However, the ionization can also directly deprotect the ester function, thus inducing the solubility switch wanted in a resist film. These results serve as a building block to reconstruct the full picture of the mechanism in widely used chemically amplified resist thin films, provide a knob to tailor more performant resist materials, and will aid interpreting advanced ultrafast time-resolved experiments.","1 INTRODUCTION The move from deep ultraviolet (DUV) photolithography using 248-193 nm (4.8-6.4 eV) to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) at 13.5 nm (92 eV) means that the way light interacts with a photoresist thin film has changed fundamentally. While DUV light selectively activates chemical bonds in the resist material by resonant excitation, the high photon energy of EUV intrinsically triggers ionization events, but this process only has a low local selectivity. The primary photoionization events furthermore lead to a complex radiation chemistry in a resist thin film. In order to design potent resist materials for EUV lithography that are suited for imaging feature sizes below 20 nm, it is crucial to understand and ultimately control the physical and chemical processes in a photoresist film imaged with EUV radiation. In this paper, the dissociative photoionization of tert-butyl methylacrylate (TBMA), a monomer unit that is widely used in (co-)polymers of chemically-amplified resists (CARs), is investigated using photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy in the gas phase. This reduces the complexity of the chemistry by focusing only on the initial step in the interaction of EUV photons with resists and gaining deep fundamental insights that would not be accessible without this isolated view. Together with further complementary experiments, these insights are one basic building block in deciphering the full chemical and physical processes in EUV photolithography. The interaction of a EUV photon with a photoresist material leads to photoionization, i.e., the emission of a primary photoelectron. The ionization energy of organic molecules lies typically in the 10 eV range. Thus, the produced photoelectrons can possess a significant amount of kinetic energy at 92 eV photon energy, which leads to a second important reaction step in the EUV exposure mechanism: The primary electrons interact further with the material inducing a chain reaction of more ionization events and the creation of secondary electrons albeit with less kinetic energy. These low energy secondary electrons are assumed to mainly drive the radiation chemistry in EUV resists by electron impact dissociation and electron attachment processes. In CARs, either of these processes can lead to the generation of the photoacid, which then catalyses the deprotection of a functional group of the base polymer and therefore leads to a solubility switch. Here, also diffusion processes become relevant that make it even more challenging to obtain the desired resolution of the imaged pattern. Most of the studies on EUV photochemistry follow the pathway of the electrons generated by photoionization. However, removal of an electron can weaken a chemical bond and it is possible that a fragmentation is directly induced at this step leading to potentially reactive dissociation products. Although the electron chemistry is probably the main driving force in the solubility switch, the unavoidable fragmentations by photoionization must not be neglected since they will often lead to unwanted side reactions deteriorating the performance of a resist. The complex reaction sequences in the condensed phase make it very challenging to investigate EUV photochemistry directly in thin resist films with established analysis methods.[1] An alternative approach is therefore to use complementary experimental techniques and investigate the various processes individually in an isolated gas phase environment first in order to get fundamental insights into the chemistry occurring in each step.[2, 3] Gas phase photoelectron spectroscopy and photoionization mass spectrometry yield information on the initial photoionization step,[3, 4, 5] whereas the chemistry induced by secondary low energy electrons can be investigated using focused electron beams to study dissociative electron impact ionization and dissociative electron attachment in the gas phase.[6] The deep insights gained in such experiments can then be used to understand experiments on thin films, such as photoemission, which also adds information on the kinetic energy distribution of secondary electrons, [7, 8, 9] or outgassing experiments. The latter can identify charged and neutral fragment species that leave the surface of the thin film during EUV exposure.[10] Techniques like infrared and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy before and after exposure of the film provide information on the chemical net change in the resist upon exposure. Combining this uncomplete list of techniques helps to draw a more complete picture of the photoresist chemistry in EUV lithography. In this paper, we report on PEPICO experiments of a prototypical CAR monomer, tert-butyl methacrylate, in the gas phase providing novel fundamental insights that can be transferred to better understand the photoionization of resists by EUV photons. PEPICO combines photoelectron spectroscopy and photoionization mass spectrometry by detecting electrons and ions in coincidence.[11] Hereby, photoelectron spectra yielding the kinetic energy distribution of the primary photoelectrons are obtained as well as mass spectra, from which fragmentation products and their respective ratio produced by dissociative photoionization are obtained. In addition, PEPICO allows to combine these two datasets by correlating electrons and ions for each single ionization event. In practice, the intensity of the photon source should be so low that one photon pulse does not lead to more than one ionization event in order to guarantee an unambiguous assignment of electrons and ions. Consequently, PEPICO experiments are best conducted with light sources which operate at a high repetition rate, such as synchrotron storage rings with repetition rates in the MHz range, in order to balance acquisition time and statistics. The appearance of fragment ions can then be assigned to electrons with a certain kinetic energy in the photoelectron spectrum. Through PEPICO it can be understood which electronic states lead to which fragment ions. For photoresists there might be fragmentation channels, which actively contribute to the solubility switch by dissociative photoionization, while others lead to reactive side products. PEPICO experiments can give an idea on how to try to change the electronic structure of the resist/molecule, e.g., by different functional groups, in order to enhance (suppress) the formation of wanted (unwanted) dissociation products. TBMA is a monomer used in many common CARs and containing a tert-butyl ester side group, which is hydrolyzed upon exposure with EUV (and DUV) light leading to a higher solubility in protic solvents. Here we find that TBMA almost exclusively undergoes dissociative photoionization at 92 eV and induces a number of fragmentations, which could decrease the performance of resists containing TBMA monomers. However, one of the channels yields directly the deprotected free acid in a McLafferty rearrangement and the PEPICO technique combined with quantum chemical computations allowed to assign this dissociation channel mainly to ionization out of the HOMO-2 orbital."

Here we provide a theoretical framework able to capture the different roles played by phonon-polaritons in experimental protocols based either on Raman-like pump and probe schemes, typical of four-wave-mixing processes, or on THz pump-visible probe three-wave mixing protocols. By using a many-body description of the nonlinear optical kernel, along with a perturbative solution of nonlinear Maxwell’s equations, we highlight the advantages of exploiting broadband THz pumps to enlarge the phase space of the phonon-polariton dispersion accessible in a single experiment. Besides providing a quantitative description of existing and future experiments, our results offer a general framework for the theoretical modeling of the hybridization between light and lattice degrees of freedom in time-resolved experiments.","References Basov et al.

The recent GNoME protocol identifies over 380,000 novel stable crystals. From this, we identify over 33,000 materials with potential as energy materials forming the Energy-GNoME database. Leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) tools, our protocol mitigates cross-domain data bias using feature spaces to identify potential candidates for thermoelectric materials, novel battery cathodes, and novel perovskites. Classifiers with both structural and compositional features identify domains of applicability, where we expect enhanced accuracy of the regressors. Such regressors are trained to predict key materials properties like, thermoelectric figure of merit (zT), band gap (E_{\mathrm{g}}), and cathode voltage (\Delta V_{\mathrm{c}}). This method significantly narrows the pool of potential candidates, serving as an efficient guide for experimental and computational chemistry investigations and accelerating the discovery of materials suited for electricity generation, energy storage and conversion.","The growing commitment to environmental sustainability and preservation has catalyzed a shift towards a green economy, emphasizing usage of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), decarbonization strategies, and sustainable resource management to ensure long-term ecological balance and economic resilience [1]. In this context, energy-related materials play a central role in driving the transition to a new, eco-friendly industrial paradigm. Materials for renewable energy conversion — such as perovskites for photovoltaic (PV) solar cells [2, 3], materials for efficient energy usage — such as thermoelectric [4, 5] materials, along with materials for energy storage devices — like cathode materials for batteries [6, 7, 8] — are the key to attenuate the intermittent nature of RES, unlocking the full potential of clean energy and achieving the overarching goal of minimizing our environmental footprint while shifting to a sustainable green economy [9, 10, 11]. Advancements in these fields are strictly correlated to the discovery of novel materials with enhanced properties. Most of these physical and chemical properties can be accurately determined by first principles methods based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) [12, 13] However, an exhaustive screening of such innovative materials with traditional strategies is to date impractical due to the high-dimensional composition spaces and the often unaffordable computational cost of DFT simulations. Furthermore, efforts in investigating hypothetical materials typically rely heavily on the intuition of the researcher for identifying promising candidates, as well as on heuristics with limited extrapolation capacities on unseen samples [14, 15, 16]. Despite these difficulties, the efforts required to address the task of materials discovery have been greatly reduced over the last years by the development of high-throughput platforms and of data-driven Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Indeed, in recent years, ML techniques have greatly impacted the way research [17, 18] and industry [19, 20, 21] approach to several applications, including those in the energy field [22, 23, 24]. Coupled with the creation of extensive materials databases such as Materials Project (MP) [25], the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) [26], the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) [27], NOMAD [28], and AFLOWLIB [29], these advanced tools have matured to unlock new potential in the materials discovery process [30, 31]. The combination of high-throughput computational methods and ML approaches has been successfully applied in recent research to predict novel materials and determine key properties, driving innovation in energy storage, generation, and conversion. Fanourgakis et al. [32] applied ML methodologies to screen a wide virtual space of hypothetical Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), introducing a universal strategy employing the “atom types” as the only descriptors to predict the MOFs’ adsorption capacities. A similar work was carried out by Trezza et al. [33]: the authors exploited ML regressors trained to predict MOFs’ adsorption capacities to establish a minimal set of important crystallographic features, and investigated the role of such “genetic code” when using Sequential Learning (SL) algorithms. Nandy et al. [14] exploited Natural Language Processing (NLP) procedures to leverage the available MOF literature, obtaining stability measures and thermal decomposition temperatures for structurally characterized MOFs. Furthermore, the authors trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to predict solvent removal stability and thermal stability. Cerqueira et al. [34] created a computational dataset for conventional, i.e. Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer, superconductors containing ab initio electron-phonon calculations, which was also used for training a ML model to identify superconducting compounds with a critical temperature T_{\mathrm{c}} greater than 5\text{\,}\mathrm{K}, taking as input features the compositional, structural, and ground-state properties. Moses et al. [35] leveraged data retrieved from the MP database to train deep Neural Network (DNN) models able to predict the change in volume and the average voltage of battery electrode materials during the charging and discharging processes. The authors also investigated the screening capabilities outside of the training dataset. Rutt et al. [36] applied a computational screening approach to identify promising multivalent cathodes, demonstrating the importance of evaluating both relative stability and ion mobility in materials not initially containing the working ion of interest. Here a high-throughput material exploration strategy was applied, in which the MP crystal candidates were iteratively defined in 4 steps, starting by screening the materials with relative stability above 0.2\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}\text{\,}{\mathrm{\text{atom}}}^{-1}, and selecting the crystals showing reducible potential with respect to Mg ions. The authors then proceeded with insertion site identification, and finally measured the migration path using approximate Nudged Elastic Band (ApproxNEB) algorithms [37]. Wang et al. [38] developed a computational band gap database of single and double perovskites based on highly accurate DFT calculations, and used it to identify an accurate expression to predict the band gap. This model was then employed to screen Pb-free perovskites in the MP database, finding 14 unreported crystals potentially suitable for PV applications. Kim et al. [39] trained a Random Forest (RF) based ML model on the whole OQMD to identify novel quaternary Heusler compounds. The model was employed to screen 3.2 million possible structures, predicting their stability and identifying 303 promising compositions, of which 55 were confirmed to yield stable compounds through DFT calculations. Kang et al. [40] used ML to characterize the heat of explosion of potential candidates of energetic materials, based on the constituent elements-averaged cohesive energy and on the oxygen balance. The authors applied the model to perform a high-level screening of over 140 million molecules in the PubChem database [41], followed by a theoretical fine-level screening which eventually identified 262 molecular candidates with the required properties. Rao et al. [42] investigated the compositional design of high-entropy alloys, proposing an active learning framework which combines a generative model, regression ensemble, physics-driven learning, and experiments. The authors demonstrated the framework’s capabilities in the design of high-entropy Invar alloys with low thermal expansion coefficient. In addition to these previous screening material successes, the application of ML in materials science has unlocked a vast and largely untapped resource: the Graph Networks for Materials Exploration (GNoME) database [43]. GNoME is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven platform designed to explore the vast chemical space through an iterative pipeline that combines active learning algorithms and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This process generates and filters numerous candidate solid state materials using a GNN trained and validated with DFT to predict formation energies. This active learning framework enables GNoME to continuously refine its predictions, culminating in the discovery of over 2.2 million stable materials. Remarkably, it has identified over 380,000 novel stable crystals, which reside on the updated convex hull of formation energies. To the best of our knowledge, this vast database of materials has not yet been screened to identify potential materials for disparate energy applications. Therefore, in this study, we aim to perform a preliminary screening of the GNoME database to identify potential materials for further numerical or experimental investigation within three relevant domains in the energy field: thermoelectric materials, perovskites, and batteries. Specifically, we adopt specialized datasets available in the literature for training, validating and testing proper ML regressors towards the prediction of relevant properties of interest across the above four domains. A straightforward practice would consist in using those models to directly predict such properties of interest over the GNoME materials. However, the specialized datasets utilized for training represent only a localized subset of the entire materials space. As a consequence, the trained ML models – being not extrapolative [16] – are able to reliably forecast the corresponding property of interest only for those GNoME samples that fall within the same localized subset as the training materials. To take into account this biased nature of specialized datasets, we adopt the protocol recently proposed and validated by some of the authors of this work [44]. Specifically, it consists of a set of binary classifier-based filters, trained over samples from the specialized dataset (class 1) and random subsets from a less biased general-purpose database like MP (class 0). By applying these classifiers to the GNoME materials, we can effectively rule out samples for which the regression models are likely to provide unreliable predictions, thereby we expect an enhanced reliability and accuracy of our screening process. The protocol identified 7,530 thermoelectric candidate materials, 4,259 perovskite candidates for PV applications, and 21,243 cathode material candidates for lithium and eight post-lithium kind batteries. This article is structured as follows: Section 2 includes a brief overview of the proposed protocol and workflow and presents the findings of our AI-driven screening process for various energy-related materials, including candidates for thermoelectric, perovskites, and cathodes applications. Section 3 discusses the significance and limitations of these results, their potential applications in the energy sector, and the further development of these methods. Section 4 details the computational approaches, data handling, and ML protocols used to predict material properties and identify promising candidates within the GNoME database."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09896v1,Revealing the Evolution of Order in Materials Microstructures Using Multi-Modal Computer Vision,"The development of high-performance materials for microelectronics, energy storage, and extreme environments depends on our ability to describe and direct property-defining microstructural order. Our present understanding is typically derived from laborious manual analysis of imaging and spectroscopy data, which is difficult to scale, challenging to reproduce, and lacks the ability to reveal latent associations needed for mechanistic models. Here, we demonstrate a multi-modal machine learning (ML) approach to describe order from electron microscopy analysis of the complex oxide La1-xSrxFeO3. We construct a hybrid pipeline based on fully and semi-supervised classification, allowing us to evaluate both the characteristics of each data modality and the value each modality adds to the ensemble. We observe distinct differences in the performance of uni- and multi-modal models, from which we draw general lessons in describing crystal order using computer vision.","Technological advancements in energy storage and quantum computing depend on our ability to design and deploy high-performance materials. A basic tenet of materials science is that function follows form: that is, a material’s microstructure determines emergent properties and functionality for a given application. How we describe and design such microstructures is therefore critical to developing better materials; while conceptually simple, this task is challenging in practice. Most materials are formed or deployed in coupled extremes of temperature, pressure, radiation, and other stimuli, leading to non-linear modifications of microstructures that are difficult to predict and control.Eswarappa Prameela et al. (2023); Zhang and Weber (2020); Pernigoni and Grande (2023); Schmidt et al. (2021a) Our mastery of materials thus begins and ends with our ability to describe and direct microstructures. Microstructures elude a simple definition, but in practice they usually reflect specific associations in local structure, chemistry, and composition.Norouzi, Waitelonis, and Sack (2024) These associations may encompass distributions of crystalline or amorphous phases, interfaces, and defects such as voids, impurities, dislocations, and stacking faults. How we measure these features depends on the material, but one of the highest resolution and most information-rich approaches is based on scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).Ramasse (2017); Petford-Long and Chiaramonti (2008) In the STEM, a convergent electron probe is scanned over a material’s surface, generating a variety of modalities formed from imaging signals, spectroscopic signals, and diffraction signals that collectively inform the microstructure. The interpretation of these signals is complex and may depend on sample preparation, imaging parameters, and beam-specimen interactions.Chen et al. (2016); Spurgeon, Du, and Chambers (2017) In simple mathematical terms, our goal is to reconstruct an object function from its imaging function. We do this through physics-based models specific to each signal, which reveal different characteristics of the microstructure under study. Despite recent work in data fusion,Schwartz et al. (2022) there is still no widely accepted, objective metric for which STEM modalities matter and how they should be interpreted to collectively define a microstructure. While microstructures are important across all classes of materials, here we focus specifically on complex oxides. These materials exhibit strong lattice-spin coupling that underpins useful functionality and is highly sensitive to even low concentrations of vacancies, impurities, and extended defects.Gunkel et al. (2020); Tuller and Bishop (2011) Oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs) have emerged as key components of modern electronics.Shi et al. (2021); Geng et al. (2023); Yan et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2024) Heterojunction oxide TFTs, in particular, demonstrate improved electrical performance as well as high operational stability.Faber et al. (2017); Li et al. (2020); Lee and Chung (2023) TFTs and other oxide-based components are commonly deployed in extreme environments such as nuclear reactors and spaceflight, where they are exposed to charged particles and photons that can introduce deleterious lattice defects,Sickafus et al. (2000) impacting performance and leading to early device failure. It is therefore important to quantify both intrinsic microstructures and their behavior under irradiation. Beyond the bulk, oxide interfaces have attracted particular attention because these regions exhibit useful, distinct structural and chemical states.Stemmer and Allen (2014); Zubko et al. (2011) External stimuli can uniquely couple to interfaces, leading to modified cation intermixingYano et al. (2022) and corrosion sensitivity.Kaspar et al. (2023); Schmidt et al. (2021b) Radiation-induced damage in particular strongly depends on interface components and their configuration.Beyerlein et al. (2015, 2013) For instance, we have previously observed a retention of interface crystallinity upon irradiation of epitaxial \ceLaMnO3/\ceSrTiO3 thin films,Matthews et al. (2021) and shown that asymmetries in defect formation energies strongly influence how interfaces degrade.Sassi et al. (2019); Spurgeon et al. (2020) While these and other studiesChoudhury et al. (2015); Aguiar et al. (2014a, b); Dholabhai et al. (2014); Bi et al. (2014) have yielded valuable insights into the behavior of oxide interfaces, they are highly specialized and limited in their statistical and descriptive power. Additionally, repeatability may be low as most analysis steps are informed by researchers and therefore subject to their experience and biases.Bruno et al. (2023) To build more accurate models of interface behavior, we require more objective descriptors of microstructural evolution. Computer vision models may offer a solution to this problem by allowing for more reproducible, scalable, and informed descriptors relative to human-in-the-loop studies. In recent years, automated methods have been developed to collect, triage, and quantify microstructural data in the microscope.Kalinin et al. (2023); Olszta et al. (2022) Such methods have been used to track adatom movement in 2D materials,Roccapriore et al. (2022) quantify nanoparticle morphologies,Sytwu, Groschner, and Scott (2022) identify atomic defects and dopants in monolayers,Li et al. (2023) and detect oxygen deficient regions in thin films.Akers et al. (2021) These methods can reproducibly and scalably analyze large volumes of data, potentially informing more accurate microstructural descriptors. While STEM is incredibly data-rich because of its various imaging, diffraction, and spectroscopy operating modes, in practice researchers only utilize a small subset of the data available to them because of their inability to deeply process hundreds or thousands of images. Furthermore, most models are painstakingly trained on single data modalities and specialized for particular materials systems, leading us to overlook important cross-modal correlations. For example, there are many approaches to image segmentation for STEM,Li and Xi (2021); Stuckner, Harder, and Smith (2022); Ziatdinov et al. (2022); Sadre et al. (2021); Groschner, Choi, and Scott (2021); Lee et al. (2022); Burns et al. (2024); Shi et al. (2024), but such models may not effectively discern interfaces in both structure and composition. The application of semi-supervised multi-modal models could provide insight into how different modalities influence segmentation results and, more importantly, allow us to assess whether more modalities provide a more informed microstructural descriptor. The integrated analysis of multi-modal data streams in electron microscopy is still in its infancy.Schwartz et al. (2022) In contrast, multi-modal AI/ML has found considerable use in applications of autonomous driving and remote sensing, often using a combination of cameras, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and radar.Cui et al. (2022); Rizzoli, Barbato, and Zanuttigh (2022); Li et al. (2024); Jiang et al. (2023) Progress has been made towards integrating multiple microscopy modalities in AI/ML analyses in the life sciences,Walter et al. (2020); Fernandez-Gonzalez et al. (2021); Cameron et al. (2021); Ibtehaz and Rahman (2020) while comparatively less work has been done in materials science Muroga, Miki, and Hata (2023). For examples, Kimoto et al. performed a comprehensive bimodal analysis of material nanostructures using 4D-STEM image and diffraction data Kimoto et al. (2024). In these approaches, registered images from different modalities are typically fused into multi-dimensional arrays that are passed into computer vision models. When spectral information is involved, each bin in the spectrum is treated as its own dimension to create a hyperspectral image that is then passed into the computer vision model. It has been recently shown that the unsupervised segmentation of digital photographs can be achieved by combining image features or learned embeddings and graph theory. Jiao et al. applied graph clustering to high-dimensional embeddings obtained from an autoencoder which was fed low-level visual features of color, edge, gradient, and image saliency.Jiao, Chen, and Dong (2020) Wang et al. used graph-cuts on a graph formed from similarities between self-supervised transformer features to perform object localization.Wang et al. (2022) Melas-Kyriazi et al. performed spectral clustering on a graph Laplacian matrix formed from a combination of color information and unsupervised deep features.Melas-Kyriazi et al. (2022) Aflalo et al. incorporated node features derived from pre-trained neural networks into the graph and performed clustering using a graph neural network trained on a loss function based on classical graph clustering algorithms.Aflalo et al. (2022) In addition, graph-based analytics readily support the incorporation of multiple modalities during creation of the graph representation.Ektefaie et al. (2023); Iyer, Chanussot, and Bertozzi (2020); He et al. (2023) While graph-based image segmentation has existed prior to the widespread use of deep-learning-based segmentation,Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher (2004); Camilus and Govindan (2012) these approaches have not yet been widely applied to electron microscopy data. In this work, we examine the multi-modal segmentation of the complex oxide interface LaFeO3 (LFO)/SrTiO3 (STO). We choose the LFO/STO system for its technological relevance as a potential solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) for extreme environments.Taylor et al. (2023) In our approach, we apply various levels of a priori knowledge: 1) a graph-based approach that requires minimal advanced knowledge of the sample, in the form of an upper bound for similarities between identified regions, 2) an unsupervised clustering-based approach that requires one to know the expected number of discrete regions, and 3) a semi-supervised few-shot classification approach that requires an expected number of regions and a limited subset of user-selected examples of each region. In addition, we examine the effect of incorporating multiple datastreams of high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectra on the segmentation performance. Finally, we assess how each modality effects segmentation by examining the elemental composition and crystallinity of the identified clusters. We observe distinct differences in the performance of uni- and multi-modal models, which allow us to derive latent correlations informing disordering of the LFO/STO system. More broadly, we identify important considerations and limitations of the use of multi-modal computer vision for microscopy."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09741v1,2D Theoretically Twistable Material Database,"The study of twisted two-dimensional (2D) materials, where twisting layers create moiré superlattices, has opened new opportunities for investigating topological phases and strongly correlated physics. While systems such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been extensively studied, the broader potential of a seemingly infinite set of other twistable 2D materials remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we define “theoretically twistable materials” as single- or multi-layer structures that allow for the construction of simple continuum models of their moiré structures. This excludes, for example, materials with a “spaghetti” of bands or those with numerous crossing points at the Fermi level, for which theoretical moiré modeling is unfeasible. We present a high-throughput algorithm that systematically searches for theoretically twistable semimetals and insulators based on the Topological 2D Materials Database (2D-TQCDB). By analyzing key electronic properties, we identify thousands of new candidate materials that could host rich topological and strongly correlated phenomena when twisted. We propose representative twistable materials for realizing different types of moiré systems, including materials with different Bravais lattices, valleys, and strength of spin-orbital coupling. We provide examples of crystal growth for several of these materials and showcase twisted bilayer band structures along with simplified twisted continuum models. Our results significantly broaden the scope of moiré heterostructures and provide a valuable resource for future experimental and theoretical studies on novel moiré systems.","The discovery and study of two-dimensional (2D) materials have revolutionized condensed matter physics, opening new avenues for exploring quantum phenomena in reduced dimensions. One of the most exciting developments in the field is the concept of twistronics [1, 2, 3, 4], where a small twist between layers of 2D materials leads to the formation of moiré superlattices, fundamentally altering the electronic structure and interaction landscape, giving rise to novel phenomena. Twisting introduces periodic modulations and creates a moiré pattern that can drastically affect the low-energy electronic properties. The resulting moiré bands can become extremely flat due to the enlarged moiré unit cell, quenching the kinetic energy of electrons and thus enhancing the role of electron-electron interactions. These interactions can drive a wide range of topological and correlated phases, such as correlated insulating states [5], unconventional superconductivity [6], and fractional Chern insulators [7, 8, 9]. The prototypical example is twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) [10], where a “magic angle” twist between two graphene layers leads to the emergence of flat bands [6, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Beyond graphene, twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as twisted \chMoTe2 and \chWSe2, have also been shown to exhibit many different types of strongly correlated phases [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]. Despite the intense focus on TBG and TMD systems, many other potential moiré systems remain unexplored. Given the vast number of 2D materials with different crystal symmetries and electronic structures, there is a much larger space of twistable materials that could host rich correlated and topological physics [55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62]. The systematic exploration of this space is crucial to identifying new systems with novel properties that go beyond what has been observed in TBG and TMD moiré superlattices. However, a systematic approach is hindered by the lack of theoretical predictions. Many single-, double-, and multilayer systems exhibit highly complex band structures, lacking simple effective models such as the Dirac cone in graphene or the quadratic band edge in TMD materials. Twisting an already complicated band structure leads to moiré bands that are theoretically intractable, making it difficult to predict the so-called “magic” angles [10]. In the case of TBG, the prediction of the magic angle was crucial in realizing superconductivity (SC) in the system. Therefore, we define “theoretically twistable” materials as 2D exfoliable materials with “clean” band structures. For metals, this means point or line Fermi surfaces that can be modeled theoretically. For insulators, we require clean band minima or maxima. We also impose experimentally relevant conditions, such as a gap smaller than 3\text{\,}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}, as larger gaps would make forming good contacts difficult. Additional conditions, as described in the main text, are also applied. Figure 1: Moiré \mathbf{Q} lattices derived from different Bravais lattices and valleys. (A) shows the \mathbf{Q} lattices corresponding to the \Gamma and K valley in the hexagonal lattice. The K valley generates two sets of \mathbf{Q} lattices from the two time-reversal symmetry (TRS)-related K points, K_{1} and K_{2}, forming a honeycomb lattice in momentum space. (B) depicts the \mathbf{Q} lattice from the M valley in the hexagonal lattice, which results in a kagome lattice in momentum space, with three sublattices corresponding to the three C_{3}-symmetry-related M valleys. (C) presents the \Gamma and M valleys from the square lattice, both forming a square lattice in momentum space. (D) illustrates the \mathbf{Q} lattice generated by the X valley from the square lattice, forming two nested square lattices in momentum space given by the two C_{4}-related valleys X_{1} and X_{2}. (E) shows the \mathbf{Q} lattices for the \Gamma and Y valleys from the rectangular lattice. With these conditions, we develop a high-throughput algorithm to screen the Topological 2D Materials Database (2D-TQCDB) [63] for twistable materials. Our algorithm identifies candidates based on their electronic structures, focusing on semimetals and insulators that exhibit clean band structures suitable for theoretically predictable moiré engineering. By applying the algorithm, we have identified 61 clean twistable semimetals and 1568 twistable insulators, which we further classify into large classes based on their Bravais lattices, valley types, and spin-orbital coupling (SOC) splitting strength. We select representative materials for each universality class and present example twisted bilayer band structures alongside simplified moiré continuum models. We also offer experimental insights into the feasibility of realizing twistable materials, all these simple layers either exist or are predicted to exist. Complete data on the twisting properties of these materials are available on the 2D-TQCDB. This work not only provides a complete database of potential twistable materials but also broadens the scope of twistronics, paving the way for future experimental and theoretical investigations into novel 2D moiré systems."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10447v1,Ultrafast optical control of charge orders in kagome metals,"We show that ultrafast optical pump pulses provide effective control over charge orders in the kagome metals AV3Sb5 with A= K, Rb, and Cs. Starting from the real charge density waves (rCDWs) at the p-type Van Hove singularity, we conduct a thorough analysis of the post-pump dynamics by time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory. Our analysis uncovers distinct dynamical phenomena under linearly and circularly polarized pumps. Linearly polarized pumps induce directional preferences in the rCDWs, accompanied by an enhancement in the flat band. Unexpectedly, charge nematicity also emerges and receives maximal enhancement at a resonant pump frequency, which we understand with a Rabi-oscillation-like model. On the other hand, circularly polarized pumps suppress the rCDWs uniformly and triggers imaginary CDWs (iCDWs) with charge loop currents. Our results can be directly compared to the pump-probe experiments on the kagome metals AV3Sb5.","References Yin et al. [2022] J.-X. Yin, B. Lian, and M. Z.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10382v1,Geometric dependence of curvature-induced rigidity,"Bending the edge of a thin elastic material promotes rigidity far from its clamped boundary. However, this curvature-induced rigidity can be overwhelmed by gravity or other external loading, resulting in elastic buckling and large deformations. We consider the role of body geometry on this competition using experiments, numerical simulations, and reduced-order models. Finite element simulations are performed using a model nonlinear hyperelastic material, and a theoretical framework is proposed that incorporates small lateral curvatures, large longitudinal rotations, and a varying cross-sectional width. A particular focus is on the comparison between rectangular and triangular sheets, and trapezoidal sheets in between. Sheet geometry affects downward tip deflection by changing the relative importance of the sheet’s weight and the rigidity provided by curvature, often in subtle ways. In extreme cases, non-monotonic deflection is observed with increasing sheet length, and a region of hysteretic bistability emerges, becoming more pronounced with rectangular sheets and large imposed curvatures. These findings demonstrate the profound impact of geometry on the competition between curvature-induced rigidity and gravity-induced deformation in thin elastic materials.","Experiments To explore the role of shape on curvature-induced rigidity, thin sheets were cut from commercially available Shore 30A silicone rubber of density \rho=$1250\text{\,}\mathrm{k}\mathrm{g}\mathrm{/}\mathrm{m}^{3}$, thickness h=$1.5875\text{\,}\mathrm{mm}$, base width a=$5\text{\,}\mathrm{cm}$, tip widths ranging from b=a (rectangles) to b=0 (triangles), and lengths ranging from L=$3\text{\,}\mathrm{cm}14\text{\,}\mathrm{cm}$. These were then clamped at their base upon rigid arcs of curvature ranging from 1/R=0 to 1\text{\,}{\mathrm{cm}}^{-1}, and left free to deform under gravity until the material was fully relaxed (see Fig. 1). Figure 1: Curvature-induced rigidity appears in nature in such disparate systems as: (a) fish fins [reproduced with permission from Ref. [7]]; (b) tulip leaves; and (c) in the human foot (the transverse and longitudinal arches are shown as solid and dashed curves, respectively). Right: Experimental setup. Silicone sheets of thickness h, length L, base width a, and tip width b were clamped at their base upon rigid arcs of radius R. The signed tip deflection, d, measures the vertical distance between the lowest points of the clamped and free edges. The most apparent measurable quantity is the vertical tip displacement, or deflection, d, defined as the signed vertical distance from the lowest point of the clamped edge to that of the free edge. Figure 2 shows the tip displacement as a function of the relative length, L/a, for rectangular sheets (b/a=1, top panel) and triangular sheets (b/a=0, bottom panel). A range of clamping curvatures were considered. For zero clamping curvature (a/R=0), the tip dropped steadily with increasing sheet length, as expected for a classical cantilever [58, 59]. Increasing the clamping curvature monotonically decreased the tip deflection for all lengths considered. For large clamping curvatures but small sheet lengths, the tip was observed to deflect upwards against gravity (d<0), consistent with previous studies [2]: the tip is elevated to a position closer to the vertical center of mass, which reduces stretching along the sheet edges. Also observed in cases with substantial clamping curvatures (a/R\gtrsim 1), at least for rectangular sheets, were regions of bistability, L_{0}^{*}\leq L\leq L_{1}^{*}, where the sheet has two distinct displacement modes. In these ranges, applying a temporary gentle force could change the configuration from one apparently stable state to the other. Figure 3(a-c) shows photographs of the two modes for clamping curvature R/a=2.5 and length L/a=1.3. The first mode shows a relaxation of the transverse curvature near the base, beyond which the sheet appears flat as it dips downward due to gravity. The second mode exhibits curvature throughout the length, and no significant tip displacement is observed. Distinct regions of curvature-dominated, gravity-dominated, and commensurate deformations in rectangular sheets were studied by Taffetani et al. [2], who also noted anecdotally the presence of bistability. Figure 2: The downward tip deflection d as a function of the ratio of sheet length L to base width a from experimental measurements (symbols) and the results of finite element simulations (curves). Different symbols/colors correspond to different clamped curvatures. Curvature-dominated and gravity-dominated configurations, and bistability, are observed for rectangular sheets (a). Triangular sheets (b) can deflect more or less than rectangular sheets depending on their length, and do not appear to be bistable."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10122v1,"Self-learning path integral hybrid Monte Carlo with mixed 
and machine learning potentials for modeling nuclear quantum effects in water","The introduction of machine learned potentials (MLPs) has greatly expanded the space available for studying Nuclear Quantum Effects computationally with ab initio path integral (PI) accuracy, with the MLPs’ promise of an accuracy comparable to that of ab initio at a fraction of the cost. One of the challenges in development of MLPs is the need for a large and diverse training set calculated by ab initio methods. This data set should ideally cover the entire phase space, while not searching this space using ab initio methods, as this would be counterproductive and generally intractable with respect to computational time. In this paper, we present the self-learning PI hybrid Monte Carlo Method using a mixed ab initio and ML potential (SL-PIHMC-MIX), where the mixed potential allows for the study of larger systems and the extension of the original SL-HMC method [Nagai et al., Phys. Rev. B 102, 041124 (2020)] to PI methods and larger systems. While the MLPs generated by this method can be directly applied to run long-time ML-PIMD simulations, we demonstrate that using PIHMC-MIX with the trained MLPs allows for an exact reproduction of the structure obtained from ab initio PIMD. Specifically, we find that the PIHMC-MIX simulations require only 5,000 evaluations of the 32-bead structure, compared to the 100,000 evaluations needed for the ab initio PIMD result.","Nuclear Quantum Effects (NQEs) play a large role in determining the properties of matter containing light atoms and, by extension, the isotope effects seen when hydrogen (H) is exchanged for deuterium (D) or tritium (T). One example of this is the observed differences between light (H2O) and heavy (D2O) water,Ceriotti et al. (2016) which has recently been investigated by a series of experiments. Zeidler et al. (2011, 2012); Soper (2013); Kameda et al. (2018) We have also previously reported some structural and reactive differences between the two liquids and other isotopologues of water Thomsen and Shiga (2021a, 2022) from ab initio or first principles (FP) simulations. Modeling of NQEs in bulk systems relies on path integral (PI) methods based on the Feynman path formulation of quantum mechanics. Feynman (1972); Feynman, Hibbs, and Styer (2010); Schulman (2012) Implementations of these methodsShiga (2018); Kapil et al. (2019) typically require the simultaneous evaluation of energies and gradients of P copies of the system in each time step. P is generally considered in tens or low hundreds for simulations at room temperature and, thus, adds significantly to the cost of performing FP simulations required for the accurate description of NQEs in materials. In the 1990s, methods were suggested for generating machine learned potentials (MLPs),Blank et al. (1995); Brown, Gibbs, and Clary (1996); Lorenz, Groß, and Scheffler (2004) with accuracy close to those of FP calculations but at a much-reduced computational cost. However, MLPs were initially limited to the study of small gas phase clusters. It was only with the introduction of high-dimensional neural network potentials Behler and Parrinello (2007); Behler (2014, 2015, 2017) by Behler and Parrinello that the MLPs were extended to the study of bulk-phase systems. The development of these MLPs is continuing, with later generations including more physics informed terms, such as machine learned atomic chargesArtrith, Morawietz, and Behler (2011); Morawietz, Sharma, and Behler (2012) and global charge equilibration,Behler (2021) for the accurate description of charge separation. From the first MLPs used for the simulation of liquid water, Morawietz et al. (2016) the study of bulk phase water using MLPs has undergone a rapid development,Omranpour et al. (2024) with the low cost of evaluation of the MLP allowing for the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of very large systems both withKrishnamoorthy et al. (2021) and without Lu et al. (2021) NQEs. Generally, fewer FP calculations are needed when training an MLP, and one can thus explore more expensive FP methods for describing the electronic potential in water simulations. MB-PolBabin, Leforestier, and Paesani (2013); Babin, Medders, and Paesani (2014); Medders, Babin, and Paesani (2014) presents one physics based model for water, which has recentlyMedders et al. (2015); Zhu et al. (2023) been adjusted to fit CCSD(T), i.e., the gold standard of quantum chemistry, data for the interaction potentials in water. This model along with other recent fitted MLPs based on FP data from CCSD(T)Yu et al. (2022); Daru et al. (2022); Chen et al. (2023) have been shown to accurately reproduce both equilibrium and dynamic properties of water when NQEs are considered. The investigation of NQEs has also been undertaken by a number of studies due to the reduced cost of PI simulations when an MLP is employed,Cheng, Behler, and Ceriotti (2016); Kapil, Behler, and Ceriotti (2016); Kapil et al. (2020); Yao and Kanai (2020); Li, Paesani, and Voth (2022); Yao and Kanai (2021) including comparisons of isotopologues of water Ko et al. (2019); Xu et al. (2020) and the effect of NQEs on the behavior of the hydroxide and hydronium ionsAtsango et al. (2023) in the liquid phase. Shared by all MLP models is the need for a training set made up of FP data, which should ideally cover the entire phase space while not stemming from an exhaustive search using FP methods. To efficiently carry out the search, one can use on-the-fly learning Li, Kermode, and De Vita (2015); Jinnouchi et al. (2019); Cheng et al. (2020); Young et al. (2021); Montero de Hijes et al. (2024) to train a cheap potential representation, which can be used to accelerate the search. Several of the authors recently suggested the self-learning hybrid Monte Carlo (SL-HMC) method Nagai et al. (2020); Kobayashi et al. (2021) based on the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method. Gottlieb et al. (1987); Duane et al. (1987); Mehlig, Heermann, and Forrest (1992); Tuckerman et al. (1993); Shinoda, Shiga, and Mikami (2004); Nakayama, Taketsugu, and Shiga (2009) In the SL-HMC method, a short ML-MD simulation is run between each HMC step to allow efficient sampling of phase space while training an MLP for the system being studied. Extension of this method to larger systems and the PI domain is, however, hindered by the limitations of HMC as the acceptance ratio scales inversely with the size of the system. Here, we introduce the self-learning path integral hybrid Monte Carlo method using a mixed FP and ML potential (SL-PIHMC-MIX) to overcome this limitation. In brief, this method allows for larger discrepancies between the FP and ML potential energies through the potential mixing, thus enabling larger acceptance ratios and faster sampling of the phase space of the mixed potential Hamiltonian. Thus, reweightingMiao et al. (2014) and longer trajectories are necessary to sample the phase space of the FP Hamiltonian. The savings enabled by the larger acceptance rate of the potential mixing scheme are, however, great enough that the effective length of the trajectory using potential mixing exceeds those using the pure FP potentials. The SL-PIHMC-MIX method is furthermore, as the SL-HMC method, fully general with respect to the FP model used and the MLP model used. In this study, we will use SL-PIHMC-MIX to train an MLP to model room temperature water. After training the MLP, it will be used in a production run using the PIHMC-MIX method, which allows us to rapidly converge the radial distribution functions (RDFs) and, thus, predict the structure of water using only 5000 FP calculations along the bead chain, compared to the 100 000 calculations needed in our previous FP-PIMD studiesThomsen and Shiga (2021a, 2022) to converge the water RDFs. The structure of water has long been a topic of discussion,Finney (2024) and FP based studies of water using density functional theory (DFT) have since the first report,Chen et al. (2003) and until the emergence of coupled cluster based MLPs, been the state of the art for studying water, with several studies comparing the accuracy of functionals for this purpose. Gillan, Alfè, and Michaelides (2016); Villard, Bircher, and Rothlisberger (2024) Recent advances in algorithms for PI propagation have allowed for the study of dynamics, including NQEs using hybrid functionals,Marsalek and Markland (2017) and FP-based molecular dynamics ( FP-MD) studies have also been conducted at the MP2Del Ben, Hutter, and VandeVondele (2015) and quantum Monte CarloZen et al. (2015) levels of theory. DFT and other FP based studies remain relevant in the context of solvated systems where no general high quality MLP or model is currently available. This paper is organized as follows. First, we will extend the SL-HMC and HMC methods to the PI formalism and introduce the SL-PIHMC-MIX and PIHMC-MIX methods that allow the study of systems containing many particles. Reweighting of the results from PIHMC-MIX to get the structural properties of the DFT ensemble will also be described in this section. In Sec. III, the computational details of the simulations used in this work are given. In Sec. IV, the results from the PIHMC-MIX method using an MLP that was fitted using SL-PIHMC-MIX will be compared to the results of FP-PIMD for the RPBE-D3 functional. The effects of the mixed potential method and the accuracy of the MLPs produced by the SL-PIHMC-MIX method will then be discussed. We will briefly discuss the description of heavy water (D2O) using the PIHMC-MIX method and the MLPs produced by the SL-PIHMC-MIX method. We will then go on to compare the results of PIHMC-MIX for SCAN, rev-vdW-DF2, and optB88-vdW functionals with both experimental data and those from the RPBE-D3 functional. For each of the SCAN, rev-vdW-DF2 and optB88-vdW functionals a unique MLP has been fitted using the SL-PIHMC-MIX method. Finally, we will provide a summary of the findings of this study in Sec. V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10065v1,Impact of triplon damping on thermal Hall conductivity in Shastry-Sutherland model,"We investigate the thermal Hall effect in the Shastry-Sutherland model, incorporating interactions between quasiparticle excitations. In this model, with strong nearest-neighbor interactions, the ground state is well described by the direct product of spin-singlet states, and the elementary excitations to spin-triplet states are known as triplons. In candidate materials for this model, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions are inevitably present, resulting in topologically non-trivial band structures for triplon excitations. In this study, we examine quasiparticle damping due to triplon-triplon interactions as a potential factor contributing to the suppression of the thermal Hall effect. We apply nonlinear flavor-wave theory to the Shastry-Sutherland model and treat triplons as bosonic excitations. We calculate the triplon damping rate using the imaginary Dyson equation approach and evaluate the thermal Hall conductivity. Our findings demonstrate that triplons with nonzero Berry curvature are scattered by thermally excited triplons. This scattering effect suppresses the thermal Hall conductivity, particularly at finite temperatures, highlighting the significant role of triplon damping in the thermal Hall effect.","Topological quantum states of matter have attracted considerable attention in condensed matter physics. In particular, topologically nontrivial electronic band structures have been extensively studied in various systems, such as quantum Hall systems [1, 2, 3] and topological insulators [4, 5, 6]. In these systems, topological properties manifest as quantum transport phenomena, such as the quantum Hall and spin Hall effects. On the other hand, the topological properties of elementary excitations from symmetry-broken states have also been explored [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Since these excitations are often described as charge-neutral bosonic quasiparticles, it is difficult to observe their topological properties electrically. However, the thermal Hall effect, a thermal analog of the quantum Hall effect, has been proposed as a promising phenomenon to reflect the topological properties of bosonic quasiparticles [7, 8, 9, 12, 10, 11, 22, 23]. For example, thermal Hall effects originating from magnons and phonons have been observed in insulating magnets [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. In these bosonic systems, the Berry curvature of the quasiparticle bands plays a crucial role in this effect [31]. In addition to magnons and phonons, which are collective modes arising from symmetry-broken phases, triplon excitations have been studied as another type of quasiparticle. Triplons are spin-triplet excitations from a spin-singlet ground state in quantum magnets, often described as bosons [32]. A typical example exhibiting triplon excitations is the spin-dimer phase of the Shastry-Sutherland model [33], a two-dimensional quantum magnet with strong nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions. As candidate materials for this system, SrCu2(BO3)2 has been proposed [34, 35], and its magnetic properties and excitation spectra have been actively studied [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. In this compound, the magnetic properties cannot be fully explained by the pure Shastry-Sutherland model; additional interactions, such as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, are necessary to account for experimental results [42, 43, 44]. Due to the DM interaction, the triplon bands exhibit a topologically nontrivial band structure with nonzero Berry curvature, which induces the thermal Hall effect [45]. However, recent experiments have shown no evidence of the thermal Hall effect in SrCu2(BO3)2 [46]. As possible causes of this discrepancy, the effects of triplon-triplon interactions and coupling with phonons have been proposed, which were not considered in previous theoretical studies. Recently, it has been suggested that interactions between bosonic quasiparticles play a crucial role in the stability of topological chiral edge modes [47, 48] and in the thermal Hall effect in magnon systems [49], which may also apply to triplon systems. In this paper, we focus on the finite-lifetime effect of triplons resulting from triplon-triplon interactions as a possible cause for the suppression of the thermal Hall effect. We investigate the effect of triplon damping on the thermal Hall conductivity in the Shastry-Sutherland model incorporating DM interactions. We introduce triplons as bosonic quasiparticles by applying the flavor-wave theory to this model. We address contributions beyond the linear flavor-wave approximation by using the imaginary Dyson equation (iDE) approach. To calculate the damping rate of triplons, we consider the collision and decay processes in the triplon self-energy. Our findings reveal that at zero temperature, the higher-energy triplon bands are significantly broadened due to the damping effect, which originates from the decay process where a triplon splits into two quasiparticles. At finite temperatures, the collision process involving thermally excited triplons also contributes to the damping effect. Through this process, triplon bands with nonzero Berry curvature become smeared out. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity is suppressed by triplon damping at finite temperatures, which originates from the scattering of triplons with nonzero Berry curvature by thermally excited triplons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these damping effects result from contributions beyond the lowest-order Born approximation, which can be addressed using the iDE approach. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we describe the model and method employed in this study. We introduce the Shastry-Sutherland model in Sec. 2.1 and triplon excitations as its bosonic quasiparticles from the ground state based on the generalized Holstein-Primakoff transformation, which is referred to as the flavor-wave theory. The linear approximation of the flavor-wave theory is explained in Sec. 2.2. Contributions beyond the linear flavor-wave approximation are explored in Sec. 2.3. Nonlinear effects are addressed using the iDE approach and are incorporated by the triplon damping rate. In Sec. 2.4, we present the method for calculating the thermal Hall conductivity with and without triplon damping. Section 3 discusses the results of this study. In Sec. 3.1, we show the triplon band structure and Berry curvature in the Shastry-Sutherland model within the linear flavor-wave approximation. The results regarding the triplon damping effect on the spectral function are given in Sec. 3.2. The origin of the damping effect is examined through the scattering processes of triplons. In Sec. 3.3, we present the thermal Hall conductivity calculated with triplon damping and discuss the impact of triplon damping at finite temperatures. Finally, Sec. 4 is devoted to the summary."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09907v1,Density-wave like behavior in a new Kagome material CeRuSi,"Kagome materials with inherent geometric frustration can produce many interesting physical properties, such as flat bands, quantum spin liquid, chiral magnetism, superconductivity and density-wave orders. Sometimes, the localized 4f electrons from Ce atoms coupled with other conduction electrons would also give rise to the flat bands near the Fermi level, and results in the formation of heavy fermion. Thus, it is highly probable that kagome material incorporating Ce element will display nontrivial physical properties. In this study, we present a new Kagome material belonging to the trinary Laves phase, Ce2Ru3Si, in which kagome plane is formed by Ru atoms. Electrical transport and specific heat measurements reveal a density-wave like transition. A Curie-Weiss behavior is observed in low-temperature region. Meanwhile we also find a relatively large specific coefficient \gamma_{n}(0). The calculated Wilson ratio R_{\mathrm{W}}\propto{\chi(0)/\gamma_{n}} is approximately 3.1, indicating a moderate electron correlation effect. Chemical doping of Ir at the Ru site rapidly suppresses this density-wave like transition, while Mo doping leads to a gradual decrease in transition temperature. Theoretical calculation indicates both the Ce-4f and Ru-4d electronic bands cross the Fermi level, forming a Mexican-hat-shape Fermi surface close to the Fermi energy, potentially accounting for the observed density-wave like transition. Our findings provide an useful platform for investigating how hybridization between 4f and 4d electrons influences the electronic transport, and the relationship between the density-wave transition and kagome structure.","The kagome lattice consists of interwoven triangles and hexagons, which inherently leads to geometric frustration[1, 2]. The band structure of the ideal kagome lattice exhibits the Dirac point, van Hove singularity (vHS), and flat band[3, 4, 5], with the latter two having a high density of states and large effective mass which may lead to strong electron correlations. With strong interaction between charged particles, an instability of Fermi surface may be induced, leading to various quantum phenomenon, such as superconductivity, charge density wave (CDW), pair density wave (PDW), and complex magnetism[6]. In contrast, the Dirac point with linear dispersion may results in various topological states[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Thus, the system with a kagome structure provides fertile ground for studying the interplay between magnetism, electron correlation, superconductivity and topology. In recent years, a new prototype structure based on kagome lattice was discovered, namely AV3Sb5 (A = K, Cs, Rb)[12], leading to extensive research on interplay and competition between various phases such as superconductivity, CDW, PDW, nematic and stripe order[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. With replacing V by Cr in this structure, a new kagome material CsCr3Sb5 was found to exhibit strong electron correlation, noteworthy that a flat band exists near the Fermi level; under high pressure, the density-wave transition in this sample was suppressed and unconventional superconductivity was observed[21]. Additionally, the CDW also has been discovered in antiferromagnetic ordered kagome phase FeGe[22], etc.. Compared to 3d elements like V, Cr, Fe, the element Ru possesses 4d electrons, and exhibits relatively weaker electron correlation but quite often shows magnetic feature, which may lead to other novel phenomena. With Ru atoms forming a kagome net, LaRu3Si2 possesses the highest superconducting transition temperature (T_{\mathrm{c}}) of 7.8 K among other compounds with the same structure, RT_{3}Si2 and RT_{3}B2 (R = rare earth metal, T = transition metal), highlighting the significant role of Ru’s 4d electrons in forming the superconductivity[23]. Very recently, charge order above room temperature in La(Ru1-xFex)3Si2 was also discovered[24]. Additionally, superconductor CeRu2 with C15 Laves phase, in which superconductivity may strongly intertwined with magnetism, features a Ru-kagome plane oriented perpendicular to the [111] direction[25, 26]. Despite incorporating rare-earth element Ce into the lattice, contrary to predictions, its 4f electrons are not localized; instead, they hybridize with conduction electrons leading to an intermediate valence state for Ce ions[27]. This hybridization involving 4f electrons can give rise to various correlated electronic phenomena such as heavy fermion, mixed-valence system, and unconventional superconductivity[28, 29]. The Laves phase is characterized by three predominant structural types, the hexagonal C14 type (MgZn2-type), the cubic C15 type (MgCu2-type), and the hexagonal C36 type (MgNi2-type)[30, 31]. Traditional Lave phase includes binary compounds with common formula of AB_{2}, however if substituting non-kagome-transition-metal element with non-metallic element Si will generate trinary Lave phase, such as Sc2Ir4-xSix, Mg2Ni3Si, and superconductor Mg2Ir3Si[32, 33]. In this study, we present a new Ru-based kagome material with the hexagonal structure: Ce2Ru3Si. Transport measurements reveal a shoulder-like behavior in the temperature dependent resistivity curve, indicative of a potential density-wave like transition; this finding is corroborated by specific heat measurements. Meanwhile, the magnetization curve basically obeys the Curie-Weiss law, and no obvious anomaly is observed. This discrepancy may be attributed to an enhanced delocalization degree of the 4f-electrons due to their hybridization with conduction electrons. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both the 4f-electron bands from Ce ions and the 4d-electron bands from Ru ions cross the Fermi level; notably, the 4d band from Ru forms a Mexican-hat-shaped band near the Fermi level, which gives rise to a vHS."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09892v1,Deep learning robotics using self-supervised spatial differentiation drive autonomous contact-based semiconductor characterization,"Integrating autonomous contact-based robotic characterization into self-driving laboratories can enhance measurement quality, reliability, and throughput. While deep learning models support robust autonomy, current methods lack pixel-precision positioning and require extensive labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a self-supervised convolutional neural network with a spatially differentiable loss function, incorporating shape priors to refine predictions of optimal robot contact poses for semiconductor characterization. This network improves valid pose generation by 20.0%, relative to existing models. We demonstrate our network’s performance by driving a 4-degree-of-freedom robot to characterize photoconductivity at 3,025 predicted poses across a gradient of perovskite compositions, achieving throughputs over 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping photoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals regions of inhomogeneity. With this self-supervised deep learning-driven robotic system, we enable high-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization techniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing the measurement of previously inaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving laboratories.","Results Workflow for autonomous robotic control using vision and CNNs Figure 1: Autonomous robotic process workflow for contact-based characterization of semiconductors. a, Synthesized and annealed drop-casted semiconductor films are fed into the autonomous process, consisting of computer vision segmentation of the semiconductor films, prediction of optimal robot poses using a spatially differentiable CNN (SDCNN), distance-minimizing path planning, and then robotic control with subsequent measurement. b, Photoconductivity and surface profilometry (smoothed) use-cases of the robotic contact-based characterization process. c, Average positional and rotational accuracy across 3,500 robot pose predictions with two standard deviation error bars for our proposed SDCNN method, compared against seven other models. Through optimal pose prediction from computer vision inputs, we autonomously drive a 4DOF robot with a four-point probe end effector to characterize the photoconductive properties of semiconductors spatially. Figure 1a illustrates this autonomous control pipeline. Firstly, semiconductor films are drop-cast offline from the autonomous feedback loop using an OpenTrons volumetric pipetter [32]. Then, an on-board camera takes an image of the semiconductors, \Phi_{\textrm{cam}}, which is then rectified from the camera reference frame to the robot reference frame using a series of calibration matrices, K: \Phi_{\mathrm{robot}}=K_{\mathrm{img\rightarrow robot}}\left(K_{\mathrm{cam% \rightarrow img}}\Phi_{\mathrm{cam}}\right)\;, (1) where K_{\mathrm{cam\rightarrow img}} rectifies \Phi_{\textrm{cam}} from the camera to the image reference frame and then K_{\mathrm{img\rightarrow robot}} rectifies \Phi_{\textrm{img}} from the image to the robot reference frame. Once, in the same coordinate frame as the robot, the Fast Segment Anything Model (FastSAM) [33] is used to quickly find the edges of each drop-casted film, creating image segments, I. Next, optimal poses are predicted directly onto the image segments using the proposed SDCNN model, an 8-layer CNN with customized spatially differentiable loss function. The optimality of each pose is determined using I as a prior in image space, which can be back-propagated into the network as a loss due to spatial differentiability. A stochastic Dijkstra’s planner [34] is used to find a travel route that minimizes the total distance to all predicted poses across all drop-casted films. Finally, the robot is controlled to each SDCNN-predicted pose to characterize the properties of the semiconductor at that location in space. The average positional and rotational accuracies of predicted poses by the SDCNN are shown to be higher than predictions coming from CNNs using existing loss functions (Fig. 1c), with improvements between 1.5% and 8.9%. Designing the SDCNN to predict poses with high positional accuracy and rotational uniqueness enables comprehensive spatial mapping of important measured semiconductor properties in the fewest number of poses. The spatial mapping capabilities of this autonomous workflow can be generalized to function with different contact-based end effectors. Figure 1b highlights two characterization use cases: photoconductivity and surface profilometry. Photoconductivity is measured at each predicted pose by taking the difference between illuminated and dark current-voltage curves (Fig. 1b, left). The blue-shaded regions highlight the spread of the photoconductive properties across the area of a drop-casted methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite film for a set of k=3 poses, predicted by the SDCNN to maximize the unique spatial area measured. These results indicate that photoconductivity is generally uniform across the area of this particular film. Conversely, the thickness of the film varies largely by tens of micrometers, measured using surface profilometry at the same spatially predicted contact poses (Fig. 1b, right). Utilizing different end effectors with the same driving SDCNN model, shows the ability to precisely it becomes possible to spatially resolve important properties of semiconductor materials in an autonomous fashion. Spatial differentiability for optimal robot pose prediction Figure 2: Creating a spatially differentiable loss function for image-based pose prediction. a, Image segment pixels (I_{X},I_{Y}) are passed through a Gaussian filter to maintain the differentiability of the edges. Predicted pose pixels, (\mathrm{Pose}_{X},\mathrm{Pose}_{Y}), from the SDCNN are superimposed onto the differentiable segment pixels, (I^{\prime}_{X},I^{\prime}_{Y}), using another Gaussian filter and sigmoid function, S(\cdot), to perform direct computation and back-propagation in image space. b, SDCNN architecture and differential predicted poses, (\mathrm{Pose}^{\prime}_{X},\mathrm{Pose}^{\prime}_{Y}), composed onto the image segment pixels, (I^{\prime}_{X},I^{\prime}_{Y}). The SDCNN is trained to predict poses onto the regions of the films with high spatial reward (orange region). Spatial differentiation enables our loss function to be differentiable across the pixel domain of an input, in turn, allowing for image-based computations to be back-propagated through the neurons of an SDCNN. Here, we use spatial differentiability to convert unsupervised learning into self-supervised learning by creating a pixel-based loss function that accepts shape priors as inputs to refine a prediction. We aim to have the SDCNN predict a set of k valid robot poses that will maximize the number of pixels making unique contact with the spatial area of each film. The image segments, I, and predicted poses, \{\mathrm{Pose}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{k}, are the shape priors to the loss function. This method is valid for convex shapes in general and does not assume a perfect circle (Fig. S-5). These shapes are first passed through Gaussian filters to ensure they are smooth and differentiable before being passed to the loss function, generating, I^{\prime} and \{\mathrm{Pose}^{\prime}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{k} (Fig. 2a). A predicted pose is a valid contact if all its pixels fall within the non-zero regions of the segment, otherwise, the pose is invalid. Pixels with zero values are considered the background. The SDCNN is trained to predict poses onto the pixel region of I^{\prime} with high spatial reward towards its center (Fig. 2b), tuned by changing the standard deviation of the Gaussian filter, \sigma (Fig. 2a). The spatially differentiable loss function consists of a tunable weighted sum of two optimization objectives: (1) maximization of the intersection of each pose with non-zero segment pixels and (2) maximization of the pose rotational variance to encourage pose uniqueness: \begin{split}\mathrm{loss}\left(I^{\prime},\{\mathrm{Pose}^{\prime}_{i}\}_{i=1% }^{k}\right)=&-\underbrace{\omega_{1}\sum_{i=1}^{k}\left(I^{\prime}_{XY}\circ% \{\mathrm{Pose}^{\prime}_{XY_{i}}\}_{i=1}^{k}\right)}_{\text{Maximize % intersection with segment}}-\underbrace{\omega_{2}\operatorname{Var}\left(\{% \mathrm{Pose}^{\prime}_{\theta_{i}}\}_{i=1}^{k}\right)\vphantom{\sum_{i=1}^{k}% }}_{\text{Maximize angular variance}}\\[4.30554pt] &\qquad\qquad\text{subject to}\quad\mathrm{Pose}^{\prime}_{i}\cap\mathrm{Pose}% ^{\prime}_{j}=\emptyset,\quad\forall\,i\neq j,\end{split} (2) where \omega_{1} and \omega_{2} are weights set to \omega_{1}=\omega_{2} and I^{\prime}_{XY}\circ\mathrm{Pose}^{\prime}_{XY} is the composition of the differentiable segment pixels onto the differentiable pose pixels. \mathrm{Pose}^{\prime}_{XY_{i}} and \mathrm{Pose}^{\prime}_{\theta_{i}} are the XY-pixel coordinates and the yaw-rotation angles, respectively, for i\in\{1,..,k\} unique differentiable poses. The objectives are negated to form a loss and are subject to the constraint of reducing the number of overlapping pixels between any two unique predicted poses. Figure 3: Comparison of performance across different CNN loss functions on the robot pose prediction task. a, Loss minimization procedure in image space using our spatially differentiable CNN (SDCNN). b, Predicted poses onto a subset of 9 experimentally synthesized semiconductor films for k=3 poses per film. Eight models are compared: ours (SDCNN), recent loss functions from literature designed for robust and spatial tasks (Reverse Huber [30], Wing [29], and Barron [31]), and conventional loss functions (mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Huber, and Poisson negative log-likelihood). N-number of valid contact poses that fully intersect with the drop-casted film are shown in white, and invalid poses are shown in red. The photocurrent curve at each valid pose is measured experimentally using the robotic system. c, Left: poses output by the same stochastic process used for generating the ground truth poses to train the conventional and robust models. Middle: success rate of generating k=3 valid poses for each film in the full set of 35 experimentally synthesized semiconductors across 100 unique trials. Right: computational performance of CNN inference time on the pose prediction task for the full set of films across 100 unique trials, run on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. Figure 3a illustrates this loss minimization procedure in image space. Before training, the network has a high loss since it has not learned how to use the shape priors, resulting in placing poses randomly. After training, the network learns to place poses in high-reward regions of shape priors. Figure 3b compares the performance on the valid pose prediction task of our SDCNN against 7 other CNN models that use existing loss functions. Corresponding photoconductivity curves are experimentally measured on the perovskite film using the 4DOF robotic system for each valid predicted pose. The CNN models for comparison use either recent loss functions from literature designed for robust and spatial tasks [29, 30, 31] or conventional loss functions. Aside from the loss function, all models have equivalent network architectures and training parameters. However, since the models using existing loss functions are supervised, a labeled set of poses for each input segment is generated using a stochastic process (Fig. 3c, left). The models using existing loss functions tend to cluster predicted poses tightly together, often resulting in close or partial overlaps. In contrast, our approach encourages predictions to be more spread apart, effectively utilizing the full segment prior, while still being within the segment boundaries. Furthermore, in addition to tight clustering, as shown in Fig. 3b, the existing models also have lower positional accuracy (Fig. 1c), resulting in fewer valid poses being successfully generated for this subset of 9 perovskite films, compared to our spatially differentiable model. In Fig. 3c (middle), we expand this analysis from 9 films to 35 films and perform 100 replicate trials of valid pose generation. Across these 100 trials, we demonstrate that our SDCNN model achieves improvements of 20.0% and 16.2% in the median success rate of generating valid poses over robust loss functions and conventional loss functions, respectively. Given these performance improvements, the inference time of our loss function is negligible compared to the hardware response time, increasing by only 2.4 ns, relative to the slowest tested loss function in our evaluation, Reverse Huber (Fig. 3c, right). Hence, utilizing spatial differentiability in a neural network for pose prediction tasks improves the reliability of autonomous robotics by successfully generating valid predictions without sacrificing compute speed, while also reducing the data labeling burden through self-supervision. Autonomous characterization of perovskite photoconductivity Figure 4: Photoconductivity of perovskite semiconductors characterized by an autonomous robotic platform controlled by a spatially differentiable CNN. a, Photoconductance, G_{\mathrm{ph}}, measured at 3,025 unique poses, predicted by the spatially differentiable CNN (SDCNN), across a gradient of drop-casted methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) mixed-halide perovskite semiconductor films, MAPb(Br1-xIx)3. b, All measured photocurrent, I_{\mathrm{ph}}, curves with colormap corresponding to G_{\mathrm{ph}} (slope of I_{\mathrm{ph}}). Measured I_{\mathrm{ph}} curves for the following perovskite film compositions: c, MAPb(Br0.94I0.06)3, d, MAPb(Br0.47I0.53)3, and e, MAPb(Br0.03I0.97)3. f, Top: images of synthesized MAPb(Br1-xIx)3 films. Bottom: spatially mapped G_{\mathrm{ph}} with Gaussian interpolation, collected using the autonomous robotic system. g, Perovskite films with non-uniform spatially-resolved G_{\mathrm{ph}}. Semiconductor self-driving laboratories are capable of rapidly synthesizing materials that must be quickly screened for photoactivity to identify compositions yielding functional semiconductors for applications like solar cells [35, 36, 37] and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [38, 39]. This need motivates the development of our coupled SDCNN and 4DOF contact-based robotic probe to characterize semiconductor photoconductivity autonomously at high-throughputs using an illuminating four-point probe end effector. The measured semiconductors during the campaign are a gradient of drop-casted methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) mixed-halide perovskite films, MAPb(Br1-xIx)3. Throughout the duration of a 24-hour campaign, 3,025 unique poses are predicted and measured by the SDCNN-controlled robotic system. Resulting in a characterization throughput of over 125 measurements per hour. At each SDCNN-predicted pose, the photocurrent, I_{\mathrm{ph}}, is measured as a function of voltage, V, by taking the difference between the illuminated and dark current-voltage curves. Then, photoconductance, G_{\mathrm{ph}}, can be characterized at each pose by computing the slope of each photocurrent-voltage curve: G_{\mathrm{ph}}=\frac{I_{\mathrm{ph}}}{V}=\frac{I_{\mathrm{light}}-I_{\mathrm{% dark}}}{V}\;. (3) Figure 4a shows all characterized values of G_{\mathrm{ph}} across the gradient of drop-casted perovskites, measured at 3,025 uniquely predicted contact poses by the SDCNN. The distribution of G_{\mathrm{ph}} along the y-axis for each composition illustrates the spatial variance of photoconductance across the area of each film with median values shown as black diamonds. An increasing trend in G_{\mathrm{ph}} is observed (dashed curve in Fig. 4a) as the composition shifts from MAPbBr3 to MAPbI3 under broad-band white light illumination. This is consistent with the decreasing bandgaps of the corresponding perovskite compositions from 2.3 to 1.6 eV [40], assuming similar thicknesses between samples. Figure 4b displays the full experimentally measured photocurrent-voltage curves, measured at each predicted pose. The spatially characterized I_{\mathrm{ph}} curves are highlighted for three perovskite films within the MAPb(Br1-xIx)3 gradient: bromine-rich (Fig. 4c), mixed (Fig. 4d), and iodine-rich (Fig. 4e). Data collected across several spatially distinct contact points for a given film allows us to generate a spatial map of experimental G_{\mathrm{ph}} values using a simple Gaussian interpolation (Fig. 4f, bottom). Detailed spatial mapping is critical for identifying defects or non-uniformities in material synthesis, which can significantly affect device performance. For example, based on the trend observed in Fig. 4a, we expect iodine-rich films to have higher G_{\mathrm{ph}} values across the area of the film area with only some expected spatial variation. However, in certain instances (Fig. 4g), we observe regions of very low G_{\mathrm{ph}} values, likely induced by early degradation or pinhole defects in the film. Hence, with highly resolved spatial data, which can now be collected in an autonomous and high-throughput fashion for key properties like photoconductance, the root causes of critical defects and non-uniformities can be better understood faster. In turn, the advancement of these autonomous spatial mapping capabilities supports the improvement of material and device quality within the semiconductor development pipeline."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09592v1,Is the gain-voltage dependence of SiPMs linear?,The gain-voltage dependence for SiPMs from Ref. [1] is reanalyzed and a non-linearity at the sub-percent level is observed. Simulations show that the non-linearity can be explained by the increase of the depletion depth of the avalanche region with over-voltage. A consequence of the non-linearity is that the voltage at which the discharge stops is systematically underestimated if a linear extrapolation is used.,"Silicon Photo-Multipliers (SiPMs) are arrays of avalanche photo-diodes, called pixels in this paper, operated above the break-down voltage. Typical pixel pitches are between 10 and 50 \upmum with sensitive SiPM areas of 1 to 6 mm2. Thanks to their excellent performance, single photon detection with a gain, G, of order 10^{6}, sub-nanosecond timing resolution, high photon-detection efficiency, operating voltages below 100 V, insensitivity to magnetic fields and moderate cost, they have replaced vacuum photo-multipliers in many applications. It has been observed that, as long as the probability that more than one photon converts in the active region of a pixel is low, G increases to a good approximation linearly with the bias voltage U_{b} above the breakdown voltage U_{\mathit{bd}}. Extrapolating this linear dependence to G=1, allows to estimate U_{\mathit{off}}, the voltage at which the discharge stops. It is found that U_{\mathit{off}}\approx U_{\mathit{bd}}. This paper discusses how well the linearity is satisfied and how valid the linear extrapolation is for determining U_{\mathit{off}}. Evidence for a non-linear gain-voltage dependence is reported in Refs.[2, 3], and explained by This is due to the progressive depletion of the epi-layer beneath the p-n junction, leading to a diode capacitance reduction with increasing bias voltage, thus a non linear gain dependence. The study presented confirms the observation and the explanation. The next section presents 1D electric field calculations as a function of U_{b} for a p-n pixel using a doping profile which is realistic for the center of a pixel. As expected, the depletion depth increases with U_{b}, which results in a decrease of the pixel capacitance, C_{\mathit{pix}}. From the formula (which ignores the effect of an additional capacitance parallel to the quenching resistor) G(U_{b})=\max\left(1,\frac{C_{\mathit{pix}}(U_{b})\cdot U_{b}-C_{\mathit{pix}}% (U_{\mathit{bd}})\cdot U_{\mathit{bd}}}{q_{0}}\right) (1) with the elementary charge q_{0}. It can be seen that a voltage-dependent C_{\mathit{pix}} results in a non-linear dependence of G(U_{b}). If C_{\mathit{pix}} does not change for U_{b}\geq U_{\mathit{bd}}, Eq. 1 simplifies to G(U_{b})=\max(1,C_{\mathit{pix}}\cdot(U_{b}-U_{\mathit{bd}})/q_{0}), which has been used so far in the literature. In the following section the experimental results for KETEK SiPMs with pixel pitches of 15 and 25 \upmum from Ref. [1] show, that a non-linearity similar to the one predicted by the simulation is observed. In addition, the difference of U_{\mathit{off}} using a linear and a quadratic fit to G(U_{b}) for the extrapolation to G=1 is presented. The last section summarizes the main results. In the Appendix results for the MPPC HPK 13360 -1325 are shown, which confirm the results obtained for the KETEK SiPMs."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09515v1,Application of signal separation to diffraction image compression and serial crystallography,"We present here a real-time analysis of diffraction images acquired at high frame-rate (925 Hz) and its application to macromolecular serial crystallography. The software uses a new signal separation algorithm, able to distinguish the amorphous (or powder diffraction) component from the diffraction signal originating from single crystals. It relies on the ability to work efficiently in azimuthal space and derives from the work performed on pyFAI, the fast azimuthal integration library. Two applications are built upon this separation algorithm: a lossy compression algorithm and a peak-picking algorithm; the performances of both is assessed by comparing data quality after reduction with XDS and CrystFEL.","X-ray macromolecular crystallography is one of the most successful methods to determine the atomic structure of biological molecules. The achievable diffraction quality may often be limited by radiation damage. Although cryogenic conditions permit to extend the lifetime of crystals in the X-ray beam and to increase the maximum absorbed dose before inducing damage, they may hinder physiologically relevant conformations. This limitation has renovated the interest for room temperature macromolecular crystallography by applying a more drastic approach to overcome the radiation damage problem by collecting data from thousands of small crystals, in what became known as serial crystallography. First developed at X-ray free electron laser sources (xfel) [Chapman2011, structure_sx] the method is currently applied also at synchrotron sources [ssx, ssx_desy, ssx_id13, ssx_diamond]. 1.1 Serial crystallography using synchrotron sources (SSX) Serial crystallography consists in exposing thousands of small crystals to the X-ray beam only once in a serial way. Diffraction is collected with a very high flux density, in order to extract the most information from a single shot. This is in contrast with traditional rotational crystallography, where a complete dataset is collected from a single crystal rotated around one (or several) axis. Those SSX images represent a slice through the reciprocal space, thus intersect a lower fraction of the reciprocal space as the crystal is still, in comparison with rotational crystallography. To achieve a complete dataset, thousands of frames have to be collected, individually indexed and then merged. The high flux needed to collect all diffraction signal from a single crystal within a single exposure makes the SSX technique a good candidate to benefit from the 4th generation synchrotron sources, such as the new ESRF-EBS update [EBS]. However, macromolecular crystallography beam-lines (MX) have been extremely specialized towards rotational data-collection and thus require modifications to the experimental setup to perfom SSX experiments. The synchrotron serial crystallography beamline (ID29 at the ESRF) has been built to have a dedicated environment to perform SSX experiments with a high flux (using a larger energy bandwidth with a multilayer monochromator), a high-speed chopper (to separate X-ray pulses), several sample delivery methods and a fast detector. 1.2 Jungfrau 4M detector Macro-molecular crystallography has enormously progressed in the last decades with to the introduction of photon-counting detectors [pilatus]. With their absence of read-out noise and their fast speed, the main limitation of photon-counting detectors is the achievable count-rate, i.e. how fast the electronic of a pixel is able to count arriving photons. Unlike photon-counting detectors such as the Eiger detector [Eiger], the Jungfrau detector [jungfrau2016] is an integrating detector, thus, it is not limited by the count rate, even under the very intense flux expected when recording Bragg-peaks. To cope with this photons density, every single pixel implements an automatic gain switching mechanism (3 levels) which offers a precision of the order of one third of a keV on the higher gain mode, a precision of the order of one photon in the intermediate level and the ability to cope with thousands of photons in the lower gain mode. Moreover, the Jungfrau is able to operate at two kilohertz, which means the image must be read every half millisecond. Since the Jungfrau detector is an integrating detector, dark current and flat-field correction have to be applied: every pixel has three, so called, pedestals and three gain values (one for each gain level). This large number of parameters per pixel makes the pre-processing of raw signal challenging at full speed: the signal from a single pixel, initially packed with 16 bits per pixel, gets expanded to 32 bits (floating point or integer value), doubling the required bandwidth and the storage size [jungfrau_PSI]. The ID29 beamline features a Jungfrau 4M detector, operating at 1kHz, pace imposed by the chopper and synchronized with the photon bunches from the ESRF. At nominal speed, the detector will produce 16 GBytes of pre-processed data per second, making the data analysis and storage extremely challenging. 1.3 Requirements for online data processing Serial crystallography is one of the techniques where online data processing is likely to have most impact: millions of images are to be collected, and existing detector already saturate the fastest storage systems, not even considering the cost of this storage. Beside this, only a few percentage of the frames are expected to contain diffraction signal and out of them, a fraction will be indexed, integrated and thus useful to solve the protein structure. Efficient processing of raw images is thus essential for SSX, with 4 levels of increasing complexity: • image reconstruction with pedestal correction • veto-algorithm: be able to sieve-out images with poor signal • save only pixels with diffraction signal • precise location of peak position with indexation [toro] • real-time integration of diffraction peaks . Reconstruction and pedestal correction have been already described in \citeasnounlima2. This document will focus on the subsequent steps: the detection of signal is addressed in section 2, sparse data compression in section 3, and peak-finding in section 4 before drawing some conclusions in section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09429v1,"AI-driven inverse design of materials: Past, present and future","The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, particularly such as the one based density functional theory, as well as high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials.

Undoubtedly, the evolution of novel materials is crucial for fostering technological breakthroughs, invigorating economic prosperity, and elevating the standard of living. Generally, materials science is a major scientific discipline dedicated to the study of advanced functional materials. The search for advanced materials through inverse design of materials is an important research field within materials science. Inverse design of materials essentially involves creating an optimization space based on the desired performance attributes of materials. This process strives to establish a high-dimensional, nonlinear mapping from material properties to structural configurations, while adhering to physical constraints. The development of inverse design of materials has garnered widespread attention in academic works and can be categorized into four major paradigms: \bullet Experiment-driven paradigm. The experimental-driven paradigm is the original method of material discovery, and these methods have played a crucial role in propelling the field of materials science forward. For example, Madame Curie used experiments to discover the new elements radium and polonium, Onnes discovered the superconductivity phenomenon in mercury [8], and the discovery of the high-temperature superconducting material MgB2 [9]. However, this experimental-driven paradigm heavily relies on trial-and-error experimentation, individual expertise, and phenomenological scientific theories. Moreover, these methods are characterized by iterative cycles of experiments and observations to determine the properties and behaviors of materials, which is not only time-consuming and resource-intensive but also leads to extended research cycles and increased costs. In materials research, a heavy dependence on personal experience is also common. Although experienced researchers can guide experimental design with their intuition and prior knowledge, this method is limited in terms of reproducibility and scalability. The quantification and transfer of personal experience often face challenges, hindering the process of knowledge accumulation and dissemination [10]. Additionally, personal biases and misunderstandings may arise due to individual backgrounds and cognitive limitations [2]. \bullet Theory-driven paradigm. The theory-driven paradigm emphasizes the key role of theoretical insights and computational models in materials science. This paradigm is characterized by the widespread use of molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamic models to understand and predict material behavior. These developments have, to a certain extent, simplified material research and enhanced the efficiency of investigations into new materials. There are some very famous materials and states of matter that were first predicted by theory and then verified experimentally, and these discoveries have extremely high scientific significance, even winning Nobel Prizes. In 1930, British physicist Paul Dirac derived the existence of “antimatter” from his quantum mechanical equations, suggesting that for every particle there is a corresponding antiparticle [11]. Dirac’s equations first predicted the existence of the positron, the antiparticle of the electron. In 1932, Carl Anderson discovered the positron in cosmic rays, confirming Dirac’s prediction [12]. Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936 for this discovery, and Dirac also received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 for his contributions to quantum mechanics, including the theoretical prediction of antimatter. John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer proposed the BCS theory, which explained the cause of superconductivity—the pairing of electrons to form Cooper pairs, leading to zero electrical resistance [13, 14, 15]. Although the BCS theory itself did not directly predict new materials, it became the foundation for research into low-temperature superconductivity. Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972 for their work. In 2005, Charles Kane and Eugene Mele predicted the existence of the quantum spin Hall effect through topological quantum theory, a phenomenon where edge state conduction occurs without an external magnetic field. This concept laid the foundation for topological insulators. In 2007, scientists first realized the quantum spin Hall effect in HgTe quantum wells, verifying the accuracy of the theory. These classic predictions demonstrate the powerful predictive ability of theoretical physics in the exploration of new materials and phenomena, and also promote the development of experimental physics. Many such theoretical breakthroughs ultimately won the Nobel Prize for experimental verification, marking significant advances in physics. Nevertheless, these theoretical frameworks often require complex mathematical models that are demanding in terms of computational resources and expertise. Their applicability may be limited, especially when it comes to material systems that exhibit multi-scale phenomena and complex interactions. \bullet Computation-driven paradigm. Established on the groundwork of theoretical progress, the computation-driven paradigm has risen alongside the surge in computational power and data accessibility. This paradigm leverages computational models to simulate material behaviors and inform the design process. The application of density functional theory (DFT) [16, 17, 18] and computational chemistry tools like Hartree-Fock theory has revolutionized our ability to predict and optimize material properties. The DFT has played a crucial role in investigating the electronic structure of graphene. It was through the DFT that the zero-band gap structure of graphene was uncovered, a feature that is essential for its electronic properties and holds significant potential for its application in electronic devices [19]. Furthermore, the Hartree-Fock method has been extensively applied in calculating molecular orbitals, such as in studies of water molecules, offering vital insights into their geometric and electronic characteristics [20]. The potency of these methods is clear in their capacity to manage complex systems that were once difficult to dissect. However, reliance on computational models introduces challenges, as the accuracy of predictions heavily relies on model quality and available computational resources. Additionally, high-throughput screening (HTP) and combinatorial screening have become significant methodologies for exploring new materials and systems. This approach greatly expedites the discovery and development of novel materials, particularly in drug discovery, catalyst design, and energy storage material development, where it allows for the parallel assessment of vast compound libraries to identify potential new materials [3]. Despite HTP’s achievements in materials science, challenges remain, including substantial resource requirements for physical or computational experiments, constraints by existing material libraries, and insufficient consideration of intricate relationships between material properties [21]. \bullet AI-driven paradigm. With the dawn of the big data era, materials science has transitioned into an AI-driven paradigm. Artificial Intelligence (AI) marks a significant shift within the engineering field, heralding an era defined by enhanced intelligence and automation. Both the widely utilized auto-regressive models based on the Transformer architecture [22] and the robust diffusion models [23, 24] have made substantial contributions to the advancement of inverse design of materials [25, 26, 27, 28]. The capacity of AI to discern patterns and formulate predictions from data has sparked notable transformations in materials science. By examining vast experimental data and computational simulation outcomes, AI models reveal intricate correlations between material properties and their underlying crystal structures [29, 30]. Furthermore, a recent survey [25] has integrated inverse design methodologies with machine learning models to forecast the mechanical properties of materials, including elastic modulus and yield strength, thus expediting the discovery and development of innovative materials. These data-driven strategies not only bolster the precision of predictions but also considerably shorten material development cycles. Consequently, “machine learning materials discovery” is garnering escalating research interest (See Figure 1 (a)). In parallel, the exponential growth of the total known materials over time highlights the accelerated pace of material discovery processes, with significant contributions from Google’s GNoME [31] and Meta’s OMat24 [32]. Figure 1: Trends in publications and citations in the field of “Machine Learning Materials Discovery” from 2019 to 2024. The left panel (a) illustrates the growth in the number of publications (represented by blue bars) alongside the total citations (depicted by the red line with markers), reflecting a significant increase in both metrics over the past few years. The right panel (b) presents the variation in the total known materials over time on a logarithmic scale, highlighting the acceleration of material discovery processes facilitated by GNoME [31] of Google and OMat24 [32] of Meta. This figure underscores the rapid development within the field of machine learning materials discovery Figure 2: Materials Science Research Paradigms This figure illustrates the evolution of research paradigms in materials science, emphasizing key milestones across various approaches. It highlights the increasing role of artificial intelligence in driving future materials discovery, with AI becoming the dominant force in shaping the field. The experiment-driven paradigm is exemplified by Marie Curie’s Nobel Prize-winning discovery of radium and polonium. The theory-driven paradigm is represented by Dirac’s equation, which predicted the existence of the positron, as well as the quantum spin Hall effect. The computation-driven paradigm is demonstrated through DFT calculations applied to materials such as MgB2, hydride superconductors, and graphene. Finally, the AI-driven paradigm showcases recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, including AlphaFold2, GPT-4, and AI-accelerated materials discovery, signaling the frontier of research in the field. As discussed before, AI-driven methods are not a new technical concept for inverse design of functional materials, but has evolved with the advance of AI over the decades. The experiment-driven and theory-driven paradigms mainly aim to discover new functional materials based on heavily trial-and-error experiments or theoretical models, while latest AI-driven methods concentrate on constructing the hidden mappings between material functions and crystal structures. From conventional experiment methods to data-driven methods, it is an important leap in using modern advanced computational methods to design target functional materials. In Figure 2, we delineate the evolution of materials science discoveries alongside the progression of time and technological advancements. Initially, the confirmation of new materials was primarily achieved through experimentation (such as Madame Curie’s discovery of new elements), which entailed substantial costs and numerous trials. Subsequently, theoretical paradigms were introduced, predicting physical properties that were later experimentally verified (for instance, the prediction and validation of semiconductors). With the advancement of computer technology and the enhancement of computational ability, high-throughput computational methods have become a significant avenue for the discovery of new materials. Ultimately, as the latest generation of technology, AI methods can efficiently generate and screen new functional materials by elucidating the hidden correlations between crystal structures and properties, thereby accelerating the discovery of new materials. In summary, throughout this evolutionary process, technological progress has enabled us to employ more sophisticated methods to expedite the discovery of new functional materials. In the existing literature, the inverse design of materials has been extensively discussed and surveyed [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. However, current surveys often focus on specific machine learning algorithms or particular types of materials, leading to a lack of systematic integration of diverse methodologies and a broad range of material systems. Many existing surveys predominantly concentrate on specific categories of materials or application scenarios, such as topological insulators or high-entropy alloys [33, 34], thereby failing to provide a comprehensive examination of AI-driven inverse design of materials. Specifically, there is a significant absence of comparative and analytical studies across different researches about AI-driven inverse design of materials, which hinders a holistic understanding of the advantages, disadvantages, and applicable contexts of various methodologies. These limitations pose challenges for readers attempting to fully grasp the overarching landscape of AI-driven inverse design of materials, particularly with respect to the dynamic evolution of new methods and their applications. Faced with both opportunities and challenges, it needs more attention on the research and development of AI-driven inverse design of materials. In order to provide a basic understanding of this research filed, this survey aims to address the gaps in the current body of research by comprehensively examining previous studies from two perspectives: the discovery of functional materials based on AI methods and the development of AI methods in materials science. We systematically analyze the latest advancements in AI technologies within the domain of inverse design of materials. We conduct an exhaustive survey of the literature to synthesize the pivotal discoveries, AI methods, and procedural methods in the inverse design of functional materials. We are also aware of several relative survey articles on inverse design of materials [35, 36]. The reference [36] provides an overview of the importance and utilization of graph neural networks (GNNs) within the realms of chemistry and materials science. GNNs can directly process the graphical representations of molecules and materials, thereby capturing the essential information required to characterize these materials. The review further outlines the fundamental principles of GNNs, including commonly used datasets and architectures, and emphasizes their critical role throughout the materials development. Another reference [35] systematically explores the research advancements of geometric GNNs in the applications of materials discovery and drug discovery. It emphasizes the significance of geometric graphs in scientific fields, particularly their ability to capture geometric features such as the three dimensional coordinates of nodes. The survey further defines geometric graphs and compares them with traditional graphs, elucidating their distinct characteristics. Additionally, it summarizes existing models, including invariant GNNs and equivariant GNNs. Our survey presents the latest advancements in functional materials accelerated by machine learning techniques, with particular emphasis on the robust representational capabilities of geometric GNNs. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of advanced generative models and large language models, highlighting their pivotal roles in driving materials discovery. In the end, we have gathered standard datasets and benchmarks that are crucial for material discovery, in order to advance the methods of AI-driven inverse design of materials. “All great achievements take time.”–The inverse design of materials has undergone a long development to achieve the latest successes. Our goal is to delve into the historical progression of material directional design, with a particular focus on the innovative approaches to material discovery that have arisen in the era of artificial intelligence. This survey will shed light on the critical issues inherent in inverse design of materials. Subsequently, we discuss the specific classes of materials that are currently at the forefront of materials science (including superconducting materials, magnetic materials and so on), and detail the AI technologies. We have also compiled a comprehensive overview of the evolution of AI technologies within the materials domain. It is our aspiration that the contributions presented in this paper will propel the field of AI-driven inverse design of materials to new heights of advancement. In what follows, we will introduce the the recent applications of AI-driven method in expediting the inverse design of functional materials in Section 2. We then elaborate on the development history of AI technology in the field of materials science in Section 4. Finally, we will briefly discuss a series of open problems and promising directions in the future in Section 4 and conclude in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09392v1,"How orbitals and oxidation states determine apparent topographies in
scanning tunneling microscopy: the case of fluorine on silver
surfaces","We use density functional theory calculations to characterize the early stages of fluorination of silver’s (100) and (110) surfaces. In the Ag(100) surface, the hollow site is the most favorable for F adatoms. In the Ag(110) surface, three adsorption sites, namely hollow, long bridge, and short bridge, exhibit similar energies. These locations are also more favorable than an F adatom occupying a vacancy site irrespectively of whether the vacancy was present or not in the pristine surface. The computed energy as a function of surface coverage is used to compute the equilibrium thermodynamics phase diagram. We argue that for the typical pressure and temperature of fluorination experiments, the state of the surface is not determined by thermodynamics but by kinetics. Combining these results with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) topographic simulations we propose assignments to features observed experimentally. We present a minimal model of the apparent topography of adatoms in different locations in terms of hydrogenic orbitals, explaining the observed trends. The model links the STM apparent topography to structural information and the oxidation states of the Ag atoms near the adatom.","The interaction of halogens, chalcogens, and other adatoms with metallic surfaces is of fundamental importance in several fields such as electrochemistry [1], corrosion, heterogeneous catalysis [2, 3, 4] and opens up the possibility to synthesize exotic quantum materials such as, for example, spin-1/2 silver fluorides [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Density functional theory (DFT) [17, 18, 1, 19, 20, 21, 22] is an invaluable theoretical tool to study atom adsorption on metal surfaces. DFT computations provide insights into key parameters, including the distance between the adatom and the upper metal layer, the proximity to the nearest metal atom, charge distributions among the atoms, changes in the work function induced by the adsorbate, and the energy associated with adsorption which is essential for thermodynamic considerations [23]. From the experimental point of view, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) provides unique information on how adatoms interact with metallic surfaces. STM provides an “apparent topography” (AT) of the surface. This, however, may be different from naive expectations based on the charge distribution. For example, operating in constant current mode, sometimes adatoms appear as protrusions but a depression is also possible, as well as a combination of both yielding a Mexican hat or “sombrero” shape. For example, sombrero shapes are observed in the case of sulfur [21], and oxygen [24] on silver. More recently, sombrero shapes have been observed for fluorine on silver surfaces [25]. This variety of ATs is due to the fact that the conductance depends on several factors, such as the density of states and the extension of orbitals. Therefore, modeling the STM data is mandatory to extract all the physical and chemical information from the STM results. Early theories [26, 27] of the ATs of adsorbed atoms on metallic surfaces were based on the jellium model. This provided insights into the bias dependence of the tunneling current and the apparent height of the adatom right at its center but did not give information on the apparent topography away from the center, i.e., what kind of feature the adatom produces. A more complete theory [28] in terms of a tight-binding model provided more detailed information on the ATs and predicted protrusions, depressions, and the sombrero shape depending on the adatom. DFT can compute [21] STM ATs based on the Tersoff-Hamann approximation [29, 30, 31] thus allowing the identification of the features observed in the experiment. In Ref. [25] low-temperature (LT)-STM measurements have been performed on the Ag(100) and Ag(110) surfaces of single crystals exposed to fluorine and hydrogen fluoride (HF). Here we present DFT computations to identify the energetically most favorable adatom locations and the corresponding ATs. We consider both adatoms on top of the ideal surfaces and adatoms in surface vacancy sites. We use the DFT results to estimate the range of fluorine gas chemical potential at which a given coverage is thermodynamically stable and compare it with the condition to have stable bulk phases. The energetics at small coverage allow us to propose assignments of the experimentally observed ATs to specific high-symmetry locations on the surfaces. This is complemented with computations of the ATs of the most stable adatom locations. Experimental ATs have a rich internal structure. As mentioned, the Ag(100) and some Ag(110) ATs show a sombrero shape, especially for negative voltage biases. Instead, ATs acquired with positive voltages tend to show a depression shape of the adatom. Simulated ATs in DFT generally reproduce this behavior although some discrepancies remain. As well known, DFT provides a wealth of information by including all relevant orbitals and a realistic effective potential. However, the trade-off is that it is not always straightforward to pinpoint the important factors determining the AT in terms of the chemistry and structure of the surface. To obtain a deeper understanding of the AT, we present a simplified orbital model of the STM topographies. This allows us to link the main observed features in STM data to information such as the out-of-plane distance from the Ag surface of the F adatom and the oxidation state of the nearby Ag atoms. Figure 1: Geometry of the first two layers of the (a)-(b) Ag(100) and (c)-(d) Ag(110) slabs. The square and rectangle drawn with red solid lines in (a) and (c) show the unit cell considered for each surface. The crystallographic axis on the left indicates the orientation of the bulk crystal associated to the Ag(100) surface. For the 110 surface shown in (c) the horizontal direction corresponds to [110] while the vertical direction corresponds to [001]. The highly-symmetric positions are indicated with yellow shapes for both surfaces. The light and dark gray spheres represent silver atoms from the topmost and the underlying layers, respectively. The distance between these two layers is indicated with an arrow in panels (b) and (d). The parameter \delta_{12} characterizes the interlayer distance relaxation for the two topmost layers. This work is organized as follows. The methods used are explained in Sec. II. Structural parameters and the energetics and diffusion barriers of adatoms are discussed in Sec. III.1. The thermodynamics of a silver surface exposed to fluorine gas is discussed in Sec. III.2. Results for the topographies of adatoms are discussed in Sec. III.3. Section III.4 deals with the explanation of the topographic features as the sombrero shape in terms of a simplified orbital model. The summary and conclusions of the work can be found in Sec. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09346v1,Quantum emitters in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride,"Hexagonal boron nitride has been experimentally shown to exhibit room-temperature single-photon emission. This emission is attributed to defect states in the wide band-gap of hBN, which allow new optical transitions between these dispersion-less defect levels. In this work, we study the new spectral features introduced by interacting atomic defects in consecutive layers of bilayer hBN. Density Functional theory simulations have been carried out to calculate the energy band structure, frequency-dependent complex dielectric functions, and Kohn-Sham states to demonstrate and understand the cause of the emission enhancements. We found that placing colour centres in the vicinity of each other in bilayer hBN introduces new polarization dependent spectral features, with strong dependence on the distance and relative orientation between atomic defects. Our results provide a pathway to engineering single photon emission in hBN via inter-defect interaction.","Figure 1: Emission enhancement in defected bilayer hexagonal boron nitride. a and b show the schematic diagrams for monolayer and bilayer hBN (with C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} point-defect), respectively. c and d show the optical absorbance spectra for the systems in a and b, respectively. The labelled numbers are the peak heights for the Lorentzian region (yellow) and bulk region (blue) of \alpha_{xx}. Defect engineering in hexagonal boron nitride is a promising pathway towards achieving single photon emission in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectral regions[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Theoretical studies on colour centres in hBN traditionally investigate the electronic and optical properties of atomic point-defects in monolayer hBN. The energy and brightness of these emissions is determined by the nature of the defect and its interaction with the host lattice (the monolayer hBN). In this work, we study the new spectral features introduced by placing colour centres in the vicinity of each other in bilayer hBN. In addition to this, our study also proposes a method to tune the emission energies, by altering the relative orientation and distance between the defects in the two layers. Although studies have been carried out to investigate the effect of combining individual atomic defects in monolayer hBN [4], extensive research has not been conducted yet to investigate the tuning of the quantum emission by changing the relative distance and orientation between individual defects. Combining defects in monolayer hBN has the effect of eliminating spin-splitting and introducing a single new defect state above the Fermi energy (but below the bulk conduction bands), leading to a strong optical transition between the two defect states (marked as 1 and 2 in Fig. 6b). However, when such a defect dimer is introduced in both layers of bilayer hBN, the number of total defect states is doubled, with a slight energy difference between the electronic levels (the states marked as 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Fig. 7 b). The new feature offered by defects in bilayer hBN is that by tuning the distance and orientation between the bilayer dimer defects, we can break or restore inversion symmetry of the defect state wavefunctions, which imposes certain selection rules determining the allowed optical transitions between defect states in bilayer hBN. This allows us to dictate how many optical transitions are allowed between the multiple defect states, and in some cases also allows us to create a polarized quantum emitter (see Fig. 8). In addition to this, combining defects in bilayer hBN also leads to enhancement in the single photon emission. The enhancement in spectral features is quantified by the relative heights of the peaks, corresponding to the single photon emission and bulk-band transitions, in the absorbance spectrum (see Fig. 1). The absorbance in Fig.1 is calculated from the frequency-dependent complex dielectric function using the following formula [6]: \alpha(\omega)=\frac{2\omega}{c}\sqrt{\frac{|\epsilon(\omega)|-\text{Re}[% \epsilon(\omega)]}{2}}. (1) In Fig. 1, the absorbance spectra for monolayer and bilayer hBN show that there is an enhancement of 18.4% in the relative peak heights (the peak height of the Lorentzian region divided by the peak height of the bulk region, as shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. 1d), when two C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} defects are allowed to couple with each other in bilayer hBN. The enhancement is explained by the splitting of the bands in the band structure, when a second layer of hBN (with C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} defect) is superposed on top of the first layer of hBN (also with C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} defect). The band splitting gives rise to extra defect states below and above the Fermi energy, allowing for extra optical transitions with nearly the same energies. This result suggests that the emission from the bilayer is not simply an incoherent sum of the two monolayer defect spectra but rather shows a complicated behaviour involving inter-defect interaction. In the following sections, we study this interaction in more details highlighting the tunability of the spectral features of the single photon emission in the bilayer system. We begin by studying the optical and electronic properties of pristine monolayer and bilayer hBN, and see how these properties change with the addition of C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} defects in the monolayer and bilayer systems. Furthermore, we also investigate how the complex dielectric tensor changes when the distance and orientation between the defects is varied in bilayer hBN, and we explain these changes by looking at the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions for the resulting defect states."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09035v1,Coherently Coupled Carrier and Phonon Dynamics in Elemental Tellurium Probed by Few-Femtosecond Core-Level Transient Absorption,"The narrow bandgap semiconductor elemental tellurium (Te) has a unique electronic structure due to strong spin-orbit splitting and a lack of inversion symmetry of it’s helical lattice. Using broadband extreme ultraviolet core-level transient absorption, we measure simultaneously the coherently coupled photo-induced carrier and lattice dynamics at the Te N4,5 edge initiated by a few-cycle NIR pulse. Ultrafast excitation of carriers leads to a coherently excited A1g phonon oscillation and the generation of a hot carrier population distribution that oscillates in temperature, and the phonon excursion and hot carrier temperature are \pi out of phase with respect to each other. The depths of modulation suggest a significant coupling between the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in Te. A long-lived shift of the absorption edge suggests a metastable excited state of Te in a new equilibrium potential energy surface that lives on the order of the carrier recombination timescale. The observed phonon-induced oscillations of the hot carriers are supportive of a semiconductor-to-metal light-induced phase transition, whereby Te becomes more metallic with increasing phonon-induced displacement. Additionally, near the Fermi level we observe an energy-dependent phase of the displacive excitation of the A1g phonon mode. The discovery of coherent coupling between the lattice and hot carriers in Te provides the basis to investigate coherent interactions between spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The results spectrally and temporally resolve the correlation between photo-excited hot carriers and coherent lattice excitations, providing insight on the optical manipulation of the tellurium electronic structure at high carrier densities exceeding {10}^{21}\text{\,}{\mathrm{cm}}^{-3}.","Tellurium (Te) is an elemental semiconductor that has attracted extensive interest due to its chiral structure of connected Van der Waals helical chains [1]. The strong spin-orbit interaction and chiral structure lead to many exotic electronic properties that include radial spin textures [2], topological phase transitions [3], and a quantum Hall effect [4]. An exceptionally high field effect mobility [5], resistance to oxidation [5], and thickness-tunable band gap of Te nanowires enables potential application in p-type transistors at the quantum confinement scale [6]. The high level of nested electronic bands also inherently leads to favorable thermoelectric properties in p-type Te where knowledge of carrier-phonon scattering is of vital importance [7]. Underlying these favorable properties are two anisotropic lone electron pairs at the valence band maximum (VBM) and isotropic anti-bonding 5p-orbitals at the conduction band minimum (CBM). Important to realizing applications with Te is understanding the non-equilibrium carrier dynamics in both its valence and conduction bands. Manipulation of the chiral structure is possible by excitation of the electrons, which thus enables coupling of the electronic, lattice, and spin degrees of freedom. This is achievable via intense ultrafast laser pulses that may induce dynamic coupling between the electrons and lattice [8]. While optical-pump probe [9, 8, 10] and photoelectron spectroscopy [11] have made progress in the measurement of lattice and carrier dynamics in Te, simultaneous measurement remains difficult. In these regards, a time-resolved spectroscopic method that can resolve both the hot carriers and excited lattice configuration will be helpful in understanding the coupling of the lone pair and anti-bonding orbitals to obtain useful properties. In previous ultrafast studies of elemental Te, laser excitation was shown to induce a transient semiconductor-to-metal transition by distortion along the A1g phonon coordinate [8, 10, 12]. It was also demonstrated, using polarized optical transient reflectivity spectroscopy, that there is a band-splitting in the conduction band minimum that emerges at the H-valley and decays over 30 ps by relaxation of the carriers to the ground state [13]. More recently, it was determined with transient reflectivity in the mid-IR spectral region that the Auger recombination at the H-valley occurs over the same timescale [14]. Coherent dynamics of the A1g phonon have been studied extensively [15], investigating the impacts of carrier density, diffusion [9], and electronic softening [16] of the mode. Further investigation is needed as to how the A1g coherent phonon motion couples to the hot carriers that influence these effects and how hot carriers are possibly associated with a light-induced phase transition. In this work, we provide experimental characterization of the hot carrier dynamics and their coupling to the lattice via broadband extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption measurements at the Te N4,5 edge of Te thin films. The core-level transitions from the Te 4d shell to the Fermi level probe the carriers in the valence band structure, changes to the lattice, and transient modification of the electronic structure with few-femtosecond resolution. We: (1) track the carrier thermalization and cooling processes, (2) characterize coherent coupling of the lattice and electronic degrees of freedom, and (3) measure the photo-induced lattice distortion coupled to the electronic structure. By exciting Te with a few-femtosecond laser pulse that spans visible to NIR wavelengths (500-1000 nm), at carrier densities around {10}^{21}\text{\,}{\mathrm{cm}}^{-3}, we observe the generation of hot holes and electrons in the electronic band structure and coherent excitation of the A1g phonon mode. The high energy carriers rapidly thermalize through electron-electron (<5 fs) and electron-phonon (0.15(1) ps) scattering to a hot Fermi-Dirac distribution and subsequently cool over the course of 1.60(2) ps. Due to coupling between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom, excitation of the A1g mode coherently modulates the temperature of the hot carriers with an observed nearly \pi phase difference between the hot carriers the phonon-driven displacement. We attribute this to a variation of the electronic heat capacity as Te becomes more metallic when the structure is symmetrized by the A1g mode. This coherent anti-correlation between phonon excursion and carrier temperature, predicted by Giret et al. [17] and previously observed in the A7 semimetals [18, 19] and CDW materials [20], is also now observed in a degenerate semiconductor. Further, we measure a long-lived distortion of the lattice along the A1g phonon mode coordinate that decays over 31(2) ps. This is consistent with the hypothesis that carrier recombination times in Te [14] determine the lifetime of the metastable phase. Lastly, we resolve the spectral phase of the coherent phonon, which provides insight into the effects of hot carrier relaxation in the generation of the A1g phonon and identify a -0.51(3)\pi rad phase at the frequency attributed to weak excitation of the E1TO phonon."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08946v1,"The rich structural, electronic and bonding landscape of 1T-type TaTe single-layers","Charge density waves (CDW) in single-layer 1T-MTe2 (M= Nb, Ta) recently raised large attention because of the contrasting structural and physical behavior with the sulfide and selenide analogues. A first-principles study of fourteen different 1T-type TaTe2 single-layers is reported. The importance of Te to Ta electron transfer and multicenter metal-metal bonding in stabilizing different structural modulations is highlighted. Analysis of the electronic structure of the optimized structures provides a rationale for what distinguishes 1T-TaTe2 from the related disulfide and diselenide, what are the more stable structural modulations for 1T-type TaTe2 single-layers, the possible role of Fermi surface nesting on some of these CDW instabilities, how the CDW affects the metallic properties of the non-distorted lattice and the possibility that some of these CDW phases exhibit exotic properties. All CDW phases studied exhibit band structures typical of metallic systems although some exhibit both very flat and dispersive bands at the Fermi level so that Mott effects could develop; one of the (4\times4) phases studied exhibits a Dirac cone at the Fermi level.","The field of charge density wave (CDW) materials has experienced a spectacular development in the last decade. Both new materials and challenging properties have been reported [1, 2, 3, 4]. Importantly, some of these properties have even paved the way for practical applications [5, 6]. Group V transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) have played a central part in our understanding of the diversity of electronic instabilities in low-dimensional conductors. The discovery of the structural modulations in bulk groups IV and V TMDC almost fifty years ago [7, 8] played a decisive role in calling attention to the rich and novel physics of very anisotropic conductors. Group V TMDC are built from MX2 layers (M= V, Nb, Ta; X= S, Se, Te) where M can exhibit either an octahedral (1T-type polymorphs) or trigonal prismatic coordination (2H-type polymorphs). These systems have been and remain controversial for many reasons [9]. For instance, the possibility of either strong or weak electron–phonon coupling CDW scenarios [1] and the competition between CDW and superconductivity in 2H-MX2 (M = Nb, Ta; X = S, Se) have been discussed for decades. The MX2 layers interact through weak van der Waals forces and thus they are easily exfoliated. Consequently, it is possible to examine the more interesting and controversial issues at the two-dimensional (2D) limit as well as by smoothly changing the density of carriers through gate doping. This is at the origin of the impressive revival of interest recently raised by these materials [10, 11, 12]. Indeed, intriguing differences of these few-layers or even single-layer materials with their bulk counterparts have been discovered [13, 14]. An interesting aspect which is now the object of large attention is the difference between group V MX2 tellurides from sulfides and selenides. In general, the valence bands of transition metal tellurides are noticeably wider than those of selenides or sulfides because the Te 5p orbitals are considerably more diffuse than the S 3p and Se 4p ones. Therefore, there is often a substantial overlap of the Te-based valence bands with the bottom part of the transition metal-based d bands leading to a non-negligible electron transfer from tellurium to the transition metal atoms [15, 16]. These electron transfers have strong implications for the structural and transport properties of many transition metal tellurides which often exhibit crystal structures and transport properties differing from those of the corresponding selenides or sulphides [17]. Bulk MX2 (M= Nb, Ta; X= S, Se) are found in both the 1T and 2H hexagonal polymorphs and in both cases they exhibit CDW. In contrast, bulk MTe2 (M= V, Nb, Ta) are only found in a strongly distorted monoclinic 1T’-type structure [18]. From now on except when otherwise stated we will always refer to 1T-type (octahedral) TaTe2 structures. Figure 1: Top layer of the bulk structure of 1T-TaTe2 (a), 1T’-TaTe2 (i.e. (3\times1)-TaTe2) (b) and (3\times3)-TaTe2 (c). For simplicity, the Te atoms are not shown in (b) and (c). The dashed red (b) and blue (c) repeat units are those used for the (3\times1) and (3\times3) single-layer calculations. In (d) the relationship between the BZ of the three single-layers is schematically shown. The different Ta-Ta bonds referred to in the discussion are shown in (e). Bulk TaTe2 at room temperature is metallic [19, 20, 21] and exhibits a distorted 1T’ structure [18] containing very peculiar double zigzag chains in the Ta sublattice (see Fig. 1b). Such a distinctive structure, only shown by group V MTe2 (M= V, Nb, Ta), is thought to occur as a result of the above mentioned large Te to Ta electron transfer [16]. Because of the trimeric zigzag chains, each layer of 1T’-TaTe2 can be thought of as a (3\times1) reconstruction of an ideal, non distorted 1T-TaTe2 structure (Fig. 1a). Bulk 1T’-TaTe2 undergoes a structural modulation around 170 K below which the zigzag trimeric chains rearrange and the periodicity along the chains becomes three times larger [22]. Consequently, below 170 K the layers can be described as a (3\times3) reconstruction of 1T-TaTe2 (Fig. 1c). Let us note that the emergence of a (\sqrt{1}9\times\sqrt{1}9) periodicity in bulk has already been known for some time [23, 24] although a full structural characterization of the latter was not reported. The metallic character of 1T’-TaTe2 is kept across the 170 K transition, although anomalies in the resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat capacity have been detected [22, 25, 20]. It is worth noting that bulk 1T’-NbTe2 does not exhibit the low-temperature transition towards the (3\times3) modulated structure. 1T’-NbTe2 is an ambient pressure superconductor (T_{c}= 0.4 K) [26] but (3\times3)-TaTe2 it is not. However, under pressure, when apparently the (3\times3) CDW is suppressed, three different superconducting states have been reported [27]. One could assume that the absence of Te…Te inter-layer interactions would make single-layers of group V transition metal ditellurides more similar to disulfide and diselenides. However, this is not the case: intra-layer Te…Te interactions still make tellurides very different. Recent works on single- or few-layer NbTe2 and TaTe2 [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33] have made clear that they exhibit different and more complex structures than those of the corresponding sulfides and selenides. In addition, both the NbTe2 and TaTe2 single-layers have been found to occur with several different structures, some of which having modulations with large unit cells as for instance (4 \times 4) [34], (\sqrt{1}9\times\sqrt{1}9) [30] and even (\sqrt{2}8\times\sqrt{2}8) [28]. Apparently, the energy differences between the different structures are not large enough and different phases or even phase coexistence can be prepared. This is a remarkable difference with sulfides and selenides. There have been several theoretical studies concerning TaTe2 bulk [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41] and single layers [42, 43, 31, 30, 33], although many of them deal either with the well-known 1T, 1T’ and (3\times3) structures, the star-of-David structure of TaSe2 or the particular structures suggested by the associated experimental studies. Comparative studies of a broad range of possible structures trying to unravel the structural and electronic factors favoring each structure are notoriously lacking. This is a serious handicap since recent works have clearly shown that single-layers or few-layers thick TaTe2 phases that do not correspond to the more stable one can be indeed prepared and characterized [31, 30, 33]. Although the non-occurrence of the (3\times3) structure for NbTe2 and the absence of superconductivity at ambient pressure in TaTe2 suggests some fundamental difference between NbTe2 and TaTe2, the previous observation points also the need to consider if different structures, characterized or proposed for the other group V MTe2 single-layers, are likely to be observed for TaTe2. Whereas some of the considered structures are normal metals, other display interesting electronic structures around the Fermi level and may exhibit unconventional properties. For instance, a recent theoretical study on single-layer NbTe2 suggested that the ground state could be a (4\times4) CDW non trivial topological insulator [34] and later a similar result was proposed for hole-doped TaTe2 [44]. From the viewpoint of the chemical bonding, TaTe2, like the other group V ditellurides, does not behave as expected for an octahedrally coordinated d^{1} transition metal atom in hexagonal-based layers. In fact, understanding the occurrence of the trimerized double zigzag chains (Fig. 1b) has been a challenge for longtime [16, 45]. Under such circumstances, a general theoretical study of TaTe2 single-layers where all structures are considered on the same footing and where both structural, electronic and bonding features are compared would be of major value. In particular we would like to understand the following questions: what distinguishes 1T-TaTe2 from the related disulfide and diselenide?, what are the more stable structural modulations for TaTe2 single-layers?, is Fermi surface nesting at the origin of some of these CDW instabilities?, how the CDW affects the metallic properties of the non distorted lattice?, can some of these CDW phases exhibit exotic properties? In this work, we report a study of a large series of possible CDW structures for 1T-type TaTe2 single-layers and we develop a detailed analysis of the so far unclear relationship between structure and bonding. A very rich structural and electronic landscape emerges which we hope can provide useful guidelines to stabilize different TaTe2 CDW.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09699v1,"Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and
Application to Rare-Earth Magnets","Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective \mathbb{Z}_{2} chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoemission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.","Magnetic topological semimetals with cubic symmetries in the parent state, particularly those found in rare-earth magnets with rock-salt structures Hirschberger et al. (2016); Schrunk et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2023); Kushnirenko et al. (2022, 2023); Wu et al. (2019), have recently gained attention. The cubic space group permits several point group symmetries that can protect topological band crossings Chiu et al. (2016). These include three- and four-fold rotational symmetries which can individually stabilize crossings between pairs of Kramer’s degenerate bands, giving rise to three-dimensional Dirac semimetals (DSMs) Yang and Nagaosa (2014). Therefore, cubic crystals offer a promising platform for realizing cubic-symmetric DSMs. Over the past decade, several cubic-symmetric materials have been proposed as DSM candidates. Notably, ab initio calculations have identified several full Heusler alloys Guo et al. (2017a); Mondal et al. (2019), along with Pd and Pt oxides as potential DSMs Li et al. (2017). More recently, experiments on the cubic material PtBi2 Wu et al. (2019) have revealed existence of Fermi-arc like surface states, leading to the suggestion that it is an DSM. Moreover, cubic-symmetric DSM states have been proposed as parent phases for magnetic Weyl semimetals Duan et al. (2018); Guo et al. (2017b); Huang et al. (2020). Despite the growing body of literature supporting the existence of DSMs in cubic crystals, the extent to which Dirac semimetallic features influence the electronic behavior of cubic crystalline materials remains unclear and has yet to be systematically explored. (a) (b) Figure 1: Universal bulk-characteristics and phase diagram of symmetry-protected Dirac semimetals (DSMs). (a) The minimum number of Dirac points (red dots; DPs) in rotational-symmetry protected DSMs is 2, which lie along the rotation axis (highlighted in blue). (b) In cubic-symmetry protected DSMs the minimum number of DPs is 6 which appear along the three symmetry-equivalent, fourfold-rotation axes. In inversion and time-reversal symmetry preserving systems, there are two types of DSMs, sd and sp [sd and sf], in category (a) [(b)]. (inset) Respective phase diagrams supported by the minimal Hamiltonians describing these phases on (a) tetragonal and (b) simple cubic lattices. Here, “TI” and “OI” are acronyms for topological insulator and ordinary insulator. Understanding cubic-symmetric DSMs poses two key challenges, however. First, the multiple equivalent rotation axes and mirror planes in cubic systems can protect a variety of bulk-band crossings, complicating the interpretation of experimental data. As a result, early theoretical works on DSMs primarily focused on trigonal, tetragonal, and hexagonal systems, which feature a single principal rotation axis. Through minimal Hamiltonians, various aspects of the physics of rotational-symmetry protected DSMs have been addressed, including nature of band-topology Kargarian et al. (2016, 2018); Wieder et al. (2020); Tyner et al. (2023); Fang and Cano (2021), classification schemes Yang and Nagaosa (2014); Yang et al. (2015a); Gao et al. (2016), and experimental implications Burkov and Kim (2016); Armitage et al. (2018). Insights from such minimal modeling have led to the identification of several candidate materials Wang et al. (2012, 2013); Le et al. (2017, 2018); Kim et al. (2019); Tang et al. (2016), and interpretation of experimental investigations into tetragonal Liu et al. (2014a); Neupane et al. (2014); Borisenko et al. (2014, 2020); Zhang et al. (2019); Lv et al. (2015); Kong et al. (2021) and hexagonal Liu et al. (2014b); Xu et al. (2015a); Xiong et al. (2015); Zhang et al. (2017); Yang et al. (2023) symmetric Dirac materials. Second, theoretical investigations have revealed an absence of a robust bulk-boundary correspondence in rotational-symmetry protected DSMs Kargarian et al. (2016, 2018); Wieder et al. (2020); Tyner et al. (2023); Fang and Cano (2021), in sharp contrast to topological insulators and Weyl semimetals (67) . Since surface states have been pivotal in probing the bulk topology of topological materials Armitage et al. (2018); Lv et al. (2021), this feature of symmetry-protected DSMs complicates the diagnosis of their bulk-topology using surface-sensitive techniques such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Some of this ambiguity can yet be resolved by examining the universal features of minimal models, which offer a clearer framework for associating surface state characteristics with bulk topological properties. Here, we systematically develop a theory of non-magnetic DSMs in cubic crystals, and demonstrate the universal aspects of the relationship between various space group symmetries and observable properties of such DSMs. We find two classes of cubic-symmetric DSMs, based on the parity of the orbitals that hybridize to give rise to Dirac points (DPs). In analogy to similar classification of rotational-symmetry protected DSMs Wieder et al. (2020), we name them sd-DSM (orbitals with same parity) and sf-DSM (orbitals with opposite parity). In both cases the minimum number of DPs is six, which is three times larger than those in rotational-symmetry protected DSMs; see Fig. 1. This feature indicates that the surface states in cubic-symmetric DSMs are qualitatively distinct than those in rotational-symmetry protected DSMs. We construct minimal models to study the topology of the Bloch wavefunctions, identify the universal symmetry-protected features of the surface states, and the nature of spin-momentum locking the latter supports. More specifically, in the sd-DSM we identify an effective \mathbb{Z}_{2} chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Further, by incorporating candidate magnetic orders that may develop as instabilities of cubic-symmetric DSMs, we show that this framework could provide insights into key spectral features observed in rare-earth magnets. We further make specific predictions that can validate the role of DSM physics and also identify potential cubic materials that could be experimentally tested for similar phenomena. Overall, our study suggests that DSM physics may offer a coherent framework for understanding surface states in magnetic topological semimetals with cubic parent symmetries, connecting various materials, and clarifying their origins."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09662v1,On the Ferrimagnetic State of CrCl(pyz),"Van der Waals layered ferromagnetic compounds with high two-dimensional electronic conductivity holds strong potential for quantum computing, future unconventional superconductors, catalysts, batteries, and fuel cells. We suggest a minimal theoretical model to understand the magnetic properties of the metal-organic framework CrCl2(pyz)2 (pyz=pyrazine). Using a Hubbard model we show that the groundstate is dominated by a specific configuration of delocalized electrons on the pyz sites with a ferrimagnetic coupling to the localized spins on the Cr sites. This model suggests a magnetic moment of 2\mu_{B} which is remarkably close to the experimental value of 1.8\mu_{B} [K. S. Pedersen et al., Nat. Chem. 10, 1056-1061 (2018)]. From Weiss mean-field theory we predict a weak ferromagnetic Cr-Cr coupling of \approx 0.9 meV. This is consolidated by second order perturbation theory of the RKKY interaction yielding a Cr-Cr coupling of \approx 5 meV. Understanding the interactions in these types of compounds can facilitate designs of metal-organic compounds with tailored magnetic properties.","Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been predicted to serve as a platform for the next generation of quantum technology [1, 2]. The diversity of organic ligands compared to metal ligands allow for enhanced tunability of electronic and magnetic properties. These compounds may be key to harvest renewed insights into and exploitation of quantum phenomena such as the Quantum Hall Effect [3, 4, 5], topological insulators [6] and superconductivity [7]. The putatively first organic-inorganic hybrid 2D MOF, CrCl2(pyz)2 (pyz = pyrazine), was successfully synthesized in 2018 [8]. CrCl2(pyz)2 exhibits both long-range magnetic order and high 2D electronic conductivity. The compound has a Curie temperature of 55 K, and its magnetization at low temperatures saturates to 1.8 \mu_{B} in strong external fields. This indicates an intralayer ferrimagnetic coupling in agreement with predictions by density functional theory (DFT) [9, 10]. First principle calculations indicate that CrCl2(pyz)2, like other hybrid materials [11, 12, 13], can be exfoliated making it relevant for 2D applications [9]. The majority of 2D materials are non-magnetic in their pristine form [14]. A magnetic 2D material, like CrCl2(pyz)2, could have applications within spintronics [15], multiferroics [16, 17, 18] and magnetoelectronics [19]. This material could possibly even have applications within dark matter detection [20, 21, 22]. The sibling coordination solids VCl2(pyz)2 and TiCl2(pyz)2 display contrasting physical properties. In the former, divalent V ions facilitate an antiferromagnetically ordered ground state, while in the latter trivalent Ti ions favor paramagnetism and a correlated Fermi liquid state [23]. In principle, this opens the possibility for tuning through exotic phase transitions via doping. This may be compared to the magnetic phase transitions proposed for Mn2-xCr2Sb [24, 25] and Mn2Sb1-xBix [26]. Finally, the perovskite S2FeMoO6 may be highlighted as another material in which the coexistence of itinerant and localized electrons cause an ordered, in this case putatively ferromagnetic, ground state [27, 28]. A crucial step towards synthesizing materials with desired magnetic properties is to understand the mechanism yielding these properties. Here we provide a simple explanation of the ferrimagnetic coupling and explain why the magnetic moment of CrCl2(pyz)2 is approximately 2\mu_{B}. As such, we propose a minimal model for monolayer CrCl2(pyz)2 that captures the essential features of chromium couplings mediated by intermediate and itinerant pyrazine electrons. First, we compute a tight-binding model using a Slater–Koster procedure to obtain hopping parameters. From this we propose an effective model relevant for the valence electrons. The ground state configuration of the model is investigated before a magnetic field is introduced and the magnetic moment is computed. Using mean-field theory an estimate of the Cr-Cr coupling is found. Finally, the exchange interaction between electrons on neighboring chromium and pyrazine sites is calculated and an expression of the indirect exchange interaction coupling between neighboring chromium sites is obtained using second order perturbation of the RKKY interaction. From this we predict an estimate of the coupling between the localized Cr spins and the itinerant pyz electrons."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09631v1,NEP-MB-pol: A unified machine-learned framework for fast and accurate prediction of water’s thermodynamic and transport properties,"Water’s unique hydrogen-bonding network and anomalous properties present significant challenges for accurately modeling its structural, thermodynamic, and transport behavior across varied conditions. Although machine-learned potentials have advanced the prediction of individual properties, a unified computational framework capable of simultaneously capturing water’s complex and subtle properties with high accuracy has remained elusive. Here, we address this challenge by introducing NEP-MB-pol, a highly accurate and efficient neuroevolution potential trained on extensive MB-pol reference data with coupled-cluster-level accuracy, combined with path-integral molecular dynamics and quantum-correction techniques to incorporate nuclear quantum effects. This NEP-MB-pol framework reproduces experimentally measured structural, thermodynamic, and transport properties of water across a broad temperature range, achieving simultaneous, fast, and accurate prediction of self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Our approach provides a unified and robust tool for exploring thermodynamic and transport properties of water under diverse conditions, with significant potential for broader applications across research fields.","I Methods The NEP model. In the NEP approach, the site energy U_{i} of atom i can be written as U_{i}=\sum_{\mu=1}^{N_{\mathrm{neu}}}w^{(1)}_{\mu}\tanh\left(\sum_{\nu=1}^{N_{% \mathrm{des}}}w^{(0)}_{\mu\nu}q^{i}_{\nu}-b^{(0)}_{\mu}\right)-b^{(1)}, (1) where \tanh(x) is the activation function, \mathbf{w}^{(0)}, \mathbf{w}^{(1)}, \mathbf{b}^{(0)}, and b^{(1)} are the weight and bias parameters. The descriptor q_{i}^{\nu} is an abstract vector whose components group into radial and angular parts. The radial descriptor components q_{n}^{i} (0\leq{n}\leq n_{\rm max}^{\rm R}) are defined as q_{n}^{i}=\sum_{j\neq{i}}g_{n}(r_{ij}), (2) where r_{ij} is the distance between atoms i and j and g_{n}(r_{ij}) are a set of radial functions, each of which is formed by a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials. The angular components include n-body (n=3,4,5) correlations. For the 3-body part, the descriptor components are defined as (0\leq{n}\leq n_{\rm max}^{\rm A}, 1\leq{l}\leq l_{\rm max}^{\rm 3body}) q_{nl}^{i}=\sum_{m}(-1)^{m}A_{nlm}^{i}A_{nl(-m)}^{i}; (3) A_{nlm}^{i}=\sum_{j\neq i}g_{n}(r_{ij})Y_{lm}(\hat{\bm{r}}_{ij}). (4) Here, Y_{lm} are the spherical harmonics and \hat{\bm{r}}_{ij} is the unit vector of \bm{r}_{ij}. Note that the radial functions g_{n}(r_{ij}) for the radial and angular descriptor components can have different cutoff radii, which are denoted as r_{\rm c}^{\rm R} and r_{\rm c}^{\rm A}, respectively. These and other hyperparameters used in our NEP-MB-pol and NEP-SCAN models are presented in Supplementary Notes 1. Density-functional theory. The SCAN dataset is generated using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP, version 6.3.0)[68] to calculate energy, force, and virial. The SCAN energy functional is employed to model the exchange-correlation energy. To account for the non-spherical contributions to the gradient correction within the PAW sphere, the flag LASPH is set to TRUE. A kinetic energy cutoff of 1500 eV is applied for the plane waves, with a reciprocal space sampling grid spacing of 0.5 Å-1. The self-consistent field (SCF) iterations are considered converged when the difference in total energy and band structure is below 10-6 eV. Molecular dynamics. For all the MD simulations for computing the physical properties presented in the main text, the simulation system is a periodic cubic box with 24\,567 atoms, which has a dimension of about 6.2 nm in each direction. The time step for integration is set to 0.5 fs for both classical and path-integral MD simulations. To calculate the density of water at each temperature, the system is equilibrated for 50 ps in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. The pressure of the system is set to 1 bar, and the temperature is varied from 280 K to 370 K with an interval of 10 K. Isobaric heat capacity. The isobaric heat capacity Cp is defined as the rate of change of enthalpy H with respect to temperature under constant pressure conditions: C_{p}=(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T})_{P} (5) where, H=U+PV, and U,T,P,V represent the internal energy, temperature, pressure, and volume, respectively. Substituting this expression into the above formula, we obtain the following convenient relation for calculating isobaric heat capacity in molecular dynamics simulations C_{p}=\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}+P\frac{\partial V}{\partial T} (6) To compute Cp, the value of H is calculated at a series of temperature points with the same pressure P. A quadratic function is then fitted to the relationship between H and T, and its first derivative provides the Cp as a function of T. Self-diffusion coefficient. The running SDC for water is calculated using the following Green-Kubo relation: D(t)=\frac{1}{3}\int_{\tau=0}^{t}C_{vv}(\tau)\rm{d}\tau (7) where the velocity auto-correlation function is defined as C_{vv}(\tau)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^{N}\langle\mathbf{v}_{i}(0)\cdot\mathbf{v}_{i% }(\tau)\rangle.. Here, N is the number of atoms in the systems, and \mathbf{v}_{i} is the velocity of atom i. Shear viscosity. The shear viscosity is defined as \eta=\frac{1}{3}\left(\eta_{xy}+\eta_{xz}+\eta_{yz}\right), where the running integral of \eta_{\alpha\beta} is calculated using the following Green-Kubo relation: \eta_{\alpha\beta}(t)=\frac{V}{k_{\rm B}T}\int_{0}^{t}C_{PP}(\tau)\rm{d}\tau. (8) Here, C_{PP}(\tau)=\langle(P_{\alpha\beta}(0)-\langle P_{\alpha\beta}\rangle)(P_{% \alpha\beta}(\tau)-\langle P_{\alpha\beta}\rangle)\rangle is the pressure auto-correlation function, V is the volume, k_{\rm B} is Boltzmann’s constant, T is temperature, and P_{\alpha\beta} is the pressure tensor. Thermal conductivity. Similarly, we can use a Green–Kubo relation to calculate thermal conductivity: \kappa(t)=\frac{1}{k_{\rm B}T^{2}V}\int_{0}^{t}dt^{\prime}\langle\mathbf{J}(t^% {\prime})\cdot\mathbf{J}(0)\rangle, (9) where \mathbf{J}(t) is the heat current and \langle\mathbf{J}(t^{\prime})\cdot\mathbf{J}(0)\rangle is the heat current auto-correlation function. For liquid system, the heat current has two contributions, \mathbf{J}=\mathbf{J}^{\rm k}+\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}. The kinetic term is \mathbf{J}^{\rm k}=\sum_{i}{\mathbf{v}_{i}E_{i}}, where, E_{i} and \mathbf{v}_{i} are the total energy and velocity of atom i, respectively. The potential term for many-body potentials is [69] \mathbf{J}^{\rm p}=\sum_{i}\mathbf{W}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{v}_{i}, where \mathbf{W}_{i}=\sum_{j\neq i}\mathbf{r}_{ij}\otimes\frac{\partial U_{j}}{% \partial\mathbf{r}_{ji}} is the virial tensor of aotm i and \mathbf{r}_{ij}=\mathbf{r}_{j}-\mathbf{r}_{i}, \mathbf{r}_{i} being thee position of atom i. According to the decomposition of the heat current, the thermal conductivity can be decomposed into three terms: \kappa(t)=\kappa^{\rm pp}(t)+\kappa^{\rm kk}(t)+\kappa^{\rm pk}(t), where the potential-potential term \kappa^{\rm pp}, the kinetic-kinetic term \kappa^{\rm kk}, and the cross term \kappa^{\rm pk} correspond to the following heat current auto-correlation functions: \langle\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}(t)\cdot\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}(0)\rangle, \langle\mathbf{J}^{\rm k}(t)\cdot\mathbf{J}^{\rm k}(0)\rangle, and \langle\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}(t)\cdot\mathbf{J}^{\rm k}(0)\rangle+\langle\mathbf{J% }^{\rm k}(t)\cdot\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}(0)\rangle. Besides, we use the homogeneous nonequilibrium MD method [64] to calculate the thermal conductivity of water. In this method, an external driving force \mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{ext}}=E_{i}\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{e}}+\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm% {e}}\cdot\mathbf{W}_{i} is exerted on each atom i, driving the system out of equilibrium. Here, \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{e}} is the driving force parameter with the dimension of inverse length. In this work, the magnitude of F_{\mathrm{e}} was chosen as 0.001 Å-1, which has been tested to be small enough to keep the system within the linear response regime. The driving force will induce an ensemble-averaged steady-state non-equilibrium heat current \mathbf{J}, which is related to the thermal conductivity tensor \kappa^{\alpha\beta}: \frac{\left\langle J^{\alpha}\right\rangle}{TV}=\sum_{\beta}\kappa^{\alpha% \beta}F_{\mathrm{e}}^{\beta}.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09541v1,"Magnetization process of a quasi-two-dimensional quantum magnet:
Two-step symmetry restoration and dimensional reduction","We report on a comprehensive thermodynamic study of a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) quantum magnet Cu2(OH)3Br which in the 2D layer can be viewed as strongly coupled alternating antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic chains. In an applied magnetic field transverse to the ordered spins below T_{N}=9.3 K, a field-induced phase transition from the 3D ordered to a disordered phase occurs at B_{c}=16.3 T for the lowest temperature, which is featured by an onset of a one-half plateau-like magnetization. By performing quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the relevant 2D model, we find that the plateau-like magnetization corresponds to a partial symmetry restoration and the full polarization in the ferromagnetic chains. Our numerical simulations also show that the magnetization saturation occurs with full symmetry restoration at a much higher field of B_{s}\simeq 95 T, corresponding to a 1D quantum phase transition in the antiferromagnetic chains. We argue that the experimentally observed field-induced phase transition at B_{c} follows from the partial symmetry restoration and the concomitant dimensional reduction.","References Sachdev [2011] S.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09377v1,Chiral Light-Matter Interactions with Thermal Magnetoplasmons in Graphene Nanodisks,"We investigate the emergence of self-hybridized thermal magnetoplasmons in doped graphene nanodisks at finite temperatures when subjected to an external magnetic field. Using a semi-analytical approach, which fully describes the eigenmodes and polarizability of the graphene nanodisks, we show that the hybridization originates from the coupling of transitions between thermally populated Landau levels and localized magnetoplasmon resonances of the nanodisks. Owing to their origin, these modes combine the extraordinary magneto-optical response of graphene with the strong field enhancement of plasmons, making them an ideal tool for achieving strong chiral light-matter interactions, with the additional advantage of being tunable through carrier concentration, magnetic field, and temperature. As an illustration of their capabilities, we demonstrate that the thermal magnetoplasmons supported by an array of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption and chiral thermal emission.","A photonic structure is considered chiral if it cannot be superimposed onto its mirror image through translations or rotations [1]. Chiral photonic structures respond differently to the left- (LCP) and right-handed (RCP) circularly polarized components of the electromagnetic field, resulting in a phenomenon known as circular dichroism [2, 3]. This ability makes them ideal tools for the detection, identification, and manipulation of chiral molecules [4, 5, 6, 7], which is a problem of paramount importance in biotechnology [8]. Chiral photonic structures can also be employed to control and modify the polarization state of light [9, 3, 10] and to generate circularly polarized thermal radiation [11, 12, 13, 14]. These prospects have driven an intense research effort into developing different chiral photonic elements, including, among others, emitters [15, 16, 17], cavities [18, 19], absorbers [20, 21], metasurfaces [22, 23], and collective modes in periodic arrays [24, 25, 26]. Another approach to achieving circular dichroism involves the use of materials with a strong magneto-optical response. Among these, graphene—a single layer of carbon atoms—stands out as one of the most promising platforms due to its unique electronic properties [27, 28]. In the presence of an external static magnetic field directed normally to a graphene sheet, the optical conductivity of this material exhibits off-diagonal Hall components that result in an extraordinary magneto-optical response, as exemplified by reports of giant Faraday rotation [29, 30, 31]. Meanwhile, when doped with charge carriers, graphene nanostructures are able to support localized surface plamons [32]. These excitations, whose strength and frequency are determined by the level of doping, can boost light-matter interaction due to the extraordinary near-field enhancement and cross sections that they provide at terahertz and infrared frequencies [33, 34, 35, 36]. A notable example is the possibility of achieving perfect absorption using an array of graphene nanostructures arranged in a Salisbury screen configuration—a concept initially predicted theoretically [37] and later confirmed experimentally [38]. Due to the combined effects of charge carrier doping and applied static magnetic field, graphene nanostructures support magnetoplasmons that enable strong chiral light-matter interactions [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44]. In principle, the characteristics of these excitations are largely determined by the doping level and the strength of the static magnetic field [40, 45]. However, the linear band structure and two-dimensional (2D) nature of this material, which are at the origin of its high optoelectronic tunability, together with its low electronic heat capacity, facilitates substantial temperature-induced changes in the optical response of graphene nanostructures [46, 47, 48]. This characteristic presents new opportunities for controlling and manipulating graphene magnetoplasmons but demands exploring how the interplay of a static magnetic field, carrier doping, and temperature influences their behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate new strategies to thermally control chiral light absorption and emission using graphene magnetoplasmons. We demonstrate that, at finite temperature and in the presence of a perpendicular static magnetic field, the magnetoplasmons supported by graphene nanodisks undergo strong hybridization with transitions between thermally populated Landau levels that become more prominent at elevated electron temperatures, leading to the formation of hybrid thermal magnetoplasmons (TMPs). Our investigation is based on a semi-analytical formalism that describes the eigenmodes and the polarizability of magneto-optical 2D nanodisks, which we introduce here to fully characterize the properties of TMPs in isolated nanodisks. By combining this formalism with a coupled dipole model and transfer matrix calculations, we demonstrate that the TMPs supported by arrays of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption (i.e., perfect absorption for only one light handedness) when paired with a gold mirror in a Salisbury screen configuration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same system generates fully circularly polarized thermal radiation of a single handedness. These findings extend the known capability of graphene plasmons to mediate thermal emission [49, 50] and pave the way for developing novel nonreciprocal thermal emitters [51, 52, 53] capable of advancing solar energy harvesting technologies [54]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09300v1,Large anomalous Hall effect and -phase in hexagonal polar magnet GdNiSn,"While recent theoretical studies have positioned noncollinear polar magnets with C_{nv} symmetry as compelling candidates for realizing topological magnetic phases and substantial intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, experimental realizations of the same in strongly correlated systems remain rare. Here, we present a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect and extended topological magnetic ordering in Gd3Ni8Sn4 with hexagonal C_{6v} symmetry. Observation of topological Hall response, corroborated by metamagnetic anomalies in isothermal magnetization, peak/hump features in field-evolution of ac susceptibility and longitudinal resistivity, attests to the stabilization of skyrmion A-phase. The anomalous Hall effect is quantitatively accounted for by the intrinsic Berry curvature-mediated mechanism. Our results underscore polar magnets as a promising platform to investigate a plethora of emergent electrodynamic responses rooted in the interplay between magnetism and topology.","References Nagaosa and Tokura [2013] N.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09165v1,Solving the Inverse Band-Structure Problem for Photonic Crystals,"We present a symmetry-agnostic topology optimization framework for photonic-crystal structures based on computation of the photonic density of states in a manner analogous to \Gamma-point integration. We provide a generalization of the approach that allows for computations at different scales with the additional scales being analogous to integration over the full Brillouin zone and to regimes between the two limiting cases of full Brillouin-zone integration and \Gamma-point integration, though these other scales do not preserve the symmetry-agnostic nature of the \Gamma-point framework. We also demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to the problem of inverting photonic or phononic bandstructures. Finally, we show that at the symmetry-agnostic scale analogous to \Gamma-point integration, we can recover a known two-dimensional photonic crystal for the TM polarization. A key insight of our work is the determination of the minimum supercell size and the minimum precision to which the frequencies within the photonic bandgap must be sampled in order to observe photonic-crystal structures.","Results Photonic-crystal convergence as a function of system size We now present results for two-dimensional structures supporting photonic bandgaps for the transverse magnetic (TM) polarization that were obtained by suppressing the photonic density of states of the structures over a frequency window \Delta\omega with a central frequency \omega_{0}, where the photonic density of states is computed in a manner analogous to \Gamma-point integration. For all TM calculations, we assigned the values \omega_{0}=0.4\cdot 2\pi c/a, \Delta\omega=\omega_{0}/10, \mu(\mathbf{r})=\mu_{0} for the permeability, and allowed the permittivity \epsilon(\mathbf{r}) to vary between \epsilon_{0} and 8.9\epsilon_{0} for comparison with the structures found in Ref. Joannopoulos et al. (2011). The quantities c, \mu_{0}, and \epsilon_{0} are the speed of light, the permeability, and the permittivity for free space, respectively, and we set a=1 since we can treat lengths without dimensions given the scale invariance of Maxwell’s equations Joannopoulos et al. (2011). Convergence of the photonic crystal as a function of the system size and the grid-point resolution (gpr), which is the number of grid points used to resolve a length a=1, is shown for the TM polarization in Fig. 1. By performing a Fourier transform of the structure that was optimized over 5000 iterations for a 10\times 10 design region, a gpr of 100, and N=10, where N is the number of frequencies sampled within the bandgap, we can extract the location of the four highest maxima of the absolute value of the transform that occur at non-trivial positions. We find that these maxima are located at \mathbf{k}_{1}=-8\cdot 2\pi/(10a)\hat{e}_{x}, \mathbf{k}_{2}=8\cdot 2\pi/(10a)\hat{e}_{x}, \mathbf{k}_{3}=8\cdot 2\pi/(10a)\hat{e}_{y}, and \mathbf{k}_{4}=-8\cdot 2\pi/(10a)\hat{e}_{y}. Observing that the real-space structure of the photonic crystal with N=10 and a 10\times 10 design region at 5000 iterations corresponds to dielectric columns/rods, we can extract the radius of these rods by summing the absolute value of the Fourier transform at the locations \mathbf{k}=\mathbf{k}_{1}, \mathbf{k}_{2}, \mathbf{k}_{3}, and \mathbf{k}_{4}, dividing by 8\cdot 8=64 (which is the number of effective unit cells given the location of the maxima of the absolute value of the Fourier transform), dividing by \pi, and then taking the square root. We obtain r=0.24a^{\prime}, where a^{\prime}=\frac{10}{8}a, compared with the value in Ref. Joannopoulos et al. (2011) which was r=0.2\tilde{a} for some lattice constant \tilde{a}. Figure 1: Designs optimized for 5000 iterations and N=10 with TM polarization as a function of the size of the design region and the number of grid points (gpr) used to resolve a length a=1. The color bar indicates the permittivity \epsilon in the various parts of the design region. The convergence as a function of system size can be understood by observing that the Bragg length, which dictates the characteristic length for attenuation of light illuminating a photonic crystal, varies as Hasan et al. (2018); Neve-Oz et al. (2004) L_{B}\approx\frac{d}{\ln\left(\frac{1+\sin\left(\frac{\pi\Delta\omega}{4\omega% _{0}}\right)}{1-\sin\left(\frac{\pi\Delta\omega}{4\omega_{0}}\right)}\right)}% \approx\frac{2d}{\pi}\frac{\omega_{0}}{\Delta\omega}, (1) where \omega_{0} is the central frequency, \Delta\omega is the bandgap or frequency window, as above, and d is the smallest distance for a set of crystal planes. Thus, given d=a^{\prime}=\frac{10}{8}a=\frac{10}{8}\cdot 1=\frac{10}{8} and \frac{\omega_{0}}{\Delta\omega}=\frac{1}{0.1}, we expect a minimum crystal linear dimension of L\gtrsim L_{B}\approx 8 for convergence of the results, in good agreement with the convergence behavior in Fig. 1. Convergence as a function of the number of frequencies, N, sampled within the bandgap We next examine the photonic-crystal convergence behavior as a function of N for TM polarization. As shown in Fig. 2, we find that photonic-crystal behavior is not captured for all N. The location of the crossover point to the final TM photonic-crystal structure can be understood by observing that each sampled frequency \omega_{n}, within the bandgap, is in correspondence with a wavenumber k_{n}=\frac{\omega_{n}}{v}, where v is the speed of light through the given medium. These wavenumbers k_{n} must be able to capture the length scales of all structures in the photonic crystal. In particular, they must be able to capture the length scale corresponding to the periodicity of the photonic crystal. We treat time-harmonic fields so that we can use the rules for addition of sinusoidal functions to deduce that the smallest difference between these k_{n} must be equal to the smallest wavenumber at which a peak is observed in the Fourier transform of the optimized structure. This argument follows from the fact that the function resulting from the sum of sinusoidal functions is a product of an envelope function with frequency equal to the smaller of the difference between or the sum of the frequencies of the original sinusoidal functions and a modulated sinusoidal function with frequency equal to the larger of the difference between or the sum of the frequencies of the original sinusoidal functions. Given a smallest wavenumber k_{\text{min}}=8\cdot 2\pi/(10a), we find a minimum N given by N_{\text{min}}\approx\text{gpr}\cdot\frac{\Delta\omega}{vk_{\text{min}}}\approx 5 for a gpr of 100, \omega_{0}=0.4\cdot 2\pi c/a, \Delta\omega=\omega_{0}/10, and using v\sim c, in good agreement with the results shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2: Designs optimized for 5000 iterations, a gpr of 100, and a 10\times 10 design region as a function of the number of frequencies sampled within the bandgap, N. TM polarization was used. Material permittivity values are as in Fig. 1. Extracting photonic bandstructures As a function of the number of iterations, we also investigate the convergence of the radius r that was computed above at 5000 iterations for the photonic-crystal structure resulting from minimization of the photonic density of states over the frequency window \Delta\omega with central frequency \omega_{0} for a 10\times 10 design region, N=10, and a gpr of 100. The location of the four highest maxima of the absolute value of the Fourier transform occurring at non-trivial positions for the photonic-crystal structures does not change between 1000 and 10000 iterations, We find that between 9000 and 10000 iterations, the relative change in the radius r is less than 0.03%. For the radius obtained at 10000 iterations, which we also found to be r=0.24a^{\prime}, we compute the corresponding bandstructure using the MPB code Johnson and Joannopoulos (2001). Given that the lattice constant in the computation is increased by a factor of \frac{10}{8}, based on the periodicity of the structure that we found compared to a=1, we need to rescale the frequencies we obtain by the factor \frac{10}{8} if we are to use the lattice constant a=1. The bandstructure is shown in Fig. 3. After this rescaling, we find \omega_{0}=0.43\cdot 2\pi c/a and \Delta\omega=0.30\cdot\omega_{0}. The value of \omega_{0} is in good agreement with our input value of \omega_{0}=0.4\cdot 2\pi c/a, which indicates that our optimization procedure is able to target a desired bandgap regime. The value of \Delta\omega obtained is also consistent with our input that requested that the bandgap be at least as large as \omega_{0}/10. Figure 3: The bandstructure obtained from a structure of dielectric rods with radius r=0.24a^{\prime} and permittivity \epsilon=8.9\epsilon_{0} is presented in (a). In (b), we show the convergence of the radius r as a function of the number of iterations for optimization with N=10, a gpr of 100, and a 10\times 10 design region. The photonic-crystal structure obtained at 10000 iterations is shown as the inset in (b). See Fig. 1 for material permittivity values."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08980v1,Orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in 2H-NbS flakes,"Symmetry breaking in a layered superconductor with Ising spin-orbit coupling has offered an opportunity to realize unconventional superconductivity. To be more specific, orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, exhibiting layer-dependent finite-momentum pairing, may emerge in transition metal dichalcogenides materials (TMDC) in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Orbital FFLO state can be more robust against the magnetic field than the conventional superconducting state with zero-momentum pairing . This feature renders its potential in field-resilient superconducting functionality. Although, orbital FFLO state has been reported in NbSe2 and MoS2, it is not yet clear if orbital FFLO state can be a general feature of TMDC superconductor. Here, we report the observation of orbital FFLO state in 2H-NbS2 flakes and its dependence on the thickness of flake. We conclude that the relatively weak interlayer coupling is instrumental in stabilizing orbital FFLO state at higher temperature with respect to the critical temperature and lower magnetic field with respect to paramagnetic limit in NbS2 in comparison to its NbSe2 counterpart.","References Hou et al.

Cavity Quantum Materials","The strong coupling regime of photons and quantum materials inside optical cavities has emerged as a promising environment for manipulating states of matter with light. Here, in turn, we show that photons bear witness to cavity quantum-electrodynamical modifications of the material, leading to profoundly non-classical properties of light passing through the cavity. By generalizing quantum-optical input-output relations to correlated quantum materials, we study the second-order photon coherence g^{(2)}(t) and demonstrate that antibunching of transmitted photons serves as direct evidence of light-induced changes to the cavity-embedded material. We show that materials near a quantum critical point can realize a collective many-body photon blockade, enabling the generation of single photons or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs via leveraging strong matter fluctuations. Our findings provide new routes for interrogating and harnessing cavity-embedded quantum materials as quantum light sources, as a resource for photon-based computation and quantum sensing.","The strong light-matter coupling regime of photons and correlated quantum materials has recently garnered much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In conventional quantum-optical settings, individual localized emitters become strongly coupled to photon modes inside optical cavities, generating polariton excitations with hybrid light and matter characteristics that are a rich resource for quantum information processing [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Recent studies have started to bridge the fields of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) and correlated electrons, by demonstrating strong coupling of photons to the collective modes of many-body systems in cavities [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], and exploring whether photon fluctuations can suffice to alter ground state properties of quantum materials [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. However, monitoring the quantum electrodynamical dressing of states of matter in cavities, and distinguishing these photon-induced changes from more mundane screening or interface effects due to the cavity remains a central challenge. At the same time, observable ramifications for the state of light remain largely unexplored, raising intriguing questions regarding whether correlated electron systems can be harnessed as sources of quantum photon states, with applications to quantum computing and metrology. The starting point for this work rests on the observation that, if strong light-matter coupling indeed alters the collective phase of a quantum material, then photons must necessarily be witnesses to these changes through their entanglement with the material [41, 46]. Hence, as photons are injected into the cavity and trigger changes in the material, these modifications should become visible to measurements of the statistics of ejected photons. On generic grounds, materials near a quantum critical point (QCP) are a particularly attractive target to test these ideas, as strong quantum fluctuations should make them susceptible to light-induced changes. Light emitted from cavities hosting strongly-correlated and photon-dressed quantum materials should consequently exhibit strongly non-classical properties. Here, we confirm these expectations, showing that the quantum statistics of light transmitted through cavities are direct evidence of quantum-electrodynamical changes to the state of matter in materials. Generalizing quantum optical input-output relations to strongly-correlated cavity quantum materials, we study the second-order photon coherence g^{(2)}(t) for weakly-driven cavities hosting Mott insulators in the strong light-matter coupling regime. We find that transmitted photons exhibit pronounced (anti)bunching, which becomes drastically amplified near an Ising QCP, and establish measurements of g^{(2)} as a probe of the ensuing photon-induced changes to the state of matter. We then show that quantum materials near criticality can in turn become collective single-photon sources, harnessing strong quantum fluctuations in the material to convert a laser drive into single photons. Finally, we demonstrate that chiral Mott insulators embedded in optical cavities can become efficient sources of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs of entangled photons, as a resource for photon-based computation and sensing [47]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08947v1,Resonant second harmonic generation in a two-dimensional electron system,"We consider the nonlinear response of a disordered two-dimensional electronic system, lacking inversion symmetry, to an external alternating electric field. The application of an in-plane static magnetic field induces local contributions to the current density that are quadratic in the electric field and linear in the magnetic field. This current oscillates at twice the frequency of the external irradiation and there are two linearly independent vector combinations that contribute to the current density. This particular mechanism coexists with the topological Berry-dipole contribution to the second harmonic of the current density, which can be generated by quantum confinement. Additional nonlocal terms in the current density are possible in the regime away from the normal incidence. The total current exhibits a nonreciprocal character upon reversal of the magnetic field direction. We evaluate the magnitude of this effect by computing its dependence on the strength of spin-orbit coupling and the disorder scattering rate. Importantly, we show that these local second-harmonic contributions can be resonantly excited when the frequency of the external radiation approaches the energy separation between the spin-orbit split bands.","The continuing interest in nonlinear optical phenomena is driven by advances in optical measurement techniques Fülöp et al. (2010); Basov et al. (2011), as well as by the peculiar physics arising from the topological properties and nonreciprocity of quantum materials, as reviewed in Refs. Morimoto and Nagaosa (2016); Tokura and Nagaosa (2018); Nagaosa and Yanase (2024). In particular, nonlinear effects such as second harmonic generation in normal conductors and third harmonic generation in superconductors have become focal points of theoretical and experimental studies. For instance, in conventional superconductors, the application of terahertz pulses can excite both amplitude and phase modes Katsumi et al. (2023) and induce the inverse Faraday effect – i.e., the emergence of static magnetization caused by circularly polarized light Majedi (2021); Putilov et al. (2023); Mironov et al. (2021) (for a recent discussion, see also Ref. Dzero (2024) and references therein). In the nonlinear optical response, the electron current density \mathbf{j} can be phenomenologically expanded in powers of the driving electric field \mathbf{E}. In a centrosymmetric material, the leading nonlinear contribution starts at the cubic order, \mathbf{E}^{3}, unless the field is inhomogeneous. In such cases, quadratic terms are also possible, but they must include spatial gradients. Examples of allowed terms include \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{E}) and (\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{\nabla})\mathbf{E} Jha (1965). Depending on whether the field is static or alternating, various effects can emerge. From the cubic term, one can obtain phenomena such as static nonlinear conductivity, the Kerr effect, photocurrent, dc-induced second harmonic generation, and third harmonic generation Butcher (1991); Ivchenko (2005). Figure 1: Schematic of the system under consideration: electrons are confined to a quantum well, forming a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. The 2DEG is represented pictorially as a slab. The system is illuminated by light of frequency \omega and subjected to an in-plane static magnetic field \mathbf{H}. The combination of these two stimuli induces a second harmonic of the electrical current density, which flows in a direction defined by the vector product of the out-of-plane spin-orbit axis and the magnetic field. This current scales proportionally with the optical power illuminating the 2DEG. In contrast, in materials whose symmetry group includes a polar axis – common in those lacking inversion symmetry – the electron current density may contain terms that are quadratic in the field, even in a homogeneous field. Consequently, the nonlinear part of the electron current density can be characterized by a rank-three tensor: \mathbf{j}_{\text{a}}=\sigma_{\text{abc}}(\omega_{1},\omega_{2})\mathbf{E}_{% \text{b}}(\omega_{1})\mathbf{E}_{\text{c}}(\omega_{2}), (1) which represents the second-order nonlinear optical conductivity \sigma_{\text{abc}}. These materials exhibit a variety of intriguing physical phenomena, such as the photogalvanic and piezoelectric effects Sturman and Fridkin (1992); Belinicher and Sturman (1980); Belinicher et al. (1982); Sipe and Shkrebtii (2000). Indeed, for \omega_{1}=-\omega_{2}=\omega, the product of the fields can be decomposed into symmetrized terms, \propto\sigma_{\text{abc}}(\mathbf{E}_{\text{b}}\mathbf{E}^{*}_{\text{c}}+% \mathbf{E}^{*}_{\text{b}}\mathbf{E}_{\text{c}}), describing linear photogalvanic effects (LPGE), and antisymmetrized terms, \propto i\varsigma_{\text{ab}}[\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{E}^{*}]_{\text{b}}, describing circular photogalvanic effects (CPGE). The microscopic origin of these effects can be traced to the asymmetry of electronic scattering processes (for a review, see Ref. Sturman (1984) and references therein). For matched frequencies, \omega_{1}=\omega_{2}=\omega the \mathbf{E}^{2} term gives rise to second harmonic generation (SHG). In materials with topologically nontrivial band structures, finite Berry curvature contributes to unique photocurrents Deyo et al. (2009); Moore and Orenstein (2010); de Juan et al. (2017); König et al. (2017), the quantum nonlinear Hall effect Sodemann and Fu (2015); König and Levchenko (2021), and more generally, gyrotropic Hall effects König et al. (2019). Some of these effects have been observed, such as in semiconductor heterostructures Ganichev et al. (2001); Olbrich et al. (2009) and in Weyl semimetals like TaAs Wu et al. (2017); Patankar et al. (2018), which exhibit a giant nonlinear optical response – orders of magnitude higher than that of archetypal electro-optical materials such as GaAs Bergfeld and Daum (2003) and ZnTe Wagner et al. (1998). In this work, we focus on the specific mechanism of second harmonic generation (SHG) in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). To this end, we consider a 2D electron system described by the Rashba model of spin-orbit coupling Rashba (1959); Bychkov and Rashba (1984) and account for electron-impurity scattering, as illustrated in Fig. 1. We demonstrate that the application of an in-plane magnetic field induces an oscillatory current response, which exhibits a resonant structure at frequencies commensurate with the energy separation between the spin-orbit split bands. The direction of the induced nonlinear current is determined by a linear superposition of two vectors one of which points along the direction of external electric field while the other points along the direction given by the cross product of magnetic field and normal to the surface."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08940v1,X-ray measurements of gas distribution in a zero gap alkaline water electrolyzer,"X-ray radioscopy was used to measure the 2D projected dynamic void fraction in a zero/narrow gap alkaline water electrolyzer at a spatial resolution of 15 \mum, for narrow gap sizes up to 300 \mum and current densities up to 0.54 A/cm2. As expected, the void fraction in the bulk was found to increase along the cell height and with increasing current density. The void fraction measured in the gap region (the space between the diaphragm and the electrode and its holes) was always larger than in the bulk. It hardly depended on the gap size at current densities below 0.3 A/cm2. The lowest cell potential was measured for zero gap. No evidence of isolating gas pockets/films in the gaps was found. Liquid crossover and oxygen void fraction exceeding the hydrogen void fraction occurred for porous plate electrodes, but these phenomena were suppressed for perforated foil electrodes.","Water electrolysis to generate hydrogen with renewable energy is a key technology towards a carbon-free society. Among different types of technology, alkaline water electrolysis is cost-effective and of reasonably good efficiency (see e.g. [1]). The efficiency can be further improved if ohmic losses are reduced. Zero gap between electrodes and the diaphragm is considered to minimize ohmic losses (e.g. see [2]). However, the ohmic/area resistance in zero gap cells is often found much higher than expected, i.e. the much higher than the diaphragm/separator resistance [3]. It is well-known that the hydrodynamics of the electrogenerated bubbles inside the cell can affect the cell potential in nonzero gap (flat plate) electrolyzers [4]. In water electrolysis, dissolved hydrogen and oxygen gases are produced separately at the cathode and anode respectively. Upon supersaturation of the dissolved gases, H2 and O2 bubbles are formed [4]. Bubbles between electrodes can act as electric insulators amd lengthen the path needed for the ions to travel from one electrode to another [5], thus increasing the cell resistance while electrode coverage by bubbles can reduce the active surface area of the electrode [4]. On the other hand, as mentioned in Ref. [6], when bubbles detach from the electrode surfaces, a microconvection at the boundary layer is induced, enhancing the mass transfer and thus also the cell efficiency [7, 8]. In particular, for the zero-gap (or narrow gap) configuration, the origin of the high area resistance was speculated to be caused by bubbles or a gas film trapped in the gap as practically it is almost impossible to reach a true zero gap (see also [9, 10, 11, 12]). It is expected that the void fraction at the gap increases with decreasing gap size. Therefore there might exist an optimal distance between the electrodes for optimal cell efficiency while the area resistance contributed by the solution is still significantly reduced [9]. The existence of the optimal gap size is experimentally found in Ref. [11, 13]. Furthermore, recently, experiments were reported by Haverkort & Rajaei [13], in which a gap width of 200\text{\,}\mu\mathrm{m} led to a substantially lower cell voltage than a gap width of zero, suggesting that introducing a deliberate gap allows bubbles or gas films to escape more easily. Nevertheless, the presence of gas bubbles/films in ‘zero’ gap remains still a hypothesis to date. To clear up the speculations in literature and the mystery of bubble/gas effects on the cell resistance in zero/narrow gap configurations, it is of primary interest to visualize and measure the gas distribution. Measuring the gas distribution in electrolyzers is challenging due to opaque dense bubbly flows and the required high spatial resolution. As mentioned in Ref. [4], the attempts to measure the void fraction in which the bubbles produced by vertical plane electrodes are via image analysis (e.g. Ref. [14, 15] employed high speed camera) and local intrusive probes to measure the resistivity of the bubbly electrolyte solution [16, 14]. The image analysis method can yield significant error near the electrode due to bubble shadowing effect and the resistivity method assumes homogeneity of void fraction in depth [4]. In short, measuring the void fraction in narrow-gap cells poses practical challenges due to limited optical access and spatial resolution. In this work, we employ 2D X-ray radioscopy to measure the void fraction in an electrolyzer, including the gap region with a resolution down to 15\text{\,}\mu\mathrm{m}. In the past, X-ray radioscopy and tomography have been employed to study bubbly flows in porous transport layers of polymer electrolyte water electrolyzer (summarized in [17]) and proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (summarized in Ref. [18]). X-ray measurements have also been extensively employed to dense bubbly flows in many other engineering applications [19]. To the best of our knowledge, no attempt before the current work has utilized X-ray scanning to measure the gas volume fraction in zero/narrow gap electrolyzers. Another phenomenon that will be addressed in this paper is the liquid crossover through the diaphragm. Liquid crossover is a cause of dissolved gas crossover. Gas crossover has become an ongoing industrial challenge due to the resulted risk in safety and the gas purity. Yet very limited research on this phenomenon is available in open literature [20, 21, 22]. One transport mechanism is through the electro-osmotic flow induced by the electric potential difference across the diaphragm, which is observed in Ref. [23, 24]. In this work, we try to determine and understand the crossover in a zero-gap cell using electrodes with different porosity and surface wettability. The experimental setup and method is elaborated in Sec. 2. Then, the overall structure of the bubbly flows and the typical current-voltage curve are illustrated in Sec. 3.1. After that, the effect of gap size and current densities on the measured void fraction are uncovered quantitatively in Sec. 3.2. This is followed by a further analysis on the gas contribution to the cell voltage in Sec. 3.3. In Sec. 3.4 the crossover phenomenon is addressed by comparing the different hydrodynamic behaviors in zero-gap configurations using two different electrodes."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08911v1,A Message Passing Neural Network Surrogate Model for Bond-Associated Peridynamic Material Correspondence Formulation,"Peridynamics is a non-local continuum mechanics theory that offers unique advantages for modeling problems involving discontinuities and complex deformations. Within the peridynamic framework, various formulations exist, among which the material correspondence formulation stands out for its ability to directly incorporate traditional continuum material models, making it highly applicable to a range of engineering challenges. A notable advancement in this area is the bond-associated correspondence model, which not only resolves issues of material instability but also achieves computational accuracy comparable to finite element analysis (FEA). However, the bond-associated model typically requires higher computational costs than FEA, which can limit its practical application. To address this computational challenge, we propose a novel surrogate model based on a message-passing neural network (MPNN) specifically designed for the bond-associated peridynamic material correspondence formulation. Leveraging the similarities between graph structure in computer science theory and the neighborhood connectivity inherent to peridynamics, we construct an MPNN that can transfers domain knowledge from peridynamics into a computational graph and shorten the computation time via GPU acceleration. Unlike conventional graph neural networks that focus on node features, our model emphasizes edge-based features, capturing the essential material point interactions in the formulation. Additionally, an attention mechanism is integrated into the MPNN to enhance its representation of bond-associated dynamics, ensuring that significant interactions are weighted appropriately. A key advantage of this neural network approach is its flexibility: it does not require fixed neighborhood connectivity, making it adaptable across diverse configurations and scalable for complex systems. Furthermore, the model inherently possesses translational and rotational invariance, enabling it to maintain physical objectivity—a critical requirement for accurate mechanical modeling. We validate the accuracy and efficacy of this surrogate model through several numerical examples, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for efficient and accurate peridynamic simulations. This work opens new avenues for applying peridynamic models in computationally demanding scenarios, providing a viable alternative to traditional methods with the potential for significant computational savings.","Peridynamics is a nonlocal continuum mechanics theory that addresses the limitations of the classical local theory in dealing with spatial discontinuities and accounting for length scale effects [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The development of peridynamics began with the seminal work by Silling [1] on reformulation of elasticity theory for discontinuities and long-range forces, where pairwise bond-based interactions within finite distance called horizon are formulated. In this bond-based formulation, the force density of a bond depends only on its stretch. While it is effective in capturing fracture phenomena, the bond-based formulation is limited in describing general material behaviors such as arbitrary Poisson ratio and nonlinear constitutive relationship, due to the usage of a pairwise potential that is totally independent of all other local conditions [2]. To overcome this limitation, the state-based formulation which leveraged the concept of state to rewrite the material-dependent part of the peridynamic model was introduced [2]. More importantly, the material correspondence formulation, a subset of the state-based formulations, bridges the gap between peridynamics and the classical continuum mechanics theory by allowing direct incorporation of continuum material models into peridynamics. This is achieved by introducing nonlocal deformation gradient and stress tensors in a manner equivalent to the classical continuum mechanics theory but within a nonlocal framework. However, the material correspondence formulation is not without challenges. One well-known issue of the formulation is the existence of material instability or zero-energy modes manifested in the form of oscillation in the displacement field. These modes arise when certain deformation states do not contribute to the strain energy, leading to non-physical solutions and numerical instabilities. Among existing strategies proposed in the literature to address this issue, the bond-associated formulations are the most effective and provide more accurate accounting of bond-level quantities such as deformation gradient and stresses. Chen et al. [7, 8] proposed a family of non-spherical influence function and developed the corresponding material correspondence model to improve the accuracy of bond-level quantities such as deformation gradient and stress. Unlike the conventional formulation, where the influence function is spherical and depends only on the bond length, the proposed non-spherical influence functions take into account both the bond length and the bond relative angle (with respect to a target bond). This novel bond-associated correspondence model has achieved great success in inherently eliminating the material instability in the conventional formulation. However, the computational cost of this bond-associated formulation is higher than conventional ones, which is caused by iterative calculation of the non-spherical influence function. One way to overcome this issue is using GPU acceleration technique, which is commonly adopted in artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a type of neural network architecture that can operate on graph structures, such as those found in social networks, molecules, and materials. Unlike traditional neural networks, which are designed for tabular data, GNN models can be proposed to operate directly on the graphs with arbitrary edges, giving them the flexibility to train task-specific representations more relevant to the properties of interest. More specifically, GNN captures the dependence of graphs via message-passing between the nodes or edges of graphs. According to the pattern of message-passing and aggregation, it contains different variants, such as graph recurrent network (GRN) [9], graph convolutional network (GCN) [10], graph attention network (GAT) [11], etc. As a sub-class of GNN, message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) have recently shown great success in a wide range of applications[12]. Due to the similarities existed between non-locality of peridynamics and graph structure, bond-associated influence functions and attention mechanism, it is possible to build a MPNN-based surrogate model for the bond-associated material correspondence model. By doing so, we can not only achieve faster running speed by leveraging GPU computation, but also pave the path of discovering new material response through solving inverse problems. Some attempts have been made by incorporating peridynamics with the novel AI/ML methods. Ning et al.[13], Madenci et al.[14, 15] developed physics-informed neural network based on peridynamic differential operator. Yu et al.[16] proposed energy-informed neural network as a surrogate model for computing the displacement, which essentially is also a physics-informed neural network. Jafarzadeh et al.[17] introduced the peridynamic neural operator framework which learns ordinary state-based peridynamic constitutive models from data. So far, few attempts for combining GNNs with peridynamic material correspondence formulation have been reported in the literature. Due to their similarities in both structures and mechanisms, we believe this can be a promising direction for AI-assisted scientific computing. The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows: a brief introduction to bond-associated peridynamics correspondence formulation is presented in section 2; the proposed message passing neural network framework is given in section 3."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08811v1,K-edge XANES of octahedral aluminum compounds: similarities and differences via the analysis of excitonic properties,"This study presents an ab initio investigation of the XANES spectra at the aluminum K edge for three compounds: Al2O3, AlF3 and AlCl3, where the Al atoms share the same oxidation state (III) and are coordinated in an octahedral symmetry. The XANES spectra calculated within the independent-particle approximation reveal significant differences, including shifts in the spectrum onset, variations in the spectral shapes, and the presence of a pre-peak in the case of AlCl3, all in correspondence with the behavior of the PDOS of the absorbing atom in the different materials. The origin of the features stems from the specific band structure of each compound. When electron–hole interactions are taken into account through the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, a series of dark and bright excitons with large binding energies and Frenkel character is obtained. The strong excitonic effects lead to the suppression of the pre-peak in AlCl3 and further accentuate the differences among the three Al K-edge spectra.","X-ray absorption spectroscopy, particularly x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), is a powerful tool for the structural characterization of materials. XANES provides high sensitivity to the local chemical environment of the absorbing atom and to the medium-range structural organization, yielding valuable information on symmetry [1, 2], coordination number [2, 3, 4], bond length [5] and bond angle. Therefore, it serves as a distinctive fingerprint to identify and characterize constituent atoms within a material’s structure. XANES can be also used to infer changes in the oxidation state of the absorbing atom. An example is the K edge of Mn, where changes in the oxidation state of Mn from II to IV in a series of compounds yield different chemical shifts [6, 7]. Similarly, in a series of vanadium oxides the energy shifts of the absorption edge and the pre-edge have been observed to be linearly dependent on the valence of the absorbing vanadium atom [8]. The fine structures measured with XANES provide information on the local density of the empty electronic states at the site of the absorbing atom, in the presence of the core hole. In particular, K-edge XANES spectra probe predominantly s\rightarrow p dipole transitions, since monopole (s\rightarrow s) and quadrupole (s\rightarrow d) terms are normally orders of magnitude smaller. However, a pre-edge related to dipole-forbidden transitions is often present at the K edge of low-Z cations in minerals and oxides. These pre-edge features are determined by multiple factors, including coordination number, local distortion, oxidation state, and the nature of ligands around the absorbing atom. For example, transition metal compounds with tetrahedral geometries usually exhibit stronger pre-peak intensities than those with octahedral geometries [9, 10, 11]. The pre-edge features stem from the density of states the bottom of the conduction band, which in these compounds is composed primarily by the transition metal 3d empty states. According to group theory, atomic p-d mixing is forbidden under octahedral symmetry but allowed under tetrahedral symmetry. When absorbing atoms have a tetrahedral or distorted octahedral coordination, this results into an enhancement of the pre-peak intensity, where dipole transitions from the core 1s state to the p-d hybridized orbitals at the bottom of the conduction band become possible [12]. A similar behavior has been observed in aluminum compounds and minerals [1, 2, 13, 14, 3, 4], where tetrahedral symmetry or local distortions in octahedral geometries enable atomic s-p mixing. Extensive research has been carried out to correlate K-edge spectral features, particularly in the pre-edge region, with the local chemical environment. However, understanding the spectral shapes in detail remains challenging. For instance, in aluminum compounds with octahedral geometries, six-fold coordinated aluminum exhibits a variety of XANES features. The interplay among the various structural parameters (such as the number of Al sites and the distribution of interatomic distances) complicates the quantitative interpretation of XANES spectra [1, 2]. On the other hand, band-structure effects are also expected to strongly influence the absorption features. In addition, the interactions between the core holes and the electrons excited in the conduction states, also known as excitonic effects, can play a crucial role, leading to substantial shifts in the absorption edge and modifications in absorption intensities. In this context, theoretical studies can provide important information for the interpretation of spectra by allowing the selective activation or deactivation of specific interactions at play in the materials. For excitations from deep core states, predicting near-edge structures requires appropriate theoretical methods, capable of reproducing spectral features and excitonic effects. In particular, the interaction between the excited electrons and core holes, highly localized and poorly screened, demands a high-level treatment of electron-hole correlation. Common approaches for XANES spectra, in the so-called core-hole or final-state-rule approximation [15], typically evaluate a one-electron Fermi Golden rule, with a relaxed final state including a partial or a full core hole at a single atomic site within a supercell. Other methods based on multiplet ligand-field theory [16, 17, 18] are very efficient, but are not completely parameter free. Alternatively, XANES spectra can be obtained within linear-response theory through the Bethe-Salpeter equation[19, 20] (BSE) using an all-electron approach. Here, core electrons are treated explicitly within a muffin-tin region around the nuclear positions. The BSE is the state-of-the-art method for calculating optical excitations[20] and is also increasingly used for core-level excitation spectra in solids [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. The present work aims to analyze changes in the K-edge XANES spectra of aluminum compounds and relate them to their crystallographic properties and chemical environments. We have carried out independent-particle and state-of-the-art BSE calculations to obtain XANES spectra at the aluminum K edge for Al2O3, AlF3, and AlCl3, all containing Al atoms with the oxidation state {+3} and octahedral coordination. The results show the limits of the atomic perspective. Distorsions from the ideal octahedral structure coupled with strong excitonic effects make the ab initio results crucially needed for a quantitative description and analysis of the aluminum compounds. The manuscript is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe the theory for the calculation of the XANES spectra through the BSE and independent-particle approximation (IPA), together with the computational details. In Sec. III we present the results for Al2O3, AlF3, and AlCl3. Finally, in Sec. IV we draw conclusions and perspectives of the present work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08528v1,"Unveiling the Optoelectronic Potential of Vacancy-Ordered Double Perovskites:
A Computational Deep Dive","Lead-free perovskite materials have emerged as key players in optoelectronics, showcasing exceptional optical and electronic properties, alongside being environmentally friendly and non-toxic elements. Recently, among studied perovskite materials, vacancy-ordered double perovskites (VODPs) stand out as a promising alternative. In this study, we captured the electronic, optical, excitonic, and polaronic properties of a series of VODPs with the chemical formula Rb2BX6 (B = Si, Ge, Sn, Pt; X = Cl, Br, I) using first-principles calculations. Our results indicate these materials exhibit high stability and notable electronic and optical properties. The calculated G0W0 bandgap values of these perovskites fall within the range of 0.56 to 6.12 eV. Optical properties indicate strong infra-red to ultraviolet light absorption across most of the systems. Additionally, an analysis of excitonic properties reveals low to moderate exciton-binding energies and variable exciton lifetimes, implying higher quantum yield and conversion efficiency. Furthermore, utilizing the Feynman polaron model, polaronic parameters are evaluated, and for the majority of systems, charge-separated polaronic states are less stable than bound excitons. Finally, an investigation of Polaronic mobility reveals high polaron mobility for electrons (3.33-85.11 cm2V-1s-1) compared to previously reported Cs-based VODP materials. Overall, these findings highlight Rb-based VODPs as promising candidates for future optoelectronic applications.","The development of halide perovskites (HPs) for optoelectronic applications has made tremendous progress in recent years. Primitively, organic-inorganic lead-halide perovskites APbX3(A = Rb, Cs, CH3NH3; X = Cl, Br, and I) drew a lot of attention due to their strong optical absorption, variable energy gap, long carrier diffusion length, and excellent power conversion efficiencies[1]. Due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites are highly sought after for a range of applications, including efficient solar cells, information storage, humidity sensors, LEDs, lasers, and photoelectric detectors. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these perovskite solar cells has reached up to 24.2%[2], surpassing some silicon-based thin-film solar cells. Consequently, organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites have emerged as the most extensively researched and cost-effective materials for photovoltaic energy conversion in recent years. Despite their outstanding performance, the practical applications of CH3NH3-based materials are limited due to the volatility and moisture sensitivity of CH3NH3, as well as the toxic nature of lead (Pb), and their poor long-term stability. This highlights the need to explore Pb-free hybrid halide perovskites.[3]. To get rid of lead, a new approach has been developed where two Pb2+ cations are replaced by a combination of one monovalent cation (M+) and one trivalent cation (M3+). This substitution gives rise to a new class of perovskites, called double perovskites with the formula A2M(I)M(III)X6, where A represents a monovalent cation, and X represents halides such as Cl, Br, or I. Several Pb-free double halide perovskites have been explored in past few years, such as Cs2MSbX6 (M = Cu, Ag, Na, K, Rb, Cs, and X = Cl, Br)[4] and Cs2YCuX6 (X = Cl, Br, I)[5]. These lead-free halide double perovskite materials have shown to exhibit outstanding optoelectronic properties such as high optical absorption, tunable bandgap, broad absorption spectrum, small carrier effective masses, long charge diffusion lengths and high charge carrier mobility[6, 7]. While these lead-free alternatives show promise, they still require significant efficiency improvements to match the performance of lead-halide perovskites. One major challenge of lead-free halide double perovskites is their typically large and indirect bandgaps, which hinder their efficiency in comparison to lead-halide perovskites. This limitation restricts their potential for applications like high-efficiency solar cells and optoelectronic devices. To address these limitations, vacancy-ordered double perovskites (VODPs), a class of double perovskites, with the formula A2BX6 have emerged as a more efficient alternative. These complexes are eco-friendly, containing interesting luminescent, optical, dielectric, and magnetic properties and have applications in modern semiconductor devices[8]. The VODP materials can be viewed as a derivative structure of the traditional ABX3 by orderly deleting half of the B atoms in the core of the octahedron in a regular motif[9]. VODPs, with B in a ‘+4’ oxidation state, demonstrate enhanced stability in the presence of air and moisture compared to traditional ABX3 perovskites[8, 10]. This structural modification expands the composition space, allowing them for chemical tuning and property optimization. The transition from traditional single and double halide perovskites [ABX3 and A2M(I)M(III)X6] to A2BX6, thus presents exciting prospects for advancing optoelectronic materials with broader applications. In contrast, there is relatively little room for chemical modification in the halide ABX3 structure, and only a few halide perovskites can form; those have already been thoroughly studied[11]. Recent research based on the A2BX6 has opened new possibilities for a stabilized and eco-friendly solar cell material[12]. Compounds such as Rb2PdI6, Rb2PdBr6, and Cs2PtI6 exhibit ideal bandgaps, high dielectric constants, and strong absorption coefficients, making them promising for solar cell applications due to their robust nature and environmental benefits[13]. Zhao et al. used DFT-based first-principles calculations to examine the electronic and optical properties of inorganic A2PtI6 (A = Rb or Cs) compounds[14], which having bandgaps of 1.15 eV and 1.29 eV, suitable for solar cells and optoelectronic devices. Jiang et al. determined the direct bandgaps and computed the mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of Cs2SnX6 (X = Cl, Br, and I)[15]. Several materials, including Cs2TeI6, Cs2SnI6, and Cs2TiI6, with suitable bandgaps are known in theory and experiment[16, 17, 9]. In the context of DFT and hybrid functional (HSE06), the stability and electronic structure of A2BX6 (A = K, Rb, Cs; B = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Ni, Pd, Pt, Se, Te; and X = Cl, Br, I) have been studied [18]. The synthesis of thin films and single crystals of Cs2TeI6 has been done having an optical bandgap of 1.5 eV and Cs2PdBr6 showing a bandgap of 1.69 eV and strong long-term stability[19, 20]. Additionally, microcrystals of Rb2HfCl6 and various Rb2TeX6(X=Cl, Br, I) compounds have been experimentally synthesized[8, 21]. Recent advancements include the synthesis of Rb2SnCl6, Rb2SnBr6, K2SnBr6, and Rb2SnI6[22]. Recently, the potential for using Cs2SnI6 in solar technology has also been investigated[9]. The optoelectronic properties of various VODPs are significantly influenced by the B-site cation, with the choice of element affecting their structural and tunable optoelectronic characteristics due to the [BX6]- octahedra. However, Sn2+ and Ge2+ cations are prone to oxidation into Sn4+ and Ge4+, which can lead to instability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on these materials. Despite this challenge, Cs2SnI6, with its unique VODP structure, shows potential as a light-absorbing layer for PSCs[23]. This underscores the necessity of exploring Sn- and Ge-based VODPs further to overcome stability issues and optimize their performance in optoelectronic applications.. Another fact is that crystalline Si solar cells are widely used in industry but are more expensive to produce, which has prompted researchers to investigate the theoretical features of Si-based DPs. Cs2SiI6has already been studied computationally and it possesses a direct bandgap of 2.72 eV. Till now, according to our report, Rb2SiBr6 and Rb2GeBr6 have yet to be studied experimentally and theoretically. In this contribution, we employed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) based simulations to extensively explore the phase stability and optoelectronic properties of lead (Pb)-free Rb2BX6 (B = Si, Ge, Sn, Pt; X = Cl, Br, I) VODPs. All compounds maintain a stable, standard cubic double perovskite structure with alternating B-site vacancies, showing promising mechanical stability and flexibility. Electronic properties reveal that these materials have a direct bandgap except Rb2PtBr6 and Rb2PtI6. Then, utilizing excited-state methods, we computed the optical characteristics using the GW-BSE methodology based on the many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE)[24, 25], on top of a single-shot GW(G0W0)@PBE[26], has been solved to ascertain the electronic contribution to the dielectric function. Further, the ionic contribution to the dielectric function is obtained using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). Aditionally, our results indicate low carrier effective mass, high mobility, varied exciton lifetimes, and low to moderate exciton binding energies. Finally, we determined several polaronic properties, suggesting that most of the materials have high polaron mobility facilitating efficient charge transport in optoelectronic devices. Overall, this study offers a thorough analysis of a number of Rb2BX6 compounds and creates a pathway for the intriguing lead-free perovskite possibilities, which have significant promise for next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08289v1,Breakdown of continuum elasticity due to electronic effects in gold nanotubes,"A recent experiment reports a creation of goldene, which is two-dimensional gold with hexagonal structure. By rolling up the goldene, gold nanotubes (GNT) should exist, but their structural and electronic properties are not understood well. Based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate a breakdown of inverse square law, wherein the curvature energy stored in a GNT decreases with the inverse square of the GNT radius. This is due to the enhanced curvature energy in specific GNTs having nearly flat bands around the Fermi level. We show that the electron states on the flat band of GNT reflect those on the Fermi surface of goldene by using the Bloch and geometric boundary conditions, and that in-plane character of the latter states enhances the curvature energy.","References (1) H.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08194v1,"Computationally Efficient Machine-Learned Model for GST 
Phase Change Materials via Direct and Indirect Learning","Phase change materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) are ideal candidates for next-generation, non-volatile, solid-state memory due to the ability to retain binary data in the amorphous and crystal phases, and rapidly transition between these phases to write/erase information. Thus, there is wide interest in using molecular modeling to study GST. Recently, a Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) was trained for GST to reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies and forces at a fraction of the computational cost [Zhou et al. Nature Electronics \mathbf{6}, 746–754 (2023)]; however, simulations of large length and time scales are still challenging using this GAP model. Here we present a machine-learned (ML) potential for GST implemented using the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework. This ACE potential shows comparable accuracy to the GAP potential but performs orders of magnitude faster. We train the ACE potentials both directly from DFT, as well as using a recently introduced indirect learning approach where the potential is trained instead from an intermediate ML potential, in this case, GAP. Indirect learning allows us to consider a significantly larger training set than could be generated using DFT alone. We compare the directly and indirectly learned potentials and find that both reproduce the structure and thermodynamics predicted by the GAP, and also match experimental measures of GST structure. The speed of the ACE model, particularly when using GPU acceleration, allows us to examine repeated transitions between crystal and amorphous phases in device-scale systems with only modest computational resources.","Figure 1: A render of our molecular simulations of the amorphous and crystal structures of GST (made using OVITO Stukowski (2010)). Ge are shown in red, Sb are shown in blue, and Te are shown in yellow. Phase change materials (PCMs) have received attention for their ability to reversibly transition between stable solid phases with different electrical conductivities and optical reflectivities Ren et al. (2011); Ríos et al. (2015); Ovshinsky (1968); Lai (2003); Le Gallo and Sebastian (2020). These property differences allow PCMs to encode information in the solid phases – crystalline and amorphous – which correspond to bits of binary data Ríos et al. (2015); Lai (2003); Le Gallo and Sebastian (2020), as illustrated by Fig. 1. This phase transition can occur rapidly and locally due to temperature changes which may be induced by a laser, for optical storage, or electrically, for non-volatile random access memory Ren et al. (2011); Ríos et al. (2015); Lai (2003); Le Gallo and Sebastian (2020). Currently, the most commonly used PCM for memory applications is Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) Ren et al. (2011); Le Gallo and Sebastian (2020), and hence there is wide interest to better characterize this material both experimentally and through atomistic modeling. Our focus is on developing an accurate and efficient computational model for atomistic simulations of GST for use by the broader community. There are a range of approaches to model the interactions of the constituent atoms of a material via computer simulation. Empirical potentials that can be described by simple analytic functions of the particle coordinates, such as the ubiquitous Lennard-Jones or Coulombic potentials, can often successfully capture material properties. The simplicity of such models facilitate rapid computation of forces and energies, allowing for material simulations at large length and time scales. While these simple models are successful in many cases, they are insufficient to model a variety of materials, particularly when the electronic structure plays an important role in the interatomic interactions. This challenge arises for many phase change materials, such as GST, which are known to exhibit competing structural motifs Caravati et al. (2007). Consequently, methods to incorporate electronic structure, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), are often used to generate the forces and energies needed for a dynamical simulation. This procedure is referred to as ab initio molecular dynamics (MD), and has been shown to reproduce a number of the experimentally known properties for GST Kalikka, Akola, and Jones (2016). As pointed out in recent work Mocanu et al. (2018); Zhou et al. (2023), the computational expense of ab initio MD effectively precludes exploration of the time and length scales needed to study macroscopically relevant properties, such as the phase change cycle of GST. Thus, there is a need to explore alternative methods that combine accuracy and computational efficiency. Machine learning (ML) offers an approach that is being rapidly adopted to train computationally efficient models that reproduce the potential energy surface of DFT-based calculations Friederich et al. (2021); Ori et al. (2019). The field of ML potentials has been growing since 1992, beginning with general neural network (NN) potentials that draw on existing ML methods to train models on large sets of DFT data Friederich et al. (2021). Since then, regression models, such as the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) have become increasingly popular, where the training process fits preexisting, high-dimensional functions that enforce physical symmetries such as translation, rotation, and permutation of atoms of the same type Kolb et al. (2016); Li, Song, and Behler (2019); Friederich et al. (2021); Behler and Parrinello (2007); Behler (2016). Recently, several ML potentials that are directly trained on GST configurations computed with DFT have been developed: El Kheir et al. El Kheir et al. (2024) and Choi et al. Choi, Ghim, and Jhi (2024) developed efficient NN-based models, and Zhou et al. Zhou et al. (2023) developed a GAP Bartók et al. (2010); Mocanu et al. (2018). Despite the tremendous improvement in computational performance compared to DFT, the complexity of the GAP framework still makes it a challenge to simulate the length and time scales necessary to study the phase change properties that make GST so valuable. Here we consider an alternate ML approach that is potentially even more computationally expedient. The Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) Bochkarev et al. (2022); Drautz (2019); Lysogorskiy et al. (2023), a recently introduced regression model, is an efficient alternative with the flexibility to represent many existing empirical and ML potentials Lysogorskiy et al. (2021). Thus, our focus is to use the ACE framework to train an accurate and efficient GST potential. In order to train a suitable ML potential, it is critical that the training data set contains sufficient and accurate information on the interactions and states that are of interest to model Friederich et al. (2021). Since ML potentials are often trained for systems with complex quantum interactions, DFT offers clear advantages as a source of training data. This process of training a model on DFT interactions is known as direct learning, and has made up the vast majority of ML potentials to date. However, in order to build a representative training set, thousands of DFT calculations may be needed to cover a wide range of structures and thermodynamic conditions. Thus, the high computational cost of DFT presents a current limitation of this direct learning approach Ori et al. (2019). As an alternative to this traditional approach, a method of indirect learning has recently been proposed Morrow and Deringer (2022). Indirect learning is the practice of training a potential using an intermediate ML potential which was itself trained directly on the DFT; hence the moniker “indirect learning”. By generating the training set using an ML potential, expensive DFT calculations can be bypassed, allowing for a much larger dataset to be generated than would be plausible using direct learning. Morrow et al. Morrow and Deringer (2022) suggest that this procedure would allow the training set to sample a wider range of conditions than would be possible if it was generated using DFT, which may lead to a ML potential that is transferable to a broader range of conditions. In this paper, we develop potentials for GST using the ACE framework where we consider both direct learning using the published DFT training set of the recently developed GAP model for GST Zhou et al. (2023) as well as indirect learning from additional training configurations generated by this GAP model. (Note that the DFT training set of ref. 17 is also freely available, though it had not been published at the time this work was done). The resulting ACE potentials reproduce the behavior of GAP at approximately 1000 times the computational speed on equivalent computational resources. We validate that the properties of the indirectly learned potential agree with both GAP and the directly learned potential across a wide range of conditions. We then expand the training set used to do indirect learning and discuss the implications of our resulting potential. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our potential to efficiently model the phase change behavior of GST in device-scale simulations of 10^{6} atoms."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08160v1,Ultrafast Electron Dynamics in Altermagnetic Materials,"Altermagnets constitute a new class of magnetic materials that combine properties previously thought to be exclusive to either antiferromagnets or ferromagnets, and have unique properties of their own. In particular, a combination of symmetries connecting magnetic sublattices gives rise to a band spin splitting exhibiting unconventional d, g, or i-wave character.Their unique electronic properties have already led to new spin-dependent transport effects. Here, we consider their spin and charge dynamics on ultrafast timescales. We use a minimal tight binding model that captures the main features of the altermagnetic candidate material KRu4O8. In the framework of this model, we compute the spin-dependent electronic scattering dynamics after ultrashort-pulse excitation and show through these microscopic calculations how electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering processes redistribute optically excited carriers in a 2D slice of the Brillouin zone. We find that the optically excited spin polarization is long lived (\sim1 ps) compared to the electron-electron momentum scattering lifetime of roughly 10 fs. This contrasts remarkably with the much shorter spin lifetimes observed in typical ultrafast electronic spin dynamics in conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, making these pulse-driven spin excitation experiments a key probe of altermagnetism.","I introduction The exponentially increasing demand for storing and processing information in our AI digital age creates the need for pushing existing speed and efficiency limits [1]. Present-day devices are based on mature semiconductor and ferromagnetic thin-film technology [2], so that further advances likely need new materials and/or tools for information manipulation. In order to take magnetoelectronics from the GHz frequencies of current ferromagnetic thin-film technology to the THz domain, antiferromagnetic spintronics have been proposed due to their intrinsically faster antiferromagnetic dynamics. However, compared to ferromagnets with their robust magnetoelectric effects, they are hampered by small achievable signals due to the weak spin-orbit coupling needed to manipulate the Néel vector [3, 4, 5, 6]. In order to overcome this roadblock, altermagnets have been introduced and classified as new class of magnetic materials [7, 8, 9]. They constitute a possible material class for future non-silicon based information technology, as they combine the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets by exhibiting intrinsic THz dynamics with a robust, controllable magnetic splitting [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Altermagnets have so far been mostly studied for transport close to the Fermi energy and the intrinsic dynamics of their elementary excitations. In particular, novel effects such as the altermagnetic spin-splitter [15] call for an investigation of altermagnets in the ultrafast time domain that can be accessed and probed by laser pulses. The present paper investigates the spin dependent electron dynamics on these ultrafast timescales in a d-wave altermagnet including both electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering. By considering a planar d-wave altermagnet we can accurately describe the electronic dynamics using an effective model that captures the altermagnetic properties in a 2D slice of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Figure 1: Sketch of altermagnetic properties and processes included: (1.) Dispersion of the altermagnetic bands along high symmetry paths (vertical planes) and electron distribution at initial equilibrium projected onto the x-y plane at the Fermi-energy (2.) Electron distribution after laser excitation (3.) Altermagnetic conduction bands near the Fermi edge fit by tight-binding model (4.) Optically excited electron-electron scattering dominates dynamics on a sub-ps time scale (5.) Electron-phonon scattering contributes to cooling/electronic energy dissipation on a sub-ns time scale. Figure 1 presents an overview of the steps involved in our approach to compute the electronic dynamics in an altermagnetic band structure (1.) Calculation of the band structure and the ground-state electronic distributions using density-functional theory (DFT); (2.) Computation of the laser-excited k-resolved electronic distributions; (3.) Fitting a minimal tight binding model to the two conduction bands close to the Fermi edge that are predominantly excited by the optical pulse, as calculated in step (2.). Mapping the excited electron distributions from the DFT to the corresponding tight-binding bands from step (2.); (4.) and (5.) Computing the electronic distribution functions in these bands including electron-electron and electron-phonon interaction processes at the level of Boltzmann scattering integrals. The last step is performed in the 2D slice of the Brillouin zone (BZ) in which the band structure is dominated by the planar d-wave character of the altermagnet. The reduction to the 2D slice of the BZ enables us to treat electron-electron scattering dynamics at the level of Boltzmann scattering integrals including the relevant k-dependent spin splitting in the band structure. A full 3-dimensional treatment of the scattering integrals will likely renormalize the results but not change the physics; details are presented in the Methods section."

Its exact solution on the real-frequency axis at finite temperature for polarization using the diagrammatic Monte Carlo method [Phys. Rev. B 109, 045152, (2024)] captures effects of multiple Coulomb scattering of a single particle-hole excitation, but does not account for multiple pair excitations important for studying dielectric loses in metals at frequencies comparable to the plasmon mode. In this paper we report technical developments which allow one to efficiently compute the dielectric response in a wide frequency range from zero to a few Fermi energies without systematic bias at finite T. By applying it to the homogeneous electron gas we demonstrate how at small momenta the gap in the spectral density between the electron-hole and plasmon excitations, existing within the HF-BSE approach, is filled with two particle-hole excitations and is completely washed out already at temperature T\sim\varepsilon_{F}/10.","References [1] D.M.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08800v1,Deep Learning Accelerated Quantum Transport Simulations in Nanoelectronics: From Break Junctions to Field-Effect Transistors,"Quantum transport calculations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices, yet the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency has long limited their practical applications. We present a general framework that combines the deep learning tight-binding Hamiltonian (DeePTB) approach with the non-equilibrium Green’s Function (NEGF) method, enabling efficient quantum transport calculations while maintaining first-principles accuracy. We demonstrate the capabilities of the DeePTB-NEGF framework through two representative applications: comprehensive simulation of break junction systems, where conductance histograms show good agreement with experimental measurements in both metallic contact and single-molecule junction cases; and simulation of carbon nanotube field effect transistors through self-consistent NEGF-Poisson calculations, capturing essential physics including the electrostatic potential and transfer characteristic curves under finite bias conditions. This framework bridges the gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a powerful tool for high-throughput quantum transport simulations across different scales in nanoelectronics.","Quantum transport simulations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices. The non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) method[1, 2, 3], combined with density functional theory (DFT)[4, 5], has established itself as the standard approach for investigating quantum transport phenomena at the first-principles level[6, 7]. However, the computational burden of DFT-NEGF self-consistent field (SCF) iterations severely constrains its practical applications. This limitation becomes particularly critical in studying large-scale systems and dynamic processes, in which extensive sampling of configuration space is required. A prime example is the break junction experiments[8, 9], where quantum transport through nanoscale contacts evolves from metallic contacts to single-molecule junctions. Thousands of conductance measurements throughout this process are essential for statistical analysis, making first-principles calculations computationally prohibitive. Machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged as promising alternatives to accelerate quantum transport calculations. There are several ML attempts including direct prediction of conductance from atomic structures using local descriptors[10], and mapping combined structural and electronic features to transmission spectra near the Fermi level[11]. While these approaches demonstrate the potential of ML in transport calculations, they are often limited to specific systems or single transport property, lacking the generality required for broad applications in nanoelectronics. A systematic and comprehensive framework to accelerate DFT-NEGF simulations and capable of predicting various transport properties - from transmission spectra to potential profiles and current-voltage characteristics - remains elusive. The key to addressing this challenge lies in bypassing the time-consuming SCF iterations while maintaining first-principles accuracy. Our recently developed deep learning represented tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian method, DeePTB[12, 13], provides an efficient route to accurate electronic structure calculations. By combining deep neural networks with physics-based principles, DeePTB achieves remarkable accuracy in predicting both local environment-dependent Slater-Koster (SK) tight-binding Hamiltonians[12] and DFT Hamiltonians, overlap and density matrix in the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis[13]. Building on these capabilities, we present a general DeePTB-NEGF framework for efficient quantum transport calculations. This framework enables direct prediction of TB models or DFT Hamiltonians as well as the overlap matrices, eliminating the need for SCF iterations while maintaining first-principles accuracy. We demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of our approach through two representative applications: (1) break junction systems, where we successfully simulate the dynamic process in metallic contacts and single-molecule junctions, showing good agreement with both DFT-NEGF calculations and experimental measurements[14]; and (2) carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FETs), where we implement Poisson calculations in DeePTB-NEGF framework to study transport characteristics under finite bias, validating our results against the established NanoTCAD ViDES solver[15, 16]. These applications demonstrate that our framework can efficiently handle quantum transport across different scales and materials systems, opening new possibilities for high-throughput quantum transport calculations in nanoelectronics."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08664v1,UniMat: Unifying Materials Embeddings through Multi-modal Learning,"Materials science datasets are inherently heterogeneous and are available in different modalities such as characterization spectra, atomic structures, microscopic images, and text-based synthesis conditions. The advancements in multi-modal learning, particularly in vision and language models, have opened new avenues for integrating data in different forms. In this work, we evaluate common techniques in multi-modal learning (alignment and fusion) in unifying some of the most important modalities in materials science: atomic structure, X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), and composition. We show that structure graph modality can be enhanced by aligning with XRD patterns. Additionally, we show that aligning and fusing more experimentally accessible data formats, such as XRD patterns and compositions, can create more robust joint embeddings than individual modalities across various tasks. This lays the groundwork for future studies aiming to exploit the full potential of multi-modal data in materials science, facilitating more informed decision-making in materials design and discovery.","Materials science datasets are inherently heterogeneous and are typically represented using modalities such as characterization spectra, atomic structure, micro-structure images, and text-based processing information, etc 1, 2, 3, 4. Each modality possesses fundamentally varying sensitivities to different characteristics of a material. Integration of information across multiple modalities is necessary to achieve a comprehensive understanding of a material. However, this integration has been a challenge due to the heterogeneity of the data and embedded information 4, 5. These datasets, typically collected using diverse methods, often differ significantly in their format and volume, which complicates their thorough integration. Despite these challenges, effective integration of multi-modal data can enable tasks such as enhanced property prediction, and retrieval/generation of one modality from other prior-known modalities. These tasks are expected to play a pivotal role in identifying the best materials to investigate and to identify the best materials characterization workflow for accelerated materials discovery. Wherein, accelerated materials discovery is needed to address grand challenges in areas such as environment, energy, and security. The advancements in multi-modal AI methods, driven by the success of vision and language models, have opened new avenues for combining diverse data formats. Several multi-modal AI methodologies 6, 7, 8, 9 have emerged recently, and are currently being used to integrate various modalities in practical applications such as retrieval of one modality from another, for example, a text description into credible images or song lyrics into musical accompaniment. These methodologies also enable enhancement of representations learned for the single modalities, i.e. the integration of textual descriptions with visual data improves the accuracy and contextual appropriateness of image captions 10, 11. In addition, single-modal machine learning approaches in materials science have significantly progressed. Methods that use chemical composition, crystal structure, and various spectroscopic techniques in isolation have matured significantly, making them viable building blocks for materials discovery and design campaigns. Thus, it is an opportune time for us to adapt advancements in multi-modality to the materials science domain. The adaptation should be grounded in a few objectively verifiable metrics. Particularly, we judge the relevance of multi-modal AI methods in materials science based on the following criteria : • Can we enhance the predictive capability of one modality through integration of additional modalities? • Can experimentally obtainable modalities be integrated to obtain the information available via simulated modalities? This criterion has particular relevance for real world applications where-in information such as crystal structure typically available via simulation modalities are difficult to access through experiments preventing accelerated materials discovery • Can modalities with inherently weaker sensitivity to certain features benefit other modalities? While prior approaches have reported on sub-parts of these criteria, our work focuses on addressing all of these fundamental criteria using multi-modal AI methods. We particularly emphasize on the utility of multi-modal AI methodologies to capture material properties from experimentally accessible modalities. In this contribution, we present UniMat, a multi-modal AI methodology that unifies material embeddings from various modalities, such as XRD patterns, structure graphs, and compositional features. We demonstrate that lattice lengths and angles can be better predicted with crystal structure graphs aligned with simulated XRD patterns, compared to crystal structure graphs alone. By fusing and aligning embeddings from the XRD patterns and chemical composition, we achieve predictive accuracy comparable to models that rely solely on structure graphs, outperforming single-modality approaches like XRD-only or composition-only models. Our comparison of XRD/composition-based predictions with structure graph-based methods also demonstrates how experimental modalities (XRD and composition) can be effectively combined to achieve performance on par with models that strictly rely on crystal structure data."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08598v1,Space-local memory in generalized master equations: Reaching the thermodynamic limit for the cost of a small lattice simulation,"The exact quantum dynamics of lattice models can be computationally intensive, especially when aiming for large system sizes and extended simulation times necessary to converge transport coefficients. By leveraging finite memory times to access long-time dynamics using only short-time data, generalized master equations (GMEs) can offer a route to simulating the dynamics of lattice problems efficiently. However, such simulations are limited to small lattices whose dynamics exhibit finite-size artifacts that contaminate transport coefficient predictions. To address this problem, we introduce a novel approach that exploits finite memory in time and space to efficiently predict the many-body dynamics of dissipative lattice problems involving short-range interactions. This advance enables one to leverage the short-time dynamics of small lattices simulate arbitrarily large systems over long times. We demonstrate the strengths of this method by focusing on nonequilibrium polaron relaxation and transport in the dispersive Holstein model, successfully simulating lattice dynamics in one and two dimensions free from finite-size effects, reducing the computational expense of such simulations by multiple orders of magnitude. Our method is broadly applicable and provides an accurate and efficient means to investigate nonequilibrium relaxation with microscopic resolution over mesoscopic length and time scales that are relevant to experiment.","Lattice models play a key role in understanding physical and chemical phenomena. For instance, the Holstein Holstein (1959a, b) and Fröhlich Fröhlich (1954) models shed light on polaron formation and electrical transport in semiconductors Hulea et al. (2006); Fetherolf, Golež, and Berkelbach (2020), the Hubbard model Hubbard (1963) helps elucidate the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity Arrigoni, Fradkin, and Kivelson (2004), and the Ising model Ising (1925) is used to interrogate magnetism Newell and Montroll (1953) and phase transitions Dziarmaga (2005). However, while modern algorithms can efficiently simulate the quantum dynamics of small lattices over short times Tanimura and Kubo (1989); Makri and Makarov (1995); Wang, Thoss, and Miller (2001); Thoss, Wang, and Miller (2001); Suess, Eisfeld, and Strunz (2014); Wang (2015); De Vega and Bañuls (2015); Strathearn et al. (2018); Tamascelli et al. (2019); Schröder et al. (2019); Xie et al. (2019); Kloss, Reichman, and Tempelaar (2019); Makri (2021); Bose and Walters (2022); Gribben et al. (2022); Fux et al. (2023); Lacroix et al. (2024), reaching sufficiently large systems and long times to compare to experiments remains a fundamental challenge. is is because these methods often scale exponentially or, at best, polynomially with lattice size and simulation time, rendering the thermodynamic limit inaccessible. The severity of this limitation becomes clear when calculating dynamic properties, e.g., conductivities, viscosities, and diffusion constants, which are sensitive to finite-size effects Kikugawa, Nakano, and Ohara (2015); Simonnin et al. (2017); Cox and Geissler (2018); Jamali et al. (2018); Samanta, Ghosh, and Mohanty (2018); Bertini et al. (2021); Celebi et al. (2021); Cox and Geissler (2022). For example, finite-size effects can cause simulations to underestimate diffusion constants of polymers near the glass-transition Ray and Binder (1994), relaxation times of glass-forming liquids Berthier et al. (2012), the Curie temperature for Ni nanoparticles Dos Santos, Urbassek, and Bringa (2024), and the diffusion constant and viscosity of model fluids Yeh and Hummer (2004); overestimate the critical fermion-phonon coupling causing the metal-to-Peierls phase transition in a Holstein-Hubbard lattice Hébert et al. (2019); and yield apparently non-converging mobilities of dispersive Holstein polarons Bhattacharyya, Sayer, and Montoya-Castillo (2024a). These examples reveal the need of computing the dynamics of lattice models in thermodynamically large systems over long timescales. Generalized Master Equations (GMEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for reducing the computational cost of dynamical simulations Shi and Geva (2003, 2004); Zhang, Ka, and Geva (2006); Cohen and Rabani (2011); Cohen, Wilner, and Rabani (2013); Kelly and Markland (2013); Kidon, Wilner, and Rabani (2015); Kelly, Brackbill, and Markland (2015); Kelly et al. (2016); Montoya-Castillo and Reichman (2016, 2016); Pfalzgraff et al. (2019); Mulvihill et al. (2019); Ng, Limmer, and Rabani (2021); Mulvihill and Geva (2022); Amati et al. (2022); Lyu et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023); Sayer and Montoya-Castillo (2023, 2024a, 2024b). GMEs are exact non-Markovian equations of motion for nonequilibrium averages, correlation functions, and even multi-time correlators of select variables that encapsulate the effects of an environment into a memory kernel Nakajima (1958); Zwanzig (1960); Mori (1965). In dissipative systems, the memory kernel decays to zero over a finite memory lifetime, which can be shorter than the relaxation time of the desired correlation function. Thus, in principle, one can use a reference simulation over the memory lifetime to construct a GME that predicts the dynamics of the desired correlation function to arbitrarily long times. This temporal truncation of memory at its lifetime can reduce the computational cost of simulating the quantum or classical dynamics of complex many-body systems in different problems, including charge transfer reactions in solution Pfalzgraff, Kelly, and Markland (2015); Liu, Mulvihill, and Geva (2024), protein folding Cao et al. (2020); Dominic et al. (2023); Cao et al. (2023), nonlinear spectroscopy Ivanov and Breuer (2015); Sayer and Montoya-Castillo (2024a), and transport Yan et al. (2019); Bhattacharyya, Sayer, and Montoya-Castillo (2024b). However, to construct a GME from a short-time reference simulation, it must satisfy two conditions: (1) the simulation time must span the memory kernel lifetime, and (2) the reference calculation must be performed in the same system whose dynamics one intends to interrogate with the GME. If one constructs a GME using a small lattice simulation, particles encounter the lattice boundaries and manifest finite-size effects: one reduces the cost but still obtains the wrong answer. Hence, one must be able to afford an admittedly short-time reference simulation, but of a thermodynamically large lattice. The poor scaling of dynamical methods with system size renders this calculation at best impractical and at worst impossible. Here, we propose a novel approach to lattice problems that exploits our observation that certain GME formulations display a finite spatial memory to motivate truncating memory in time and space. This allows us to employ short-time reference simulations of small lattices to generate the exact quantum dynamics of thermodynamically large lattices over arbitrarily long times for the cost of only the small reference calculation. We demonstrate the strengths of this method by applying it to nonequilibrium polaron formation and transport in dispersive Holstein lattices. Enabled by our space-local GME, we simulate, for the first time, the exact nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of small polaron formation, relaxation, and flow in thermodynamically large one-(1D) and two-dimensional (2D) lattices with up to 900 sites over 100 ps, free of finite-size contamination. Our method is model-agnostic and can be expected to enable the efficient investigation of nonequilibrium excitation dynamics in dissipative lattices displaying local interactions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08597v1,Electron-Magnon Coupling Mediated Magnetotransport in Antiferromagnetic van der Waals Heterostructure,"Electron-magnon coupling reveals key insights into the interfacial properties between non-magnetic metals and magnetic insulators, influencing charge transport and spin dynamics. Here, we present temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy and magneto-transport measurements of few-layer graphene (FLG)/antiferromagnetic FePS3 heterostructures. The magnon mode in FePS3 softens below 40 K, and effective magnon stiffness decreases with cooling. Magnetotransport measurements show that FLG exhibits negative magnetoresistance (MR) in the heterostructure at low fields (\pm 0.2\,\text{T}), persisting up to 100 K; beyond this, MR transitions to positive. Notably, as layer thickness decreases, the coupling strength at the interface reduces, leading to a suppression of negative MR. Additionally, magnetodielectric measurements in the FLG/FePS3/FLG heterostructure show an upturn at temperatures significantly below (T_{\text{N}}), suggesting a role for the magnon mode in capacitance, as indicated by hybridization between magnon and phonon bands in pristine FePS3 via magnetoelastic coupling.","The interaction between conduction electrons and spin fluctuations in magnetic insulators, i.e., magnons, may cause electronic and/or magnonic spin current which may be probed either electronically, by measuring spin-mixing conductance, or thermally, by spin Seebeck effect (SSE) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Theoretically, scattering of electron and magnon (frequency \omega) results in transition from electronic state i to j with momentum transfer (\mathbf{q}), and can be expressed in terms of electron-magnon coupling (EMC) matrix element (\left\langle\Psi_{j,\mathbf{k+q},\downarrow}\left|\nabla^{\nu}_{\mathbf{q}}V% \right|\Psi_{i,\mathbf{k},\uparrow}\right\rangle\omega_{\mathbf{q}\nu}^{-1/2}), where V represents the electron-magnon self energy, analogous to the electron-phonon and electron-photon coupling [7, 8, 9]. However, this process requires a spin flip in the electronic state to satisfy the angular momentum conservation, whereas electron-phonon coupling operates independent of spin state. Depending on the EMC strength, efficient momentum transfer at the metal/antiferromagnetic insulator (AFMI) interface increases the effective local density of state (DOS), which in turn, influences the electron transport through the metallic channel. Moreover, as the lattice modulation in AFMIs is accompanied by magnetic order, magnons may couple with the electric dipoles which may be captured in magnetocapacitance (MC) measurement [10, 11, 12]. Effectiveness of magnon (frequencies GHz to THz, lifetime microseconds to nanoseconds) detection over a large distance (several micrometers) via magnetotransport/spin transport method rely on: (i) the interface between the magnetic material and the metal layers, (ii) the shape and size of the magnetic material, (iii) availability of low-temperature for the reduction of scattering with phonons, and (iv) the frequency range of the detection system [13]. Even though AFM magnons (THz range frequencies) are gaining interest due to faster dynamics, and robustness against external fields, the detection technique is challenging compared to ferromagnets because of the lack of net magnetization, which makes conventional magneto-optical techniques less effective [14]. Detection of spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in AFMIs is more challenging than FMIs as the coupling between the spin current and the complex magnonic structure of the AFM produces subtle changes in spin-mixing conductance than that of ferromagnets even at cryogenic temperature [15, 16]. In an electron-doped antiferromagnet, spiral phase of the sublattice magnetization is not energetically favorable due to the presence of homogeneous phase. Even though magnon exchange can bind two electrons, it is weaker at large distances (r) between electron, decay faster as \sim\frac{1}{r^{4}} than in holes (\sim\frac{1}{r^{2}}) [17]. Consequently, for the detection of the electron-magnon coupling, graphene as transport channel with low spin-orbit coupling, high spin diffusion length (\sim \mum at room temperature), high carrier concentration (\sim 1013 cm-2) is preferable over metallic films [18, 19]. To probe magnon-mediated fluctuation in carrier density of graphene, an uncompensated interface, where the electrons on the graphene surface couple asymmetrically to the AFM sublattice can increase the EMC [20, 21]. An effective approach for generating a magnon spin current involves using charge-spin conversion through spin-orbit coupling, along with continuous spin transfer between electrons and magnons [22, 23, 24], a process referred to here as charge-magnon conversion. This conversion efficiency is much higher for uncompensated interface and the efficiency is enhanced with the thickness of AFM in two dimensional regime as discussed by Liao et. al. [25]. Recently, Yang et.al. studied graphene/van der Waals AFM heterostructure (HS) and observed an unconventional manifestation of the quantum Hall effect which can be due to the presence of counterflowing spin-polarized edge channels originating from the spin-dependent exchange shift in graphene [26]. Moreover, in the stacked HS (graphene/vdW FM CrBr3/graphene), tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) at low temperature indicates magnon emission with a possibility of spin-injection [27]. Practically, for 2D AFMIs, thicker flakes (thickness \geq 5 nm), with higher magnetic moment and magnetic ordering temperature, may be transferred onto the graphene channel for stronger EMC [28]. In this context, few-layer graphene (FLG), compared to monolayer, provides better signal-to-noise ratio, higher sensitivity due to the increased carrier density, and greater robustness against the strain/rippling effect during micromanipulation process [29]. An alternative approach towards realization of AFM magnon-coupled electronic device could be correlating spin-charge-lattice coupling via Raman scattering with conventional magnetoresistance (MR) and magnetocapacitance (MC) measurement of FLG/vdW antiferromagnet HS in suitable geometry. Here, we bring together temperature dependent magnetotransport study (MR, and MC) and Raman spectroscopy in a FLG/bulk 2D AFMI FePS3 (out-of-plane anisotropy with T_{\text{N}} \sim 120 K) HS device. Similar to the pristine FePS3, spin-phonon coupled modes in the HS, indicative of magnetic ordering, were observed at/around 120 K, but with 3 times higher deviation (softening) from usual anharmonicity (\Delta\omega) when placed on FLG. Moreover, in the HS, contrary to the characteristics of magnetic Bragg peaks, magnon mode of FePS3 (\sim 120 cm-1) softens between 5 K and 120 K which suggests decrease of effective magnon stiffness in presence of graphene. In the HS device with micro-electrodes only on FLG, besides the typical positive MR (in isolated FLG) resulting from the distortion of the trajectory of charge carriers with increasing magnetic field, negative slope has been recorded at low magnetic field (\leq 0.2 T) persisting upto 100 K which is evocative of the EMC due magnon-to-charge conversion (see Figure 1(a)). Predictably, with lowering the thickness of AFMI, suppression of said negative MR in FLG has been observed due to the lessened magnetic moment in the few-layer limit of FePS3 which causes considerable drop in magnon-to-charge conversion and hence, reduced EMC. Further, MC of bulk FePS3, sandwiched between two FLG flakes, exhibits an upturn below magnon temperature (\sim 90 K) which suggests the role of magnon-phonon coupling in FePS3 on the interfacial electric polarization (see Figure 1(b)). The material perspective, and the device architecture reported here may have significant implications in future magnetoelectric memory and logic devices based on antiferromagnetic magnon."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08464v1,Crystal Structure Generation Based On Material Properties,"The discovery of new materials is very important to the field of materials science. When researchers explore new materials, they often have expected performance requirements for their crystal structure. In recent years, data-driven methods have made great progress in the direction plane of crystal structure generation, but there is still a lack of methods that can effectively map material properties to crystal structure. In this paper, we propose a Crystal DiT model to generate the crystal structure from the expected material properties by embedding the material properties and combining the symmetry information predicted by the large language model. Experimental verification shows that our proposed method has good performance.","Material science plays a crucial role in the development of modern technology and industrial production, with high-performance materials serving as the foundation for the manufacture of various advanced equipment. The generation of crystal structures is a central process driving the advancement of material scienceYao et al. (2023). As periodic materials, crystals are widely used in many important fields, including catalysts, alloys, and molds. In recent years, data-driven methods have made great progress in the task of crystal structure generation (Nouira et al. (2018); Hoffmann et al. (2019); Hu et al. (2020); Ren et al. (2022)). Among various methods, diffusion model-based methods have been shown to be particularly effective in generating realistic and diverse crystal structures (Xie et al. (2021); Jiao et al. (2024a); Jiao et al. (2024b); Ye et al. (2024)). These methods use random processes to gradually transform random initial states into stable distributions, effectively capturing the complex landscape of crystal structures. On the other hand, methods based on autoregressive models have also achieved good results in generating crystal structures (Taniai et al. (2024)). These methods treat crystal structure data as strings and perform structure prediction in an autoregressive manner. Despite the success of existing methods, few methods can accurately achieve end-to-end mapping of crystal properties to crystal structure. In this paper, we establish an end-to-end mapping between crystal properties and crystal structure through constraints on material properties and space groups. The method we proposed is called Uni-MDM, a universal material structure design model. This method establishes the relationship between material properties, space groups and crystal structures by combining the Fine-tuned GLM4(GLM et al. (2024)) model and the Crystal structure DiT model. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: 1. We divide the entire crystal structure generation process into two parts: first, the space group information is generated according to the required material properties, which is completed by the GLM4 model; second, the crystal structure is generated based on the material properties and space group information, which is completed by the DiT model. 2. We fine-tuned the GLM4 model through prompt engineering, allowing the model to output a reasonable number of crystal space groups and wyckoff positions based on the input elemental composition and material properties. 3. We proposed a DiT model that includes symmetry information constraints. By introducing material property embedding and crystal graph structure Transformer, the model can generate expected crystal structures through the constraints of material properties and space groups. 4. All our models have been trained and adapted on the NVIDIA platform and the Ascend Altas 800T A2 platform. Experiments show that our proposed method can generate stable crystal structures that meet the expected performance requirements under the constraints of material properties and space groups.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08414v1,Material Property Prediction with Element Attribute Knowledge Graphs and Multimodal Representation Learning,"Machine learning has become a crucial tool for predicting the properties of crystalline materials. However, existing methods primarily represent material information by constructing multi-edge graphs of crystal structures, often overlooking the chemical and physical properties of elements (such as atomic radius, electronegativity, melting point, and ionization energy), which have a significant impact on material performance. To address this limitation, we first constructed an element property knowledge graph and utilized an embedding model to encode the element attributes within the knowledge graph. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal fusion framework, ESNet, which integrates element property features with crystal structure features to generate joint multimodal representations. This provides a more comprehensive perspective for predicting the performance of crystalline materials, enabling the model to consider both microstructural composition and chemical characteristics of the materials. We conducted experiments on the Materials Project benchmark dataset, which showed leading performance in the bandgap prediction task and achieved results on a par with existing benchmarks in the formation energy prediction task.","The prediction of material properties is an important aspect of materials engineering applications, such as the discovery of novel materialsHamilton et al. (2024) with specific properties and the assessment of the reliability of materials in useZhao et al. (2024). Computational methods based on quantum mechanics (e.g. density functional theory, DFT) play a key role in predicting the physical and chemical properties of materials, but the high computational complexity, high cost and long computation time of such methods severely limit their applicability to large-scale materials systems. In recent years, machine learning methods have been adopted by an increasing number of research institutes due to their potential to efficiently and accurately predict material properties, opening up new avenues for rapid screening and optimisation of materialsMueller et al. (2016); Kong et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2023); Hwang et al. (2023); Banik et al. (2024). In these machine learning models, the characterisation of the material’s crystal structure is crucial. The crystal structure of a material is usually modelled by the smallest cell containing all the constituent atoms in different coordinates, repeated infinitely many times in 3D space on a regular lattice, making the material structure periodic in nature. By modelling the material crystal structure with Graph Neural Networks (GNN), representations based on geometrical structural information have been constructed to enable prediction of material propertiesXie and Grossman (2018b); Schütt et al. (2017); Choudhary and DeCost (2021b); Yan et al. (2024b); Xie and Grossman (2018a); Chen et al. (2019); Louis et al. (2020); Choudhary and DeCost (2021a); Choudhary K (2021); Isayev et al. (2017); Yan et al. (2024a). These research methods have introduced various strategies such as the introduction of geometrical features such as multi-scale information, symmetry features, bond lengths and bond angles to improve the prediction accuracy of various crystalline properties. Das K et al.Das et al. (2023) fused the multimodal features of the crystal structure and the textual representation of the structure to capture both the local domain features in the crystal structure and the global chemical features in the textual representation for the prediction of crystalline material properties. Although the method introduces multimodal data, the quality and consistency of the textual description cannot be guaranteed and must be generated using RobocrystallographerGanose and Jain (2019), making the data pre-processing process complex and dependent. Although these studies can effectively model crystal structures and their inherent properties, existing methods are purely data-driven, focusing on exploring the intrinsic topological structure and structural rules of crystal structures without incorporating any chemical prior knowledge. The lack of this crucial elemental-level information often leads to inaccurate performance predictions when these models are applied to complex material systems containing different types of elements with significant variations in their properties. In this study, we propose a multimodal fusion framework, ESNet, to enhance the accuracy of crystalline material property predictions by integrating element attributes with crystal structure features. First, we construct an element attribute knowledge graph that systematically captures the chemical and physical properties of elements (such as electronegativity, atomic energy, and modulus). Using an embedding model to encode this knowledge graph, we reveal deeper relationships among various elements, yielding a rich representation of elemental features. Then, ESNet jointly learns both element attribute and crystal structure features, allowing the model to represent material microcomposition and chemical characteristics from a more comprehensive perspective. For the extraction of crystal structure features, we reference the ComFormerYan et al. (2024a) approach. Extensive experiments on the Materials Project benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness and superiority of ESNet in predicting key material properties such as band gap and formation energy. Results indicate that the multimodal representation combining element attributes and crystal structure significantly improves model performance, offering a novel approach to crystalline material property prediction."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08331v1,Magnetic field control over the axialness of Higgs modes in charge-density wave compounds,"Understanding how symmetry-breaking processes generate order out of disorder is among the most fundamental problems of nature. The scalar Higgs mode - a massive (quasi-) particle - is a key ingredient in these processes and emerges with the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. Its related exotic and elusive axial counterpart, a Boson with vector character, can be stabilized through the simultaneous breaking of multiple continuous symmetries. Here, we employ a magnetic field to tune the recently discovered axial Higgs-type charge-density wave amplitude modes in rare-earth tritellurides. We demonstrate a proportionality between the axial Higgs component and the applied field, and a 90∘ phase shift upon changing the direction of the B-field. This indicates that the axial character is directly related to magnetic degrees of freedom. Our approach opens up an in-situ control over the axialness of emergent Higgs modes.","Charge-density wave (CDW) phases play an essential role in condensed matter physics, where they are closely linked to exotic phases and emergent phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity [1], topologically non-trivial electronic phases [2], or generating novel electronic states along domain walls [3, 4]. On a more fundamental level, charge-density waves serve as valuable platforms to explore general concepts such as the (tunability of the) nature of phase transitions, quantum criticality, and the breaking of symmetries. Especially those CDWs that are linked to unconventional ordering processes may offer access to explore phenomena postulated for high-energy particle physics. A recent polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopic study of the uni-directional charge-density wave materials GdTe3 and LaTe3 revealed a remarkable two-fold (A_{2}) symmetry of the CDW amplitude mode at room temperature and zero magnetic fields. This low symmetry is rationalized by quantum pathway interference processes that uniquely occur in these rare-earth tritellurides with two distinct charge-density wave vectors. In contrast to other, conventional CDW materials, RTe3 hosts two (nearly) degenerate nesting conditions, qCDW and c∗-qCDW, connecting p_{x}–p_{x} (p_{y}–p_{y}) bands of Te, and mixing p_{x}–p_{y} (p_{y}–p_{x}) bands, respectively [5, 6]. The resulting two-fold periodic CDW amplitudon with vector character has since been dubbed as an axial Higgs mode [7], i.e., a condensed matter analogon to a highly elusive elementary particle. Two natural questions arise: what is the microscopic mechanism that generates axialness in RTe3, and how can we control or tune the nature of the Higgs mode? Its axialness dictates the breaking of additional symmetries. We can conceive of several potentially relevant scenarios, illustrated in Fig. 1a: (i) Since GdTe3 orders antiferromagnetically below the Néel temperature T_{\mathrm{N}}=11.5 K, a coupling between the Gd spins and the CDW may be a crucial component to the axial Higgs mode. (ii) A slight lattice distortion of the Te square-net units within the CDW phase may be conducive to a ferro-rotational state with axial properties. (iii) A finite orbital angular momentum (OAM) can be generated from the mixing of Te orbitals via p_{x}\pm\mathrm{i}p_{y}, which breaks time reversal symmetry and can respond to an external magnetic field. Motivated by this open issue, we performed a polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy study on the two sister compounds GdTe3 (with low-temperature antiferromagnetic order) and LaTe3 (without any long-range magnetic order) at various temperatures and with applied magnetic fields. In this work, we show that the low two-fold symmetry of the Higgs mode persistently observed in both materials and across a wide range of temperatures, together with its dramatic field-dependence allows us to rule out spin degrees of freedom as a relevant ingredient, and ultimately highlights the relevance of orbital degrees of freedom to stabilize axial Higgs modes in RTe3."

Although first principles density-functional-theory (DFT) based EPC calculations are used widely, their efficacy is limited by the accuracy and efficiency of the underlying exchange-correlation functionals. These limitations become exacerbated in complex d- and f-electron materials, where beyond-DFT approaches and empirical corrections, such as the Hubbard U, are commonly invoked. Here, using the examples of CoO and NiO, we show how the efficient r2SCAN density functional correctly captures strong EPC effects in transition-metal oxides without requiring the introduction of empirical parameters. We also demonstrate the ability of r2SCAN to accurately model phonon-mediated superconducting properties of the main group compounds (e.g., MgB2), with improved electronic bands and phonon dispersions over those of traditional density functionals. Our study provides a pathway for extending the scope of accurate first principles modeling of electron-phonon interactions to encompass complex d-electron materials.","References Giustino (2017) F.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08125v1,Optimizing Phononic Crystal Waveguides for Acoustically Induced Spin Transport,"Through the use of strain and induced piezoelectric fields, surface acoustic waves have been shown to control quantum information processes, such as single photon emission and the coherent transport of electron spins. Regarding the latter, systems using plane surface waves have provided suitable demonstration systems, but to build complexity, more control over the acoustic wave may be required. One method for acoustic control is the use of phononic crystals consisting of periodic arrays of nanofabricated holes on the surface of a device. These inclusions form a metamaterial-like layer with properties different from the normal material to dictate the physics of wave motion. Exploiting these surface properties can lead to acoustic waveguides, which can be designed to control the path of the surface acoustic waves. The design parameters of a new type of phononic crystal waveguide is explored that uses 2-fold elliptical cylinder inclusions to create a slow region that also limits coupling and radiative loss to bulk acoustic modes. Such a waveguide would be the foundational piece in an acoustic circuit that could then mediate complex spin transport geometries.","The desire for scalability in quantum computation is illustrated by the fact that an estimated 2 million qubits are needed for computations in quantum chemistry [1]. To address this issue, groups have been developing ways to move quantum information around devices using ions[2], electrons[3], and spins[4]. The latter two studies use acoustic excitations in the form of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to confine and transport quantum states. SAWs are effective as their strain and piezoelectric fields can couple to semiconductor nanostructures and the charges and spins they contain. The high frequencies of the SAWs enables them to transport on the order of 1 billion individual electrons per second, therefore providing an interesting paradigm to study for quantum computation [5]. To this end, this ability of SAWs to couple to quantum states in semiconductors has lead to a number of interesting applications such as: the creation of single electron transistors[6]; control of single photons from quantum dots[7, 8]; opening additional band gaps in photonic structures[9] and inducing the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate[10]. In those studies using acoustically mediated charge transport, the electrons and holes are spatially separated by the piezoelectric electric field induced by the SAW and do not interact, allowing the ambipolar transport to extend up to millimeters due to the significant increase in their recombination lifetimes[11]. When a lateral confinement is applied (transverse to the direction of motion), the charges are then transported in fully 3-D confinement potentials, referred to as dynamic quantum dots (DQDs), that form a quantum conveyor belt and can be used to transport single electrons[6, 12, 13] or to coherently transport electron spins [4, 14]. However, previous work involving electron spins involved only simple, linear transport. To create non-trivial paths for the flying (as opposed to stationary) electron spins, a system for acoustic control could be based on controlling SAWs within phononic crystal (PnC) waveguide structures [15]. By creating acoustic circuits compatible with semiconductor nanostructures, complex, acoustically mediated circuits could be realized to control the flow of spin information. The proper design of a PnC structures is key as they cannot adversely affect the semiconductor nanostructure in an effort to control the SAW. For example, the transport of electron spins uses a GaAs quantum well as the transport layer, and a phononic crystal inclusion would require the use of shallow inclusions [16] that would not puncture the quantum well or resonant pillars on the surface [17]. Naturally, the confined acoustic mode must also generate a piezoelectric field in the region below the surface where the quantum well exists. Using shallow inclusions, a waveguide that simply consisted of the PnC metamaterial could confine a SAW and generate the requisite piezoelectric fields below the surface [18]. While being able to waveguide, that study still suffered from energy loss due to acoustic coupling to bulk modes. Recently, a new 2-fold symmetric inclusion geometry was proposed that lowers the mode frequencies below the sound line thus dramatically reducing energy loss while demonstrating an improved waveguide confinement [19]. Using this new inclusion design, the design and optimization of a waveguide will be examined with specific consideration made for the applications of acoustic circuits mediating spin transport in GaAs. In the original work using shallow inclusions as the phononic crystal waveguide in GaAs [18], it was found that a waveguide of four unit cells wide provide the best balance of lateral confinement while maintaining a core strain energy ratio above 0.6 and have the highest reciprocal attenuation. The original report of using elliptical cylinder inclusions replicated the four inclusion waveguide width for comparison [19], but a more detailed investigation was not completed. Building on that work, here we will explore the impact of waveguide parameters such as waveguide width, inclusion aspect ratio, and inclusion depth on key metrics characterizing surface acoustic wave (SAW) confinement, dispersion, and bandwidth within the waveguide, aiming to optimize waveguide performance for enhanced acoustic spin transport in GaAs."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08065v1,h-CMD: An efficient hybrid fast centroid and quasi-centroid molecular dynamics method for the simulation of vibrational spectra,"Developing efficient path integral (PI) methods for atomistic simulations of vibrational spectra in heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces has long been a challenging task. Here, we present the h-CMD method, short for hybrid centroid molecular dynamics, that combines the recently introduced fast quasi-CMD (f-QCMD) method with fast CMD (f-CMD). In this scheme, molecules that are believed to suffer more seriously from the curvature problem of CMD, e.g., water, are treated with f-QCMD, while the rest, e.g., solid surfaces, are treated with f-CMD. To test the accuracy of the newly introduced scheme, the infrared spectra of the interfacial D2O confined in the archetypal ZIF-90 framework are simulated using h-CMD compared to a variety of other PI methods, including thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (T-RPMD) and partially adiabatic CMD as well as f-CMD and experiment as reference. Comparisons are also made to classical MD, where nuclear quantum effects are neglected entirely. Our detailed comparisons at different temperatures of 250-600 K show that h-CMD produces O–D stretches that are in close agreement with the experiment, correcting the known curvature problem and red-shifting of the stretch peaks of CMD. h-CMD also corrects the known issues associated with too artificially dampened and broadened spectra of T-RPMD, which leads to missing the characteristic doublet feature of the interfacial confined water, rendering it unsuitable for these systems. The new h-CMD method broadens the applicability of f-QCMD to heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces, where defining curvilinear coordinates for the entire system is not feasible.","Liquid-air, liquid-liquid, and liquid-solid interfaces play critical roles in various chemical, biological, materials, and environmental processes. Vibrational infrared (IR) spectroscopy provides a wealth of information about interactions of molecules in condensed phases and at different interfaces, especially in aqueous environments.Sharma et al. (2008); Le Caër et al. (2011); Catafesta et al. (2014); Perakis et al. (2016) Specifically, IR spectra can reveal key fundamental insights into the complex hydrogen bond (HB) network of water and how it is influenced by temperature, pH, reducing or oxidizing potentials, and the presence of different ions, among others. Reliable atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of vibrational spectra requires an efficient way of incorporating nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). However, while the role of NQEs in chemical and material sciences is a widely acknowledged fact, the development of efficient computational methods and software platforms capable of incorporating them into MD simulations of complex systems has been a challenging task.Markland and Ceriotti (2018) Path-integral approaches, including path-integral MD (PIMD)Parrinello and Rahman (1984), centroid MD (CMD),Cao and Voth (1994a, b, c, d) and ring polymer MD (RPMD),Craig and Manolopoulos (2004, 2005a, 2005b) as well as a myriad of more sophisticated methods branched from them,Habershon et al. (2013) have emerged as the leading platform for the incorporation of NQEs in large-scale condensed-phase simulations. In these methods, NQEs are captured using Feynman’s imaginary-time path-integral formalism Feynman and Hibbs (1965); Feynman (1972) by taking advantage of the so-called isomorphism between the quantum-mechanical partition function and the partition function of a classical ring polymer (RP). Every nuclear degree of freedom (DOF) is represented by an RP comprised of n copies of the system, known as “beads”, connected by harmonic springs. The extended phase space of this RP captures NQEs, such as zero-point energy and nuclear tunneling. Hence, accurate yet computationally efficient path integral (PI) techniques provide powerful alternatives to prohibitively expensive full quantum-mechanical dynamical simulations. However, when it comes to calculating the IR spectra of complex heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces, the quantum dynamic community has struggled to propose a computationally efficient PI method that can accurately capture NQEs, which are more pronounced in spectra than other structural and dynamical properties. One of the most well-known formalisms to approximate the real-time dynamics while incorporating NQEs in the PI framework is CMD. In CMD, the dynamics of the particles are performed under the effective mean-field potential of the imaginary-time path-integral whose centroid is constrained to be at the position of the particle. For low dimensional systems, this effective potential can be calculated on a grid prior to dynamical simulations, while for large systems, it must be calculated “on-the-fly,” which is referred to as adiabatic CMD (ACMD).Cao and Voth (1994c) This is achieved by introducing an adiabatic separation between the centroid and internal modes by using the physical mass of the particle as the centroid mass, scaling down the mass of the internal modes of the RP, and attaching them to a thermostat so that they sample the equilibrium distribution while being constrained to the position of the slower moving centroid.Cao and Voth (1994c) Full adiabatic separation in CMD requires a very small mass for the internal modes and, thus, a very small simulation time step for the dynamics to be accurate. The computational cost associated with such choices led to the development of the partially adiabatic CMD (PA-CMD) method, where the mass scaling is not as extreme, allowing for a larger time step while still providing accurate dynamics.Hone, Rossky, and Voth (2006) Further work in reducing the computational cost of CMD comes in the form of fast CMD (f-CMD), where the effective potential is learned beforehand from PIMD simulations using force matching to create a new classical analytical force field Hone, Izvekov, and Voth (2005) or neural network potential (NNP) Loose, Sahrmann, and Voth (2022). It has been documented that vibrational spectra calculated using CMD methods exhibit red-shifting of peaks, primarily of stretch bands, which is worsened with the lowering of temperatures and/or for lighter particles.Ivanov et al. (2010) This phenomenon, dubbed the “curvature problem”, is a result of the RP spreading out along the angular coordinates of a system when approaching the inside of the stretching coordinates. This stretching reduces the force along the stretching coordinate, lowering the oscillation frequency of that coordinate and red-shifting the spectra. One approach to overcome the curvature problem is the quasi-centroid MD (QCMD) method introduced by Althorpe and coworkers. Trenins, Willatt, and Althorpe (2019a); Haggard et al. (2021); Trenins, Haggard, and Althorpe (2022a) QCMD works by defining a quasi-centroid (QC) for the molecule using curvilinear coordinates and determining the effective mean-field potential using an imaginary time RP that has its QC constrained to the particle position as opposed to its Cartesian centroid. Trenins, Willatt, and Althorpe (2019a) The resulting potential does not exhibit the same flattening on the inside of stretching curves as in CMD and thus does not have the red-shifting of vibrational spectra. The original adiabatic implementation of QCMD does not lend itself to scaling to complex chemical systems due to computational complexity and cost. Trenins, Willatt, and Althorpe (2019a); Trenins, Haggard, and Althorpe (2022a) Inspired by the f-CMD approach, Manolopoulos and coworkers developed the f-QCMD method. Fletcher et al. (2021); Lawrence et al. (2023a) In f-QCMD, a corrective potential to the classical force field is learned to create QCMD-like dynamics in classical simulations, but the corrections are found using iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) Soper (1996); Reith, Pütz, and Müller-Plathe (2003) on a set of distribution functions instead of force matching. While f-QCMD has shown reduced computational cost compared to QCMD, Fletcher et al. (2021); Lawrence et al. (2023a) determining the distribution functions for large molecules/frameworks poses a challenge. In a similar vein, Kapil and coworkers developed the temperature elevation PI coarse-graining simulations (Te PIGS) method. Musil et al. (2022) Like with some f-CMD implementations, a classical NNP is learned through force matching a PIMD simulation to incorporate NQEs. However, the PIMD simulations are performed at a high temperature where the RP distribution is more compact. Musil et al. (2022) The resulting NNP is then used for calculating vibrational spectra at lower temperatures without the curvature problem of CMD. Musil et al. (2022) While offering a simpler implementation for complex systems compared to f-QCMD, performing the high-temperature simulations to obtain the NNP could pose challenges for delicate systems or when using an NNP for the PIMD simulation where bond breaking/forming is possible at high temperatures. Here, to circumvent the curvature problem and create an accurate yet efficient scheme for calculating vibrational spectra of complex condensed phases and interfaces, we have devised a new method coined hybrid CMD (h-CMD) that combines f-QCMD and f-CMD methods. This method allows us to simulate interfacial systems involving complex frameworks with high accuracy for the most important degrees of freedom and reduced complexity for the others. To bring f-QCMD and f-CMD methods on equal computational footing, the latter f-CMD method is implemented with the regularized IBI method used in f-QCMD. We showcase the accuracy of our new hybrid h-CMD method on simulating IR spectra of D2O confined in zeolitic-imidazolate framework-90 (ZIF-90) compared to the experiment as reference. By comparing the spectra using our hybrid h-CMD method to PA-CMD and T-RPMD, as well as f-CMD and classical MD at different temperatures, we provide detailed insights into the applicability of this new scheme to complex interfaces. This work is structured as follows: In Section II, we outline our h-CMD method, followed by the methods used for calculating vibrational spectra. Simulation details are provided in Section III. In section IV, we provide our detailed analyses of the IR spectra of interfacial D2O confined in ZIF-90 at different temperatures, followed by conclusions and future works."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07960v1,Predicting Ti-Al Binary Phase Diagram with an Artificial Neural Network Potential,"The microstructure of the Ti-Al binary system is an area of great interest as it affects material properties and plasticity. Phase transformations induce microstructural changes; therefore, accurately modeling the phase transformations of the Ti-Al system is necessary to describe plasticity. Interatomic potentials can be a powerful tool to model how materials behave; however, existing potentials lack accuracy in certain aspects. While classical potentials like the Embedded Atom Method (EAM) and Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) perform adequately for modeling dilute Al solute within Ti’s \alpha phase, they struggle with accurately predicting plasiticity. In particular, they struggle with stacking fault energies in intermetallics and to some extent elastic properties. This hinders their effectiveness in investigating the plastic behavior of formed intermetallics in Ti-Al alloys. Classical potentials also fail to predict the \alpha to \beta phase boundary. Existing machine learning (ML) potentials reproduce the properties of formed intermetallics with density functional theory (DFT) but do not examine the \alpha to \beta or \alpha to D019 phase boundaries. This work uses a rapid artificial neural network (RANN) framework to produce a neural network potential for the Ti-Al binary system. This potential is capable of reproducing the Ti-Al binary phase diagram up to 50\% Al concentration. The present interatomic potential ensures stability and allows results near the accuracy of DFT. Using Monte Carlo simulations, RANN potential accurately predicts the \alpha to \beta and \alpha to D019 phase transitions. The current potential also exhibits accurate elastic constants and stacking fault energies for the L10 and D019 phases.","Ti-Al alloys are indispensable due to their high melting points, exceptional specific strength and stiffness, and excellent resistance to oxidation and corrosion [1]. These properties make them suitable for load-carrying applications in aerospace, automotive, and energy industries [2, 3]. While Ni-based superalloys have traditionally dominated these fields, Ti-Al alloys exhibit comparable performances at temperatures ranging between 600 and 800\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius} [4]. The ability of Ti-Al alloys, particularly the two-phase intermetallics like L10 \gamma-\chTiAl and D019 \alpha_{2}-\chTi3Al, to operate efficiently at elevated temperatures while maintaining resistance to oxidation and creep underscores their technological importance [5, 6]. The microstructure within Ti-Al alloys changes significantly with composition. At low Al concentrations, Ti has a low temperature \alpha (HCP) phase, and a high temperature \beta (BCC) phase. At an Al concentration around 12\%, the ordered hexagonal D019 (\alpha_{2}) phase forms. These phases, in turn, affect material properties such as ductility, fracture toughness, and creep resistance. For instance, lamellar \gamma-TiAl, with a combination of \gamma and \alpha_{2} phases, exhibits superior high-temperature performance but suffers from poor room-temperature ductility due to its complex dislocation slip and twinning systems [7]. Studying phase evolution within Ti-Al alloys is crucial for understanding and enhancing their mechanical behavior under operational conditions. Phase transformations dictate the material’s structural integrity and performance, particularly under thermal cycling, which is common in aerospace applications [8, 9]. Understanding these transformations helps in optimizing alloy compositions and heat treatment processes to achieve desired mechanical properties. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a pivotal role in the modeling of Ti-Al alloys by utilizing atomic-scale interactions to reproduce phenomena that can be challenging to observe experimentally. These simulations provide insights into the mechanisms of plastic deformation, phase transitions, and the impact of alloying elements on the material’s properties. Furthermore, MD can predict the behavior of materials under various loading and environmental conditions, thus aiding in the design of more resilient materials. Both experimental and computational methodologies have been used in the extensive study of Ti-Al alloys to interpret the complex interplay of alloy composition, microstructure, and mechanical properties [10, 11, 12]. Historically, experimental approaches, such as in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments, have provided significant insights into basic deformation mechanisms, interface strengthening behaviors, and crack nucleation and propagation in these alloys. These studies have elucidated the role of microstructural features like grain and interphase boundaries in governing plasticity and fracture behaviors [13, 14]. Computational research efforts have primarily focused on the use of density functional theory (DFT) [15, 12, 16, 17] and empirical or semi-empirical interatomic potentials such as the Embedded-Atom Method (EAM) [18, 19, 20] and the Modified Embedded-Atom Method (MEAM) [21, 22, 23] to describe the microstructural features in Ti-Al alloys. DFT calculations have shed light on the non-planar character of dislocation cores and their associated Peierls stresses, offering deep insights at the atomic scale. One major drawback in using these quantum mechanics-based methods is the computational demand required when simulating complex dislocations or large systems [24, 25, 26]. Emperical potentials, while useful in overcoming the size and time limitations of DFT, often fall short in accuracy. For instance, EAM and MEAM potentials have been tailored to capture the directional bonding essential for modeling Ti-Al alloys but have shown discrepancies in modeling the full spectrum of plasticity and fracture phenomena across different stable phases [27]. This has led to a partial understanding that lacks the ability to comprehensively predict material behavior under varied operational conditions, particularly at high temperatures. To address these challenges, a paradigm shift has emerged in the field of materials science, wherein machine learning (ML) techniques are leveraged to develop interatomic potentials [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. ML potentials represent a departure from conventional methods, minimizing reliance on physical or chemical intuition by interpolating mathematical functions using reference data obtained from DFT computations. This data-driven approach has revolutionized computational materials science, accelerating the discovery of new materials by accurately capturing the underlying physics of interatomic bonding. Some of the more popular ML potentials include the spectral neighbor analysis method (SNAP), Gaussian approximation potentials (GAP), spline-based neural network potentials (s-NNP),and moment tensor potentials (MTP)) [36, 37, 29, 38]. For the Ti-Al system, the most prominent ML potential employs the MTP [39] formalism and exhibits superior accuracy when compared to previous ML potential [40]. Despite this accuracy, MTP does not adequately capture the transition between pure Ti and its intermetallics. While it demonstrates excellent accuracy within the intermetallic phases, it fails to accurately predict phase evolution and the effects of solutes on the plasticity of pure Ti’s \alpha and \beta phases. Building on the foundation laid by previous research, the current study introduces significant advancements in the molecular dynamics simulation of Ti-Al alloys through the development and implementation of the Rapid Artificial Neural Network (RANN) framework [41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. This novel approach leverages machine learning to interpolate complex potential energy surfaces from a vast dataset derived from high-fidelity DFT calculations. Unlike previous interatomic potentials, RANN is capable of modeling both the dilute and intermetallic phases of Ti-Al alloys with a level of precision comparable to DFT calculations. RANN is also effective in seamlessly transitioning between different alloy phases without a loss in accuracy. This is particularly important for Ti-Al alloys, where phase evolution plays a critical role in determining material properties. To the best of authors’ knowledge, no existing interatomic potential comprehensively models both the dilute alloy and intermetallic phases of this crucial alloy at the atomistic scale. The current study bridges the gap between the modeling capabilities of dilute alloys and intermetallics of Ti-Al. Here, RANN is designed to be inherently flexible, enabling it to accurately predict phase behaviors, solute effects, and the thermomechanical properties of both dilute and intermetallic phases."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07953v1,Quantitative Phase-Field Modeling of Rapid Alloy Solidification,"We further develop a recently introduced phase-field model of rapid alloy solidification [K. Ji et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 026203 (2023)]. This model utilizes enhanced solute diffusivity within the spatially diffuse interface region to quantitatively capture solute trapping with a larger interface width, thereby making simulations on experimentally relevant length and time scales computationally feasible. The main developments presented here include testing the robustness of different variational formulations, extending the model to concentrated alloys by incorporating solid and liquid free energies from thermodynamic databases, as illustrated for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys with CALPHAD, extending convergence tests as a function of interface width to 3D, and carrying out simulations in both 2D and 3D to examine existing theories of microstructure development. Our results indicate that the simplest variational formulation that interpolates the bulk free-energy density between its solid and liquid forms is the most robust. Remarkably, for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys, this formulation yields a high-velocity nonequilibrium phase diagram that is independent of interface width, thereby demonstrating that the framework of enhanced solute diffusivity framework can be non-trivially extended to concentrated alloys. Other variational formulations have restricted ranges of materials or processing parameters that can be reliably modeled. We use 2D simulations to construct high-velocity microstructure selection maps for dilute Al-Cu alloys. The results validate the important role of latent heat rejection at the interface and extend the limited predictions of linear stability analysis [A. Karma and A. Sarkissian, Phys. Rev. E 47, 513 (1993)] and sharp-interface 1D simulations to fully nonlinear regimes. Furthermore, 3D simulations, carried out using a computationally tractable axisymmetric cellular/dendritic interface shape, demonstrate a good convergence similar to that observed in 2D as a function of interface width. Full 3D simulations, in turn, reveal that the standard theory of absolute stability is a good predictor of the upper critical velocity beyond which steady-state growth becomes unstable, despite the different morphological manifestations of this instability in 2D and 3D.","Alloy microstructures develop during solidification processes that range from conventional casting to advanced additive manufacturing techniques, where the solid-liquid interface velocity V spans six orders of magnitude from micron/s to m/s [1, 2]. Understanding the formation and evolution of these microstructures is essential for controlling the properties of the manufactured alloys, and it requires multiscale computational modeling. The phase-field (PF) method has emerged as a major contributor for modeling and predicting mesoscale microstructures during solidification processes [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This method describes a two-phase (solid-liquid) system by a scalar PF that takes constant values in each of the bulk phases and varies smoothly across interfaces of a characteristic thickness W. This scalar field can be coupled to the local thermodynamic state variables, such as temperature and solute concentration, and avoids the need for explicit front tracking. A number of PF studies have successfully predicted and elucidated microstructure patterns at length scales \sim 100 \mum observed in experiments, predominantly under slow solidification conditions where the interface is close to thermodynamic equilibrium [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Despite the physical solid-liquid interface thickness being around W_{0}\sim 1 nm—significantly smaller than the scale of microstructural patterns—PF simulations can be conducted at experimentally relevant length and times scales by upscaling the diffuse interface thickness [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], such that W\gg W_{0}. Techniques like the anti-trapping current help eliminate spurious effects from this upscaling [17, 18], ensuring local thermodynamic equilibrium at the interface. As a result, quantitative agreements between PF simulations and well-controlled experiments can be established [10, 12, 15]. Yet, modeling conditions far from equilibrium, as seen in rapid solidification processes like additive manufacturing, introduces unique challenges, encompassing two main aspects detailed below. The first challenge lies in modeling an out-of-equilibrium interface with complex morphologies, where nonequilibrium effects become dominant during rapid solidification. As the solid-liquid interface propagates at an increased velocity, the solid phase will trap excess solute, resulting in a reduction of the peak concentration as illustrated in the schematics of Fig. 1(a). This phenomenon, known as solute trapping, occurs when the semi-liquid interface region fully crystallizes before solute partitioning is complete, where the former takes a time \sim W/V for a diffuse interface moving at V, and the latter is established on the characteristic time \sim W^{2}/D_{l} for solute atoms of diffusivity D_{l} (in the liquid) to diffuse across the interface [22]. When these two time scales become comparable, i.e., V is close to a diffusive speed V_{d}\equiv D_{l}/W, the interface dynamics is largely controlled by the nonequilibrium effects. This is especially true for the range of V approaching or exceeding the so-called absolute stability limit V_{a}, beyond which the solid-liquid interface is theoretically expected to become morphologically stable [23, 24], when the stabilizing effect of surface tension surpasses the destabilizing effect of the solutal diffusion field. Except for very dilute alloy concentrations [25, 26], a smooth transition from cellular-dendritic to planar front growth is not typically observed. Instead, “banded microstructures” form [one example given in Fig. 1(b)], which consist of an alternation between bands exhibiting a microsegregation pattern characteristic of dendritic array growth, and microsegregation-free bands characteristic of planar front growth [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. Linear stability analyses that incorporate nonequilibrium effects have predicted the existence of oscillatory modes of the planar interface [37, 38, 39]. Nonlinear oscillations of the planar interface have indeed been shown to exist, but are insufficient to fully describe banding. Approximate analytical models of banding have also been developed, but assume instantaneous transitions between steady-state dendritic and planar front growth [29, 30, 34]. They also neglect latent-heat rejection found to strongly affect planar front oscillations [40, 39]. While these studies have provided useful insights, a quantitative modeling approach is essential to address basic questions about dendritic array pattern stability and the underlying mechanisms of banding. To achieve this objective, the computational modeling needs to incorporate alloy phase diagram, relevant thermal conditions, energetic and kinetic anisotropies of a solid-liquid interface, and importantly, nonequilibrium solute trapping effects over a broad velocity range, extending beyond the absolute stability limit. Figure 1: (a) Schematic representations of one-dimensional concentration c(x) and PF \phi(x) profiles during rapid solidification of binary alloys, where the positive x directs to the right side of the figure. c_{\infty} is the nominal concentration away from the interface. The solid and dashed c(x) curves represent lower and higher solidification velocities, respectively. (b)-(c) Comparison of banded microstructures for Al-9 wt.% Cu from the late stage of a thin-film resolidification experiment [36] and a 2D PF simulation with thermal diffusion [41] (\tilde{c}=c/c_{\infty} color map). Reproduced with permissions. The second challenge revolves around carrying out simulations on experimentally relevant length and time scales. While PF models have been shown to reproduce solute trapping properties for a physical choice of interface thickness W_{0}\sim 1 nm in one dimension [42, 43, 44, 45, 46], two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) simulations at the microstructural pattern scale generally necessitate the choice of an increased interface thickness in the PF model, i.e., S\equiv W/W_{0}\gg 1. This selection, however, induces spurious excess trapping. Given that the diffusive speed is inversely related to the chosen interface thickness S through the relation V_{d}\sim D_{l}/W\sim V_{d}^{0}/S (where V_{d}^{0}\equiv D_{l}/W_{0} is a constant), the excess trapping induced by S\gg 1 can profoundly influence interface dynamics, especially when nonequilibrium effects become dominant with V\sim V_{d}. In the context of slow solidification, this complication has been circumvented by introducing an anti-trapping current [17, 18], which effectively eliminates excess solute trapping, thereby restoring local equilibrium at the interface. The form of this current has been modified to also account for a moderate departure from equilibrium below the absolute stability limit [47]. Yet, to describe far-from-equilibrium phenomena, such as banding, a more quantitative strategy is needed to consistently eliminate this excess trapping across a wide velocity range from low to high V. In our recent study [41], a PF model was developed to address the aforementioned dual challenges. This model incorporates well-known nonequilibrium effects, including solute trapping characterized by velocity-dependent forms of the partition coefficient k(V) and liquidus slope m(V), as well as interface kinetics. A computationally tractable choice of W is used to model the solidification of a dilute Al-Cu alloy under far-from-equilibrium conditions. To compensate for the excess solute trapping, the model adopts a novel approach by enhancing the solute diffusivity D(\phi)\equiv D_{l}q(\phi) within the spatially diffuse interface region. Simple forms of q(\phi) are used to reproduce the desired V-dependent forms of k(V) and m(V) across an extremely wide velocity range, from near [k(V)\to k_{e} where k_{e} is the equilibrium value of the partition coefficient] to far from [k(V)\to 1] equilibrium conditions. 2D simulations revealed a new burgeoning instability in dendrite tip growth, driven by solute trapping at velocities nearing the absolute stability limit. These simulations also reproduced the formation of the widely observed banded microstructures and predicated band spacings that agree quantitatively with observations in rapidly solidified Al-Cu thin films [36], as shown in Fig. 1(b)-(c). Furthermore, the bands in the PF simulation form by the same lateral spreading mechanism as observed in the experiment, with a lateral velocity that remarkably matches the experimental measurements [48]. Furthermore, this PF model has recently been used to study the formation of banded microstructures during laser powder-bed fusion of a Magnesium alloy [49]. The strategy of enhancing solute diffusivity to upscale interface thickness has also been implemented in a recent formulation [50] with finite interface dissipation [46] to simulate banded microstructures during rapid solidification. In this paper, we revisit the aforementioned quantitative PF model [41], hereafter referred to as Model A, and present a derivative Model B based on a similar variational framework. We derive the evolution equations of each model from a free-energy functional and perform the 1D asymptotic analysis, demonstrating that the solute trapping properties of both PF models match the predictions of the microscopic Continuous Growth (CG) model [51] in the large V limit. While Model A is derived from a phenomenological free-energy functional introduced in Ref. [43] for a dilute binary alloy, Model B is based on a free energy that interpolates between bulk phases at the interface, allowing for the modeling of both dilute and non-dilute alloys with the integration of free-energy functions from the Calculation of Phase Diagrams (CALPHAD). In addition, we introduce a revised PF model that separates solute diffusion in normal and tangential directions to study the effects of excess surface diffusion. Furthermore, we expand the modeling capabilities by coupling latent-heat diffusion to the PF simulation and extending the simulation to 3D. Numerical simulations in 2D produce microstructure selection maps for dilute Al-Cu alloys under different thermal conditions, including the standard frozen temperature approximation assuming a fixed homogeneous temperature gradient and the time-dependent calculation of thermal diffusion within an adiabatic zone. In the latter, the banded microstructure is selected at a higher composition, which is in good agreement with the results of linear stability analyses [40, 39], demonstrating the significant effects of latent-heat diffusion on banding. The transitions from cellular/dendritic to planar/banding with various alloy compositions are investigated through 2D PF simulations. The PF results with S=1 agree well with the absolute stability limit that is analytically predicted when the cellular/dendritic solution loses stability. The PF model is also extended to 3D, with both axisymmetric and full 3D simulations conducted at velocities close to the absolute stability limit. The latter reveal a tail instability developing in the grooves of dendrite arms, which resembles the corrugated roofs observed in 2D simulations but differs from the hemispherical caps seen in axisymmetric cases. Moreover, we address a numerical issue specific to Model A under certain combinations of alloy and modeling parameters. The free-energy density f_{AB}(\phi,T) in Model A encompasses contributions from both the pure substance and the solute addition, where \phi is the PF varying from +1 in the solid to -1 in the liquid, and T denotes temperature. A phenomenological form of f_{AB}(\phi,T) [43] is chosen in Model A, such that the stationary solution of the PF profile is exactly a hyperbolic tangent function. This is achieved by using different functions of \phi to interpolate the pure-substance and chemical parts of the free energy between the solid and liquid phases. In the dilute limit, this PF formulation is equivalent to the Kim-Kim-Suzuki model [52] that interpolates the concentration in the interface region between its solid and liquid values, and a thermodynamically-based formulation that interpolates the grand potential [20]. The choice of f_{AB}(\phi,T) in Model A, however, can lead to the emergence of an additional spurious minimum of the bulk free-energy density at values other than \phi=\pm 1 within the interval -1<\phi<1 , thereby causing unphysical simulation results. As presented in Sec. III.1, we distinguish between the“safe” and “unsafe” regions within the parameter space. In the safe region, Model A operates under any interface driving force, whereas in the unsafe region, certain driving forces might induce the development of unphysical phases. Typically, the unsafe region is characterized by a high nominal concentration c_{\infty}, a small k_{e}, and/or a large interface thickness S. Even for the case of S=1, a sufficiently small k_{e} can lead to the appearance of unphysical phases under certain driving forces, which holds true for both Model A, as discussed here, and the PF models in Refs. [52, 20]. Within the unsafe region, simulations using these models are still feasible as long as the driving force does not trigger unphysical phases, though extra caution is required. This numerical issue does not arise in Model B, which interpolates the free energy of the solid and liquid phases across a diffuse interface. It should be noted that Model B in its S=1 case is equivalent to the PF formulation introduced in Refs. [53, 54], where the interface is assumed to be in an intermediate state between the two bulk phases. Although the solution of Model B deviates from the hyperbolic tangent profile of the stationary PF solution, this model reproduces the quantitative k(V) and m(V) curves similar to that of Model A for dilute alloys and circumvents the problem of unphysical phases for any combination of alloy and modeling parameters. However, given that Model B introduces a higher energy barrier, it requires more stringent conditions for numerical stability and results in higher computational costs. Thus, we primarily utilize Model A for PF simulations of dilute alloys, resorting to Model B only when parameters fall into the unsafe region. The approach of interpolating the free energy of bulk phases at the interface in Model B also provides additional flexibility. This allows for the integration of Gibbs free energy as functions of temperature and alloy concentration for each phase, commonly used to accurately predict phase properties in CALPHAD. By applying these experimentally verified free-energy functions and enhancing interfacial diffusion for an upscaled interface, we investigate solute trapping for concentrated Al-Ag alloys. The nonequilibrium liquidus and solidus predicted by the PF model are nearly S-independent, enabling the quantitative modeling of rapid solidification of non-dilute binary alloys at experimentally relevant time and length scales. An example 2D PF simulation for a concentrated Al-Ag alloy is provided. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we first introduce the sharp-interface equations for a moving solid-liquid interface. Then, we present detailed derivations of PF models in Sec. III. Asymptotic analyses, approximate and full PF solutions of solute trapping are presented in Sec. IV. Numerical results in both 2D and 3D are discussed in Sec. V. Lastly, conclusions and perspectives are given in Sec. VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07629v1,Periodic phase diagrams in micromagnetics with an eigenvalue solver,"This work introduces an approach to compute periodic phase diagram of micromagnetic systems by solving a periodic linearized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation using an eigenvalue solver with the Finite Element Method formalism. The linear operator in the eigenvalue problem is defined as a function of the periodic phase shift wave vector. The dispersion diagrams are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for complex eigen frequencies and corresponding eigen states for a range of prescribed wave vectors. The presented approach incorporates a calculation of the periodic effective field, including the exchange and magnetostatic field components. The approach is general in that it allows handling 3D problems with any 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities. The ability to calculated periodic diagrams provides insights into the spin wave propagation and localized resonances in complex micromagnetic structures.","The study of micromagnetic systems is important for our understanding of the fundamental behaviors of magnetic materials and their applications. At the core of these studies lies the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, a fundamental tool for describing the dynamic evolution of magnetization in response to internal and external excitations. However, analyzing the dynamics of periodic micromagnetic structures remains a significant computational challenge due to the complexity of boundary conditions and the interactions between periodic elements. Periodic systems, such as magnetically large object and patterned nanostructures, exhibit unique properties arising from their symmetry and periodic boundary conditions. The linearized form of the LLG equation [1] provides a pathway to analyze the stability, resonance phenomena, and spin wave propagation in such systems, but it necessitates an accurate and efficient calculation of the periodic fields. Conventional periodic micromagnetic methods often encounter difficulties in handling the periodicity or with phase shift[2, 3, 4, 5], leading to challenges in the ability to calculate phase diagrams and eigenvalue spectra in general 3D structures with 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities[6, 7, 8]. In this paper, we propose an approach to solve eigenvalue problems using the linearized LLG equation with periodic boundary conditions in the Finite Element Method (FEM) framework. We consider general 3D periodic problems possibly with 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities (Fig. 1). A key aspect of our methodology is the precise computation of the periodic fields, which ensures compatibility with the micromagnetic framework while preserving the periodicity of the system. By employing this approach, we aim to construct periodic phase diagrams that capture the stability and dynamic (spin wave propagation) properties of micromagnetic systems under various conditions. We validate our method through applications to well-studied periodic micromagnetic systems, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in calculating the periodic problem with phase shift. We then demonstrate the power of the approach by calculating dispersion diagrams of 1D and 2D periodic problems. This work contributes a new computational framework for analyzing periodic micromagnetic structures, offering potential insights for researchers in dynamic magnetism, spintronics, and materials science.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07614v1,Two-dimensional room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors,"To realize ferromagnetic semiconductors with high Curie temperature T\rm_{C} is still a challenge in spintronics. Recent experiments have obtained two-dimensional (2D) room temperature ferromagnetic metals, such as monolayers MnSe2 and Cr3Te6. In this paper, by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we proposed a way to obtain 2D high T\rm_{C} ferromagnetic semiconductors through element replacement in these ferromagnetic metals. High T\rm_{C} ferromagnetic semiconductors are predicted in the monolayers (Mn, D)Se2 and (Cr, D)3Te6, where element D is taken as vacancy, 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal elements.

In addition, Mn(Se6/8, Sb2/8)2 is also predicted to be a 2D ferromagnetic semiconductor with T\rm_{C} above 300 K.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07545v1,Terahertz control of surface topology probed with subatomic resolution,"Light-induced phase transitions offer a method to dynamically modulate topological states in bulk complex materials[1, 2, 3, 4]. Yet, next-generation devices demand nanoscale architectures with contact resistances near the quantum limit[5] and precise control over local electronic properties[6]. The layered material \ceWTe2 has gained attention as a likely Weyl semimetal[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], with topologically protected linear electronic band crossings hosting massless chiral fermions. Here, we demonstrate a topological phase transition facilitated by light-induced shear motion of a single atomic layer at the surface of bulk \ceWTe2, thereby opening the door to nanoscale device concepts. Ultrafast terahertz fields enhanced at the apex of an atomically sharp tip[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30] resonantly couple to the key interlayer shear mode of \ceWTe2 via a ferroelectric dipole at the interface[31, 32, 33, 34], inducing a structural phase transition at the surface to a metastable state. Subatomically resolved differential imaging, combined with hybrid-level density functional theory, reveals a shift of 7 \pm 3 picometres in the top atomic plane. Tunnelling spectroscopy links electronic changes across the phase transition with the electron and hole pockets in the band structure, suggesting a reversible, light-induced annihilation of the topologically-protected Fermi arc surface states in the top atomic layer.","With technology reaching the limits of conventional design and fabrication, next-generation device concepts based on nanoscale architectures, terahertz clock rates, and complex material systems are becoming increasingly important. For example, light-induced phase transitions in complex materials promise a route to ultrafast switching of versatile electronic and photonic devices[1, 2, 3, 4]. Materials with switchable, topologically non-trivial phases are especially intriguing due to their symmetry-protected states, which offer unique electronic properties. Theoretical calculations[7, 8, 12, 9, 13, 15, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 20, 22, 35, 23, 11] and experimental studies with scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM)[16, 17, 18], angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)[10, 13, 19, 9, 8, 12, 11], and transport measurements[15] suggest that the non-centrosymmetric Td phase of bulk \ceWTe2 is a type-II Weyl semimetal at low temperature. This classification refers to the presence of three-dimensional (3D) linear electronic band crossings at the touching points of electron and hole pockets. The absence of inversion symmetry leads to pairs of Weyl points with opposite chirality, which are non-degenerate in momentum space and connected by topologically protected Fermi arc surface states[7]. It has been shown that strong terahertz fields can resonantly excite an interlayer shear mode[21], while mid-infrared and near-infrared pulses can non-resonantly drive the bulk lattice structure into a metastable state via the shear mode[36, 22, 37, 23, 24, 38, 21, 39]. The light-induced structural phase transition can restore inversion symmetry, which leads to an annihilation of the Weyl points and, hence, a topological electronic phase transition from a Weyl semimetal to a trivial semimetal. In contrast to its bulk form, monolayer \ceWTe2 is a quantum spin Hall insulator in its low-temperature ground state[40]. Moreover, the stacking of few-layer \ceWTe2 leads to a spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization[31, 32, 33, 34]. The orientation of this ferroelectric dipole can be switched through a sliding motion of the top atomic layer, which can be induced by a vertical field on the scale of 0.1–0.2 V/nm (refs. [31, 34]). A similar shift of the top atomic layer of bulk \ceWTe2 has also been activated by static doping with adsorbed potassium atoms[41]. In the present work, we show that terahertz fields enhanced at an atomically sharp tip apex and polarized normal to a bulk \ceWTe2 surface couple to its ferroelectric dipole. When these terahertz near-fields exceed \qty1V/nm, they induce a localized structural phase transition of the topmost atomic layer, driving it from the low-temperature Td phase to a metastable state characterized by both a shear translation and an intralayer distortion. As a result, the electronic structure at the vacuum interface undergoes a phase transition, where the top layer can no longer host Fermi arc surface states. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations using hybrid exchange-correlation functionals are integral to this analysis, providing a comprehensive understanding of the ground and metastable states observed in experiments along with insight into the stability of the Weyl points."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07448v1,Defect formation in CsSnI from Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning,"Sn-based perovskites as low-toxic materials are actively studied for optoelectronic applications. However, their performance is limited by p-type self-doping, which can be suppressed by substitutional doping on the cation sites. In this study, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with machine learning (ML) to develop a predictive model and identify the key descriptors affecting formation energy and charge transition levels of the substitutional dopants in CsSnI3. Our DFT calculations create a dataset of formation energies and charge transition levels and show that Y, Sc, Al, Nb, Ba, and Sr are effective dopants that pin the fermi level higher in the band gap, suppressing the p-type self-doping. We explore ML algorithms and propose training the random forest regression model to predict the defect formation properties. This work shows the predictive capability of combining DFT with machine learning and provides insights into the important features that determine the defect formation energetics.","Halide perovskites are promising candidates for optoelectronic applications due to their straightforward synthesis methods and optical and charge transport properties.Zhou and Zhao (2019); Dong et al. (2015); Stranks et al. (2013); Noh et al. (2013) The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Pb-based perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) has dramatically improved. Kojima et al. (2009); 6-p CsSnI3 has been explored as a promising low-toxicity alternative to Pb-based perovskites.Chung et al. (2012a, b); Eperon et al. (2015); Babayigit et al. (2016) However, despite its potential, the PCE of CsSnI3 remains lower (14.8%)Yu et al. (2021) than that of CsPbI3. This reduced efficiency is primarily attributed to substantial self-p-type doping and defect-assisted nonradiative recombination.Song et al. (2017); Chung et al. (2012b); Xu et al. (2014); Shi et al. (2017) To address these limitations, defect engineering through doping has been investigated as a potential solution to improve Sn-based perovskite properties. Experimental studies on Ba-doped Sn-Pb perovskites indicate that Ba incorporation can reduce hole concentration, thereby reducing the effects of p-type doping.Yu et al. (2022) Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide a theoretical understanding of the mechanism, showing that Ba acts as an energetically favorable donor in CsSnI3 that shifts the Fermi level upward and decreases the background hole concentration.Zhang and Chen (2023) DFT studies also propose that trivalent cation doping on Sn site in MASnI3 including Sc, La, and Ce can also raise the Fermi level, which is supported by experimental validation that La doping in MASnI3 results in an increase in photocurrent and open circuit voltage.Gregori et al. (2024a) Another DFT study on MASnI3/MASnI2Br proposes that Sc, Y, and La doping can shift the Fermi level upward, thereby reducing hole concentration compared to pristine perovskites.Gregori et al. (2024b) DFT is widely used to predict defect formation energies under various chemical potentials and has reliably predicted intrinsic defect and dopant formation energies and charge transition levels in semiconductors.Xu et al.

This work combines DFT using HSE06+SOC with ML to predict formation energies and charge transition levels for substitutional dopants in CsSnI3. We explore elements from group II-A (e.g., Mg, Ca), transition metals (e.g., Sc, Y, Ti), post-transition metals (e.g., Al, Ga, In), and metalloids (e.g., Ge, As, Sb). DFT calculations are performed to generate a dataset for formation energies in the neutral (q=0) and q=+1 charge states as well as the +1/0 charge transition level. We then identify key descriptors affecting formation energy and develop predictive models for the formation energies and charge transition levels of dopants in CsSnI3. Linear and nonlinear regression models including linear regression, gaussian process regression, kernel ridge regression, and random forest regression are trained to determine the most accurate model. We also analyze the feature correlations and feature importance and extend predictions to other out-of-sample dopants in CsSnI3."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07367v1,Modeling Extensive Defects in Metals through Active Machine Learning and Automated Configuration Reconstruction,"Extended defects such as dislocation networks and complex grain boundaries are ubiquitous in metals, and accurately modeling these extensive defects is crucial for understanding their deformation mechanisms. Existing machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often fall short in adequately describing these defects, as their significant characteristic sizes exceed the computational limits of first-principles calculations. To address these challenges, this study constructs a comprehensive defect genome, derived through active machine learning from classical empirical potentials, and augmented by conventional on-the-fly active learning. Additionally, we have developed a approach for transforming defect atomic clusters into periodic configurations via precise atom insertion, using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations. These strategies enable the development of highly accurate and transferable MLIPs for modeling extensive defects in metals. Using body-centered cubic tungsten as a model system, we develop an MLIP that reveals previously undocumented plastic mechanisms in simulations of nanoindentation and dislocation-grain boundary interactions. This framework not only improves the modeling accuracy of extensive defects in crystalline materials but also establishes a robust foundation for further advancement of MLIP development through the strategic use of defect genomes.",Abstract
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07999v1,Estimation of spin-orbit torques in the presence of current-induced magnon creation and annihilation,"We present a comprehensive set of harmonic resistance measurements of the dampinglike (DL) and fieldlike (FL) torques in Pt/CoFeB, Pt/Co, W/CoFeB, W/Co, and YIG/Pt bilayers complemented by measurements of the DL torque using the magneto-optical Kerr effect and calibrated by nitrogen vacancy magnetometry on the same devices. The magnon creation-annihilation magnetoresistances depend strongly on temperature and on the magnetic and transport properties of each bilayer, affecting the estimate of both the DL and FL torque. The DL torque, the most important parameter for applications, is overestimated by a factor of 2 in W/CoFeB and by one order of magnitude in YIG/Pt when not accounting for the magnonic contribution to the planar Hall resistance. We further show that the magnonic contribution can be quantified by combining measurements of the nonlinear longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistances, thus providing a reliable method to measure the spin-orbit torques in different material systems.","I The harmonic Hall resistance analysis of SOTs I.1 Standard analysis The change of the magnetization direction due to the SOT in NM/FM bilayers gives rise to a change of the magnetoresistance. As this change is proportional to the current, a second harmonic transverse or longitudinal magnetoresistance can be detected when using an alternating current. It is thus possible to evaluate the SOTs from the transverse magnetoresistance measurement in a Hall bar device pi10 ; garello13 ; kim13 ; avci14 ; hayashi14 . Thanks to its simplicity, the harmonic Hall resistance analysis has been extensively used to study and evaluate the SOTs in NM/FM bilayers manchon19 ; nguyen21 both in in-plane magnetized avci14 ; wen17 ; lau17 ; neumann18 ; masuda20 ; chi20 ; du20 ; hibino20 ; du21 ; lee21 ; binda21 ; binda23 and out-of-plane magnetized samples garello13 ; hayashi14 ; pai15 ; nguyen16 ; ghosh17 ; avci17 ; zhu18 ; zhu19a ; wang19 ; ghosh22 ; shirokura21 ; krishnia21 ; wang23 . More recently it was further used to estimate the SOTs in NM/antiferromagnet bilayers cogulu22 as well as the SOTs associated to the orbital Hall effect in light metal/FM bilayers sala22 ; ding22 . The technique further allows for disentangling the current-induced SOT and thermoelectric contributions, as described by Avci et al. avci14 ; avci15 ; ghosh17 . When the magnetization is rotated in-plane by an angle \varphi relative to the current direction, the first and second harmonic transverse magnetoresistance R_{xy}^{1\omega} and R_{xy}^{2\omega} are given by: R_{xy}^{1\omega}=R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{1\omega}\sin\varphi\cos\varphi, (1) \begin{split}R_{xy}^{2\omega}=(-R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega}+R_{\mathrm{\nabla T% },xy}^{2\omega}-\frac{1}{2}R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega})\cos\varphi\\ +(2R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega})\cos^{3}\varphi,\end{split} (2) where R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{1\omega} is the planar Hall resistance, R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega} is the change of transverse resistance due to the DL torque, R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2\omega} is the transverse magnetothermal contribution due to the out-of-plane thermal gradient associated with the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) and spin Seebeck effect (SSE), R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega} is the change of transverse resistance induced by the Oersted field and the FL torque. For simplicity, we will not separate the FL torque due to the spin accumulation and the Oersted field contributions. The latter can be estimated by Ampere’s law or directly measured by NV microscopy, as shown in Sect. III.2. Similarly, the second harmonic longitudinal contribution R_{xx}^{2\omega} includes contributions from torques and magnetothermal effects, as well as the unidirectional spin Hall magnetoresistance (USMR) avci15 ; langenfeld16 ; yasuda16 ; li17 ; wang18 ; borisenko18 ; avci18 ; sterk19 ; liu21 . For the in-plane angular dependence, the first and second harmonic longitudinal magnetoresistance contributions R_{xx}^{1\omega} and R_{xx}^{2\omega} are given by: R_{xx}^{1\omega}=R_{\mathrm{AMR}}^{1\omega}\cos^{2}\varphi-R_{\mathrm{SMR}}^{1% \omega}\sin^{2}\varphi, (3) \begin{split}R_{xx}^{2\omega}=(R_{\mathrm{USMR}}^{2\omega}+R_{\mathrm{\nabla T% },xx}^{2\omega}+2R_{\mathrm{FL},xx}^{2\omega})\sin\varphi\\ -2R_{\mathrm{FL},xx}^{2\omega}\sin^{3}\varphi,\end{split} (4) where R_{\mathrm{AMR}}^{1\omega} is the anisotropic magnetoresistance, R_{\mathrm{SMR}}^{1\omega} is the spin Hall magnetoresistance, R_{\mathrm{USMR}}^{2\omega} is the USMR contribution, R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xx}^{2\omega} is the longitudinal magnetothermal contribution and R_{\mathrm{FL},xx}^{2\omega} is the change of the longitudinal resistance due to the FL torque with R_{\mathrm{FL},xx}^{2\omega}=-g\cdot R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega} and R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xx}^{2\omega}=-g\cdot R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2\omega}, with g the length-to-width ratio of the Hall bar. To disentangle this multitude of effects, one has to rely on their different response to additional external stimuli. In the standard analysis, Eq. (2) is rewritten as R_{xy}^{2\omega}=R_{\cos}^{2\omega}\cos\varphi+R_{\cos^{3}}^{2\omega}\cos^{3}\varphi, (5) where R_{\cos}^{2\omega}=-R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega}+R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2% \omega}-\frac{1}{2}R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega} and R_{\cos^{3}}^{2\omega}=2R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega}. Assuming that the magnetization aligns with the external field H, and by rotating the sample in a constant field, the values of R_{xy}^{2\omega} measured as a function of \varphi are fitted using Eq. (5) to extract the coefficients R_{\cos}^{2\omega} and R_{\cos^{3}}^{2\omega}. Using linear combinations of these coefficients, the torque can be estimated from the variations of R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega} and R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega} with the applied magnetic field H avci14 . The FL torque is obtained by: R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{1\omega}}{\mu_% {0}H}B_{\mathrm{FL}}, (6) with \mu_{0} the vacuum permeability and B_{\mathrm{FL}} the magnetic flux density associated to the FL torque. The DL torque is obtained by: R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega}+R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2\omega}=\frac{R_{% \mathrm{AHE}}^{1\omega}}{\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{eff}}}B_{\mathrm{DL}}+R_{\mathrm{% \nabla T},xy}^{2\omega}, (7) where the magnetothermal contribution R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2\omega} does not depend on the effective field H_{\mathrm{eff}} acting on the magnetization, R_{\mathrm{AHE}}^{1\omega} is the anomalous Hall resistance and B_{\mathrm{DL}} the magnetic flux associated to the DL torque. The effective field is given by H_{\mathrm{eff}}=H+H_{\mathrm{dem}}+H_{\mathrm{PMA}} with H_{\mathrm{dem}} the demagnetizing field and H_{\mathrm{PMA}} the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy field. In the following, we refer interchangeably to B_{\mathrm{FL}} as the FL torque and B_{\mathrm{DL}} as the DL torque. I.2 Magnonic contribution Figure 1: Summary of the angular dependence of the second harmonic signals in the longitudinal and transverse measurement configurations due to the SOTs, m\!{}^{\dagger}​mMRs, USMR, and magnetothermal effects. The analysis of the Hall resistance reported in the previous section is valid when the magnetization M of the FM layer has a constant magnitude, independent of current. However, as discussed in Ref. jointpaper, , the injection of a spin current from the NM into the FM layer induces the creation or annihilation of magnons, depending on the polarization of the current. This effect is maximum when the polarization of the spin current is parallel or antiparallel to the magnetization. To first order in the current, the change of magnon population induces a change of magnetization \Delta M(I), resulting in a current- and angle-dependent modulation of M(I)=M_{s}+\Delta M(I)\sin\varphi, where M_{s} is the saturation magnetization at the temperature of the measurements. Joule-heating effects \propto I^{2} can be included in M_{s} to provide higher-order corrections to this expression. In order to account for the magnonic contributions Eq. (2) and (4) have to be modified. The transverse second harmonic resistance R_{xy}^{2\omega} and longitudinal second harmonic resistance R_{xx}^{2\omega} are then given by R_{xy}^{2\omega}=(R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{2\omega}-R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega}+R_{% \mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2\omega}-\frac{1}{2}R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega})\cos% \varphi+(2R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega}-R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{2\omega})\cos^{3}\varphi, (8) R_{xx}^{2\omega}=(R_{\mathrm{USMR}}^{2\omega}+R_{\mathrm{MMR}}^{2\omega}+R_{% \mathrm{\nabla T},xx}^{2\omega}+2R_{\mathrm{FL},xx}^{2\omega}+R_{\mathrm{AMR}}% ^{2\omega})\sin\varphi+(R_{\mathrm{SMR}}^{2\omega}-R_{\mathrm{AMR}}^{2\omega}-% 2R_{\mathrm{FL},xx}^{2\omega})\sin^{3}\varphi, (9) where R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{2\omega}, R_{\mathrm{MMR}}^{2\omega}, R_{\mathrm{AMR}}^{2\omega} and R_{\mathrm{SMR}}^{2\omega} are respectively the m\!{}^{\dagger}​mPHE, m\!{}^{\dagger}​mMMR, m\!{}^{\dagger}​mAMR and m\!{}^{\dagger}​mSMR coefficients defined in Ref. jointpaper, . From Eq. (8) we notice that R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{2\omega} cannot be separated from the R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega}, R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega} and R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2\omega} purely based on the angular dependence, since the equation system is underdetermined. Therefore, not accounting for the m\!{}^{\dagger}​mPHE using the harmonic Hall resistance method will affect the proper estimation of R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega}, R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega} and of the associated torques, but will not affect the quality of the fit of R_{xy}^{2\omega}. Similar to the transverse resistance, the longitudinal contributions due to the m\!{}^{\dagger}​mMRs also cannot be distinguished based on their angular dependence [see Eq. (9)]. We would like to point out that R_{\mathrm{USMR}}^{2\omega}, the USMR contribution, corresponds here to the spin-dependent USMR avci15 and the magnonic contribution associated with the spin flip USMR is entirely contained in the expression of R_{\mathrm{MMR}}^{2\omega}. In Fig. 1 we graphically summarized all the possible contributions to the second harmonic signal due to the torques avci14 , m\!{}^{\dagger}​mMRs jointpaper , USMR avci15 and magnetothermal effects avci14 ; miyasato07 ; uchida08 , in the transverse and longitudinal resistance."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07844v1,Moiré amplification of highly tunable shift current response in twisted trilayer graphene,"In this work we analyze the shift current conductivity in helical twisted trilayer graphene. Without loss of generality, we show that the density of states and the twist angle set an upper bound for this response, which is inversely proportional to the square of the twist angle. For the case of ABA stacking and at the magic angle, the shift photoconductivity can reach values of order 10^{4}~{}\mathrm{\mu A\cdot nm\cdot V}^{-2} for frequencies below 50 meV, which can be attributed to the interband transitions between the two flattened middle bands close to the Fermi level. By tuning the twist angle, we demonstrate that the photoconductivity is shifted in the frequency range and it is further influenced by two additional factors: The magnitude of the shift vector and the energy separation between the bands. Furthermore, we propose a scenario in the AAA stacked configuration, where the photoconductivity can be of order 10^{5}~{}\mathrm{\mu A\cdot nm\cdot V}^{-2} in the THz regime, revealing a potential influence of the stacking in the optimization of the shift current conductivity. Therefore, a large density of states, a small twist angle and the layer stacking are ingredients that hold promising functionality for photovoltaic applications in moiré heterostructures.","Nowadays, solar-cell technology is a suitable alternative for high efficient and eco-friendly energy applications. In this context, an alternative mechanism to the standard PN photovoltaics for the photo-current generation is the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE). In BPVE the photo-current generation is driven by the shift current (SC), where light illumination induces a photoconductivity in materials lacking inversion symmetry [1, 2, 3]. Its origin has been attributed to the shift of the center of charges in the presence of light. In contrast to the conventional PN photovoltaic effect, the BPVE can generate a photovoltage above the band gap, enabling to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit and in principle surpassing the conversion efficiency of conventional solar cells. However, even with all these good premises, BPVE is still not competitive with standard PN Photovoltaics, suggesting further exploration on materials with different band structure properties [4]. Concerning nonmagnetic materials, natural prospects for large shift conductivities are ferroelectrics, such as BaTiO3 or PbTiO3 [5], but its dependence with the direction and strength of the ferroelectric polarization is not fully understood. On the other hand, there is a growing interest on the study of BPVE in metallic systems, where the SC could be enhanced by real and virtual transitions between the bands, for example, in the topological semi-metal TaAs [6, 7]. In fact, when the frequency of the incoming light lies within the mid-infrared region of the spectrum, it can exceed by orders of magnitude the photo-conductivity of conventional ferroelectrics [5, 8] and chiral materials [9]. Nevertheless, it is still smaller than the gigantic shift conductivity computed in BiTeI, which can reach about 750 \mathrm{\mu A\cdot V^{-2}} [10] and it can be tuned throughout a topological transition in the presence of pressure [11]. Very recently, a wide variety of investigations have identified that twisted multilayer systems made of transition metal dichalcogenides or graphene monolayers, just to name a few, are able to display colossal nonlinear d.c. responses [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] and second order photocurrents [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. Regarding the nonlinear Hall effect, the magnitude of the conductivity in twisted bilayer WTe2 [12] relies on the numerous band crossings and band inversions around the Fermi level, leading to an enhancement of the Berry curvature. Correlation effects have also been proposed as an explanation to the large nonlinear Hall effect in WSe2 [15]. On the other hand, graphene structure usually exhibit very low rotational symmetries, typically \textrm{C}_{3} or \textrm{C}_{6}, forbidding the second order Hall effect driven by the Berry curvature dipole [28, 29] and the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect [30].In this situation, it is more likely that the d.c. current could be associated with more complex extrinsic contributions such as side jump or skew scattering [31]. Although the rotational symmetry can be broken in several ways, e.g., by applying strain [32, 33] or modifying the structural phase of the material [34], the nonlinear photocurrents can be considered as a signal that is more flexible to the crystal symmetry constraints, and a versatile route to take advantange of the electronic properties of moiré patterns. Several features of twisted materials can strongly impact the overall magnitude of the shift conductivity: For twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and in the THz regime, it can reach 10^{3}~{}\mathrm{\mu\cdot nm\cdot V^{-2}} depending on the value of the applied strain [22]. This value is sensitive to the presence of particle hole symmetry, encapsulation with hBN and perturbative effects from a substrate [35]. When the number of layers N\geq 5, the shift conductivity can increase up to 10^{4}~{}\mathrm{\mu\cdot nm\cdot V^{-2}}, whose origin relies on the virtual transitions between the multiple flat bands involved [36]. Motivated by the facts mentioned above, and the rebirth of the interest in semi-direct materials to observe maximal SC, we study the origin, intensity and the potential tunability of this signal in helical twisted trilayer graphene (hTTG). Our paper is organized as follows: In section II we show that an upper bound of the SC response is given by the product of the density of states involving two bands, whose distance corresponds to the energy of the incident photon. This upper bound is a complement to a previous upper limit reported for the shift conductivity in extended systems [37]. In this section we also present the model for hTTG, which we later use in section III to provide the numerical results and a discussion about the outcomes of the work. Finally, in section IV we state the main conclusions of the article."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07811v1,Rate- and temperature-dependent strain hardening in glassy polymers: Micromechanisms and constitutive modeling based on molecular dynamics simulations,"We perform molecular dynamics simulations under uniaxial tension to investigate the micromechanisms underlying strain hardening in glassy polymers. By decomposing the stress into virial components associated with pair, bond, and angle interactions, we identify the primary contributors to strain hardening as the stretching of polymer bonds. Interestingly, rather than the average bond stretch, we find that the key contributions to stress response come from a subset of bonds at the upper tail of the stretch distribution. Our results demonstrate that the stress in the hardening region can be correlated with the average stretch of the most extended bonds in each polymer chain, independent of temperatures and strain rates. These bonds, which we denote as load-bearing bonds, allow us to define a local load-bearing deformation gradient in continuum mechanics that captures their contribution to the hardening stress tensor. Building on this insight, we incorporate the load-bearing mechanism into a constitutive framework with orientation-induced back stress, developing a model that accurately reproduces the stress response of the molecular systems over a wide range of temperatures and strain rates in their glassy state.","Glassy polymers are essentially amorphous polymers at temperatures below their glass transition temperature T_{\mathrm{g}}, exhibiting solid-like mechanical behavior due to restricted atomic mobility from neighboring interactions. The polymer molecules, typically with chain-like structures, can undergo strain hardening at large deformations, effectively increasing the toughness of the materials. Accurately modeling the mechanical response in the hardening region is essential for studying the failure mechanisms of glassy polymers. Unlike rubbers, which are amorphous polymers above T_{\mathrm{g}}, the strain hardening behavior of glassy polymers is sensitive to strain rate and temperature as evident in various experiments [1, 2, 3] and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [4, 5]. However, the mechanisms underlying the rate- and temperature-dependence of strain hardening remain not fully understood. For decades, the hardening mechanism in glassy polymers has often been interpreted through entropic elasticity theory developed for rubbers [6, 7], which attributes stress increases to the reduction of entropy during the elongation of polymer chains. While this theory applies well to rubbers, various experiments [8, 9] and MD simulations [4] reveal inconsistencies when applied to glassy polymers. This discrepancy probably arises from a core assumption in entropic elasticity theory that polymer segments are free to adjust their conformations to accommodate deformation. However, in glassy polymers, atomic mobility is restricted, preventing such free adjustment. Consequently, the relaxation time associated with the evolution of polymer segments becomes non-negligible, leading to rate-dependent behavior in the hardening region of glassy polymers. This limited mobility also introduces temperature sensitivity, as relaxation times are typically temperature-dependent. Thus, understanding strain hardening in glassy polymers involves addressing two key questions: (i) which structures primarily contribute to the stress response, and (ii) the relaxation of which structures most significantly affects stress behavior? To address the first question, various assumptions have been tested via constitutive modeling, given that experimental observation of the microscopic structure during deformation is challenging. Although the precise origin of hardening stress remains unclear, most constitutive models adopt the Lee-Kröner decomposition \bm{F}=\bm{F}^{\mathrm{e}}\bm{F}^{\mathrm{p}} [10, 11] of the deformation gradient \bm{F}, where \bm{F}^{\mathrm{e}} and \bm{F}^{\mathrm{p}} represent the elastic and viscoplastic components of \bm{F}, respectively. In this framework, \bm{F}^{\mathrm{e}} is assumed to contribute to the stress, which drives the evolution of \bm{F}^{\mathrm{p}}, characterized by the viscosity \eta. To capture strain hardening, Arruda et al. [12] introduced a back stress term to account for chain orientation effects. Anand et al. [13, 14] generalized this formulation by incorporating a unimodular orientation tensor \bm{A} as an internal variable of the free energy density for orientation and proposed that the evolution of \bm{A} is subjected to a dynamic recovery term driven by the back stress. Additional approaches have also been proposed, including models with deformation-dependent viscosity [1, 3], a viscous model that uses strain rate as an external variable to capture steady-state mechanical behavior [15], and models that represent orientation through shear transformation zones (STZs) [16, 17, 18]. While these models successfully replicate the stress response of glassy polymers in the hardening region under various conditions, they remain largely phenomenological, each grounded in different assumptions about the origin of hardening stress. A deeper understanding of the underlying micromechanisms is needed to further elucidate the nature of strain hardening in glassy polymers. In addressing the second question, it is critical to determine whether the primary relaxation mechanism influencing strain hardening occurs at the scale of polymer chains, such as disentanglement, or at the scale of local segments, like bond rotations. MD simulations have been used to study the mechanisms of disentanglement by tracking the evolution of the entanglement lengths N_{\mathrm{e}} during deformation [4, 19, 17]. Hoy and Robbins [4] observed that hardening increases with decreasing N_{\mathrm{e}} only when N_{\mathrm{e}} is relatively small; beyond a critical value N^{\mathrm{cr}}_{\mathrm{e}}, hardening saturates with N_{\mathrm{e}}. This suggests that disentanglement is relevant primarily at smaller N_{\mathrm{e}}. This finding may help to reconcile the conflicting results reported in [19] and [17], where N_{\mathrm{e}} remains constant in [19] but evolves in [17] during deformation. Furthermore, the critical value N^{\mathrm{cr}}_{\mathrm{e}} is likely temperature-dependent, as increased temperatures accelerate polymer chain relaxation. This implies that disentanglement only occurs at sufficiently high temperatures for glassy polymers, while at low temperatures, the dominant relaxation mode is likely limited to local segmental rotations. These include backbone chain rotations (\alpha-relaxation) or side group rotations (\beta-relaxation) for certain glassy polymers [20, 21, 22]. Experimental studies on the time-temperature superposition of glassy polymers at large strains [23, 24, 25] support this assumption. These studies demonstrate that the stress-strain curves of glassy polymers at specific temperatures and strain rates can coincide in the hardening region, with derived shift factors matching those from small strains. This suggests that similar relaxation mechanisms are active across both small and large strain regimes in these materials. Since disentanglement is not the primary relaxation mechanism at small strains before yielding, it is likely not the dominant mechanism at large strains in the hardening region either, based on these experimental results. Using identical shift factors for both small and large strains, Xiao and Tian [26] employed the back stress model [14] to successfully predict pre-deformation effects in the strain hardening region of glassy polymers. This paper aims to investigate the microscopic mechanisms underlying strain hardening in glassy polymers using MD simulations, with a focus on capturing its rate- and temperature-dependent behavior. To achieve this, we first decompose the virial stress components into contributions from pair, bond, and angle interactions, identifying bond and angle stresses as the primary contributors to strain hardening. Subsequently, we examine the microscopic quantities that can be correlated with these bond and angle stresses within the hardening region. Our key finding is that these stress terms are correlated with the averaged values of the largest bond stretch in each polymer chain, independent of temperature and strain rate. We denote these bonds as load-bearing bonds and represent this microscopic quantity through a deformation gradient, capturing the macroscopic local load-bearing deformation, denoted as \bm{F}^{\mathrm{l}}. Building on this result, we propose a decomposition of the total deformation gradient, \bm{F}=\bm{F}^{\mathrm{l}}\bm{F}^{\mathrm{r}}, where \bm{F}^{\mathrm{r}} represents the resisting component of the deformation gradient. Finally, we develop a constitutive model within the framework established by [14], incorporating orientation-induced back stress. Compared to the model proposed by [14] and various other hardening models [26, 1, 3, 16, 17, 18, 15], the improvement presented in this paper lies in providing a clear physical basis for the stress response in the hardening region, as well as a well-defined interpretation of the deformation gradient decomposition \bm{F}=\bm{F}^{\mathrm{l}}\bm{F}^{\mathrm{r}}, where the contribution of \bm{F}^{\mathrm{l}} to the stress can be directly extracted from MD simulations. The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the MD systems used in this study. Section 3 presents the analysis of the microscopic mechanisms underlying strain hardening, followed by a discussion on the decomposition \bm{F}=\bm{F}^{\mathrm{l}}\bm{F}^{\mathrm{r}} in Section 4 based on the findings from this analysis. Section 5 derives the constitutive model, including parameter identification and the validation. Finally, Section 6 concludes this study."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07746v1,Lorentz Skew Scattering Mechanism in Nonreciprocal Magneto-Transport,"We unveil a new mechanism of nonreciprocal magneto-transport from cooperative action of Lorentz force and skew scattering. The significance of this Lorentz skew scattering mechanism lies in that it dominates both longitudinal and transverse responses in highly conductive systems, and it exhibits a scaling behavior distinct from all known mechanisms. At low temperature, it shows a cubic scaling in linear conductivity, whereas the scaling becomes quartic at elevated temperature when phonon scattering kicks in. We develop its microscopic formulation and reveal its close connection with Berry curvature on Fermi surface. Applying our theory to surface transport in topological crystalline insulator SnTe and bulk transport in Weyl semimetals leads to significant results, suggesting a new route to achieve giant transport nonreciprocity in high-mobility materials with topological band features.","References Rikken et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07624v1,Ising superconductivity in the bulk incommensurate layered material \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right),"Exploiting the spin-valley degree of freedom of electrons in materials is a promising avenue for energy-efficient information storage and quantum computing. A key challenge in utilizing spin-valley polarization is the realization of spin-valley locking in bulk systems. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the noncentrosymmetric bulk misfit compound \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right), showing a strong spin-valley locking. Our investigation reveals Ising superconductivity with a transition temperature of 3.14 K, closely matching that of a monolayer of TaS2. Notably, the absence of charge density wave (CDW) signatures in transport measurements suggests that the PbS layers primarily act as spacers between the dichalcogenide monolayers.This is further supported by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which shows negligible interlayer coupling, a lack of dispersion along the k_{\perp} direction and significant charge transfer from the PbS to the TaS2 layers. Spin resolved ARPES shows strong spin-valley locking of the electronic bands.Muon spin rotation experiments conducted in the vortex phase reveal an isotropic superconducting gap. However, the temperature dependence of the upper critical field and low-temperature specific heat measurements suggest the possibility of multigap superconductivity.These findings underscore the potential of misfit compounds as robust platforms for both realizing and utilizing spin-valley locking in bulk materials, as well as exploring proximity effects in two-dimensional structures.","I INTRODUCTION Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have garnered renewed attention in recent years owing to the emergent topological phases and unusual superconductivity [1, 2]. In addition, leveraging the energy valleys in the band structures of TMDC materials offers a unique opportunity to harness the spin and valley degrees of freedom for valleytronics applications [3]. Apart from the structural varieties, these materials offer great flexibility in terms of tuning the electronic properties easily by different means, such as doping, intercalation, gating, and heterostructure designing[4, 5, 6, 7]. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in designing heterostructured materials with electronic responses different from their constituent layers[8, 9]. The synergy between different material platforms holds immense potential to host novel correlated phases of matter, challenging the conventional understanding and opening the door to new physics and diverse technological applications.[10, 11, 12]. However, realizing high-quality, scalable systems remains a roadblock for further experimentation. The difficulty in obtaining clean interfaces and the tedious process of device fabrication are among the major challenges in this domain [13, 14]. Many of these challenges related to synthesizing heterostructures can be circumvented by studying naturally grown heterostructures, such as misfit materials. Misfit materials hold a general formula of \left(\rm{MX}\right)_{1+x}\left(\rm{TX}_{2}\right)_{n} with stacking of monochalcogenide \left(\rm{MX}\right) and dichalcogenide \left(\rm{TX}_{2}\right) layers[15, 16]. The monochalcogenide layers crystallize into distorted NaCl-type structures, while the dichalcogenide layers consist of T atoms coordinated in a trigonal prismatic arrangement. Due to the fundamentally different symmetry and periodicity of the sublattice, the crystal structure is incommensurate along one of the in-plane crystallographic axes and remains commensurate along the other two axes [17]. Although the sub-lattices are incommensurate, causing a continuous change in the coordination number of the interface atoms, the crystals show high stability with perfect stacking perpendicular to the layers [18, 19]. Furthermore, the incommensurability prevents the formation of any strong interlayer bonding. This structure can also be considered an intercalation of monochalcogenide layers between the weakly bonded TMDC layers. The monochalcogenide spacer layer thus reduces or completely decouples the TMDC monolayers and protects them. This method enables the achievement of a 2D nature in bulk van der Waals materials, providing robust stability. Similar to the intercalation of foreign atoms or molecules, recent reports show a substantial charge transfer between the layers, which helps stabilize the complex structure[16, 20]. However, the spacer layer’s impact on the TMDC layer’s electronic structure, and vice versa, along with the tailored electronic structure of misfit materials, has been less explored. Furthermore, the nature of superconductivity and the superconducting pairing mechanism in misfit compounds remains underinvestigated. Here, we have synthesized the misfit material \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right), consisting of alternating layers of monochalcogenide \rm{PbS} and monolayer \rm{1H-TaS}_{2}. \left(\rm{PbS}\right) is a semiconductor with a direct band gap, while \rm{2H-TaS}_{2} is a superconductor below 0.8~{}\rm{K} [21, 22]. The compound \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right) is particularly intriguing due to its structural similarity to \rm{4Hb-TaS}_{2}, which consists of alternating layers of \rm{1H-TaS}_{2} and strongly correlated \rm{1T-TaS}_{2}. Notably, \rm{4Hb-TaS}_{2} has exhibited signs of topological surface superconductivity with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS). While various measurements suggest the presence of non-trivial superconductivity in this material, the exact underlying mechanism remains unknown [23, 24, 25, 26]. Our measurements have shown superconductivity in \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right) at 3.14~{}\rm{K} with a possible two-gap nature. Our transport and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data show the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity with strong spin-valley locking. The electronic band structure at the Fermi level is dominated by the TMDC layer, which has a large charge transfer from mono-chalcogenide to the dichalcogenide layer."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07427v1,Diverse Manifestations of Electron-Phonon Coupling in a Kagome Superconductor,"Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments on a kagome metal CsV3Sb5 revealed distinct multimodal dispersion kinks and nodeless superconducting gaps across multiple electron bands. The prominent photoemission kinks suggest a definitive coupling between electrons and certain collective modes, yet the precise nature of this interaction and its connection to superconductivity remain to be established. Here, employing the state-of-the-art ab initio many-body perturbation theory computation, we present direct evidence that electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling induces the multimodal photoemission kinks in CsV3Sb5, and profoundly, drives the nodeless s-wave superconductivity, showcasing the diverse manifestations of the e-ph coupling. Our calculations well capture the experimentally measured kinks and their fine structures, and reveal that vibrations from different atomic species dictate the multimodal behavior. Results from anisotropic GW-Eliashberg equations predict a phonon-mediated superconductivity with nodeless s-wave gaps, in excellent agreement with various ARPES and scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements. Despite of the universal origin from the e-ph coupling, the contributions of several characteristic phonon vibrations vary in different phenomena, highlighting a versatile role of e-ph coupling in shaping the low-energy excitations of kagome metals.","References Ortiz et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07329v2,Magnetic Vortex Dynamics on a Spherical Cap,"By tailoring geometrical properties of magnetic nanocap structures, new possibilities appear to control its magnetic properties, such as the dynamics of magnetic vortices. Here, we develop an approach to describe dynamics of magnetic vortices on a spherical cap. Analytic results for the gyrofrequency of the vortex state are in a good agreement with micromagnetic simulations.","Curvilinear magnetism is a framework to analyze geometry-governed effects and predict modifications of magnetic responses in geometrically curved nanostructures [1]. The theory introduces emergent interactions, which are are responsible for different families of curvature-induced effects including topological patterning and magnetochiral effects [2]. For instance, the appearance of a skyrmion state in core-shell particles with easy-normal anisotropy [3] is a fingerprint of the topological patterning. Other examples include nonorientable Möbius rings, which support magnetic vortex states and different topologically protected domain walls [4], and spherical shells with easy-surface anisotropy favouring a 3D onion state in thin spherical shells [5] and whirligig state in thick shells [6]. Among different curvilinear magnetic systems, there is one group of the so-called spherical cap structures, which can be prepared by deposition of a magnetic thin film on non-magnetic spheres [7, 1]. Depending on the magnetic anisotropy of the thin film, either radially magnetized magnetic structures or magnetic vortices can be realized in magnetic nanocaps. Magnetic vortices were actively studied in planar films and planar nanodots [8]. A vortex state is characterized by the in-plane magnetization circulation following the edge of a nanodot and possessing an out-of-plane magnetization component (polarity) at the location of the vortex core. In the case of curved geometries, magnetic vortices acquire new properties in comparison with their planar counterparts. This includes polarity-circulation coupling of the vortex on a spherical cap and shell [5, 9], controllable switching of the vortex magnetochirality on a hemispherical cap [10], chirality symmetry breaking upon switching of the vortex core [11], and nonlocal chiral symmetry breaking effect in cap structures [12, 13]. Spherical geometries are well studied with respect to static magnetic distributions [14, 15, 5, 16, 6, 17]. The study of magnetization dynamics of topological textures is one of the important and challenging problems of the curvilinear magnetism. At the moment, dynamics of topological soliton is well described mainly for the tubular geometry [18]. General aspects of the dynamics of solitons in curved geometries are studied for skyrmions [19, 9]. In particular, the skyrmion gyromotion was studied analytically using a Thiele-like collective variable approach [19]. Investigations of magnetic dynamics of vortices in curved geometries include the description of resonance excitations [20], polarity and circulation switching [14, 11, 10, 7]. The use of the Thiele-like approach for the vortex dynamics becomes more complex due to their nonlocalized nature. Here, we develop a theoretical approach to describe the motion of magnetic vortices in nanoshells of spherical geometry. The method is based on the image vortex technique [21, 22], which we extend to curved geometries. Using mapping from a sphere to a complex plane, we derive equations of motion of magnetization on a spherical cap. We calculate the gyrofrequency of the vortex core and validate our analytic theory with micromagnetic simulations."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07216v1,"Multifunctional spintronic transistors: Sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local GMR, and NDR in spin gapless semiconductor and/or spin gapped metal FETs","Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are emerging as a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, offering unique opportunities to realize novel functionalities beyond conventional electronics. In this work, we propose a novel concept of multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) by employing SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as the source and drain electrodes. These devices function similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (SGM) electrode and the intrinsic semiconducting channel. However, unlike metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, the proposed devices leverage the distinctive spin-dependent transport properties of SGS and/or SGM electrodes to enable sub-60 mV/dec switching, a significant improvement over the sub-threshold swing bottleneck of 60 mV/dec in conventional MOSFETs, facilitating low-voltage operation. Additionally, the incorporation of SGMs introduces the negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio, further enhancing the device functionality. The proposed spintronic FETs exhibit a remarkable combination of features, including sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect, and NDR effect, making them highly attractive for next-generation applications such as logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These functionalities open avenues for exploring novel computing architectures beyond the constraints of the classic von-Neumann architecture, enabling more efficient and powerful information processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials emerge as a promising platform for realizing these multifunctional FETs. In this work, we perform a comprehensive screening of the computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials for the proposed devices. For device simulations, we select VS2 as the SGS material. As a proof-of-concept, we employ a non-equilibrium Green’s function method combined with density functional theory to simulate the transfer (I_{\mathrm{D}}-V_{\mathrm{G}}) and output (I_{\mathrm{D}}-V_{\mathrm{D}}) characteristics of a vertical VS2/Ga2O2 heterojunction FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS2. Our calculations predict a remarkably low sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 108, and a significant non-local GMR effect demonstrate these devices’ potential for low-power and high-performance applications.","Modern charge-based electronics rely heavily on metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) as fundamental building blocks. Their remarkable scaling over the decades has revolutionized computing and communication technologies, enabling the development of increasingly powerful and compact devices. However, despite their widespread use and advancements, conventional MOSFETs face inherent limitations that challenge further progress in electronics scaling and energy efficiency. One such limitation is the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing (SS) imposed by thermionic emission, which has remained a persistent bottleneck [1, 2]. This limitation significantly hinders low-voltage operation, a critical factor for achieving energy-efficient devices in modern electronics. Lowering the operating voltage not only reduces static power consumption but also minimizes leakage currents, addressing a fundamental concern for battery-powered electronics and portable devices where energy efficiency is paramount. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore alternative transistor designs and materials that can overcome these limitations and pave the way for the next generation of energy-efficient electronic devices [3, 4, 5]. To overcome the 60 mV/dec SS limit, researchers have explored alternative transistor designs categorized as steep slope transistors. These devices aim to achieve a sharper transition between the on-state and off-state, leading to a lower SS value. Examples of such devices include tunnel FETs (TFETs), Dirac source FETs, and the recently proposed cold-metal source FETs [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. While these alternative designs offer lower SS compared to conventional MOSFETs, they often come with trade-offs. Tunnel FETs, for instance, rely on a tunneling mechanism for current flow, leading to significantly lower on-currents compared to MOSFETs. This drawback limits their applicability in many logic circuits where high on-currents are crucial for driving subsequent stages. In contrast, Dirac source and cold-metal source FETs generally exhibit much higher on-state current densities, making them more attractive alternatives for practical applications. Steep-slope FETs with Dirac source and cold-metal source electrodes are an area of active research and are being explored as a potential solution to overcome the limitations of traditional MOSFETs, especially for low-power and high-speed applications. However, a key limitation of these emerging transistor proposals is their reliance solely on the charge degree of freedom. They do not exploit the potential benefits offered by the electron’s spin, a valuable resource for future spintronic devices. Spin gapless semiconductors (SGSs) have shown promising potential in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), enabling functionalities beyond conventional MTJs based on Fe, Co, and CoFeB. While these traditional MTJs offer high tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) for memory applications, they lack current rectification, hindering their functionality as diodes for logic applications [13, 14, 15]. A recent proposal addressed this by introducing type-II SGSs and half-metallic magnets in MTJs, achieving both TMR and a re-programmable diode effect [16, 17], which is experimentally demonstrated in MTJs based on Heusler compounds [18]. Inspired by this progress, we propose a novel class of spintronic FETs utilizing SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes with an intrinsic semiconductor channel. This configuration overcomes the limitations of both conventional MOSFETs (restricted by the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing) and alternative steep-slope transistor designs. The key lies in exploiting the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS and SGM electrodes. The SGSs enable sub-60 mV/dec switching and introduce the non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect, absent in conventional charge-based FETs. Additionally, SGMs offer negative differential resistance (NDR) with a high peak-to-valley current ratio. This combination opens doors for next-generation applications like logic-in-memory computing, where data processing and storage occur on the same chip [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. In this paper, we present a comprehensive conceptual framework for novel multifunctional spintronic FETs. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials emerge as a promising platform for realizing these multifunctional FETs. These materials offer a promising pathway to overcome scaling challenges inherent to conventional FETs. Their atomically thin structure enables exceptional gate control and mitigates short-channel effects, essential for low-power, high-performance devices. Focusing on spintronic applications, we identify transition metal dichalcogenides and dihalides, such as VS2 and ScI2, as potential 2D candidates. Through a comprehensive screening of a computational 2D materials database, we select suitable SGS and SGM materials for our proposed devices. To demonstrate proof-of-concept, we employ ab initio quantum transport calculations to simulate a vertical VS2/Ga2O2 heterojunction FET based on 2D type-II SGSs VS2. Utilizing a non-equilibrium Green function method combined with density functional theory, our simulations predict remarkable device performance, including a subthreshold swing (SS) of only 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 108, and a substantial non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect. These findings underscore the potential of 2D SGSs for realizing our proposed multifunctional spintronic FETs, paving the way for a new generation of low-power, high-performance spintronic devices. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we introduce the concepts of SGSs and SGMs. Section III presents the design and operation principles of our proposed multifunctional spintronic FETs. The computational methodology employed in this study is detailed in Section IV. In Sections V.A and V.B, we present the results of our screening process for suitable 2D materials and the simulation results for a vertical VS2/Ga2O2 heterojunction FET, respectively. Finally, Section VI summarizes our key findings and discusses their implications.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07044v1,Non-reciprocity in magnon mediated charge-spin-orbital current interconversion,"In magnetic systems, angular momentum is carried by the spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Non-local devices can be used to study angular momentum transport. They consist of parallel heavy-metal nanowires placed on top of magnetic insulators like yttrium iron garnet (YIG), facilitating the transmission of information by magnons, generated by the accumulation of spin at the interface, created via the Spin Hall Effect (SHE) and detected via the inverse SHE (iSHE). It has been demonstrated that these processes have comparable efficiencies when the role of the detector and injector is reversed, which points to reciprocity of the processes. However, we show that by adding Ru as a source of direct and inverse orbital Hall effect (OHE), the system no longer exhibits this reciprocity. Specifically, the generation of magnons via the combination of SHE and OHE and detection via the iSHE is found to be about 35% more efficient than the inverse process for our system.","References Hirohata et al. 2020 Hirohata, A.; Yamada, K.; Nakatani, Y.; Prejbeanu, I.-L.; Diény, B.; Pirro, P.; Hillebrands, B.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06912v1,Universally optimizable strategy for magnetic gaps towards high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall states via magnetic-insulator/topological-insulator building-blocks,"Optimizing the magnetic Zeeman-splitting term, specifically the magnetic gap of the topological surface states (TSSs), is a crucial issue and central challenge in advancing higher-temperature quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In this work, we demonstrate a counterintuitive, nonmonotonic relationship between the magnetic gap and the hybridization strength in ferromagnetic-insulator (FMI)/topological-insulator (TI) sandwich structures. Concretely, insufficient hybridization strength fails to induce a substantial magnetic gap; while excessive hybridization incandesces the competition between kinetic and Coulomb exchange interactions, thereby reducing the gap. Strong hybridization strength also spatially delocalizes the TSSs, diminishing the effective orbital coupling between TSS-based p and magnetic d orbitals, which further weakens kinetic and Coulomb exchange interaction strength. Moreover, modifying the stacking order offers an experimentally viable approach to optimizing magnetic gaps, enabling the tunability of Chern numbers, chirality and maximizing global gaps. These findings unveil a universal guiding principle for optimizing magnetic gaps in FMI-TI proximity-based QAH systems, offering valuable insights for advancing experimental implementations in this field.","I introduction Pursuing large band gap, high critical temperature is the basic and pivotal topic in designing quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems, which contains dissipationless quantized current generated by the momentum-space-based Berry flux monopole [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Behaved as the most prominent quantum effect in topology, the highlighted issue of overcoming its ultralow-temperature requirement [5] attracts enormous attentions. Researchers have made great efforts to increase the critical temperature of the long-ranged magnetism in various QAH systems these years [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. For example, by replacing the diluted magnetic-doped topological insulators (TIs) with the intrinsic magnetic-element-intercalated TIs [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]; by establishing heavily magnetic-doped insulator/TI heterostructures that benefit from the van der Waals (vdW) based nature of these two-dimensional materials [6]; by directly designing and constructing non-doped ferromagnetic insulator (FMI)/TI heterostructures [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], and so on. Furthermore, merging magnetism and topology within the d-orbitals, utilizing d-d correlated-electron-based topology, breaks away from the traditional approach of coupling between magnetism and topology, unlocking the potential for devices to operate at even higher temperatures. These predicted systems including YX_{3} (Y = transition metal elements, X = halogen elements) [29, 30], Ni(Pd)As(Sb, Bi)O3 [31, 32], LiFeSe [33], V2W(Mo)S(Se)4 [34], etc. Nevertheless, none of these candidates has been successfully fabricated under the experimental regime, nor has been characterized by high-temperature quantized dissipationless conductance, hindered by the strict demand for fabrication conditions. Hence, optimizing physical characters of the traditional FMI/TI heterostructures or magnetic TI systems still remains the major base towards experimental investigations on QAH effects. In contrast to tremendous investments in magnetic critical temperatures of numerous candidate QAH systems, a comprehensive understanding of how to modulate, enhance, and optimize the Zeeman-splitting mass term, or referred to as, “the magnetic gap”, is still lacking. Typically, previous works were focus on the two separate mechanisms contributing to the mass terms, including p-d orbital hybridizations via kinetic exchange and Coulomb exchange [35, 36], which, in most cases, exhibit opposite chirality. The size of the magnetic gap, however, depends not only on the chirality of different exchange mechanisms but also on the real-space distributions of topological surface states (TSSs). Evolved with the coupling strength between magnetism and topology, the distribution of TSSs cast an even complicated guiding factor towards modulating magnetic gaps. Here, via utilizing the representative FMIs such as Cr2X_{2}Te6 (X = Si, Ge, Sn) and CrI3 [37, 38, 39, 40], and TIs composed of Bi(Sb)2Te3 and Mn(Ni)Bi2Te4 [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 41, 42, 43], and by implementing multiform continuous tuning methods, such as artificially varying the vdW-spacing distances between FMI and TI, or manipulating stacking-order-shifts, we capture the non-monotonic evolution properties of TSSs, and then, the size of the magnetic gap. The competition between kinetic exchange and Coulomb exchange also limits the enlargement of the magnetic gap. Consequently, there exists a maximum value of the magnetic gap along with the optimization of the hybridization strength between FMI and TI. Noteworthily, with its multifunctional containments encompassing magnetism, topology and vdW-layered nature, MnBi2Te4 serves as a widely studied basis among intrinsic magnetic topology, magnetic substrate and Floquet engineering[10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 12, 13, 21, 11, 44, 45], etc. When Mn(Ni)Bi2Te4 is selected as the TI layer, the opposite chirality between Cr and Mn(Ni), combined with an experimentally operable stacking-order shift method, enables continuous modulation of both the size and chirality of the magnetic gap, resulting in Chern-number and chirality tunable characteristics. For the first time, our revealments provide a comprehensive guiding principle for how to optimize the magnetic gaps of most of the traditional QAH systems that experimentally available up to now, which finds an extensive use in assisting researchers to design and modulate both large-gapped and high-critical-temperature QAH materials. The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. In Sec. II, we list all the computational and data-processing methods related in this work. In Sec. III, via artificially adopting vdW-spacing-distance variable method, we systematically reveal and analyze the non-monotonic character of the evolution behaviors between magnetic gaps and the FMI-TI hybridization strength. In Sec. IV, based on the experimentally executable technique of stacking-order-shift, we map the distributions of magnetic gaps, global gaps and Chern numbers in typical FMI/TI heterostructures, verifying that both the gaps and Chern numbers are continuously tunable and optimizable within an experimentally achievable regime. Section V illustrates the magnetic critical temperatures of typical FMI/TI systems discussed in this work. We measure the robustness of them under multifold conditions including stacking-orders and biaxial strains. Section VI summarizes the main findings and design strategies towards optimizing the magnetic gaps in most traditional FMI/TI-proximate QAH systems. In Appendix A, in order to confirm the structural stability, phonon spectrums of FMIs and TIs that mentioned in this work under various in-plane lattice constants are depicted by density perturbation functional theory (DFPT) assisted with frozen-phonon method. Then, we unfold the evolution performances of the hybridization gaps and the \Gamma-point gaps versus (vs.) the vdW-spacing distances based upon the building-blocks discussed in the main text in Appendix B. In Appendix C, we discuss the behavior of the magnetic gap (i. e. the distribution of TSSs) vs. the vdW-spacing distances of FMI/TI heterostructures under various conditions, including antiferromagnetic (AFM) couplings and other forms of heterostructures. Besides, the signs and strengths of interlayer magnetic couplings are listed in Tables 4-6. Stacking-order-dependent parameters, involving the \Gamma-point gaps, the hybridization gaps and the TSS distribution for some discussed systems, are enumerated as mapping distributions in Appendix D. Appendix E discusses further information and analysis of exchange coefficients and critical temperatures in Cr2X_{2}Te6/TI-based heterostructures."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06804v1,Predicting ionic conductivity in solids from the machine-learned potential energy landscape,"Discovering new superionic materials is essential for advancing solid-state batteries, which offer improved energy density and safety compared to the traditional lithium-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes. Conventional computational methods for identifying such materials are resource-intensive and not easily scalable. Recently, universal interatomic potential models have been developed using equivariant graph neural networks. These models are trained on extensive datasets of first-principles force and energy calculations. One can achieve significant computational advantages by leveraging them as the foundation for traditional methods of assessing the ionic conductivity, such as molecular dynamics or nudged elastic band techniques. However, the generalization error from model inference on diverse atomic structures arising in such calculations can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we propose an approach for the quick and reliable evaluation of ionic conductivity through the analysis of a universal interatomic potential. Our method incorporates a set of heuristic structure descriptors that effectively employ the rich knowledge of the underlying model while requiring minimal generalization capabilities. Using our descriptors, we rank lithium-containing materials in the Materials Project database according to their expected ionic conductivity. Eight out of the ten highest-ranked materials are confirmed to be superionic at room temperature in first-principles calculations. Notably, our method achieves a speed-up factor of approximately 50 compared to molecular dynamics driven by a machine-learning potential, and is at least 3,000 times faster compared to first-principles molecular dynamics.","Solid-state batteries (SSBs) are a promising alternative to traditional lithium-ion batteries due to their higher energy density and enhanced safety features. With the elimination of liquid electrolytes, SSBs reduce the risk of leakage and combustion, thus mitigating one of the major safety concerns with conventional batteries [1, 2, 3]. Coupled with the potential for increased energy storage [4], this safety enhancement makes SSBs a crucial technology for advancing electric vehicles and portable electronics, where the demand for longer battery life and robust performance is ever-increasing. Despite these advantages, SSBs development faces a number of challenges that prevents their widespread adoption [5]. One major limitation is the relatively low ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes compared to their liquid counterparts, which can diminish the overall performance of the battery. Additionally, interface stability between the solid electrolyte and electrodes remains a critical issue [6, 7]. The formation of interfacial resistance and degradation over time can significantly impact the lifespan and efficiency of a battery [6]. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of new solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with improved properties to overcome these barriers. To address these challenges, computational prediction methods have been employed to identify and optimize new SSE materials [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. However, these methods are often computationally expensive and time-consuming. Machine learning (ML) presents a viable solution to mitigate these limitations [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. By leveraging large datasets such as the Materials Project database [25] and advanced algorithms, ML has the potential to speed up the discovery of new materials with high ionic conductivity and therefore accelerate the research and development of high-performance SSBs [26, 27]. Different ML algorithms that have been employed to assist the discovery of superionic materials include classical supervised ML methods like logistic regression [28, 29], gradient boosting [30] and support vector machines [31, 32], classical unsupervised methods [33, 26], as well as deep learning approaches based on graph neural networks (GNN) [34, 35, 36]. The main difficulty in implementing the ML models for identifying SSEs is in general the limited availability of high-quality data on ionic mobility in solids. This motivates the use of knowledge transfer methods [32], or trading off for larger datasets [35] obtained using approximate methods [37]. The scarcity of available data drives the search for informative material descriptors that correlate well with ionic conductivity. This search is typically focused on descriptors that characterize compositions, geometric configurations, and electrochemical and electronic properties of materials [38, 26, 39], often relying on implementations from the matminer library [40], which are adapted from scientific publications. In this work, we aim to expand this focus by exploring the features of the interatomic potential (IAP). While IAP can be evaluated with expensive first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ML models allow for bypassing this step. Since there is notably more high-quality data available for predicting interatomic forces and energies, the task of predicting IAP is far less constrained than identifying SSEs directly. In fact, various ML methods have been proposed in the past decades to effectively bypass DFT in IAP calculations [41, 42, 43]. A notable improvement in the performance and reliability of these methods has been observed after the adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs) [13, 14, 15]. These models inherently impose permutation invariance by operating on graph structures, where the order of nodes does not affect the computation of graph-level representations. Additionally, invariance under 3D translations and rotations is achieved through the use of equivariant message passing and invariant feature aggregation methods. Although most of the initial models utilize 2-body messages, the introduction of many-body messages and updates allowed models like CHGNet [17], M3GNet [16], MACE [18, 19, 20] and the NequIP-based [44] SevenNet [45] achieve significant quality improvement, as demonstrated on the Matbench Discovery public benchmark [46]. These models may also be called universal potentials, as they cover the majority of the elements in the periodic table that are highly relevant to applications. In the context of ionic transport studies, ML-IAPs can serve as substitutes for DFT in MD [36] and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations [47]. However, a notable concern with ML-IAPs is the generalization error, which refers to the error in the model’s predictions when applied to new data, unseen at training time. Naturally, one should expect this error to increase as MD and NEB simulations drive the studied systems further from the domain of the training set, leading to a decrease in the model’s predictive accuracy and reliability. A typical way of addressing this issue is through active learning [48, 49]. This involves controlling the prediction error, running DFT on configurations where the error is excessively large and then retraining the model on these configurations. While this approach effectively reduces the generalization error, it sacrifices some of the computational efficiency gained by switching from DFT to ML-IAPs. In this work, we take a different approach by utilizing a universal potential model to design a set of dedicated descriptors that predict materials with high lithium mobility while minimizing generalization error. We leverage an ML-IAP trained on vast amounts of data to analyze the potential landscape in a controlled environment for the labeled structures present in high-quality computational and experimental Li conductivity datasets. From this analysis, we propose a set of heuristics that can be calculated on structure configurations that are similar to the examples used for training the potential. This ensures minimal generalization requirements for the model and therefore more accurate predictions of the interatomic potential in the diverse material environments. Finally, we use these descriptors to predict SSEs within the Materials Project database and validate our predictions with ab initio calculations. The studies performed in this work are done using the M3GNet model, which was trained by the authors of the original work [16] on the entire Materials Project dataset [25]. It should be noted, however, that our approach is not specific to a particular model and could be used with any IAP. This document is structured as follows: Sec. II describes the methodology used throughout this work, outlining the key ideas of the proposed approach in Secs. II.1 and II.2, along with details of the ab initio calculations presented in Sec. II.3. In Sec. III, we report and discuss our findings and provide an outlook. Finally, we conclude in Sec. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06682v1,Multifield tunable valley splitting and anomalous valley Hall effect in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic MnBr,"Compared to the ferromagnetic materials that realize the anomalous valley Hall effect by breaking time-reversal symmetry and spin-orbit coupling, the antiferromagnetic materials with the joint spatial inversion and time-reversal (PT) symmetry are rarely reported that achieve the anomalous valley Hall effect. Here, we predict that the antiferromagnetic monolayer MnBr possesses spontaneous valley polarization. The valley splitting of valence band maximum is 21.55 meV at K and K’ points, which is originated from Mn-d{}_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital by analyzing the effective Hamiltonian. Importantly, monolayer MnBr has zero Berry curvature in the entire momentum space but non-zero spin-layer locked Berry curvature, which offers the condition for the anomalous valley Hall effect. In addition, the magnitude of valley splitting can be signally tuned by the onsite correlation, strain, magnetization rotation, electric field, and built-in electric field. The electric field and built-in electric field induce spin splitting due to breaking the P symmetry. Therefore, the spin-layer locked anomalous valley Hall effect can be observed in MnBr. More remarkably, the ferroelectric substrate Sc2CO2 can tune monolayer MnBr to realize the transition from metal to valley polarization semiconductor. Our findings not only extend the implementation of the anomalous valley Hall effect, but also provides a platform for designing low-power and non-volatile valleytronics devices.","Valley degrees of freedom is the third degree of freedom for electrons outside of charge and spin, which has recently attracted extensive attention since it provides remarkable opportunities for realizing the next-generation of ultra-fast speed, ultra-high capacity, low power consumption, and non-volatile devices 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 ; 5 ; 6 ; 7 ; 8 . The valley refers to a local energy maximum or minimum point in the valence or conduction band, which the energy extremum is robust against impurity scattering and phonon due to the large separation in the momentum space 9 . The current focus of valley investigation is understanding how to stably manipulate the valley degrees of freedom, thereby generating robust valley polarization 10 ; 11 ; 12 ; 13 ; 14 ; 15 ; 16 ; 17 ; 18 ; 19 . Physically, there are two strategies to realize valley polarization. One is optical excitation with circularly polarized light 20 ; 21 , the other is the symmetry breaking 22 ; 23 . The former is a dynamic process, while the latter is especially concerned, particularly the intrinsic valley polarization. There are also two kinds of ways to achieve the intrinsic valley polarization. One is to break the symmetry of spatial inversion (P) via ferroelectric polarization 16 ; 24 ; 25 , and the other broke the time-reversal symmetry (T) through magnetism 10 ; 11 ; 12 ; 13 ; 14 ; 15 ; 16 ; 17 ; 18 ; 19 . This kind of material is named ferrovalley material 10 . Until now, the ferrovalley via breaking T symmetry is mainly focused on ferromagnetic (FM) materials. Compared with the FM materials, the antiferromagnetic (AFM) material is robust against external magnetic perturbation, has high storage density, and possesses ultrafast writing speed (about three orders of magnitude higher than the FM material) due to the zero magnetic moment 26 ; 27 . It is well-known that the two sublattices have opposite spin vectors for the AFM hexagonal lattice. Both the P and T symmetries are broken, but the joint symmetry PT is retained. Therefore, the AFM ferrovalley provides inviting potential for the spintronic and valleytronic applications. Unfortunately, the spontaneous valley polarization in AFM materials is exceedingly rare, which makes the circumstances worse. Simultaneously, the anomalous valley Hall effect is undesirably suppressed for the AFM materials. In this work, based on the density functional theory (DFT) and Hamiltonian model, we propose that the AFM monolayer MnBr is a highly fascinating candidate for the abundant valley contrasting physics. Our results show that monolayer MnBr is a semiconductor with the spin up and spin down bands degeneracy without considering spin-orbit coupling (SOC). When the SOC is included, the valence band maximum (VBM) has 21.55 meV valley splitting at K and K’ points, which originated from Mn-d{}_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital by analyzing the effective Hamiltonian. Importantly, the value of valley splitting can be tuned not only by the onsite correlation, strain, magnetization rotation, electric field, and built-in electric field. But also the phase transition of valley polarized semiconductor to metal can be controlled by ferroelectric substrate Sc2CO2. Our findings open an avenue for the investigation of valley physical quantity in the AFM material, realizing the energy conservation, fast operating spintronic and valleytronic devices."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06536v1,Quantum Calculations of Hydrogen Absorption and Diffusivity in Bulk \mathrm{CeO_{2}},"CeO2 (ceria) is an attractive material for heterogeneous catalysis applications involving hydrogen due to its favorable redox activity combined with its relative impermeability to hydrogen ions and molecules. However, to date, many bulk ceria/hydrogen properties remain unresolved in part due to a scarcity of experimental data combined with quantum calculation results that vary according to the approach used. In this regard, we have conducted a series of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations utilizing generalized gradient (GGA), meta-GGA, and hybrid functionals as well as several corrections for electronic correlations, applied to a number of properties regarding hydrogen in bulk stoichiometic \mathrm{CeO_{2}}. Our calculations place reasonable bounds on the lattice constants, band gaps, hydrogen absorption energies, and O-H bond vibrational frequencies that can be determined by DFT. In addition, our results indicate that the activation energy barriers for hydrogen bulk diffusion are uniformly low (<0.15\ \mathrm{eV}) for the calculation parameters probed here and that, in general, the effect of hydrogen tunneling is small at ambient temperatures. Our study provides a recipe to determine fundamental physical chemical properties of Ce-O-H interactions while also determining realistic ranges for diffusion kinetics. This can facilitate the determination of future coarse-grained models that will be able to guide and elucidate experimental efforts in this area.","In the last several decades, ceria (\mathrm{CeO_{2}}) has been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies because of its potential in an array of applications predominantly in heterogeneous catalysis, including water-gas shift reactions[1, 2], water splitting[3], and semi-hydrogenation of alkynes[4]. However, the mechanism for hydrogen absorption and transport in ceria remains an open question. Chemisorption of hydrogen ions resulting from H2 dissociation or H2O splitting is exothermic and forms hydroxyl species on the surface, which could act as a first step in the formation of cerium hydrides.[5, 6, 7, 8] In contrast, hydrogen can require relatively high temperatures and pressures to diffuse into the bulk of sub-stoichiometric surfaces, where it can form hydroxyl groups and hydride ions near oxygen vacancies.[5, 9] Such studies would benefit from atomistic calculations that could help determine initial hydriding reaction steps as well as the ensuing chemical rate parameters, which would help elucidate the importance of competing chemical mechanisms. In this regard, quantum calculations with Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT) remains a popular choice for determining the breaking and forming of bonds in f-electron systems (e.g., Refs. 10, 11, 12). DFT calculations regarding ceria surface chemistry, though, largely remain quantitatively inconsistent. There has been reported a wide range of energetic barriers for diffusion into the bulk from \mathrm{CeO_{2}}(111) surfaces, with values between 1.15\ \mathrm{eV} and 1.67\ \mathrm{eV} (Refs. 13 and 14, respectively). In addition, there exist similar discrepancies in DFT data regarding hydrogen bulk diffusion in stoichimetric CeO2, with results ranging from 0.18\ \mathrm{eV} in Ref. 13 to 0.52\ \mathrm{eV} in Ref. 14. This is in sharp contrast to one set of experimental results[9] utilizing nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) on sub-stoichiometric \mathrm{CeO_{1.69}} films exposed to \mathrm{H_{2}} to estimate a diffusion activation barrier of 1.69\ \mathrm{eV}. The range of DFT results as well as the seeming disagreement with experimental diffusion barriers is likely in part due to the sensitivity of H-Ce-O interactions to different calculation parameters, including choice of exchange-correlation functional and level of theory (discussed below) and use of specific Hubbard parameters (e.g., DFT+U) to better account for electron correlations. For example, while the Hubbard U correction is generally only applied to the Ce 4f orbitals, some data on a number of metal oxides (including ceria) indicate advantages to including additional Hubbard corrections to the O 2p orbitals to improve the description of defect states.[15, 16, 17, 18, 19] Thus, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a systematic determination of how hydrogen properties within CeO2 depend on the various options available here, and how different choices might affect the interpretation of results and possible comparison to experiments. In this work, we address these issues by employing a range of DFT calculations at various levels of theory to better elucidate \mathrm{CeO_{2}}/H interactions. We report on calculations with the generalized gradient (GGA), meta-GGA, and screened hybrid functionals, using a Hubbard U correction on Ce 4f orbitals as well as a wide range of values for the additional correction to O 2p. We then report on bulk stoichiometric \mathrm{CeO_{2}} properties, interstitial hydrogen formation energies, and diffusion activation energy barriers. We include Arrhenius prefactor values and O–H bond vibrational frequencies, where applicable. Finally, we use the characteristic crossover temperatures to estimate the significance of quantum nuclear tunneling effects vs. classical, over-the-barrier hopping mechanisms. We believe our results place accurate bounds on hydrogen diffusion within bulk \mathrm{CeO_{2}} that can help elucidate experimental results while also providing guidance for future DFT studies on similar systems."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06454v1,Proposal of a general scheme: valley polarization in antiferromagnetic bilayer systems,"Superior to ferromagnetic (FM) valleytronics, antiferromagnetic (AFM) counterpart exhibits ultradense and ultrafast potential due to their intrinsic advantages of zero stray field, terahertz dynamics, and compensated moment of antiferromagnets. However, the physics of spontaneous valley polarization is mainly rooted in FM hexagonal lattices and is rarely used to explore the simultaneous spin and valley polarizations in AFM materials. Here, we propose a general stacking way to achieve valley polarization in AFM bilayer systems. The hexagonal ferrovalley material is used as the basic building unit, and then the space-inversion centrosymmetric bilayer system with interlayer AFM ordering is constructed by horizontal mirror and 2-fold rotational operations, which can exhibit spontaneous valley polarization. In this construction process, the rarely explored layer-locked hidden valley polarization, hidden Berry curvature and layer Hall effect are involved, and an out-of-plane electric field can be used to detect hidden valley polarization and to realize layer-locked anomalous valley Hall effect. We use three examples to illustrate our proposal. Firstly, the Janus GdBrI is used to prove concepts and effects involved in our design process. Secondly, the \mathrm{RuBr_{2}} is used to demonstrate other phenomena, including valley polarization transition and near-ideal quantum spin Hall insulator. Finally, we use our design principles to understand the valley polarization of experimentally synthesized MnSe from a new perspective. Our works establish a robust general scheme to achieve valley polarization in AFM bilayer systems, thereby opening up new avenues for AFM valleytronics.","References (1) J. R. Schaibley, H. Yu, G.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06434v1,Tuning the band topology and topological Hall effect in skyrmion crystals via the spin-orbit coupling,"The topological Hall effect (THE) is the result of spin-asymmetric deflection of charge carriers flowing through a non-collinear spin system. Effective manipulation of the topological Hall conductivity (THC) in skyrmions is currently a vigorous area of research with an eye towards potential spintronics application. Here, we show that the band topology and the THC in a skyrmion crystal can be tuned by changing the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can be accomplished via a perpendicular electric field. This results in the change of the subband Chern numbers and a transition between ordinary insulator and Chern insulator as the Rashba SOC is varied. For partially filled subbands, the Rashba SOC can tune the THC and reverse its sign, so that the direction of the Hall current is flipped. The critical Rashba strength for this depends on the skyrmion type and the carrier density. We extend our analysis to the cases of Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC as well, and show that they can be directly mapped to the Rashba SOC case and therefore lead to similar results. Our work suggests new avenues for the control of charge transport in skyrmion crystals.","Skyrmions are topologically protected structures that have garnered significant attention in recent years for the fundamental science as well as for potential application in spintronics devices[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Originally proposed by Skyrme[1] as a model for baryons in particle physics in the 1960s, they have found widespread application in condensed matter physics including Bose-Einstein condensates[10, 11], liquid crystals[12], quantum Hall magnets[13, 14], and helimagnets[2, 15]. The magnetic skyrmions that form in the solid are nanometer-size twirling spin structures, which are metastable due to the topological protection with a fixed quantized winding number. Since the prediction of the stable skyrmion state in magnetic solids[2], skyrmions have been observed in a plethora of materials [7] such as the ferromagnetic semiconductors with B20 structure such as MnSi and FeGe[16, 17], transition metal oxides [18, 19], Heusler alloys [20], Janus materials [21], moiré heterostructures [22], intermetallic compounds [23], and magnetic multilayers [24]. Skyrmion crystals, the ordered arrays of skyrmions, have been suggested theoretically[25] in magnets as well as in two-dimensional electron gas[26]. Several theoretical studies have also examined the energetics of the formation of stable skyrmion crystals via Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction, magnetic frustration, anisotropy, etc.[27, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35] Experimentally, skyrmion crystals have been observed in several systems using neutron scattering and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. A hexagonal skyrmion lattice was first observed in MnSi [16] and later in other intermetallics such as FeCoSi, FeGe, and Co8Zn10Mn2 [36, 37, 38, 39]. Other types of lattices have been found as well, viz., the triangular lattice in Gd2PdSi3, Gd3Ru4Al12, and the CoZnMn alloy system[40, 41, 42], as well as the square lattice in GdRu2Si2, EuAl4, and in monolayer Fe/Ir(111) [43, 44, 45]. The transport of electrons in the presence of skyrmions has emerged as an important area of research. Included in this are the topological Hall effect (THE) and the spin Hall effect (SHE) as well as the skyrmion Hall effect, which concerns the transport of the skyrmions themselves[46]. THE arises from the transverse motion of electrons due to the emergent magnetic field of the noncollinear spin texture, an effect akin to the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the collinear spin system. Figure 1: Topological Hall effect in the skyrmion crystal. The magnitude of the Hall current can be changed and its sign can be reversed by tuning the Rashba SOC through a critical value \alpha_{R}^{c}. The Rashba strength \alpha_{R} can be modified via a perpendicular electric field E_{\perp} or by growing an overlayer. Similar effects can be obtained with the Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC also as discussed in the text. Figure 2: Illustration of the skyrmion spin texture using field lines. The tangent indicates the planar component of the local skyrmion spin, while the color indicates the component normal to the plane. The spin at the origin is pointed down, changing gradually to the spin up orientation at the skyrmion boundary, as indicated by the color coding. There has been mounting interest in the electrical field control of the Hall effects because it would enable spin manipulation without an external magnetic ﬁeld or a large current injection. However, there has been limited success in this direction using conventional field-effect structures involving magnetic materials adjacent to gate dielectrics. More recently, it has been suggested that this may be achieved through the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, which may be modified by an applied electric field. In a recent experiment, it was found that both the AHE and the THE (arising from the interfacial skyrmions) can be tuned by an applied electric field in the oxide heterostructure via the SOC effect of an inserted layer[47, 48]. In this work, we study the THE in the skyrmion crystal in the presence of three types of SOC, viz., the Rashba, Dresselhaus, or the Weyl type. The Rashba case is studied in some detail, while we show that the other two cases can be mapped to the Rashba case for the skyrmion types we have considered here. Quite remarkably, we find that not only can the magnitude of the THC be significantly changed by varying the strength of the Rashba SOC via an applied electric field, but also that the sign of the Hall conductivity can be reversed by varying the Rashba SOC around a critical value. The band topology in the skyrmion crystal can also be changed by varying the strength of the SOC term, resulting in a change in the subband Chern numbers, which can lead to a flipping of the direction of the topological edge current."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06186v1,"Defect Engineering in Two-Dimensional Pentagonal PdTe: Tuning Electronic, Optical, and Magnetic Properties","Recently, the successful synthesis of the pentagonal form of PdTe2 monolayer (p-PdTe2) was reported [Liu et al., Nature Materials 23, 1339 (2024)]. In this work, we present an extensive first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) based computational study of vacancies in this material. Our study covers the evolution of the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of various defect configurations and compares those to the pristine monolayer (p-PdTe2). We find that VPd (VTe) is the most stable defect in the p-PdTe2 monolayer with 0.95 (1.60) eV of formation energy in the Te-rich (Pd-rich) limit. The defects alter the electronic properties of the monolayer significantly, leading to changes in their magnetic and optical properties due to the emergence of midgap impurity states. The defect complex VPd+4Te is found to induce spin-polarization in the system with a total magnetic moment of 1.87 \mu_{B}. The obtained low diffusion energy barriers of 1.13 eV (in-plane) and 0.063 eV (top-bottom) corresponding to VTe indicates its facile migration probability is higher in the top-bottom direction in comparison to the in-plane direction at room temperature, as revealed by AIMD simulations as well. In order to guide the experimentalists, we also simulated the scanning-tunneling microscope (STM) images corresponding to all the defect configurations. Moreover, we also computed the electron-beam energies required for creating mono-vacancies. In the optical absorption spectra of the defective configurations, finite peaks appear below the band edge that are unique to the respective defective configuration. We have also computed the excess polarizability of the defective configurations with respect to the pristine one and found that maximum changes occur in the infrared and visible regions, providing insights into the change in their optical response as compared to the pristine monolayer. Our study will open the prospects of defect engineering in this and related materials with the aim of tuning their electronic, optical, and magnetic properties from the point of view of device applications.","Layered van der Waals materials, such as two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are one of the most extensively investigated classes of materials by the research community owing to their potential applications in optoelectronics and spintronics devices [1, 2, 3]. These materials provide an engaging area for investigating the extensive range of physical phenomena, including exotic charge density waves (CDWs), unconventional superconductivity, topological states, exciton, and valley-related physics, etc. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In general, all materials have naturally occurring defects such as vacancies, interstitials, anti-sites, grain boundaries, etc., which can influence their properties profoundly. Similarly, it is also possible to introduce defects in the materials in a controlled manner, including TMDs, with the aim of tuning their properties [9]. In spite of the fact that creating defects may cost extra energy, there are many experimental techniques that offer different ways to create defects and study their impact on material properties [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In order to create defects, many techniques, such as ion bombardment, electron irradiation, scanning tunneling microscope (STM) voltage pulsing, vacuum annealing, etc., have been extensively used because they enable controlled modification of the properties of materials after growth [15, 16, 17, 18]. Therefore, it is important also to study theoretically the evolution of properties of materials in the presence of defects. In the TMD systems, the majority of the materials exhibit the honeycomb (hexagonal) type of crystal structure (i.e., graphene-like) and possess MX2 stoichiometry, where the metal atom (M) is sandwiched between the two layers of chalcogen atoms (X). However, in a handful of cases, one observes a preference for the pentagonal phase as well, i.e., those with buckled pentagons as their fundamental building units. Although theoreticians, based on first-principles calculations, have predicted a wide array of 2D pentagonal materials such as PdS2, PdSe2, SnS2, etc., many of them exist in metastable states, making their practical synthesis challenging [19]. Therefore, these pentagonal dichalcogenides remain relatively unexplored due to the challenges associated with their synthesis, which sets them apart from the other TMDs, such as MoX2 and WX2 (X = S, Se, Te), which have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. However, these pentagonal materials show unparalleled characteristics and distinct potential applications because of their lower spatial symmetry [19, 20]. The identification of robust structural stability and exceptional carrier mobility within monoclinic pentagonal PdS2, as uncovered by Wang et al. [21], the interest in the studies of the penta-MY2 class of materials (M = Sn, Pd, Pt, Y = Te, Se, S) has grown tremendously [22, 23]. As far as PdTe2 is concerned, the primary focus of research has been on studying the superconductivity and topological states [5, 24], thermoelectric properties [25, 20], and catalytic properties [26], etc. Recently, Liu et al. have reported successful synthesis of the pentagonal form of PdTe2 monolayer (p-PdTe2) by the symmetry-driven epitaxy method [27]. Differing from typical TMDs, such as MoS2 and WS2, a single layer of p-PdTe2 is composed of Pd atoms surrounded by four Te atoms. This arrangement leads to the creation of four-coordinated PdTe4 units, rendering the monolayer highly responsive to a range of defects, in general, and vacancies, in particular. Recently, it was found that the introduction of defects in 2D layered PdTe2 significantly increased the catalytic properties of the material [26]. Additionally, there has been extensive research on defect-induced magnetism in several TMD monolayers, such as PtX2(X=S, Se, Te) [28, 29]. Given that there have been no previous theoretical or experimental studies of defects in p-PdTe2 monolayer, in this work, we have undertaken a systematic first-principles DFT-based study of vacancies in this compound. By means of total energy calculations, we compute the formation energies of various defects. Furthermore, we also analyze the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of the p-PdTe2 monolayer in the presence of various vacancies. We have also calculated the STM images corresponding to all defect configurations considered in this work to guide the experimentalists and computed the electron-beam energy for creating such defect configurations. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section (sec. II), we present the computational details of our DFT calculations. In sec. III, we present and discuss our results, while in the final section IV, we conclude our findings."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06088v1,A Existence of dual topological phases in -based ternary chalcogenides,"It is quite intriguing to investigate the transition from a topological insulator (TI) phase to topological crystalline insulator (TCI) phase in a material as the latter has an advantage over the former in controlled device applications. This work investigates the existence of this dual topological behavior in Sn-based ternary chalcogenides family PbSnX2 (X=S, Se, Te) under the hydrostatic pressure using first-principles approach. These materials are dynamically stable at ambient and elevated pressure conditions up to which the topological phase transitions (TPTs) are studied. This family have a topologically trivial ground state with direct band gap values 0.338 eV, 0.183 eV and 0.217 eV for PbSnS2, PbSnSe2 and PbSnTe2, respectively. The first TPT i.e., TI phase for these materials is observed, under the effect of external pressure of 5 GPa, 2.5 GPa and 3.5 GPa, with a single band inversion at F-point in the bulk band structure and an odd number of Dirac cones along the (111) surface. A further increase in pressure to 5.5 GPa, 3 GPa and 4 GPa results in another band inversion at \varGamma-point and an even number of Dirac cones along the (111) plane. These even number of band inversions suggest that (\bar{1}2\bar{1}) surface has mirror symmetry around (\bar{1}0\bar{1}) plane and hence, the TCI phase is obtained. This TCI phase is further corroborated with even value of mirror Chern number calculated using winding of Wannier charge centers.Topological phase transition, ternary chalcogenides, first-principles calculations, topological crystalline insulators, mirror Chern number.","I INTRODUCTION A new phase of matter with unusual metallic edge/surface states known as topological materials (TM) has been studied intensively in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The TMs can be divided into few categories such as topological insulators (TIs) [3, 4, 5, 6], topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) [7, 8, 9], Dirac semimetals (DSMs) [10, 11], Weyl semimetals (WSMs) [12, 13], nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) [14, 15], \mathrm{Z_{2}} topological semimetals [16, 17] and triply degenerate node semimetals [18, 19], etc. The metallic Dirac-like electronic states on the surface of the crystal with insulating bulk are the signature of the existence of TI. These metallic edge/surface states appear in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) which are protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and provides robust spin-polarized conduction channels [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. These materials have potential applications in low-power high-speed electronic and spintronic devices, quantum computing, and thermoelectric applications [20, 21, 22] etc. The careful alteration in the strength of SOC plays an important role in realizing topological phases in specific materials. The hydrostatic pressure is a non-destructive way of enhancing SOC without affecting the charge neutrality of the materials. The binary and ternary materials like \mathrm{Bi_{4}Br_{4}} [23], LaAs [16], YbAs [24], LnSb (Ln=La, Gd, Tm) [17, 25], YX (X=As, Sb, Bi) [26, 27] and \mathrm{KNa_{2}Bi} [28], BiTeI [29], \mathrm{Bi_{2}S_{3}} [30], BiTeBr [31] have shown the topological phase transition (TPT) with hydrostatic pressure. The term “topological crystalline insulators,” has been introduced by L. Fu, which defines a class of materials having robust topological states and are protected by crystalline symmetries [7]. This new phase was first proposed in SnTe and later angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) verified the topological surface states (TSSs) in the (001) plane of this material [8]. Unlike TIs, TCIs have persisted protection by mirror symmetry even when TRS is broken. It is quite intriguing to investigate the TPT from TI to TCI in a material. TCI phase is more robust against impurities or defects and has diverse and tunable topological characteristic states [7, 32]. TCI materials hold higher-order topological hinge or corner states which can be identified with different topological invariants depending on the crystal symmetries [33, 34] and can have potential applications in stable qubits and novel electronic devices [7, 32, 33, 34]. The TCI phase has an advantage over the TI phase for controlled device applications such as a topological field effect transistor [32]. The narrow band-gap semiconductors are amongst the highly sought-after materials to realize TPT. Several narrow gap IV-VI semiconducting materials such as PbTe, SnSe, SnS, TlSe, TlS, and \mathrm{Pb_{1-x}Sn_{x}X} (X = Se, Te) have been studied for the existence of TIs and TCIs phases [35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. Other than these, the ternary chalcogenides \mathrm{TlXY_{2}} (X = Sb, Bi; Y = Te, Se) have also been reported as strong TIs [40, 41] but the TCI phase has not been explored in these materials except for \mathrm{TlBiS_{2}} and \mathrm{TlSbS_{2}} [42]. The present study focuses on the realization of TI and TCI phases in ternary chalcogenides \mathrm{PbSnX_{2}} (X= S, Se, Te) with the application of external hydrostatic pressure. For this family, trivial to non-trivial phase are obtained with single band inversion at \varGamma-point under hydrostatic pressure. With further increases in pressure, a pair of Dirac cones are observed along the (111) plane and made these systems trivial again. However, a TCI phase emerges at this elevated pressure as confirmed by non-trivial TSSs along (\bar{1}2\bar{1}) plane which is symmetric around the mirror plane (\bar{1}0\bar{1})."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06072v1,Magnetic properties of frustrated spin-\frac{1}{2} capped-kagome antiferromagnet (CsBr)CuVO,"The structural and magnetic properties of a spin-\frac{1}{2} averievite (CsBr)Cu5V2O10 are investigated by means of temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and 51V nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The crystal structure (trigonal, P\bar{3}) features a frustrated capped-kagome lattice of the magnetic Cu2+ ions. Magnetic susceptibility analysis indicates a large Curie-Weiss temperature of \theta_{\rm CW}\simeq-175 K. Heat capacity signals the onset of a magnetic long-range-order (LRO) at T_{\rm N}\simeq 21.5 K at zero magnetic field due to the presence of significant inter-planer coupling in this system. The magnetic LRO below 27 K is further evident from the drastic change in the 51V NMR signal intensity and rapid enhancement in the 51V spin-lattice relaxation rate in a magnetic field of 6.3 T. The frustration index f=|\theta_{\rm CW}|/T_{\rm N}\simeq 8 ascertains strong magnetic frustration in this compound. From the high-temperature value of the 51V NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate, the leading antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the Cu2+ ions is calculated to be J/k_{\rm B}\simeq 136 K.","Low-dimensional and frustrated magnets furnish a fertile ground to enrich the knowledge on phase transitions in quantum magnetism. In such materials, ground state degeneracy along with strong quantum fluctuations melt the magnetic long-range-order (LRO), leading to highly entangled and quantum disordered ground states, such as quantum spin-liquid (QSL) [1, 2, 3, 4]. Triangular lattice antiferromagnet is one of the most familiar examples of two-dimensional (2D) geometrically frustrated magnets, where the magnetic ions are embedded at the vertices of the edge shared triangular motifs. The kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet (KHAF) is another type of geometrically frustrated 2D lattice in which the triangular motifs are corner-shared and the magnetic frustration is magnified compared to the edge-shared triangular lattice. Further, the effect of quantum fluctuations in a KHAF is expected to be enhanced for low spin systems (e.g. S=1/2) and such systems are well suited for studying quantum phase transitions [5]. A well-studied example is herbertsmithite ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2, which exhibits neither spin-freezing nor magnetic ordering down to 50 mK, confirming QSL behavior [6, 7]. Depending on the sign and relative strength of the exchange couplings, several phase diagrams with different ground states are reported theoretically for KHAFs [8, 9, 10, 11]. Similarly, depending on the value of spin quantum number, multitude of magnetization plateaus corresponding to field-induced spin nematic, simplex solid, supersolid, superfluid, Valance Bond Crystal, and QSL state in isothermal magnetization curve are also delineated [12, 13, 14]. A striking feature of KHAF is that one can manipulate the lattice geometry and design many derivatives of kagome lattice such as octa-kagome [15, 16], staircase-kagome [17, 18, 19], sphere-kagome [20], strip-kagome [21, 22], hyper-kagome [23, 24, 25], tripod-kagome [26, 27, 28], square-kagome [29, 30], and breathing-kagome [31]. Because of complex lattice geometry, these compounds have the potential to host numerous nontrivial ground states. To name a few, QSL is realized in the square-kagome compound KCu6AlBiO4(SO4)5Cl [29, 30] and hyperkagome compound Na4Ir3O8 [25] and spin-ice-type ground state is reported in the tripod-kagome compound Mg2Dy3Sb3O14 [26]. The Cu2+ based averievite family with general formula (MX)Cu5O2(T^{5+}O4)2 [M = K, Rb, Cs, Cu; X = Cl, Br; and T^{5+} = P, V] are a new class of compounds with a highly frustrated capped-kagome geometry [32]. Recently, the magnetic properties of two compounds (CsCl)Cu5V2O10 (CCCVO) and (RbCl)Cu5P2O10 (RCCPO) of this family are reported in detail [33, 34]. Majority of the compounds in this series undergo a structural transition from high symmetric trigonal at high temperatures to low symmetric monoclinic at low temperatures. For both CCCVO and RCCPO, the structural transition is reported at around T_{\rm t}\simeq 310 K. The crystal structure of all these compounds comprises OCu4 tetrahedra, where Cu2+ ions form a 2D capped-kagome layer. Despite very large Curie-Weiss (CW) temperature (\theta_{\rm CW}\simeq-185 K for CCCVO and -160 K for RCCPO), both the compounds undergo magnetic ordering (T_{\rm N}) at very low temperatures. Unlike CCCVO, which has one antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at T_{\rm N}\simeq 24 K, RCCPO undergoes two magnetic transitions at low temperatures, possibly driven by anisotropy [34]. Moreover, CCCVO exhibits another structural transition at low temperatures, which may be due to the ordering of Cs atoms and such a transition is absent for RCCPO. The Zn2+ substitution in place of capped Cu2+ ion in CCCVO suppresses the magnetic LRO as well as the structural transition, making it a promising candidate for QSL [33, 35, 36]. Some preliminary magnetic measurements of the phosphate analog compounds of CCCVO [i.e. Cs(Cl,Br,I)Cu5P2O10] are also reported [37, 38]. Moreover, the recent theoretical studies have proposed that the spin-1/2 capped-kagome systems may show different magnetization plateaus at 1/5, 3/5, and 4/5 of the saturation magnetization due to the formation of localized magnons, singlets, and doublets, respectively [39, 40]. Herein, we report the synthesis and a detailed study of the structural and magnetic properties of another capped-kagome compound (CsBr)Cu5V2O10 (abbreviated as CBCVO), belonging to the same averievite family. It crystallizes in the trigonal symmetry with space groupP\bar{3} at room temperature, without any structural transition. The crystal structure of CBCVO is presented in Fig. 1. There are four inequivalent Cu sites and two inequivalent V sites in the crystal structure. Among them, Cu(3) and Cu(4) form distorted CuO4 square planner units while Cu(1) and Cu(2) form distorted CuO5 trigonal bipyramids. The corner shared CuO4 units constitute a kagome layer in the ab-plane. The CuO5 units share the edges with the neighbouring CuO4 units, building the distorted OCu4 tetrahedra. The corner-shared OCu4 oxocentered plaquettes are arranged in an up-down-up-down manner and form a 2D capped-kagome layer in the ab-plane [see Fig. 1(b)]. Disordered Cs+ ions are positioned between the adjacent capped-kagome layers while the Br- ions are located in the middle of the hexagonal rings. Similar to the other members of the averievite family, CBCVO has a large value of \theta_{\rm CW}\simeq-175 K and it shows the onset of a magnetic LRO at T_{\rm N}\simeq 21.5 K at zero magnetic field. With a frustration index of f\simeq 8, this compound is categorized to be a strongly frustrated magnet. Figure 1: (a) Crystal structure of (CsBr)Cu5V2O10 projected in the bc-plane.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05814v1,A note on thermomechanical coupling effects in the indentation of pseudoelastic shape memory alloys,"While macroscopic experiments on polycrystalline shape memory alloys (SMAs) reveal significant thermomechanical coupling effects arising from the latent heat of transformation, the relevance of thermomechanical couplings in indentation tests remains ambiguous. This ambiguity is further emphasized by the rate effects observed in a number of micro/nano-indentation experiments, thus highlighting the need for a more careful investigation of the thermomechanical interactions at such small scales. With this in mind, the present study aims to demonstrate the role of thermomechanical couplings in indentation-induced martensitic transformation in SMAs. To this end, a simple phenomenological model of pseudoelasticity is employed and finite-element simulations are performed to address two key questions. (1) At which spatial and temporal scales do the thermomechanical couplings arising from the latent heat become effective? (2) To what extent do these couplings influence the indentation response? In connection with the latter, our analysis quantifies the maximal thermal effects that emerge during adiabatic indentation and compares them with those of isothermal indentation.","At macroscopic scale, shape memory alloys (SMAs) exhibit a rate-dependent behavior. The rate-dependence is primarily driven by thermomechanical interactions originating from the latent heat of martensitic phase transformation. This is manifested under non-isothermal loading conditions, where the generated latent heat is not completely removed from the specimen due to the limited heat exchange with the surroundings. Accordingly, the resulting temperature rise elevates the transformation stress (in accordance with the Clausius–Clapeyron relation) and thus leads to complex transformation evolutions [1, 2, 3, 4]. Micro/nano-indentation tests have been extensively used to probe the microstructural features and small-scale mechanical properties of SMAs, e.g., [5, 6, 7, 8]. Within this context, a number of experiments have explored the effect of indentation loading rate on the deformation behavior of the material [9, 10, 8, 11]. Notably, in some cases, a rate-dependent behavior has been observed, which has been occasionally attributed to the thermomechanical interactions. It is, however, important to acknowledge that at such small scales, heat conduction is dominant, and the generated latent heat is expected to be rapidly transferred away from the indented region, hence leading to a (nearly) uniform temperature distribution. As a consequence, it can be reasonably inferred that thermomechanical interactions are less likely to be the origin of rate effects in micro/nano-indentation. Nevertheless, the ambiguity surrounding the potential contribution of thermomechanical couplings at small scales underscores the need for further investigation. The present study aims to elucidate the role of thermomechanical couplings in the indentation-induced martensitic transformation in SMAs. Our investigation is based on a simple phenomenological model of pseudoelasticity and is performed in two steps. First, we employ a thermomechanically-coupled model to assess the significance of transient thermomechanical interactions across various spatial and temporal scales. The goal of this initial analysis is to address the question of when and how do the thermal effects arising from the latent heat of transformation come into play during the indentation of SMAs. Subsequently, we further simplify the model and explore the potential thermal effects during adiabatic indentation. The goal of this analysis is to provide an upper-bound of these thermal effects. The study concludes with a summary of the simulation results and some general remarks."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06947v1,Focused ion beam polishing based optimization of high-Q silica microdisk resonators,"Whispering gallery mode (WGM) microdisk resonators are promising optical devices that confine light efficiently and enable enhanced nonlinear optical effects. This work presents a novel approach to reduce sidewall roughness in SiO2 microdisk resonators using focused ion beam (FIB) polishing. The microdisks, with varying diameter ranging from 5 to 20 \mum are fabricated using a multi-step fabrication scheme. However, the etching process introduces significant sidewall roughness, which increases with decreasing microdisk radius, degrading the resonators’ quality. To address this issue, a FIB system is employed to polish the sidewalls, using optimized process parameters to minimize Ga ion implantation. White light interferometry measurements reveal a significant reduction in surface roughness from 7 nm to 20 nm for a 5 \mum diameter microdisk, leading to a substantial enhancement in the scattering quality factor (Qss) from 3\times 10^{2} to 2\times 10^{6}. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of FIB polishing in improving the quality of microdisk resonators and open up new possibilities for the fabrication of advanced photonic devices.","Whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators are optical devices that leverage the phenomenon of waveguiding by curved boundaries, akin to acoustic whispering galleries. These resonators can achieve high quality factors, enabling efficient light-matter interaction, which combined with their compact design allows for enhanced nonlinear optical effects[1], crucial for applications in nonlinear and quantum optics[2] and sensing[3]. WGM resonators can have various geometries that significantly influence their optical properties and applications, such as spherical, cylindrical, and ring configurations. These resonators are primarily characterized by their axisymmetric shapes, which facilitate the confinement of light through total internal reflection. Microdisks offer several advantages in optical applications, particularly in terms of quality factors, integration capabilities, and lasing efficiency. Microdisks can be easily integrated with fiber optics and other photonic components, allowing for robust coupling and versatile applications in photonic integrated circuits [4]. The ability to parallel integrate multiple microdisks with a single fiber taper enhances their utility in complex systems. Microdisks can achieve exceptionally high quality factors (Q), which is crucial for applications requiring low loss and high sensitivity [5]. While microdisks can achieve high Q values, they often face limitations that affect their performance in practical applications. Figure 1: Schematic of sidewall polishing using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technique Figure 2: Fabrication process flow for Silica microdisk with smooth sidewalls Both subtractive as well as additive fabrication processes have been employed for microdisks [6], on different material platforms. For instance, microdisk resonators were fabricated from an organic semiconductor material using vacuum vapor deposition and photolithography without dry etching [7]. Electron-beam direct-writing was employed to fabricate microdisk resonators with high-quality factors [8], ion slicing and wafer bonding for lithium niobate microdisk resonators [9], direct laser writing for polymeric microdisks on silicon [10], and wet etching for silica-based microcavities [11]. The fabrication of high-quality silicon optical microdisk resonators on silicon-on-insulator wafers was demonstrated using resist reflow and low-damage plasma dry etching [12]. These techniques offer various advantages in terms of scalability and ease of fabrication. Thus, the fabrication of microdisk resonators involves a range of materials and methods tailored to specific requirements such as high quality factors, tunability, and efficient coupling. While diverse approaches including resist reflow, dry etching, ion slicing, direct laser writing, and wet etching have been used to realize microdisk resonators with desired characteristics, most of these techniques result in sidewall roughness at multiple stages of the fabrication process. Interference fringes in photoresist used in lithography [13], formation of ripples during etching [14], gas flow rate, platen power, etching cycle time [15] can all be the parameters affecting sidewall roughness. Figure 3: (a) Wavelength-dependent variation of the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) for the SiO2 film deposited; (b) SEM image of the microdisk post DRIE, (inset) an optical micrograph of the same disk Sidewall roughness in microdisk cavities can be eliminated or reduced through various post-processing techniques and fabrication optimizations. The choice of method depends on factors such as the material used, the desired level of smoothness, and the specific requirements of the application. Chemo-mechanical polishing has been demonstrated to significantly reduce surface roughness in silica microdisks, resulting in ultra-high quality factors exceeding 10^{8} [16]. Thermal reflow techniques have shown promise in reducing sidewall roughness and associated optical scattering loss in high-index-contrast, sub-micron waveguides [17]. Wet chemical polishing combined with dry etching has been successfully applied to GaN sidewalls, removing etching damages and smoothing vertical sidewalls [18]. Femtosecond laser polishing has emerged as a flexible and non-contact method for post-processing additively manufactured parts, including sidewalls [19]. Resist reflow techniques, such as the chip-upending method, have been shown to reduce line edge roughness in submicron single-mode waveguides [20]. However, these techniques generally require complex fabrication techniques and precise control of parameters that alter the morphology of the designed microcavity. In this work, we propose using a focused ion beam to deterministically reduce the roughness by polishing the sidewalls of the microcavity (Figure 1). This method retains the shape and dimensions of the microcavity and allows for a sub-nanometer resolution of control of polishing."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06819v1,Monte Carlo Simulation of Anisotropic Ising Model Using Metropolis and Wolff Algorithm,"We employ Monte Carlo techniques, utilizing the Metropolis and Wolff algorithms, to investigate phase behavior and phase transitions in anisotropic Ising models. Our study encompasses the thermodynamic properties, evaluating energy, magnetization, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, magnetic entropy, and the Binder cumulant. Additionally, we examine the impact of external fields on these thermodynamic quantities at different externally applied field values. We accurately determine the critical temperature for various model scenarios by analyzing the Binder cumulant. Our investigations also include an analysis of the hysteresis loop for the model for different an-isotropic cases. In particular, our study presents the magnetocaloric effect, which is the change in temperature of magnetic material when exposed to a changing magnetic field, in the different anisotropic cases of the Ising model.","I introduction The main aim of condensed matter physics is the study of the collective properties of matter composed of many constituents and the interactions between them [1]. Distinguishing different phases of a system and locating the critical points in the parameter space is key in condensed matter and statistical physics. The study of magnetic materials is a significant topic of interest in both fields. This magnetism arises from the spins of electrons within the material, and ferromagnetic materials particularly are important to study. Ferromagnetic materials have domains in which spins are aligned in a specific direction. When an external magnetic field is applied to these materials, the domains align with the applied field, magnetizing the material. As the temperature increases, the total magnetization decreases. At a specific temperature, known as the Curie temperature or transition temperature, the magnetizations become disordered, and the spins point in random directions, causing the material to lose its magnetic properties–the transition from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic state. This study focuses on explaining the thermal and magnetic behavior of magnetic materials. In 1925, a German physicist, Ernst Ising, with the advice of his PhD advisor Wilhelm Lenz, discussed a model known as the Ising model in his PhD thesis [2]. The Ising model was later solved exactly by Onsager for two dimensions [3]. This model is considered the paradigmatic model for the study of equilibrium phase transitions in statistical and condensed matter physics, as well as in various other fields such as chemistry, biology, statistics, and finance [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The Ising model is one of the simplest and fundamental models for studying magnetic materials. The model has been extensively studied due to its phase transition properties, and numerous resources are available, such as [16]. An overview of the model is as follows. Our study considers a square lattice of size L, having N(=\mathrm{L\times L}) lattice sites. The symbol s_{i} (or \sigma_{i}) is used to represent the magnetic moment (or spin) of the electron/atom/molecule at the lattice site i. The spin is considered fixed at the site and is assumed to take only binary values \{1,-1\} corresponding to the two possible spin states, up and down, along a fixed axis. See Fig.1. The choice of spins with values of \pm 1 is foundational to the model and is motivated by several reasons. This binary nature simplifies the mathematical formulation and analysis of the model, making it more tractable for theoretical studies and computational simulations. The model was originally developed to describe ferromagnetic materials, where atomic magnetic moments (spins) tend to align either parallel or anti-parallel. The Ising model with \pm 1 spins has been instrumental in understanding critical phenomena and phase transitions, particularly second-order phase transitions. These sites (i and j) interact through their fields with interaction strengths \mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{x}} or \mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{y}} along x-axis and y-axis respectively. Furthermore, the interactions are taken between nearest neighboring sites, denoted as \langle i,j\rangle under the summation. The Hamiltonian for the Ising model is represented as: \mathrm{H}(\mathrm{s})=-\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{x}}\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_{x}}s_% {i}s_{j}-\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{y}}\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_{y}}s_{i}s_{j}-h_{j}% \sum_{j}s_{j} (1) Here, h_{j} is the external magnetic field applied. Spins oriented along the magnetic (external) field will have lower energy, and those oriented opposite to the field will have higher energy. For \mathrm{J}_{x},\mathrm{J}_{y}>0, neighboring spins tend to align in a single direction and material shows ferromagnetic behavior. Conversely, for \mathrm{J}_{x},\mathrm{J}_{y}<0, the material becomes antiferromagnetic. When \mathrm{J}=0, the spins do not interact with each other. In these simulations, J is set as the unit of energy and temperature. The changes in the value of J is explained ahead for different anisotropic scenarios. . Figure 1: Schematic diagram of 2D Ising model with J_{x} and J_{y} as nearest neighbor interactions along x-axis and y-axis respectively. By the term anisotropic Ising model, we mean that \frac{J_{y}}{J_{x}}\neq 1.0. This is the model we are interested in our simulations. In the isotropic Ising model, the values of \frac{J_{y}}{J_{x}}=1.0. In our study of the anisotropic Ising model, the value of \frac{J_{y}}{J_{x}} has been changed. One of the methods for studying the phase transition of the model is the Monte Carlo (MC) technique. Metropolis algorithm has been implemented successfully on a large variety of condensed matter systems like cuprates [17, 18, 19]. On the one hand, following the tradition of using the Monte Carlo method, we employed the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (discussed in section II.1 ahead) to study phases and phase transitions of the 2D Ising model. However, this approach leads to the well-known problem of critical slowing down near the critical point. This problem has been extensively discussed in the literature [20]. While we will not delve deeply into the details of this issue, we aim to give the reader a sense of its complexity in the next few paragraphs. On the other hand, we used the Wolff algorithm [21] for the same study of phases and phase transitions. The Wolff algorithm helps us bypass critical slowing down by employing a method called cluster updating, which involves growing a cluster randomly and flipping the cluster, giving the speed-up over the Metropolis-Hastings’ algorithm which flips a single spin randomly. The working of the Wolf algorithm has been discussed in section II.2 ahead. 2D materials in general and the ones with magnetic properties especially, after the discovery of graphene [22, 23], have begun a new field of research because of their distinctive physical properties, hence, their different and interesting applications in industrial sectors like optoelectronics, magnetic recording, energy, thermo-electrics, etc. [24, 25, 26, 27] that in turn gives rise to the new technologies. This magnetism is coming due to the spins. For the fundamental understanding the Ising model, a historical model, is studied in physics that provides a simplified framework to investigate complex spin interactions in 2D and 3D materials offering valuable insights of the phenomena. Here we are focusing on 2D systems because of their special properties. The range of interactions has a role of great importance, for example, new long-range interactions have been recently studied in [28] and the references mentioned therein. The variation of the strength of interaction alters the detailed balance condition of the system, affecting the system’s overall thermodynamic behavior. This is one of our interests in this study. Let’s have some account of an engrossing phenomenon–the detailed balance condition, crucial in Metropolis-Hastings’ algorithm, which states that at equilibrium, all elementary processes should be equilibrated by their reverse processes. In simple terms, the probability of the system transitioning from state A to state B is the same as the probability of transitioning from state B to state A. In the context of the Ising model, which describes the magnetic spins on a lattice, the detailed balance condition is of great importance for sampling the configuration space according to the Boltzmann distribution. A random move is accepted or rejected based on the change in energy, following the Metropolis algorithm. The Metropolis criteria are essential to ensure that the detailed balance condition is satisfied [29]. The detailed balance condition states that for any two states \sigma and \sigma^{\prime} of the system, the transition rates \mathrm{W}\left(\sigma\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime}\right) and W\left(\sigma^{\prime}\rightarrow\sigma\right) must satisfy: \frac{\mathrm{P}\left(\sigma^{\prime}\right)\mathrm{W}\left(\sigma^{\prime}% \rightarrow\sigma\right)}{\mathrm{P}(\sigma)\mathrm{W}\left(\sigma\rightarrow% \sigma^{\prime}\right)}=1 (2) where P(\sigma) denotes the equilibrium probability distribution of state \sigma. For a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T, the probability (\sigma) is given by the Boltzmann distribution: P(\sigma)=\frac{e^{-\beta H(\sigma)}}{\mathrm{Z}} (3) where \beta=\frac{1}{k_{B}T} (k_{B} is Boltzmann constant), H(\sigma) is the energy of state \sigma, and Z is the partition function: \mathrm{Z}=\sum_{\sigma}\mathrm{e}^{-\beta\mathrm{H}(\sigma)} (4) To ensure detailed balance, the transition rates should be chosen such that: \frac{\mathrm{e}^{-\beta\mathrm{H}\left(\sigma^{\prime}\right)}\mathrm{W}\left% (\sigma^{\prime}\rightarrow\sigma\right)}{\mathrm{e}^{-\beta\mathrm{H}(\sigma)% }\mathrm{W}\left(\sigma\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime}\right)}=1 (5) which simplifies to: \frac{\mathrm{W}\left(\sigma^{\prime}\rightarrow\sigma\right)}{\mathrm{W}\left% (\sigma\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime}\right)}=\mathrm{e}^{\beta\left[\mathrm{H}% \left(\sigma^{\prime}\right)-\mathrm{H}(\sigma)\right]} (6) One common choice for the transition rates that satisfies the detailed balance condition is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, where the transition rate from state \sigma to \sigma^{\prime} is given by: \mathrm{W}\left(\sigma\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime}\right)=\min\left(1,e^{\beta% \left[\mathrm{H}\left(\sigma^{\prime}\right)-\mathrm{H}(\sigma)\right]}\right) (7) Critical slowing down [29] shows auto-correlation time blows up. Since the Metropolis algorithm flips a single random spin at a time to dismantle clusters spread throughout the lattice, this process is a huge time-consuming process in simulations. The correlation length is the characteristic length scale over which the spins of the system are correlated. Near the transition temperature, the correlation length diverges, indicating that correlations extend over long distances. Additionally, the correlation time, which is the characteristic time scale over which spins in the system are correlated, also increases. At the critical point, where there is a phase transition between the ordered (ferromagnetic) phase and the disordered (paramagnetic) phase, correlations become stronger and extend over long distances. Due to this, the single-flip method offered by the Metropolis algorithm leads to a highly time-consuming process known as critical slowing down [21, 29]. The cluster flipping method offered by the Wolff algorithm [21] assists in de-correlating the system in significantly less time. This can be realized from the Eq.(8) that gives the relation between the correlation time (\tau) and the correlation length (\xi). \tau\approx\xi^{z} (8) Here, z represents the dynamic exponent. The value of this dynamic exponent is approximately \approx 2.17 for the Metropolis algorithm and nearly zero for the Wolff algorithm [21, 30]. The systems we are studying have limited size, unlike the realistic models that ideally extend to infinite size (L\rightarrow\infty). Therefore, boundary conditions need to be taken into consideration, and for that, we are employing the usual approach of using periodic boundary conditions. This implies that the topmost and rightmost layers are considered neighbors, as are the bottom-most and leftmost layers. Figure 2: Snapshot of the Monte-Carlo simulation of isotropic Ising model using Wolff algorithm (first row) and the MA (second row) at three (2.0, 2.26, and 3.0) temperatures (Black and white dots here represent the +1 and -1 states of the model, video file: [31]). Fig.2 presents snapshots of the simulation at three different temperatures of the isotropic Ising model: 2.0 (below the transition temperature), 2.26 (near the transition temperature), and 3.0 (above the transition temperature). Black and white dots here represent the +1 and -1 states of the model. The first row displays the results for the Wolff algorithm, while the second row shows the lattice of the Metropolis algorithm. These snapshots were captured after 10^{3} Monte Carlo steps for 100\times 100 lattice. For temperatures near the critical temperature, the Wolff algorithm reaches equilibrium near 10^{3} steps, whereas the Metropolis algorithm lags. A video demonstrating these flips has been created and an online video can be seen by clicking the link in [31] From the video, it can be observed that even at a temperature of 2.0 (below the transition temperature) and especially at T = 2.26 (near to the transition temperature), the Metropolis algorithm takes larger number of Monte-Carlo steps for equilibration, while the Wolff algorithm shows the transition of the system in lesser number of Monte-Carlo steps. At T=3.0 (above transition temperature) the system is not transitioning from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic state. The phase transition is not possible above the transition temperature because the thermal fluctuations dominate the system. Our main results include magnetization, energy, specific heat, magnetic entropy, and Binder cumulant versus temperature at various magnetic field values. Additionally, we present the study of the Magnetocaloric effect for both the isotropic Ising model anisotropic Ising model and different anisotropic Ising model cases. Transition temperatures for the Isotropic Ising model and four different variants of the anisotropic Ising model were determined through Monte Carlo simulations using both the Metropolis and Wolff algorithms. The four different variants of the anisotropic Ising model involve five distinct values of \frac{J_{y}}{J_{x}}, namely 0.5,0.75,1.0,1.25, and 1.5. Transition temperatures of these models were identified using Binder cumulant graph plotting for five different values of N, the lattice size. The values of N considered in this study are 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. The magneto-caloric effect (MCE) is an interesting topic for the discovery and development of new materials with enhanced magnetocaloric properties. Contrary to traditional methods of gas compression and expansion cycles for refrigeration, for example, which often use environmentally harmful refrigerants, magnetocaloric refrigeration has the potential to be a more efficient source of energy and friendly to the environment. Magnetocaloric refrigeration can provide targeted cooling with high precision which has high industrial uses. Magnetocaloric technologies can be integrated with renewable energy sources. The MCE comes with some scientific and technological challenges that drive research and innovation. Though MCE promises many things, understanding the fundamental physics behind the effect, optimizing material properties, and designing efficient magnetocaloric devices are table-top topics in research. These challenges stimulate advancements in materials science, thermodynamics, and engineering. The investigation of magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effect has been an interesting topic for a long time. Even nowadays researchers are exploring these properties in different systems using Monte Carlo and other methods. The magnetocaloric effect using Monte Carlo simulations has been discussed for 1D, 2D, and 3D ferrimagnetic systems has been discussed in [32]. Magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effect of an Ising-type polyhedral chain have been discussed in [33], on 2D core-shell Ising system in [34], Ising model with RKKY interaction in [35], 3D Ising model with new long-range interaction in [28] Further discussion about MCE is in the magneto-caloric effect section later. After the introduction in the above section I, the rest of the paper is framed as follows. First, we are presenting an overview of the Metropolis and Wolff algorithm in section II. Afterward, a discussion on symmetry, order parameters, and phase transitions is given in section III. In the next section, we are moving to results and analysis of the below-mentioned thermodynamic quantities (Eq.(11)) to (14)) for anisotropic Ising model and anisotropic Ising model using Metropolis algorithm and Wolff algorithm, followed by the study of transition temperatures using Binder cumulant using Wolff algorithm, in section IV. Subsequently, we are presenting the study of the thermodynamic and magnetic quantities ((Eq.(11)) to (15)) at varying magnetic fields in section V. Thereafter, we are presenting the hysteresis loop survey for the Ising model for different Isotropic cases in section VI. Finally, we go to the magnetocaloric effect in section VII. And the conclusion of the paper in the last section VIII."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06734v1,Cocktail effect on superconductivity in hexagonal high-entropy alloys,"We report the study of the cocktail effect on superconductivity in high-entropy alloys (HEAs), using hexagonal close-packed HEAs as a prototype system. Compared with the compositional averages of the constituent elements, the superconducting transition temperature T_{\rm c} is enhanced by from a factor of \sim2 to over one order of magnitude. This T_{\rm c} enhancement correlates with the reduction in the Debye temperature, underlining the importance of phonon softening in triggering the cocktail effect. Furthermore, we show that the T_{\rm c} in these HEAs is governed by the average phonon frequency and electron-phonon coupling strength, the latter of which scales linearly with the inverse HEA molecular weight and is progressively weakened with increasing mixing entropy. Our study paves the way toward quantitative understanding of the superconductivity in HEAs.","Over the past decade, a new class of compositionally complex alloys developed based on the entropy concept, the high-entropy alloys (HEAs), have attracted much attention ref1 ; ref2 ; ref3 ; ref4 . These emerging alloys are made up of four or more principle elements with equimolar or nearly equimolar ratios. This chemical complexity leads to enhanced mixing entropy, which overcomes the enthalpies of compound formation. As a consequence, HEAs exist in a single solid-solution phase and are often regarded as metallic glasses on an ordered lattice. Compared with traditional alloys based on one or two principle elements, HEAs often exhibit superior mechanical and physical properties, such as high hardness ref5 , high thermal stability ref6 , excellent corrosion resistance ref7 , complex magnetism ref8 , and robust superconductivity against disorder ref9 .

Especially, the cocktail effect means that the elements that make up the HEAs work in synergy with each other to enable better performance than the compositional average. This has indeed been demonstrated for the mechanical, catalytic, electrochemical and hydrogen storage properties ref10 ; ref11 . In contrast, the cocktail effect on the physical properties has been poorly explored. Hexagonal close-packed structure is one of the prototype structures for HEAs ref12 . Although the hexagonal HEAs accounts for only \sim1% of the total HEAs, those based on 4d/5d elements are known for their proneness to become a superconductor. So far, nearly thirty different superconducting compositions have been found in this family ref13 ; ref14 ; ref15 ; ref16 ; ref17 ; ref18 ; ref19 ; ref20 , and their T_{\rm c} varies by one order of magnitude up to \sim8.3 K, as listed in Table 1. Notably, quite a few of these HEAs, such as Mo-Ru-Rh-Pd ref13 , Mo-Re-Ru-Rh ref14 , Mo-Re-Ru-Pd-Pt ref17 , and Mo-W-Re-Ru-Pd ref20 , have T_{\rm c} values much higher than those of the corresponding constituent elements. This clearly violates the rule of mixtures and signifies enhanced superconducting pairing induced by the elemental makeup. In this regard, the elucidation of its mechanism not only helps to better understand the cocktail effect and but also may provide clues to achieve a higher T_{\rm c}. However, to our knowledge, no such study has been reported to date. Figure 1: (a, b) VEC dependencies of \delta and \Delta\chi, respectively, for the hexagonal HEA superconductors. In panel (a), the horizontal dashed line denotes the threshold for the formation of single-phase HEAs. (c) \delta versus \Delta\chi plot of the hexagonal compositionally complex alloy superconductors. The data for rare-earth hexagonal HEAs, typical intermetallics, and metallic glasses are also included for comparison. The regions corresponding to different phases are highlighted in different colors. Here we address this issue by comparing the experimental T_{\rm c}, Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma, and Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D} values with the compositionally averaged counterparts \overline{T}_{\rm c}, \overline{\gamma} and \overline{\Theta}_{\rm D}. It is found that, with varying valence electron concentration (VEC), the increase in T_{\rm c}/\overline{T}_{\rm c} is concomitant with the decrease in \Theta_{\rm D}/\overline{\Theta}_{\rm D}. The \lambda_{\rm ep} dependence of T_{\rm c} and its affecting factors are examined, and the implications of these results are discussed."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06724v1,Non-Abelian charge conversion in bilayer binary honeycomb lattice systems,"In two-dimensional systems with space-time inversion symmetry, Dirac nodes (DNs) carry non-Abelian topological charges which induce intriguing momentum space braiding phenomenon. Although the original idea was proposed in condensed matter setup, the experimental verification of non-Abelian charge conversion has been limited to artificial metamaterials because of the difficulty in identifying suitable materials in which controlled tuning of DN positions is possible. In this work, we propose bilayer binary honeycomb lattices (BBHL) as a new material platform to study the non-Abelian charge conversion phenomenon in which DN positions in momentum space can be manipulated. More explicitly, we demonstrate that layer sliding and vertical pressure serve as tunable braiding parameters controlling the non-Abelian charge conversion process which is crucial to understand the stacking-dependent electronic properties of BBHL systems. We show that the BBHL systems are a promising candidate for the experimental realization of non-Abelian phenomena of DNs in condensed matter.","References Ahn et al. (2019a) J. Ahn, S.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06608v1,MolMiner: Transformer architecture for fragment-based autoregressive generation of molecular stories,"Deep generative models for molecular discovery have become a very popular choice in new high-throughput screening paradigms. These models have been developed inheriting from the advances in natural language processing and computer vision, achieving ever greater results. However, generative molecular modelling has unique challenges that are often overlooked. Chemical validity, interpretability of the generation process and flexibility to variable molecular sizes are among some of the remaining challenges for generative models in computational materials design. In this work, we propose an autoregressive approach that decomposes molecular generation into a sequence of discrete and interpretable steps using molecular fragments as units, a ‘molecular story’. Enforcing chemical rules in the stories guarantees the chemical validity of the generated molecules, the discrete sequential steps of a molecular story makes the process transparent improving interpretability, and the autoregressive nature of the approach allows the size of the molecule to be a decision of the model. We demonstrate the validity of the approach in a multi-target inverse design of electroactive organic compounds, focusing on the target properties of solubility, redox potential, and synthetic accessibility. Our results show that the model can effectively bias the generation distribution according to the prompted multi-target objective.","Deep generative models (DGMs) have become a popular choice in new high throughput screening (HTS) paradigms Westermayr et al. (2023); Ortega Ochoa et al. (2023). Within new HTS, generative models are used to create an initial pool of candidates subject to some target properties Sanchez-Lengeling & Aspuru-Guzik (2018). This initial pool is then filtered in sequential steps of increasing computational expense, from machine-learning surrogate models Schütt et al. (2017); Tsubaki & Mizoguchi (2020a) to classical computing methods, such as density functional theory (DFT; Kohn & Sham, 1965). These generative models vary in the molecular representation used, e.g., SMILES strings Gómez-Bombarelli et al. (2018); Lim et al. (2018); Popova et al. (2018), graph-based Jin et al. (2019; 2020) or point sets Hoogeboom et al. (2022b); Gebauer et al. (2022); Guan et al. (2023); Schneuing et al. (2023); Qiang et al. (2023), and modelling approach, e.g., reinforcement learning-based Popova et al. (2018); Simm et al. (2020a; b), variational autoencoders (VAEs; Gómez-Bombarelli et al., 2018; Lim et al., 2018), generative adversarial network (GANs; Cao & Kipf, 2022), diffusion models Hoogeboom et al. (2022b); Guan et al. (2023); Schneuing et al. (2023); Qiang et al. (2023); Wu et al. (2022); Huang et al. (2022); Xu et al. (2023) or flow matching Dunn & Koes (2024). Despite the diversity of models, there are challenges unique to computational materials modelling that have been often overlooked: (A) Multi-step vs one-shot generation: Generating a molecule in a single step risks making the generation process opaque. Generating a molecule in sequential steps allows spending more computation per step and makes the generation more transparent. Multi-step generative models for materials include Molgym Simm et al. (2020a), diffusion models Hoogeboom et al. (2022b); Qiang et al. (2023), flow matching Dunn & Koes (2024), VAE-based models with an autoregressive decoder Jin et al. (2019; 2020), and other autorregressive models Gebauer et al. (2022); You et al. (2018); Liao et al. (2020). (B) The size of the molecule is fixed during the generation process: A number of models that do satisfy the desirable feature (A) fixed the size of the molecule during the generation process. We believe the size of the molecule should be a choice of the model during the generation process. Some models that do take this into account include the graph-based, VAE variant models with autoregressive decoders Jin et al. (2019; 2020) and G-Schnet Gebauer et al. (2022), which operates on point sets. (C) Low chemical validity of generated molecules: Most often, chemical validity checks are enforced only at the end of the generation process, resulting in a lower percentage of chemical valid molecules. Incorporating chemical checks during the multi-step generation process allows to identify chemical violations before the molecule is completed, thus avoiding continuing the generation of chemically invalid molecules. Models that do satisfy this desirable feature are the graph-based AE variant models with autoregressive decoders JTNN, HierVAE Jin et al. (2019; 2020). (D) Coarse-graining molecules: Molecules naturally exhibit hierarchical structure, they often can be decomposed into molecular fragments that can be treated as units in themselves. Exploiting the hierarchical nature of molecules helps scale deep learning models to larger molecules Wang & Gómez-Bombarelli (2019), something that has remained a notable challenge. Models like JTNN and HierVAE use molecular fragments as units, and this approach has also been adapted for diffusion models Qiang et al. (2023). (E) Incorporating 3D information: A model that has no access to 3D geometry information of the molecule will struggle to conditionally generate other structures when the target property depends on the 3D geometry. Models like JTNN, HierVAE do not include this information in the molecule representation. Our proposed model is designed to satisfy the five desirable requirements mentioned: Multi-step generation using molecular fragments and 3D geometry of a non-fixed size molecule with enforced chemistry sanitation during generation. 1.1 Related work & contribution Our work builds on ideas from the aforementioned studies, but it is most closely related to JTNN Jin et al. (2019) and HierVAE Jin et al. (2020), particularly the latter. HierVAE is a hierarchical graph VAE-based model operating on molecular fragments using an autoregressive decoder to build molecules in sequential steps. Similarly, we enforce chemical validity during the generation process, and, like JTNN and HierVAE, we use a coarse-graining procedure to extract molecular fragments. In summary, our contributions are: • We propose a semi-order-agnostic autoregressive model that grows molecules in discrete steps. • We formulate the one-step prediction step as a single classification task, as opposed to the nested classification approach of Jin et al. (2020)Jin et al. (2020). • We formulate an approach to uniquely identify attachments of a fragment taking into account its symmetries. • We show how to incorporate spatial information in the autoregressive process to make the prediction geometry-aware. • We demonstrate the model can be used for multi-target inverse design by examining how well calibrated are the predicted properties of compounds generated subject to design criteria spanning a whole dataset."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06529v1,Thermodynamically-Informed Iterative Neural Operators for Heterogeneous Elastic Localization,"Engineering problems frequently require solution of governing equations with spatially-varying discontinuous coefficients. Even for linear elliptic problems, mapping large ensembles of coefficient fields to solutions can become a major computational bottleneck using traditional numerical solvers. Furthermore, machine learning methods such as neural operators struggle to fit these maps due to sharp transitions and high contrast in the coefficient fields and a scarcity of informative training data. In this work, we focus on a canonical problem in computational mechanics: prediction of local elastic deformation fields over heterogeneous material structures subjected to periodic boundary conditions. We construct a hybrid approximation for the coefficient-to-solution map using a Thermodynamically-informed Iterative Neural Operator (TherINO). Rather than using coefficient fields as direct inputs and iterating over a learned latent space, we employ thermodynamic encodings – drawn from the constitutive equations – and iterate over the solution space itself. Through an extensive series of case studies, we elucidate the advantages of these design choices in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility. We also analyze the model’s stability and extrapolation properties on out-of-distribution coefficient fields and demonstrate an improved speed-accuracy tradeoff for predicting elastic quantities of interest.","The ability to model and predict the evolution of complex, heterogeneous spatial structures is central to materials design. Representing these systems computationally requires solving a set of governing equations, often partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we focus on parametric elliptic PDEs, which are characterized by different sets of coefficient fields and forcing terms. Consider a system of equations \mathcal{L}(a,u)=f (1) where a(x) represents spatially-varying coefficients and f(x) captures boundary conditions or forcing terms, u(x) is the solution field, and \mathcal{L} is a differential operator tacitly assumed to also consider derivatives of its arguments (such as \nabla u) as inputs. Oftentimes f is fixed but a itself is the output of some underlying generative process conditioned on some parameters (e.g., manufacturing settings) \theta. This process produces spatially heterogeneous structures; common scientific examples include material nano/microstructures [1, 2], geological systems [3, 4, 5]), and musculoskeletal or brain tissue [6, 7, 8]. In general one can link sampled coefficient fields a\sim P(a|\theta) (2) with solutions u by solving the governing equations, then postprocess u to compute downstream quantities of interest q. Estimating forward and inverse uncertainties (p(q|\theta) and p(\theta|q), respectively) requires repeated evaluation of the coefficient-to-solution map G:a\mapsto u\quad s.t.\quad\mathcal{L}(a,G(a))=f. (3) In cases where only a few choices of a or f are required, a traditional numerical solver provides accurate and interpretable results [9, 10, 11, 12]. However, traditional solvers are typically optimized for accuracy and flexibility rather than throughput. Alternatively, Neural Operators are a class of Deep Learning models specialized for problems such as parameteric PDEs. Leveraging innate data parallelism and batched inference, neural operator surrogates ostensibly provide a high-throughput alternative to traditional solvers. Recently neural operators have shown great success in applications such as elastic wave propagation [13, 5], multiphase flow [14, 15], elastography [16] and fluid dynamics [17, 18] even on irregular domains [19]. However, training a neural operator which is robust to distribution shift is an ongoing challenge [20, 21, 22] – one which substantially undercuts their utility in inverse design. A machine learning model’s performance depends directly on the quality and diversity of training data available and is highest near the training set. However, for design and inversion problems one is likely to encounter coefficient fields not represented in the training distribution [23]. To this end, a vast body of research has explored data-free training, applying strong- or weak-form versions of the governing equations as loss functions on the neural operator’s output [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. Physics-based losses effectively shift the computational burden of data generation from a high-fidelity solver onto the training loop of the operator itself. However, this does not impact the internal architecture of the operator, and still specializes the model to certain subsets of the input/output spaces. Therefore we ask a complementary question: how can one design neural operators in a way which encourages scalability and transferability, regardless of the objective function? We draw on the rich literature of iterative numerical solvers [29]: rather than computing a direct map from input to output, we wish to incrementally improve predictions until some stopping criterion is reached. In the context of Deep Learning, this idea is known as loop unrolling, implicit learning or Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) learning. Historically, these models have been primarily used mostly in inverse problems [30, 31, 32]. However, a number of recent advances in training methodology [33, 34, 35, 36] have lead to increased use in applications such as image representation [37], generation [38], and neural operators [39, 17]. A number of theoretical questions arise with the shift to implicit learning, in particular: what latent spaces and input representations are desirable for fast and accurate inference? To explore these questions tractably, we focus on an archetypal parametric PDE: computing the deformations of heterogeneous material structures subjected to bulk loading conditions, hereafter referred to as the localization problem. Since materials are inherently stochastic, heterogeneous, multiscale systems [40, 41], their internal structures are of central interest for both design and evaluation [42]. In the following discussion, we restrict our attention to mesoscale elastic materials, so that different instantiations of coefficient fields (rank-4 symmetric elastic stiffness tensors) are referred to as microstructures. Likewise, we use pointwise stresses and strains as local solutions; while displacements or deformation mappings are the fundamental solution variable at a micromechanical level, predicting strains and stresses is sufficient for many homogenization problems [43, 44, 45]. In the following sections we introduce relevant background in deep learning and micromechanics, then develop and evaluate a class of neural operators which predict local strains and stresses over 3D heterogeneous elastic structures with known voxel-level constitutive information. To balance the above challenges, our method learns a Deep Equilibrium Model which iteratively refines strain predictions using thermodynamic encodings. A Fourier Neural Operator is used as the core filtering operation, and fixed-point iteration with Anderson Acceleration is used to solve the resulting system of equations. The contributions of this work are threefold: first, we present a solver for 3D heterogeneous elasticity, which has remained relatively untouched in literature. Since inelastic deformation mechanisms such as crystallographic slip are inherently three-dimensional, this work presents a bridge towards modeling much more complex and nonlinear phenomena with neural operators. Second, we present a thorough comparison of our method against several state-of-the-art iterative neural operator architectures in terms of efficiency, predictive accuracy, and inference stability. In particular, we find that inclusion of constitutive information inside the iteration loop tends to stabilize iterations, reduce numerical artifacts, and provide lower prediction error at the expense of slower internal convergence. Finally, we formulate a zero-shot extrapolation problem, wherein each model is tested on out-of-distribution structures which are more difficult (higher contrast) than its training set. In this setting we find that our model produces between two to five times smaller errors for the same parameter budget as other state-of-the-art methods. We now briefly introduce the notation used hereafter. All tensor quantities are represented using either boldface (\bm{C}) or index notation (C_{ijkl}). Single and double dot products refer to single and double contractions along the innermost indices (\bm{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{e})=\sigma_{ij}e_{j}, \bm{C}\mathbin{:}\bm{\varepsilon}=C_{ijkl}\bm{\varepsilon}_{kl}). Scalar quantities are denoted without subscript or bold. For brevity, spatial dependence is shown in variable definitions but not in subsequent use, and all quantities are assumed spatially-varying unless otherwise stated. While continuous integrals are used for theoretical development, they computationally take the form of sums over voxel-wise quantities. Unless otherwise specified, all superscripts are used as indices rather than exponents. In order to efficiently store symmetric rank-2 and rank-4 tensors, we utilize Mandel notation [46, 47] to convert these quantities to vectors of length 6 and 6\times 6 matrices, respectively. Further detail on this process is presented in A. 1.1 Parametric PDEs in materials A great amount of effort has been invested in experimentally exploring the connections between the process parameters used to synthesize or manufacture a material, its internal structure, and its thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties of interest. The combination of lab automation [48, 49, 50] and data-driven methods [51, 52, 53, 54] offer a high-throughput exploration of materials spaces; however, bridging information between these spaces – and across length-scales – presents several challenges. The inherent complexity and stochasticity of material structures introduces a large amount of scatter in process-property mappings. Prior physical domain knowledge (e.g., atomistics, constitutive models) and experimental data generally provide information regarding either the process-structure or structure-property cases. This introduces a major computational challenge – estimating process-structure-property linkages requires repeated evaluation of both a generative (process \rightarrow structure) model and a forward (structure \rightarrow property) solver. The latter is exactly our parametric PDE above; since the mapping can be expensive to compute for a large ensemble of microstructures, it is often approximated or bypassed in construction of UQ or inverse design models. Common PDEs in material design involve (thermo-, visco-) elasticity [55], continuum [56] and crystal plasticity [57, 58, 59], and phase-field evolution [60, 61, 62]. On the coefficient side, a burgeoning literature of generative models for materials has been developed using statistical parametrizations [63, 1], optimization methods [64, 65, 66], Generative Adversarial Networks [67], and diffusion maps [68, 69, 70, 71]. Since the upstream field of Generative AI is rapidly growing and changing, we anticipate a continued growth in the availability of synthetic microstructure generators. The ability to rapidly and accurately evaluate microstructures, especially coming from a wide range of sources, further accentuates the need for a fast surrogate solver. In summary, the challenge of materials design requires localization solvers which are both fast and accurate, perform stably and degrade gracefully outside their training distribution, and naturally accommodate the complexity of heterogeneous, stochastic material structures. While this work is directed specifically towards elastic deformation of mesoscale materials, the underlying system of equations is structurally quite similar to other engineering problems such as diffusion [72], Darcy flow [73], and electric conductivity [74]. 1.2 Elastic Localization The periodic small-strain elastic localization problem is defined as the mapping from a microstructure instantiation m(x) to its resultant strain field \bm{\varepsilon}(x) when subjected to periodic loading conditions which impose an average strain field \overline{\bm{\varepsilon}}. Connecting displacement u(x) and strain is the compatibility condition: \varepsilon_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}}u_{j}+\frac{% \partial}{\partial x_{j}}u_{i}\right)\iff\nabla\times(\nabla\times\bm{% \varepsilon})=0.\\ (4) The heterogeneous microstructure is characterized by its (linear) elastic stiffness field \bm{C}(x), which relates strain \bm{\varepsilon}(x), stress \bm{\sigma}(x), and strain energy density w(x) via the constitutive relations \displaystyle w(\bm{\varepsilon},\bm{C}) \displaystyle=\bm{\varepsilon}\mathbin{:}\bm{C}\mathbin{:}\bm{\varepsilon} (5) \displaystyle\bm{\sigma}(\bm{\varepsilon},\bm{C}) \displaystyle=\frac{\partial w}{\partial\bm{\varepsilon}}=\bm{C}\mathbin{:}\bm% {\varepsilon} (6) Momentum balance results in the equilibrium condition \displaystyle\nabla\cdot\bm{\sigma}^{T} \displaystyle=0 (7) Periodic loading conditions are imposed by restricting the displacement field to the set \mathcal{K} of displacement fields which produce periodic strain fields with average \overline{\bm{\varepsilon}}: \mathcal{K}_{\overline{\bm{\varepsilon}}}=\{u~{}|~{}\bm{\varepsilon}(u)=% \overline{\bm{\varepsilon}}+\bm{\varepsilon}(v)\quad\text{for some periodic, % continuous fluctuation field}~{}v\} (8) This approach is commonly used in computational homogenization; for a deeper discussion regarding these conditions, the reader is directed to [45]. While displacement is the primary micromechanical state variable, we can equivalently formulate the problem in terms of strains. This takes the form of predicting a periodic strain field \bm{\varepsilon} given stiffness field \bm{C} and average strain \overline{\bm{\varepsilon}}: \displaystyle\text{Map}\qquad\bm{C},~{}\overline{\bm{\varepsilon}} \displaystyle\mapsto\bm{\varepsilon} (9) \displaystyle s.t.\qquad\nabla\cdot(\bm{C}\mathbin{:}\bm{\varepsilon}) \displaystyle=0 (10) \displaystyle\nabla\times(\nabla\times\bm{\varepsilon}) \displaystyle=0 (11) \displaystyle\langle\bm{\varepsilon}\rangle \displaystyle=\overline{\bm{\varepsilon}} (12) \displaystyle\bm{\varepsilon}\quad \displaystyle\text{periodic}. (13) Notably, all dependence on microstructure enters via the microstructure-to-coefficient map m\mapsto\bm{C}. For the case of N-phase composite materials, m often takes the form of phase indicator functions; for a polycrystalline material, m instead takes the form of Bunge-Euler angles [75] or Generalized Spherical Harmonic coefficients [76]. To avoid restricting our work to a single class of materials, we work directly with the coefficient field. While the governing equations themselves are linear and elliptic, the coefficient-to-solution mapping \bm{C}\mapsto\bm{\varepsilon} (with \overline{\bm{\varepsilon}} fixed) is in fact nonlinear [77]. Moreover, microstructures are inherently discontinuous, discrete objects; for a composite material \bm{C} will be piecewise constant and discontinuous across grains or phase boundaries. This lack of regularity propagates into the solutions; while u must be continuous, it is not differentiable across jumps in \bm{C}, and thus \bm{\varepsilon} is piecewise continuous (even before discretization). These complexities have spurred a rich literature of numerical solvers but hindered the application of learning-based methods. This problem has been explored extensively in continuum mechanics [78, 56] as the linearization [79] of more complex phenomena such as finite-strain, inelastic, dissipative deformations. Therefore it acts as the outer loop for many numerical solvers [11, 80, 81]. 1.3 Traditional Localization Solvers While a vast number of discretization and approximation schemes have been explored for elastic localization, we primarily focus here on finite-element and iterative FFT schemes. However, a number of alternative approaches exist in numerical homogenization [43, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86]. Finite Element Methods convert a set of governing equations into a weak form and compute approximate solutions in a finite-dimensional function space [87, 12]. Sobolev approximation spaces provide control over the approximation’s regularity, making them a natural fit for heterogeneous localization problems [88]. These methods are extremely general in the physical geometries [89] and deformation mechanisms [57, 90, 91, 92] they can model. However, this generality makes a general-purpose FEA solver poorly suited for many-query applications due to the cost of assembling and solving a global stiffness matrix for each microstructure in an ensemble. A number of remedies have been proposed, such as the element-by-element method [93], and meshfree methods [10]. An alternative class of solution techniques – often called FFT methods – rely on a reformulation of the original governing equation into a more numerically favorable form. This is done by applying an operator splitting [94, 95] and Green’s function solution [96, 97] to convert the original system of differential equations into an implicit integral equation known commonly as the Lippmann-Schwinger (L-S) equation [98] or the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind [99]. This reformulation gives rise to numerous homogenziation techniques [44, 100, 101, 83], as well as an array of iterative localization solvers. Notably, Moulinec and Suquet [78], demonstrated that for both elastic and inelastic deformations, the Lippmann-Schwinger equation is a contraction [102, 103] and can be solved efficiently via a matrix-free fixed-point iteration. Due to their use of Fast-Fourier transforms to approximate the Green’s operator, these are often referred to as FFT solvers. A number of refinements have been proposed to the basic scheme, including different discretizations of the Green’s operator and different update rules / search methods. Of particular note are the augmented-Lagrangian approach [104], polarization- [105] or displacement-based iterations [106], adaptive iterations [45], and extensions to finite-strain and irreversible deformations [107, 80]. The central issues these methods face are ringing artifacts (sometimes called Gibb’s oscillations) due to use of a truncated Fourier basis for the Green’s operator [108, 109, 110], the restriction to a regular, uniform grid, and ill-conditioning caused by contrast in material properties. 1.4 Deep Learning for Localization While machine learning has traditionally explored maps between finite dimensional spaces (e.g., vectors of fixed length or sampled images), operator learning seeks mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces [111]. This is extremely useful in cases where a model needs to perform well across discretizations or resolutions, or when the resolution differs between available training data and desired evaluation scenarios. Recently a great number of operator learning methods have been proposed, including Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) [112, 113], Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) [114, 115, 116, 117], Spectral Neural Operators [118], Graph Kernel Networks [111, 85], and Neural Kernel Operators [119]. Since this work employs FNOs, we briefly review them here; further review and comparison on other neural operators can be found in [120, 121]. FNOs are effectively convolutional neural networks which use band-limited spectral convolutions (via Discrete Fourier Transforms) [122] rather than spatial convolutions. Their ability to capture global patterns makes them them well-suited for modeling spatial phenomena with nonlocal or long-range interactions. Unlike meshfree neural operator architectures, they follow relatively standard implementation and training schemes. The original formulation can be applied on any size Cartesian input grid, and when trained on a fine enough resolution, their accuracy does not degrade with mesh refinement (unlike standard CNNs [123]). They can also be extended to non-rectangular domains by means of coordinate embeddings [124, 19]. In context of heterogeneous materials, FNOs have been used to model quasistatic fracture in 2D [116], elastic plane strain or stress in two-phase composites [125, 86, 126, 19, 115], and 2D brittle fracture and hyperelasticity [39]. The majority of FNO research has focused on problems involving two spatial dimensions due to the dramatic increase in parameter counts from 2D to 3D. To address this, different factorizations and compressions have been explored to reduce the memory overhead while preserving predictive capacity [127]. While many canonical deep learning models are direct and feed forward in nature, iterative methods such as loop unrolling [32], learned optimizations [30], and weight-tying [128] have grown in popularity [31]. Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) Models [129] solve a nonlinear system of equations during training and inference to emulate an infinite-depth network by leveraging the Implicit Function Theorem [34] to estimate gradients for backpropagation. A number of variations have been suggested to enforce contractivity [33, 36] and path-independence [35], as well as expressive capacity [130]. Essentially, DEQ models allow the user to trade training and inference time for higher expressive capacity and accuracy, controlled by the number of iterations and choice of nonlinear solver. 1.5 Comparison with Existing Work While elasticity and plasticity have been extensively explored in 1D and 2D [86, 126, 19, 115], there is a dearth of works which use machine learning to predict full 3D solutions over heterogeneous microstructures [131, 132]. Among the myriad works in physics-based, operator, and implicit techniques, the closest to our proposed model are Implicit Fourier Neural Operators (IFNOs) by You et al. [39] and Deep Equilibrium FNOs by Marwah, et al. [17]. IFNOs use a fixed-point iteration inside the network’s forward pass (similar to DEQ methods), but only iterate on the FNO’s internal latent space. That is, the encoding and decoding operations are only used once. The motivation in that work was primarily to allow stable training of deeper FNO models without vanishing gradient issues or an exploding parameter count. Similarly, Marwah et al. employed a deep-equilibrium FNO to model porous composites (Darcy Flow) as well as steady-state incompressible flow in 2D [17]. Rather than using fixed-point iteration and backpropagating through iterations, they used accelerated schemes (e.g., Anderson mixing, Broyden’s method) and the Implicit Function Theorem to estimate gradients. However, they also used the same (encoder, implicit filter, decoder) architecture as You, et al. We first cast these variants in a shared notational framework. Let B_{n} represent the “body” of an FNO (itself composed of n Fourier layers L, with \mathcal{F} representing the FFT operation): \displaystyle L^{k}(v) \displaystyle=\sigma(W^{k}v+\mathcal{F}^{-1}[R^{k}\mathcal{F}[v]]) (14) \displaystyle\mathcal{B}_{n} \displaystyle=L^{n}\circ L^{n-1}\circ\ldots\circ L^{1} (15) We use P and Q to denote encoder and decoder layers, respectively, which are often typically implemented via channel-wise linear transforms or MLPs. Using this notation a traditional FNO approximates the mapping a\mapsto u (where \hat{u} represents the predicted solution) as: \displaystyle\hat{u} \displaystyle=Q\circ B_{n}\circ P\circ a (16) The iterative versions described above differ in the choice of latent space and solution scheme, leading to the following variations: \displaystyle\begin{split}h^{0}&=\mathcal{P}\circ a\\ h^{k+1}&=h^{k}+\frac{1}{m}\mathcal{B}_{n}(h^{k})\\ \hat{u}&=Q\circ h^{m}\end{split}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{(IFNO, $m$ % iterations)} (17) and \displaystyle\begin{split}h^{0}&=\mathcal{P}\circ a\\ h^{*}&=h^{0}+\mathcal{B}_{n}(h^{*})\\ \hat{u}&=Q\circ h^{*}\end{split}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{(FNO-DEQ)} (18) Note that both architectures only change the internal structure of the filtering operations, but leave the lifting and projection unchanged. Furthermore, the iterative models work over a learned latent space which must simultaneously represent the input coefficients and the iterative candidate solutions, then be projected out into the solution space. While one could ostensibly apply knowledge of the underlying system of equations and thermodynamic structure into the internal architecture, it is not clear how this would work on a learned latent space. In contrast, we propose iterating directly over the solution field u and instead injecting a into the iterative process via thermodynamic embeddings a,u\mapsto z. While explained further below, our approach can be cast in the above notation as: \begin{split}u^{0}&=0\\ \hat{u}&=\mathcal{Q}\circ\mathcal{B}_{n}\circ\mathcal{P}\circ z(a,\hat{u})\\ \end{split}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{(TherINO)} (19) Another work in a similar vein is the Hybrid Iterative Numerical Transferable Solver (HINTS) framework [133, 134] developed by Zhang, et al. Rather than learn an implicit operator, HINTS interleaves calls to a standard relaxation solver (e.g., Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel iterations) with evaluations of a feedforward DeepONet to solve linear differential equations. In this regime the network effectively acts as a nonlinear preconditioner, taking in residuals and returning improved solution estimates. In this case the iterative space is exactly the solution space itself, and the network need only approximate the residual-to-error mapping (e.g., error in F(a,u) vs error in u). While the HINTS paper does explore random coefficient fields, they focus exclusively on smooth and slowly-changing coefficient fields in one spatial dimension. We believe that a combination of these approaches may be valuable: alternating relaxation iterations (such as steps of an FFT solver) with the neural operator could be interpreted either as preconditioning the neural operator with a relaxation solver, or vice-versa. Since this raises a number of practical and theoretical questions, we leave it to future work. A number of works have also used neural networks as hybrid time integrators by interleaving timesteps between neural and traditional solvers [62, 135]. In this work, however, we focus on quasi-static problems. Likewise, deep learning has been used to construct initial guesses for Newton iteration [136, 137] and select tuning parameters for multigrid preconditioners [138]. There are a number of other “thermodynamics-informed” learning techniques which enforce a thermodynamically-admissible [139, 56] structure upon a neural network [140, 141, 142, 143]. These works are orthogonal to ours; rather than learn flows within a constraint space, we use thermodynamics to inform the network’s trajectory in an unconstrained space. In applications with dissipation and entropic constraints, a combined approach will likely be necessary (i.e., enforcing non-negative entropy production architecturally). Likewise, the field of physics-informed learning generally applies governing equations as loss functions, rather than architectures. Finally, derivative-informed learning uses partial knowledge of derivatives of the coefficient-to-solution map (\nabla_{a}G) as an additional loss term [144]. All losses used in this work are data losses, but given access to an efficient (batched GPU) estimator of FEA weak-form losses, one could easily use that as an additional regularization."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06461v1,A fast transferable method for predicting the glass transition temperature of polymers from chemical structure,"We present a new method that successfully predicts the glass transition temperature T_{\!\textrm{g}} of polymers based on their monomer structure. The model combines ideas from Group Additive Properties (GAP) and Quantitative Structure Property Relationship (QSPR) methods, where GAP (or Group Contributions) assumes that sub-monomer motifs contribute additively to T_{\!\textrm{g}}, and QSPR links T_{\!\textrm{g}} to the physico-chemical properties of the structure through a set of molecular descriptors. This method yields fast and accurate predictions of T_{\!\textrm{g}} for polymers based on chemical motifs outside the data sample, which resolves the main limitation of the GAP approach. Using a genetic algorithm, we show that only two molecular descriptors are necessary to predict T_{\!\textrm{g}} for PAEK polymers. Our QSPR-GAP method is readily transferred to other physical properties, to measures of activity (QSAR), or to different classes of polymers such as conjugated or bio-polymers.","Polymers are remarkably versatile materials, and the combined control of monomer chemistry and chain length allows for superior tuneability of physical properties. As a polymer melt is cooled, the time-scale \tau_{\alpha} characterising its structural (\alpha) relaxation increases dramatically, and in the absence of crystallisation the structure freezes into an amorphous solid, a glass, at the glass transition temperature T_{\!\textrm{g}} [1]. Since molecular motions are controlled by T_{\!\textrm{g}}, this is a key parameter for understanding and predicting material behaviour, and it is thus essential to develop methods for accurately predicting T_{\!\textrm{g}} directly from the chemical structure. For long-chain polymers, T_{\!\textrm{g}} is molecular weight (M) independent [2, 3, 4, 5], but strongly affected both by intramolecular dihedral barriers [6, 7] (chain flexibility) and intermolecular packing effects, both of which are chemistry-specific [5]. Importantly, it has been shown that the \alpha relaxation, which defines T_{\!\textrm{g}}, is linked to relaxations on a relatively ‘local’ sub-monomer length-scale [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], which in turn suggests that models that predict T_{\!\textrm{g}} from monomer structure should be achievable. In this paper we present such a model, and apply it to the poly(aryl ether ketone) (PAEK) family of polymers. Predictive models that relate structure-based properties and T_{\!\textrm{g}}, and are suitable for small data sets with low chemical variability, have been proposed for polymers [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 5, 20, 21]. For instance, an approximate correlation has been found between T_{\!\textrm{g}} and monomer-scale properties such as the molecular weight per conformational (or flexible) degree of freedom of the chain (M_{\phi}) [16, 18, 5, 15, 17], where M_{\phi} captures both chain flexibility and chain bulkiness (reflecting molecular packing). As one example, Schut et al. [18] correlated T_{\!\textrm{g}} with the mass per flexible bond for a data set divided into three polymer classes by introducing flexible groups into both the main chain and the side chains; an out-of-sample mean absolute error (MAE) for T_{\!\textrm{g}} of \lesssim 6\,\textrm{K} (per polymer class) was obtained. In another example, Xie et al. [19] assigned an ad-hoc mobility factor to each atom based on the chemical group it belongs to (e.g., alkyl, phenyl or thiophene). The monomer’s mobility was then averaged over the atomic contributions, followed by a regression of T_{\!\textrm{g}} on the monomer mobility. For a family of 32 conjugated polymers, a RMSE \simeq 13\,\textrm{K} was attained for in-sample T_{\!\textrm{g}} predictions. These methods are easily applicable and intuitive; e.g. by linking a relevant physical property, such as a molecular weight or volume, to each ‘flexible bond’, where ad-hoc rules are often introduced to quantify the influence of different bonds. However, the approaches are typically tailored to specific data sets and are not generalisable to a wider set of polymer structures [20]. Conversely, a more generalisable approach is the so-called group contribution, or group additive properties (GAP) method [22, 23, 24]. It assumes that a polymer property can be expressed by a composition-weighted average over contributions from sub-monomer motifs (fragments). The fragment contributions can be determined directly from data by a linear regression. van Krevelen [24] applied GAP to predict various polymer properties, such as transition temperatures, solubility, mechanical, optical and electrical properties; while Weyland et al. [23] quoted in-sample MAE \simeq 10\,\textrm{K} for predictions of T_{\!\textrm{g}}. Despite their broad applicability, a fundamental flaw of GAP models is that they cannot be used to make predictions for polymers containing fragments outside of the data sample [25, 26, 21]. A method that addresses some shortcomings of GAP models is the so-called quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) approach. QSPR-based methods use molecular descriptors [27, 28], which quantify electronic, topological or geometric properties that are calculated from atomistic representations of molecules. For polymers, QSPR methods are normally applied either to the monomer [21, 29, 25, 30] or to oligomers consisting of a few monomers [31, 32, 33], and statistical or machine learning (ML) techniques are used to determine the relationship between the descriptors and the investigated property (such as T_{\!\textrm{g}}) [34, 35, 30]. For QSPR methods applied to T_{\!\textrm{g}} predictions, RMSEs typically vary from \simeq 4-35\,\textrm{K} [21, 36, 37, 25], depending on the chemical variation within the data set. Models on larger data sets [38, 39], with higher chemical variation, typically yield prediction errors exceeding 25 K [36, 40]. A significant drawback of QSPR models is that accurate descriptor calculations can be computationally costly, especially for large monomers or oligomers. GAP and QSPR methods have usually been applied separately [21, 29, 19, 20]. However, Hopfinger et al. [26] proposed a linear regression-based model for predicting T_{\!\textrm{g}} based on a GAP-like averaging scheme, combined with associating physical properties (conformational entropy and mass) with individual bonds. Inspired by this approach, we suggest extending QSPR methods to a smaller structural scale than the monomer unit, assuming interactions between these sub-monomer motifs negligibly contribute to the property of interest. Here, we resolve the shortcomings of both the GAP and standard QSPR models, by developing a hybrid QSPR-GAP method: a molecule is divided into sub-monomer fragments for which molecular descriptors are calculated, and various linear regression methods are used to link T_{\!\textrm{g}} to the fragment structure. Our approach significantly accelerates the descriptor calculations and addresses the weakness of GAP methods, also providing accurate predictions for polymers containing fragments outside the data sample. We apply our new QSPR-GAP method to a data set of 146 linear homo- and copolymers of poly(aryl ether ketone) (PAEK) – an important class of linear polymers characterised by alternating stiff (aryls such as phenyls or biphenyls) and flexible linker (such as ethers or ketones) moieties, as shown in Fig. 1-A. The properties of PAEK polymers are highly tuneable by varying these moieties, making them suitable for a wide range of applications including smart-phone speakers, electrical insulation, automotive gears, medical implants and aircraft components [41]. To design PAEK polymers with optimised properties for specific applications, reliable structure-property relationships are essential. We use our QSPR-GAP method to predict T_{\!\textrm{g}} from the monomer structure, with an RMSE \simeq 5-12\,\textrm{K} (out-of-sample). In cases where the GAP model is known to fail (i.e., predicting polymers containing fragments outside of the training set), the model makes accurate predictions. Moreover, by identifying the molecular descriptors most important for predicting T_{\!\textrm{g}}, we reach new insights into how local molecular structure relates to the glass transition temperature in polymers. Our findings offer a pathway to predict the properties of highly complex polymer structures using small data sets, thus circumventing the need for more elaborate ML methods, which typically require larger data sets. Our method is readily generalisable to both a wider range of polymer properties (such as mechanical, optical, or electrical properties), and different classes of polymers."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06231v1,Solid-liquid interfacial free energy from computer simulations: Challenges and recent advances,"The theory of interfacial properties in liquid-liquid or liquid-vapour systems is nearly 200 years old, and includes the contributions of great personalities like Young and Gibbs. The advent of computational tools has greatly advanced the field, mainly through the use of Molecular Dynamics simulations, which allows the precise study of interfaces between different systems at the atomistic level. Despite the successes and advances in the theory of interfacial phenomena for liquid-liquid systems, the study of solid-liquid interfaces still remains a challenge both theoretically and experimentally. The main reason why the treatment of solid-liquid systems has fallen behind that of liquid-liquid systems is that there are complications that arise whenever an interface involving solid systems is considered. These complications involve both the theory of the solid-liquid interface and the calculations of related properties using Molecular Dynamics simulations. An example of the former is that, contrary to the liquid-liquid case, the interfacial properties of solids depend on the lattice orientation. The main complications in the calculation of interfacial properties arise from the fact that for solids the “mechanical route”, which requires a single calculation to determine the distribution of stresses in the sample considered, cannot be used. To overcome this problem, several numerical approaches were proposed to tackle the calculation of interfacial properties in solid-liquid systems. The main purpose of this review is to provide an overview of these different methodologies and to discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We classify these methodologies into two main groups: direct and indirect methods. Direct methods are those that are able to calculate directly (although in a more convoluted way) the properties of interfaces, while in indirect approaches the properties of the interface are not the primary result of the simulations. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of solid-liquid interfaces, we also included a discussion on the origin of the difficulties in considering solid interfaces from a thermodynamic point of view. In the second part of the review, we discuss two key related topics: nucleation theory and curved interfaces. They both represent an important problem in the study of interfaces and in particular in the context of solid-liquid ones for which the research is still extremely active.","One of the famous quotes attributed to Pauli describes a surface in a really unflattering manner, portraying it as aligned with chaos and darkness, unlike the order and rationality of the bulk 111As reported in [1], the quote reads “God made the bulk, surfaces were invented by the devil”. Although it is true that surfaces can be difficult to deal with (and we will describe why in this review), it is also true that they are often more interesting to describe and study than the bulk because several interesting phenomena occur only at the interface between two (or more) phases. This is especially true for solid-liquid interfaces. The detailed knowledge of the structure and thermodynamic properties of interfaces that separate a solid and other coexisting phases is the basis for many physical phenomena and technological processes, making it a matter of primary interest in several different fields. We dedicate the first part of this review to describing these problems and applications and, as will be made clear in the rest of this work, to showing why so much effort has been dedicated to the creation of reliable methods for the determination of interfacial properties. A central challenge (and the theme of this review) is the accurate calculation of the interfacial free energy (IFE). Among the physical phenomena dependent on the interfacial properties, the formation of a new (solid) phase from a liquid one has several different and important applications. The formation of a new solid phase from a liquid describes two different but related phenomena: in freezing (or solidification) we have the formation of a new solid phase from its melt, whereas in crystallization the new solid phase is created from a solution in which the solid is dissolved. These two processes are related by the fact that the physical process allowing the formation of the new phase is nucleation [2, 3, 4, 5] on which we will have an extensive discussion in the subsequent sections. One of the most studied systems undergoing freezing is probably water [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], not only because of its theoretical importance, but also for its wide spectrum of applications. For example, a fundamental understanding of ice formation is essential, as it plays a crucial role in atmospheric science for the accurate representation of world climate [11, 12], and for the design of functional materials, such as materials with anti-icing properties [13, 14]. Such materials will have a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from increasing safety in aviation [15], where ice formation on wings is one of the main safety concerns, increasing the performance of wind turbines in cold climates [16, 17], to reducing damage on overhead power lines [18, 19]. In solidification science, solid-liquid IFE controls the formation of solidification microstructures in metallic materials [20], from which, in turn, the quality of the final product in casting [21] depends. In particular, the dendritic growth velocity depends on the anisotropy in solid-liquid IFE [22, 23]. This anisotropy will be discussed in more detail in the next sections, and it is important in several systems, e.g., the Al-Cu alloy [24, 25] and the solid-liquid coexistence in Ni, Cu, Al [26] and Ti [27]. In fact, when a solid is in contact with a liquid, the value of the IFE depends on the particular orientation of the crystal phase in contact with the liquid. A different arrangement of the atoms in the solid will result in a different arrangement of the layers of the liquid closer to the solid [28], making the surface energy dependent on the orientation of the crystal structure. This effect highlights one of the difficulties that concern solid interfaces in general (not only in the context of the solidification process), which we will discuss in the next section: when solids are involved, the IFE is not a single quantity but assumes different values depending on the particular structure of the solid-liquid interface. In the process of formation of a new solid phase from a solution, the role of IFE between the solid and liquid phases in the nucleation process is well established [29] in different systems, from polymers [30, 31] to biomineralization [32]. The impact of the surface properties on the formation of the new solid phase through nucleation is related not only to the formation of the new phase but also which polymorph will be formed [33, 34]. A given substance exhibits polymorphism if there is more than one solid crystalline arrangement of the molecules of that substance. The prediction of which polymorph can be formed is important for biological processes [32] but also in the crystallisation of pharmaceutical products where the formation of the right polymorphs of drugs is essential for their effectiveness and safety [35, 36]. The importance of surface properties in the pharmaceutical industry is not limited to the prediction of the most stable product in drug production but encompasses several key aspects. In fact, the behaviour of such industrial products, (including both excipients and active pharmaceutical ingredients) with respect to binder-drug adhesion [37], granulation performance [38, 39, 40], powder flow, and compaction [41, 42] can be related to the surface properties [43, 44, 45, 46]. An application that has become extremely important in recent times, in which interface properties play a pivotal role, is the design of next generation graphene-based energy storage devices such as electrochemical double layer (super)capacitors (EDLC)[47, 48, 49]. Compared to standard energy storage devices, the new systems (using materials such as graphene [50, 51, 52, 53], porous activated carbon [54] and carbon nanotubes [55, 56]) have higher charge storage capacities, favourable specific energy-to-power ratios (owing to rapid charge-discharge cycling [51] controlled by changes of an applied potential) and lifetimes that can reach millions of cycles [54]. Energy storage in graphene-based supercapacitors is based on a reversible non-Faradaic physisorption of ions in the electrical double layer [57]. With its high surface area, graphene can in principle guarantee a higher capacitance than amorphous carbon-based electrodes. However, the area offered by the electrode is not the only parameter that enters the quantification of the capacitance. In order to be successful, the electrochemically active surface area of the electrode should be easily accessible by the electrolyte. This, in turn, depends on the ability of the electrolyte to wet the electrode surface. This is another manifestation of the solid-liquid IFE. In addition, the ability of the electrolyte to wet the graphene surface changes as a function of the potential applied to the electrode, a phenomenon known as “electrowetting” [58]. To capture the behaviour of graphene in contact with electrolytes, a more detailed account of electrostatic interactions is needed [57]. The development of such improved descriptions of the interactions requires quantum mechanical/molecular dynamics (QMMD) models [59] and more accurate force-fields, possibly based on machine learning [60]. The combination of such advanced descriptions with the methodologies presented here will surely be at the forefront of the investigation of such systems. Another interesting area where knowledge of interface properties in solid-liquid systems is essential is thermal transport across solid-liquid interfaces, in particular when the size of the system considered is microscopic and therefore the interface/volume ratio of the system involved becomes large [61]. The control of thermal transport at the nanoscale is important for medical applications, water purification, and microelectronics [62] (see [63] and the references therein for a more detailed account of the different applications). The interfacial thermal conductance is related to the affinity between the solid and the liquid at the interface. This effect was observed for the first time by Kapitza [64], and is now known by its name -“Kapitza resistance” (although it refers to conductance rather than resistance) and state that the stronger the attraction between the two phases is the lower the thermal resistance becomes [63]. A measure of the strength of this attraction is the wettability of the solid interface with the liquid and previous works show that there is a direct relation between wettability and thermal conductance [65, 66]. In turn, as we discussed in the case of electrochemical devices, we can consider the wettability as just another manifestation of the IFE, and the ability to obtain a reliable value of this property in a variety of systems becomes essential. Until this moment, we have talked about “surfaces” and “interfaces” without providing a proper definition, appealing instead to their common meaning. From now on, we will more rigorously define these concepts and put them into the context of thermodynamic theory for quantitative analysis and discussion. Indeed, the analysis of the properties of interfaces is deeply rooted in thermodynamics, as shown in the pioneering work of J. W. Gibbs, one of the earliest contributors to this topic, but also one of the founders of modern thermodynamics. In his work [67], he defined the interface between two different phases as a zero-width plane (later called “Gibbs dividing plane”), to which he ascribed the excess of the thermodynamic quantities which characterise the presence of an interface between two phases. One of these quantities is the IFE, \gamma, which represents the reversible work required to create a unit area of interface at the coexistence conditions for the two phases. We introduce here some of the notation that will be used throughout the rest of the work, by explicitly stating what are the two phases in contact through the interface. The liquid can be either the melt corresponding to the solid phase or a solution in which the solid phase is the solute. Where both cases are applicable, we shall refer to the IFE as \gamma_{sl}. When we consider only the solid-melt interface, we shall use \gamma_{sm}, and if we are considering only the solution-solid interface we shall use \gamma_{sx}. The Gibbs approach was later generalized by Cahn, with a formulation which avoids the need to locate the position of the dividing surface [68]. As we shall discuss in the following sections, the definition of interfacial properties, while straightforward for liquid-liquid systems, involves some subtleties when the system contains a solid interface. Such differences between liquid-liquid and solid-liquid systems are the main reasons for the different way to approach the calculation of interfacial properties using Molecular Dynamics simulations in the two kinds of systems. Whereas in liquid-liquid systems it is possible to leverage rather simple relations to calculate the interface properties using MD simulations (such as using the stress within the system as a proxy for the energy required to create the interface) such shortcuts are not possible for solid-liquid interfaces. In the latter case, more complicated calculations are needed, as one often has to resort to using very basic thermodynamic relations. For instance, the energy needed to create an interface is calculated by literally creating a new interface in a simulation box, which is an operation that is much more complicated than just calculating the force acting between atoms in the system. This review is organized as follows: we will first introduce the surface-specific quantities in solid-liquid systems starting from their thermodynamic definitions. We provide a brief account of the reasons why solid-liquid interfaces are different from liquid-liquid ones. From this we will move on to the presentation of the different methods devised in the literature to access the interface properties for solid-liquid systems. Here, we choose to partition the different techniques into two main groups, which we label as direct and non-direct methods, based on the way the interfacial properties are computed. This is the most extensive part of the review. Although such methodologies have been applied to several different systems, there are some systems which can be considered as “benchmarks” against which the results of any new extension of existing methodologies or the development of new ones should be compared: the hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones models. For this reason, we include a detailed description of such systems, along with a detailed comparison of the different approaches against the benchmark. We then discuss in some detail the calculation of interfacial properties for more realistic systems, namely water and hydrates. We selected these systems both for their importance and also because they exemplify the kind of complications one has to face in considering a realistic system for the description of the IFE. We then describe the importance of determining surface properties in the theory of nucleation and devote a section to curved interfaces. These last two sections (sections 10 and 9) must be considered “open”, in the sense that, despite being long-known problems (the first appearance of the problem of curved interface is in the work of Young in 1805 [69], and the theory of nucleation is now a century old [70, 71]), they have not reached the maturity which we can find, e.g., in the study of liquid-liquid interfaces (a problem which was completely solved by Gibbs well over a century ago [67]). In the last part, we draw some conclusions and give some perspective on future applications and ideas related to the methodologies described here."
https://arxiv.org/html/2405.09225v1,Exploring Ground States of Fermi-Hubbard Model on Honeycomb Lattices with Counterdiabaticity,"Exploring the ground state properties of many-body quantum systems conventionally involves adiabatic processes, alongside exact diagonalization, in the context of quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computation. Shortcuts to adiabaticity by counter-diabatic driving serve to accelerate these processes by suppressing energy excitations. Motivated by this, we develop variational quantum algorithms incorporating the auxiliary counter-diabatic interactions, comparing them with digitized adiabatic algorithms. These algorithms are then implemented on gate-based quantum circuits to explore the ground states of the Fermi-Hubbard model on honeycomb lattices, utilizing systems with up to 26 qubits. The comparison reveals that the counter-diabatic inspired ansatz is superior to traditional Hamiltonian variational ansatz. Furthermore, the number and duration of Trotter steps are analyzed to understand and mitigate errors. Given the model’s relevance to materials in condensed matter, our study paves the way for using variational quantum algorithms with counterdiabaticity to explore quantum materials in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.","I INTRODUCTION Efficiently simulating complex quantum systems stands as a pivotal capability of quantum computers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], often regarded as a potent tool for investigating quantum materials [6, 7, 8, 9], chemistry [11, 12, 13], biology [14, 15], and nuclear physics [16], all of which are governed by the principles of quantum mechanics. This proposal has transitioned from a conceptual idea to a practical endeavor with the development of experimental technologies in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Among the most celebrated algorithms in this context is the variational quantum algorithm (VQA) [17, 18, 19, 20], which aims to reduce circuit depth by integrating quantum computers with classical optimizers. The circuit utilizes parameterized blocks of quantum gates as ansatz, tailored for different scenarios. Hardware-efficient ansatz address hardware limitations [21], while unitary coupled clusters are optimized for quantum chemistry and condensed matter systems [22, 23]. These ansatz, derived from the system’s Hamiltonian, form the core of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), facilitating efficient exploration and optimization of quantum states. A straightforward application of VQA is in ground state searching, a critical aspect for quantum information processing and many-body physics. Exact diagonalization, while theoretically accurate, suffers from exponentially growing computational complexity, making it impractical for large-scale systems. However, this complexity can be mitigated by employing variational circuits to approximate the ground state through energy expectation minimization. This underscores the requirement for designing an adequate ansatz to facilitate finding the ground state, while increasing expressibility thus potentially reducing the impact from the notorious barren plateau caused by hardware-efficient ansatz, large system size, and deep circuits [24, 25]. In accordance with the adiabatic theorem, a system is expected to evolve while preserving its ground state integrity as long as the adiabatic criteria remain unviolated [26]. This ansatz mirrors the structure observed in digital adiabatic quantum computing, reminiscent of the quantum-approximated optimization algorithm (QAOA), which seeks to identify optimal annealing schedules [27]. This naturally leads to the assumption that one can introduce counterdiabaticity in the design of ansatz to enhance the performance of VQAs, akin to the approach seen in adaptive derivative-assembled problem tailored (ADAPT) VQAs [28, 29]. This incorporation of counterdiabaticity aims to cancel induced energy excitation [30, 31], effectively serving as shortcuts to adiabaticity [32, 33]. Most of these terms, involving many-body interactions, are difficult or even impossible to directly realize in realistic quantum systems, due to their complexity. However, this limitation no longer exists in ansatz design due to gate decomposition. By incorporating counter-diabatic (CD) interactions into VQAs, one can significantly improve performance at the same energetic cost or gate numbers, as recently demonstrated through rigorous benchmarking [34]. These digitized counter-diabatic quantum algorithms (DCQAs) have successfully determined the ground state of simpler many-body models and have found application in interdisciplinary fields such as molecular docking [35] and protein folding [36], showcasing advantages over conventional AQAs [37]. In this article, we propose DCQAs to explore the ground state of the Fermi-Hubbard (FH) model on a honeycomb lattice. The extension beyond other lattice geometries introduces additional geometric complexity and distinctive electronic properties. Following the model description, we utilize DCQAs to solve for its ground state energy, and compare their performance against digital adiabatic algorithms aided by counterdiabaticity. Our results include a comprehensive analysis of Trotter error, adiabatic error, and ground state properties. Additionally, for larger system sizes, we simulate VQAs with up to 26 qubits, assessing the performance of both Hamiltonian variational ansatz and CD-inspired ansatz. Our results provide the possible feasibility of utilizing quantum computing in many-body physics and quantum materials research."
