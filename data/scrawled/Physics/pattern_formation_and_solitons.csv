https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10097v1,Analysis of multistability in discrete quantum droplets and bubbles,"This study investigates the existence and stability of localized states in the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) equation with quadratic and cubic nonlinearities, describing the so-called quantum droplets and bubbles. Those states exist within an interval known as the pinning region, as we vary a control parameter. Within the interval, multistable states are connected through multiple hysteresis, called homoclinic snaking. In particular, we explore its mechanism and consider two limiting cases of coupling strength: weak (anti-continuum) and strong (continuum) limits. We employ an asymptotic and a variational method for the weak and strong coupling limits, respectively, to capture the pinning region’s width. The width exhibits an algebraic and an exponentially small dependence on the coupling constant for the weak and strong coupling, respectively. This finding is supported by both analytical and numerical results, which show excellent agreement. We also consider the modulational instability of spatially uniform solutions. Our work sheds light on the intricate interplay between multistability and homoclinic snaking in discrete quantum systems, paving the way for further exploration of complex nonlinear phenomena in this context.","While one-dimensional solitons of the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation are robust localized wave packets and the ground state of the model [1], the corresponding multidimensional solitons, including fundamental and higher-order states with topological structures, are different. In this multidimensional setting, the common cubic self-attractive nonlinearity typically yields completely unstable solitons [2, 3]. This instability arises from the tendency for critical and supercritical collapse in the respective dimensions, leading to singular solutions via catastrophic wave collapse (self-compression) [4]. Therefore, a significant focus lies on developing physically relevant scenarios enabling stabilization of both fundamental and topologically structured multidimensional self-trapped localized modes as they would offer characteristics that would be inaccessible in the one-dimensional case, such as higher-dimensional self-trapped states with topological charge (intrinsic vorticity) [5]. A promising approach to address this challenge was recently proposed theoretically in [6], based on utilizing quantum fluctuations as a correction to the mean-field behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), which was initially forecasted by Lee, Huang, and Yang [7]. The proposal was subsequently realized experimentally in quantum droplets, magnetic quantum gases, and dipolar supersolids; see, e.g., the reviews [8, 9]. The Lee-Huang-Yang effect manifests through local quartic self-repulsive terms within the corresponding NLS equations in the mean-field approximation. A localized state that would typically collapse is now sustained by this interplay between mean field attraction and Lee-Huang-Yang repulsion, and one has a superfluid state characterized by a density constrained to remain below a specific maximum value, rendering it incompressible. Hence, this quantum macroscopic state is classified as a fluid and is referred to as “quantum droplets” [10]. In cigar-shaped and pancake-shaped BECs, which appear in a three-dimensional setting, each system can be effectively described by one-dimensional and two-dimensional NLS equations, respectively. Consequently, under tight confinement imposed by an external potential in one direction or more, one can change the form of the effective NLS equation and create lower-dimensional droplets. In the one-dimensional limit, the Lee-Huang-Yang term exhibits quadratic self-attraction instead of being quartic in the original three-dimensional setup [11]. Dynamics and characteristics of one-dimensional quantum droplets are studied in [12], whereby upon solving the associated amended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, the authors identified two physically distinct regimes that correspond to small droplets of a Gaussian-like shape and large puddles with a broad flat-top plateau. Furthermore, Zhou et al. [13] studied them in the presence of linear optical lattice, where they interestingly observed multi-stability and stability change between onsite and off-site solitons. It was later shown that the multi-stable droplets are connected in a multi-hysteresis fashion [14] and exist in a finite interval of band-gap. Kartashov and Zezyulin [15] also considered bright solitons in a linear optical lattice and showed enhanced mobility with alternating mobility and immobility bands related to soliton multistability. Additionally, Zhao et al. [16] considered when the lattice is deep, and the NLS equation effectively becomes a discrete model, demonstrating that multistability is also present. The multistability reported in [13, 14, 16] belongs to the phenomenon of pinning observed in many nonlinear dynamical systems with bistability of two or more uniform states (see, e.g., [17, 18] and references therein). In such systems, a front linking these states typically undergoes directional drift, depending on which state is preferred. However, there is no preference between the two states at a specific parameter value, resulting in a stationary front. This point is known as the Maxwell point, occurring when the two states have equal energy. Placing two fronts back-to-back creates a localized state, and the bifurcation diagram, plotting the length of this localized solution against a control parameter, exhibits a snaking structure. This structure involves a sequence of turning point bifurcations in near-perfect alignment over a range of parameter values around the Maxwell point, forming what is known as the pinning region. Since the spatial structure of such a localized state departs from and returns to a uniform state, this phenomenon is named homoclinic snaking [19]. The present paper aims to analyze homoclinic snaking and pinning regions of discrete quantum droplets. We also consider localized solutions called holes/dark notches/quantum bubbles. The main results of our report are the mechanism behind the snaking and the asymptotic width of the pinning region of the two solution kinds in two limiting cases, i.e., strong and weak coupling between the wave packets. The paper is structured as follows. We introduce the model for the dynamics of discrete quantum droplets in Section 2. We also analyze the uniform solutions of the model in the same section. We analyze the existence of localized states, i.e., discrete quantum droplets and quantum bubbles, in Section 3. The multistability of these states that form homoclinic snaking is also reported numerically in the section. We present our asymptotic analysis of the snaking in Section 4. Finally, we conclude our work in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10376v1,Soliton Dynamics over a Disordered Topography,"We report on the dynamics of a soliton propagating on the surface of a fluid in a 4-m-long canal with a random or periodic bottom topography. Using a full space-and-time resolved wavefield measurement, we evidence, for the first time experimentally, how the soliton is affected by the disorder, in the context of Anderson localization, and how localization depends on nonlinearity. For weak soliton amplitudes, the localization length is found in quantitative agreement with a linear shallow-water theory. For higher amplitudes, this spatial attenuation of the soliton amplitude is found to be enhanced. Behind the leading soliton slowed down by the topography, different experimentally unreported dynamics occur: Fission into backward and forward nondispersive pulses for the periodic case, and scattering into dispersive waves for the random case. Our findings open doors to potential applications regarding ocean coastal protection against large-amplitude waves.","References [1] W. H. Bragg and W. L.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10320v1,Ghost states underlying spatial and temporal patterns: how non-existing invariant solutions control nonlinear dynamics,"Close to a saddle-node bifurcation, when two invariant solutions collide and disappear, the behavior of a dynamical system can closely resemble that of a solution which is no longer present at the chosen parameter value. For bifurcating equilibria in low-dimensional ODEs, the influence of such ‘ghosts’ on the temporal behavior of the system, namely delayed transitions, has been studied previously. We consider spatio-temporal PDEs and characterize the phenomenon of ghosts by defining representative state-space structures, which we term ‘ghost states,’ as minima of appropriately chosen cost functions. Using recently developed variational methods, we can compute and parametrically continue ghost states of equilibria, periodic orbits, and other invariant solutions. We demonstrate the relevance of ghost states to the observed dynamics in various nonlinear systems including chaotic maps, the Lorenz ODE system, the spatio-temporally chaotic Kuramoto–Sivashinsky PDE, the buckling of an elastic arc, and 3D Rayleigh–Bénard convection.","Characterizing dynamical systems from a geometrical point of view provides a powerful approach to complex nonlinear systems, where obtaining analytical or closed-form solutions is typically impossible. In this approach, the state of the system at a given time is viewed as a ‘point,’ and its evolution is viewed as a ‘trajectory’ within an abstract, possibly very high-dimensional, and often formally infinite-dimensional state space. Instead of describing the behavior of individual solutions for given initial conditions, a geometrical approach characterizes the dynamics in terms of the topology of the ensemble of all these trajectories, known as the phase portrait of the system. The idea for such a geometrical approach was initiated in the late nineteenth century [1, 2], which later became a key element in the study of deterministic chaos [3]. Thanks to advances in computational resources and methods over the past three decades, this approach has been successfully transferred from low-dimensional dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to those governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The function space of a PDE is infinite-dimensional, which, in discretized form, results in finite but very high-dimensional problems. Examples of such PDE systems include fluid flows [4, 5] and nonlinear optics [6, 7], among others, where a geometrical approach has proven to be particularly useful. A geometrical approach aims first to characterize how general trajectories are organized within the state space of a dynamical system, and then to discover how this organization changes as the control parameters of the system are varied. The shape of the general trajectories is determined by special trajectories corresponding to dynamically invariant solutions with a simple dependence on time. The simplest of these invariant solutions include steady states, where the system does not evolve over time, and periodic orbits, where the state recurs exactly after a given period. These invariant solutions might be dynamically unstable and, thus, never realized naturally in a numerical simulation or a laboratory experiment. However, their local dynamics and the dynamical connections between them dictate the shape of the other trajectories. When the control parameters of a dynamical system are varied, a geometrical description is typically concerned with bifurcations. A bifurcation is the appearance of a topologically nonequivalent phase portrait at precise parameter values [8]. This topological change involves the appearance or disappearance of fixed points, periodic orbits, or more complex invariant sets, or changes in their stability properties. A bifurcation is local if its associated topological change can be detected within any small neighborhood of the invariant solution involved in the bifurcation; if this change cannot be identified within small neighborhoods of the invariant solution, then the bifurcation is global. Through a local bifurcation, the shape and dynamical properties of trajectories outside a small neighborhood around the involved invariant solution do not change immediately. Consequently, whenever two invariant solutions collide and annihilate in a saddle-node (fold) bifurcation, the properties of these solutions are still ‘felt’ by the dynamics even though the solutions are not present anymore. This phenomenon is called the ‘ghost’ of the saddle-node bifurcation [9]. When two fixed points collide in a saddle-node bifurcation, slow evolution emerges in the ghost region as the key remaining property of the disappeared equilibria. The ghost region attracts and slows down the flow of nearby trajectories, delaying their transition to another attracting region in the state space. As the control parameter approaches the bifurcation value, the time spent in the vicinity of the ghost (or, equivalently, the transition time needed for the system to pass the ghost and move to some other equilibrium state) increases and diverges in a predictable manner. The scaling of the transition time with the distance from the bifurcation point in the parameter space has been extensively studied before [10, 11, 12]. Some authors [11, 13], particularly in quantum mechanics [14, 15], interpret ghosts by extending the real-valued state space of the dynamics to the space of complex-valued state variables. In this picture, two fixed points in the real-valued subspace collide and disappear from that subspace, giving rise to two repelling fixed points outside the real-valued subspace. The effect of these complex-valued repellers on the real-valued subspace, i.e., the original state space of the system, is what we identify as the ghost phenomenon. Such an approach, however, does not generalize to very complicated systems such as PDEs. Ghosts of equilibrium solutions have been investigated across a variety of applications. These include electronic circuits [16], population dynamics and catalytic hypercycles of biochemical reactions [17], the buckling of elastic solid structures [18], and understanding and predicting financial crises [19, 20], to name a few. Ghosts of equilibria play a significant role in so-called critical transitions: when the control parameter of a system, which is at a stable equilibrium state, is changed slowly toward and then beyond a critical value, where the equilibrium solution disappears through a saddle-node bifurcation or loses stability through other bifurcations, the system transitions to a new attracting region of the state space. In the case of a saddle-node bifurcation, the transition time is controlled by the ghost. This phenomenon is known as a critical transition, and the critical threshold is often referred to as the tipping point. The significance of a critical transition is that the new equilibrium state may be undesirable while, due to strong hysteresis, the transition cannot be reversed immediately by returning to a parameter value for which the desirable equilibrium exists again [21, 22]. Recently, Calsina et al. [23] considered a one-dimensional (1D) PDE model for a spatially extended population dynamics. They studied how the strength of the diffusion term in their model affects the delayed transition times to extinction. The transition time is governed by the ghost, as the parameter value is chosen close to a saddle-node bifurcation through which two other equilibria disappear and leave the uniform zero as the only attracting solution. However, the majority of previous research has investigated simple ODE systems. In this work, we formalize the ghost phenomenon by defining representative state-space structures without the necessity of being asymptotically close to the saddle-node bifurcation point in the parameter space. We term these representative structures the ‘ghost states.’ Characterizing the ghost phenomenon in terms of the representative ghost states enables us to follow three main objectives that have not been fully addressed previously. First, unlike previous works that study the ghost phenomenon as the system approaches the bifurcation point in the parameter space, we are interested in this phenomenon as the system moves away from it, so that less time is expected to be spent in the ghost region. The ghost states enable us to investigate how the ghost region evolves and whether it remains relevant to the dynamics as the control parameter is varied further from the bifurcation value. Secondly, we are interested in the ghost phenomenon in spatially extended dynamical systems governed by PDEs, such as fluid flows. We aim to explore the relevance of ghosts to both the spatial and temporal properties of the dynamics, rather than solely the temporal characteristics of delayed transitions, which have been the primary focus of previous studies. If the numerical computation of the ghost states can be scaled to high-dimensional problems, as will be demonstrated, the proposed characterization of the ghost phenomenon can be applied to high-dimensional discretizations of PDEs as well as low-dimensional ODEs. Finally, in addition to equilibrium solutions, we are interested in the ghosts resulting from the saddle-node bifurcation of time-varying invariant solutions, which has not been explored previously. We propose a family of methods that, based on a single unifying idea, defines and computes the ghost states for different types of invariant solutions. This enables us to pursue the previous two objectives for the ghosts of invariant solutions of various types. Specifically, we study the ghosts of periodic orbits as well as equilibria in the present work. We define the ghost state in the space of all sets that have the same topological structure as the invariant solutions involved in the saddle-node bifurcation. For the ghosts of equilibria and periodic orbits, this space includes all points and all loops in the state space, respectively. Within the respective search space, we formulate invariant solutions as the global minima (zeros) of a suitably defined non-negative cost function. Following this formulation, we define the ghost states as the non-zero minima of the cost function, which lift from zero as soon as the control parameter passes the bifurcation value. As the control parameter approaches the bifurcation value, the minimum value of the cost function decreases to zero, and the ghost state becomes the invariant solution itself, by construction and as expected. We demonstrate that as the control parameter is varied further from the bifurcation value, the ghost state captures the essential properties of the ghost phenomenon. Defined as such, the ghost of an equilibrium solution represents the locally slowest point in the state space at the chosen parameter value, and the ghost of a periodic orbit represents the best-fit loop to the vector field induced by the governing equations. A recently developed family of variational methods [24, 25, 26, 27] enables us to apply this approach to high-dimensional dynamical systems, including discretizations of PDEs. However, the cost functions whose minima represent the ghost states are not uniquely defined. Therefore, the ghost states are not purely a property of the dynamical system, and their exact properties depend on the specific choice of the cost function. Nevertheless, we will see that the ghost states defined based on different cost functions consistently capture the characteristics of the ghost phenomenon, providing important insight into the dynamics of a system. One particular application of ghosts is to intermittent chaos. In some instances (the type-1 transition of Pomeau and Manneville [28]), intermittent chaos is preceded by the saddle-node bifurcation of a periodic orbit. The trajectories of the subsequent chaotic attractor intermittently visit the region of the state space where the solutions formerly existed—the ghost of the bifurcation. We compute the ghost of such a periodic orbit in the Lorenz system. We demonstrate that, compared to the periodic orbit at the bifurcation point, the ghost state provides a better match with the regions of the state space frequently visited by the intermittent chaos at the studied parameter value. This paper proceeds as follows: in Sec. II, we present the mathematical background of ghosts. Section III details the general principles of the family of methods we have developed. In Sec. IV, we present several examples of applying our methods to problems of various complexities, to show the power but also the pitfalls of our methods. In Sec. V, we apply our methods to the three-dimensional (3D) Rayleigh–Bénard convection problem. We give concluding remarks in Sec. VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08787v1,Stability analysis of breathers for coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations,We investigate the spectral stability of non-degenerate vector soliton solutions and the nonlinear stability of breather solutions for the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) equations. The non-degenerate vector solitons are spectrally stable despite the linearized operator admits either embedded or isolated eigenvalues of negative Krein signature. The nonlinear stability of breathers is obtained by the Lyapunov method with the help of the squared eigenfunctions due to integrability of the CNLS equations.,"1 Introduction In this work, we study the spectral stability of the non-degenerate vector soliton solutions and the nonlinear stability of breather solutions in the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) equations [8, 39, 50] on the real line (also known as Manakov system): \begin{split}{\rm i}q_{1,t}+\frac{1}{2}q_{1,xx}+(|q_{1}|^{2}+|q_{2}|^{2})q_{1}% &=0,\\ {\rm i}q_{2,t}+\frac{1}{2}q_{2,xx}+(|q_{1}|^{2}+|q_{2}|^{2})q_{2}&=0,\end{split} (1) where (q_{1},q_{2})=(q_{1}(x,t),q_{2}(x,t)) are complex-valued functions and (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}. The initial-value problem for the CNLS equations (1) is globally well-posed in Sobolev space H^{k}(\mathbb{R}) for k\in\mathbb{N}, see [11]. The CNLS equations (1) have important applications in Bose-Einstein condensates [47] and birefringent fibers [2]. The nonlinear terms in CNLS equations (1) couple two components to describe self-phase and cross-phase modulation phenomenon. As an extension of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS), the CNLS equations (1) can be used to study the dynamics of vector solitons [1]. As an example of integrable equations, the CNLS equations (1) admit Lax pair [39, 56], bi-Hamiltonian structure [60], and an infinite set of conservation laws [60]. The Lax representation is a powerful tool to analyze the properties of equations. The Lax pair for CNLS equations (1) is \begin{split}\mathbf{\Phi}_{x}(\lambda;x,t)=\mathbf{U}(\lambda,\mathbf{q})% \mathbf{\Phi}(\lambda;x,t),\quad\mathbf{\Phi}_{t}(\lambda;x,t)=\mathbf{V}(% \lambda,\mathbf{q})\mathbf{\Phi}(\lambda;x,t)\end{split} (2) where \mathbf{U}(\lambda;x,t)={\rm i}\lambda\sigma_{3}+{\rm i}\mathbf{Q},\quad% \mathbf{V}(\lambda;x,t)={\rm i}\lambda^{2}\sigma_{3}+{\rm i}\lambda\mathbf{Q}-% \frac{1}{2}({\rm i}\sigma_{3}\mathbf{Q}^{2}-\sigma_{3}\mathbf{Q}_{x}), (3) with \displaystyle\mathbf{Q}(x,t)=\begin{pmatrix}0&\mathbf{r}^{T}\\ \mathbf{q}&0\end{pmatrix},\,\,\,\,\sigma_{3}=\mathrm{diag}(1,-1,-1),\quad% \mathbf{q}=(q_{1},q_{2})^{T},\quad\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{q}^{*}, and the complex spectral parameter \lambda. The CNLS equations (1) have the zero curvature representation \mathbf{U}_{t}-\mathbf{V}_{x}+[\mathbf{U},\mathbf{V}]=0, where [\mathbf{U},\mathbf{V}]\equiv\mathbf{U}\mathbf{V}-\mathbf{V}\mathbf{U} is the commutator. The Lax pair (2)–(3) can be derived from the 3\times 3 system [1, 60]. The infinite set of conservation laws can be obtained by trace formula in the inverse scattering transform for integrable equations with Hamiltonian structure [15, 30]. In particular, we will use the following conserved quantities of the CNLS equations (1): \displaystyle H_{0}(\mathbf{q}) \displaystyle=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left|\mathbf{q}\right|^{2}\mathrm{d% }x, (4) \displaystyle H_{1}(\mathbf{q}) \displaystyle=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}{\rm i}\mathbf{q}^{\dagger}\mathbf{q% }_{x}\mathrm{d}x, (5) \displaystyle H_{2}(\mathbf{q}) \displaystyle=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left(|\mathbf{q}_{x}|^{2}-\left|% \mathbf{q}\right|^{4}\right)\mathrm{d}x, (6) \displaystyle H_{3}(\mathbf{q}) \displaystyle=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}{\rm i}\left(\mathbf{q}_{x}^{\dagger% }\mathbf{q}_{xx}+3|\mathbf{q}|^{2}\mathbf{q}^{\dagger}_{x}\mathbf{q}\right)% \mathrm{d}x, (7) \displaystyle H_{4}(\mathbf{q}) \displaystyle=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left(|\mathbf{q}_{xx}|^{2}-4\left|% \mathbf{q}^{\dagger}\mathbf{q}_{x}\right|^{2}-\left(\mathbf{q}^{\dagger}% \mathbf{q}_{x}\right)^{2}-\left(\mathbf{q}_{x}^{\dagger}\mathbf{q}\right)^{2}-% 4\left|\mathbf{q}\right|^{2}\left|\mathbf{q}_{x}\right|^{2}+2\left|\mathbf{q}% \right|^{6}\right)\mathrm{d}x. (8) We note that H_{0}(\mathbf{q})=H_{0}^{(1)}(q_{1})+H_{0}^{(2)}(q_{2}), where H_{0}^{(j)}(q_{j})=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}|q_{j}|^{2}\mathrm{d}x, j=1,2 are independent conserved quantities. Another relevant observation is that the values of H_{1}(\mathbf{q}) and H_{3}(\mathbf{q}) are real due to integration by parts. Various solutions to the CNLS equations (1) have been derived through different methods. The degenerate vector solitons with the single-humped profiles were initially obtained through the inverse scattering method [39]. Bright and dark solitons had been discovered using Hirota bilinear method [48, 52]. The non-degenerate vector solitons with the double-humped profiles were derived by using the Hirota bilinear method in [53]. The asymptotic behavior and collision dynamics of non-degenerate solitons have been investigated in [49]. Furthermore, the Darboux transformation can be used to construct non-degenerate vector solitons and breather solutions [37, 47]. This paper focuses on investigating the stability of non-degenerate vector soliton and breather solutions from [47] in the time evolution of the CNLS equations (1). The stability analysis is a fundamental problem of mathematical physics, which is particularly important for applications of solitons and breathers in physics. 1.1 Review on stability results for CNLS equations The history of the nonlinear stability of solitary waves takes place from the first study on the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation by using the Lyapunov method in [7]. Regarding the NLS equation, nonlinear stability of ground states was obtained by utilizing concentration compactness principle in [10, 12] and [58]. Furthermore, the Lyapunov method was extended to a general class of Hamiltonian nonlinear evolution equations in [21, 22], with more results concerning the spectral stability in [20]. The Lyapunov method incorporates coercivity of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional in the proof of nonlinear stability of the orbit of solitary waves. This approach has been used in many works, see recent papers in [6, 29, 31, 32]. For the particular case of the CNLS equations (1) and their nonintegrable extensions, spectral stability of degenerate vector solitons with the single-humped profiles was obtained in [40]. The proofs of their nonlinear stability and instability was developed in [34, 35]. Variational characterizations of such vector solitons was developed in [43, 13, 41, 42]. The stability analysis of more general vector solitons which include multi-humped profiles in one component and the single-humped profiles in another component was developed in [45, 46]. Finally, bifurcations and stability of such vector solitons was developed recently in [59]. A difficulty in the nonlinear stability analysis of solitary waves with the multi-humped profiles by using the Lyapunov method arises due to a high number of negative eigenvalues of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional and a low number of symmetries that characterize its kernel [27]. In this work, we consider the double-humped profiles of the nondegenerate vector solitons and breather profiles and use integrability of the CNLS equations (1) to obtain the squared eigenfunctions of the Lax pair, see [14, 55]. The squared eigenfunctions satisfy the linearized operators which solve the spectral stability problem and contribute to the nonlinear stability analysis. The closure relation [19, 61, 28] provides tools to prove the completeness of squared eigenfunctions in the spectrum of the linearized operator and to compute the inner product between the squared eigenfunctions and adjoint squared eigenfunctions. It also allows us to relate the spectrum of the linearized operator with the spectrum of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional [26, 45, 23]. For the nonlinear stability analysis, we also use an additional tool that exists due to integrability of the CNLS equations (1). The same non-degenerate vector solitons can be characterized variationally with several Lyapunov functions due to the existence of the higher-order conserved quantities. This tool was pioneered in the proof of nonlinear stability of multi-solitons in [25, 38] and applied to studies of nonlinear stability of breathers in [4, 5], Dirac solitons in [44], and periodic waves and black solitons in [17, 18]. Further results on the linear and nonlinear stability of multi-solitons were found recently in [33, 57]. This approach is also useful to characterize linear transverse stability of solitary and periodic waves even if the higher-order conserved quantities do not form coercive Lyapunov functionals, see [24]. Here we will extend this tool to the CNLS equations (1). 1.2 Main result Recall the Galilean transformation for CNLS equations (1) given by T(a)\mathbf{q}(x,t)={\rm e}^{-2{\rm i}a(x+at)}\mathbf{q}(x+2at,t). (9) If \mathbf{q} is a solution of (1), so is T(a)\mathbf{q} for any a\in\mathbb{R}. Without loss of generality, one can consider the standing waves with zero speed and obtain traveling waves with nonzero speed by using (9). Consequently, we will consider the non-degenerate vector solitons in the form of the standing waves: \mathbf{q}(x,t)=\begin{pmatrix}{\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{1}^{2}t}&0\\ 0&{\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{2}^{2}t}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}u_{1}(x)\\ u_{2}(x)\end{pmatrix}, (10) where u_{1}(x),u_{2}(x):\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{C} represent spatial profiles of the two components with parameters b_{1},b_{2}>0 satisfying b_{1}\neq b_{2}. Without loss of generality, we assume 0<b_{2}<b_{1}. The exact expression for the non-degenerate vector solitons exist in the form, see [47], \displaystyle u_{1}(x;b_{1},b_{2},c_{11},c_{22}) \displaystyle=\frac{4b_{1}c_{11}}{M_{non}(x)}\left(|c_{22}|^{2}{\rm e}^{2b_{2}% x}+\frac{b_{1}-b_{2}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}{\rm e}^{-2b_{2}x}\right), (11) \displaystyle u_{2}(x;b_{1},b_{2},c_{11},c_{22}) \displaystyle=\frac{4b_{2}c_{22}}{M_{non}(x)}\left(|c_{11}|^{2}{\rm e}^{2b_{1}% x}+\frac{b_{2}-b_{1}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}{\rm e}^{-2b_{1}x}\right), (12) where M_{non}(x)=\frac{(b_{1}-b_{2})^{2}}{(b_{1}+b_{2})^{2}}{\rm e}^{-2(b_{1}+b_{2})% x}+|c_{11}|^{2}{\rm e}^{2(b_{1}-b_{2})x}+|c_{22}|^{2}{\rm e}^{-2(b_{1}-b_{2})x% }+|c_{11}c_{22}|^{2}{\rm e}^{2(b_{1}+b_{2})x} and c_{11},c_{22}\in\mathbb{C} are arbitrary parameters. The CNLS equations (1) are invariant under the four-parameter group of translations: S(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},x_{0},t_{0})\mathbf{q}(x,t)=\begin{pmatrix}{\rm e}^{{% \rm i}\theta_{1}}&0\\ 0&{\rm e}^{{\rm i}\theta_{2}}\end{pmatrix}\mathbf{q}(x+x_{0},t+t_{0}). (13) If \mathbf{q} is a solution of (1), so is S(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},x_{0},t_{0})\mathbf{q} for any \theta_{1},\theta_{2},x_{0},t_{0}\in\mathbb{R}. Without loss of generality, one can take c_{11}, c_{22} as real parameters by defining \theta_{1} and \theta_{2} in the transformation (13). Furthermore, if we parameterize c_{ii}=\sqrt{\frac{b_{1}-b_{2}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}}{\rm e}^{-2b_{i}\tau_{i}},\quad% \tau_{i}\in\mathbb{R}, the non-degenerate vector solitons in the form (15) reduce to the equivalent form found in [3, 54]: \begin{split}u_{1}=\frac{2b_{1}\sqrt{b_{1}^{2}-b_{2}^{2}}\ \mathrm{cosh}(2b_{2% }(x-\tau_{2}))}{b_{1}\mathrm{cosh}(2b_{1}(x-\tau_{1}))\mathrm{cosh}(2b_{2}(x-% \tau_{2}))-b_{2}\mathrm{sinh}(2b_{1}(x-\tau_{1}))\mathrm{sinh}(2b_{2}(x-\tau_{% 2}))},\\ u_{2}=\frac{2b_{2}\sqrt{b_{1}^{2}-b_{2}^{2}}\ \mathrm{sinh}(2b_{1}(x-\tau_{1})% )}{b_{1}\mathrm{cosh}(2b_{1}(x-\tau_{1}))\mathrm{cosh}(2b_{2}(x-\tau_{2}))-b_{% 2}\mathrm{sinh}(2b_{1}(x-\tau_{1}))\mathrm{sinh}(2b_{2}(x-\tau_{2}))}.\end{split} Only one parameter from \tau_{1}, \tau_{2} can be set to zero by the translational symmetry (13), the other parameter determines the profile of the non-degenerate vector soliton. The spatial profile of u_{1} is positive, whereas the spatial profile of u_{2} has a single zero at x=\tau_{1}. Figure 1 displays profiles |u_{1}| and |u_{2}| of some non-degenerate vector soliton solutions. The positive profile u_{1} can be either single-humped or double-humped. The single-zero profile u_{2} is always a superposition of two solitons of opposite polarity, hence |u_{2}| is always double-humped. Figure 1. Examples of the non-degenerate vector soliton solutions (11)–(12) with (a) b_{1}=2, b_{2}=2.002, c_{11}=c_{22}=1, (b) b_{1}=2, b_{2}=2.2, c_{11}=c_{22}=1, and (c) b_{1}=3, b_{2}=1, c_{11}=c_{22}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}. The solid blue line represents |u_{1}|, while the dashed red line represents |u_{2}|. Remark 1. The CNLS equations (1) are also invariant under the two-parameter group of rotations: R(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2})\mathbf{q}(x,t)=\begin{pmatrix}\cos(\alpha_{1})&\sin(% \alpha_{1})\\ -\sin(\alpha_{1})&\cos(\alpha_{1})\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\cos(\alpha_{2})% &{\rm i}\sin(\alpha_{2})\\ {\rm i}\sin(\alpha_{2})&\cos(\alpha_{2})\end{pmatrix}\mathbf{q}(x,t). (14) If \mathbf{q} is a solution of (1), so is R(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2})\mathbf{q} for any \alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}\in\mathbb{R}. The non-degenerate vector solitons (10) are written in the form with zero rotational parameters \alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}. For notational clarity, we define \mathbf{q}^{[2]}_{non}(x,t;a,b_{1},b_{2};c_{11},c_{22}):=T(a)\begin{pmatrix}{% \rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{1}^{2}t}u_{1}(x;b_{1},b_{2},c_{11},c_{22})\\ {\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{2}^{2}t}u_{2}(x;b_{1},b_{2},c_{11},c_{22})\end{pmatrix}, (15) where T(a) is given by (9) and the spatial profiles are given by (11) and (12). The spectral stability of the standing waves (10) is examined by considering the perturbative solution in the separable form \mathbf{q}=\mathbf{q}^{[2]}_{non}+\varepsilon T(a)\begin{pmatrix}{\rm e}^{2{% \rm i}b_{1}^{2}t}&0\\ 0&{\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{2}^{2}t}\end{pmatrix}\left(\mathbf{p}_{1}(x){\rm e}^{% \Omega t}+\mathbf{p}_{2}^{*}(x){\rm e}^{\Omega^{*}t}\right) (16) where \varepsilon is a small perturbation, \mathbf{p}_{1},\mathbf{p}_{2}\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}), and \Omega\in\mathbb{C}. Substituting (16) into (1) and linearizing at the order of \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon) yields the spectral problem for the linearized operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1}\mathbf{P}=\Omega\mathbf{P}, (17) where \mathbf{P}:=(\mathbf{p}_{1}^{T},\mathbf{p}_{2}^{T})^{T} and the expressions for \mathcal{J} and \mathcal{L}_{1} can be found in Section 3. In Hilbert space L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}), \mathcal{J} is skew-adjoint and \mathcal{L}_{1} is self-adjoint. The self-adjoint operator \mathcal{L}_{1} is related to the first variational characterization of the non-degenerate vector solitons \mathcal{I}_{1}:=H_{2}-4aH_{1}+4(a^{2}+b_{1}^{2})H_{0}^{(1)}+4(a^{2}+b_{2}^{2}% )H_{0}^{(2)}, (18) where H_{0}=H_{0}^{(1)}+H_{0}^{(2)}, H_{1}, and H_{2} are given by (4), (5), and (6). Euler–Lagrange equations for \mathcal{I}_{1} with fixed parameters a\in\mathbb{R}, b_{1},b_{2}>0 are given by \begin{split}2{\rm i}aq_{1,x}+\frac{1}{2}q_{1,xx}+(|q_{1}|^{2}+|q_{2}|^{2})q_{% 1}&=2(a^{2}+b_{1}^{2})q_{1},\\ 2{\rm i}aq_{2,x}+\frac{1}{2}q_{2,xx}+(|q_{1}|^{2}+|q_{2}|^{2})q_{2}&=2(a^{2}+b% _{2}^{2})q_{2},\end{split} (19) which are satisfied by \mathbf{q}=\mathbf{q}^{[2]}_{non}(\cdot,t;a,b_{1},b_{2};c_{11},c_{22}) for every t\in\mathbb{R}, c_{11},c_{22}\in\mathbb{C}. Adding a perturbation \mathbf{p} to \mathbf{q}^{[2]}_{non} in \mathcal{I}_{1} and expanding it near \mathbf{q}^{[2]}_{non} yields \mathcal{I}_{1}(\mathbf{q}^{[2]}_{non}+\mathbf{p})=\mathcal{I}_{1}(\mathbf{q}^% {[2]}_{non})+(\mathcal{L}_{1}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P})+\mathcal{O}(\|\mathbf{p}\|% _{H^{1}}^{3}), (20) with the same self-adjoint operator \mathcal{L}_{1} in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}) and with \mathbf{P}:=(\mathbf{p}^{T},\mathbf{p}^{\dagger})^{T}. The method of squared eigenfunctions allows us to construct all solutions of the spectral problem (17). Denote the stability spectrum \sigma_{s}(\mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1})=\{\Omega\in\mathbb{C}:\quad\mathbf{P}% \in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4})\}. The following theorem gives the spectral stability of the non-degenerate vector solitons by using the squared eigenfunctions. Theorem 1. The non-degenerate vector solitons \mathbf{q}_{non}^{[2]} for the CNLS equations (1) are spectrally stable, as indicated by \sigma_{s}(\mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1})\subset{\rm i}\mathbb{R}. If \frac{b_{1}}{b_{2}}\leq\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} or \frac{b_{1}}{b_{2}}\geq\sqrt{2}, there exist embedded eigenvalues of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1} that are limit points of the essential spectrum of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1}. For \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}<\frac{b_{1}}{b_{2}}<\sqrt{2}, the closure of the essential spectrum has no intersection with the point spectrum. Remark 2. The result of Theorem 1 agrees with the theory based on the dimension of the negative subspace \mathcal{N}_{1}:=\{\mathbf{P}\in H^{1}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}):\quad(% \mathcal{L}_{1}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P})<0\}, see [46, Section 3]. Eigenfunctions for embedded eigenvalues were found explicitly, see equation (36) in [46], and these eigenfunctions attain the negative values of (\mathcal{L}_{1}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P}). If \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}<\frac{b_{1}}{b_{2}}<\sqrt{2}, the same eigenvalues with negative values of (\mathcal{L}_{1}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P}) are isolated from the essential spectrum of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1}. Such eigenvalues on i\mathbb{R} with negative values of (\mathcal{L}_{1}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P}) are referred to as eigenvalues of negative Krein signature. It is natural to ask whether the non-degenerate vector solitons remain stable under nonlinear perturbation in H^{1}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}). However, the nonlinear orbital stability theory from [21, 22] does not hold for such vector solitons with multi-humped profiles because the negative subspace of \mathcal{N}_{1} restricted at the tangent space of fixed H_{0}^{(1)}, H_{0}^{(2)}, and H_{1} is two-dimensional, see equation (41) in [46]. As a result, we provide a second variational characterization of the non-degenerate vector solitons by using the higher-order conserved quantities H_{3} and H_{4} in (6) and (7). However, the second characterization does not distinguish between the non-degenerate vector solitons and the breather solutions, to which they are particular cases [51]. The nonlinear orbit of the breather solutions is constructed by using the scattering parameters in the Darboux transformation as in the following definition. Definition 1. Fix the scattering parameters (c_{11},c_{21},c_{12},c_{22})\in\mathbb{C}^{4} and the spectral parameters a\in\mathbb{R}, b_{1},b_{2}>0 such that b_{1}\neq b_{2}. The breather solutions of CNLS equations (1) are given by \mathbf{q}^{[2]}(x,t;a,b_{1},b_{2};c_{11},c_{22},c_{12},c_{21}):=4T(a)\frac{N(% x,t)}{M(x,t)}, (21) where \displaystyle N(x,t) \displaystyle:=\left[{\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{1}^{2}t}b_{1}\left(|\mathbf{c}_{2}|^{% 2}{\rm e}^{2b_{2}x}+\frac{b_{1}-b_{2}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}{\rm e}^{-2b_{2}x}\right)-{% \rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{2}^{2}t}\frac{2b_{1}b_{2}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}\mathbf{c}_{1}^{{% \dagger}}\mathbf{c}_{2}{\rm e}^{2b_{1}x}\right]\mathbf{c}_{1} \displaystyle\qquad+\left[{\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{2}^{2}t}b_{2}\left(|\mathbf{c}_{% 1}|^{2}{\rm e}^{2b_{1}x}+\frac{b_{2}-b_{1}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}{\rm e}^{-2b_{1}x}% \right)-{\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{1}^{2}t}\frac{2b_{1}b_{2}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}\mathbf{c}_% {2}^{{\dagger}}\mathbf{c}_{1}{\rm e}^{2b_{2}x}\right]\mathbf{c}_{2}, and \displaystyle M(x,t) \displaystyle:=\frac{(b_{1}-b_{2})^{2}}{(b_{1}+b_{2})^{2}}{\rm e}^{-2(b_{1}+b_% {2})x}+|\mathbf{c}_{1}|^{2}{\rm e}^{2(b_{1}-b_{2})x}+|\mathbf{c}_{2}|^{2}{\rm e% }^{-2(b_{1}-b_{2})x} \displaystyle\qquad+\left(|\mathbf{c}_{1}|^{2}|\mathbf{c}_{2}|^{2}-\frac{4b_{1% }b_{2}}{(b_{1}+b_{2})^{2}}\mathbf{c}_{1}^{\dagger}\mathbf{c}_{2}\mathbf{c}_{2}% ^{\dagger}\mathbf{c}_{1}\right){\rm e}^{2(b_{1}+b_{2})x}-\frac{8b_{1}b_{2}}{(b% _{1}+b_{2})^{2}}\mathrm{Re}\left(\mathbf{c}_{1}^{{\dagger}}\mathbf{c}_{2}{\rm e% }^{2{\rm i}(-b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2})t}\right), for \mathbf{c}_{i}=(c_{1i},c_{2i})^{T}, i=1,2. Non-degenerate vector soliton solutions (15) are given by the breather solutions (21) with c_{12}=c_{21}=0. Figure 2. Examples of the breather solutions (21) with a=0, b_{1}=3, b_{2}=1, c_{11}=c_{22}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, and (a1, a2) c_{12}=c_{21}=0, (b1, b2) c_{12}=c_{21}=0.1, (c1, c2) c_{12}=c_{21}=0.5, (d1, d2) c_{12}=0.5, c_{21}=1. Top (bottom) panels show the norm of the first (second) component. Examples of the profiles of breather solutions of Definition 1 are shown in Figure 2. Panels (a1,a2) display the time-independent dynamics of a non-degenerate vector soliton since c_{12}=c_{21}=0, where other panels display the time-periodic dynamics of the breather solutions with different nonzero values of c_{12}, c_{21}. The following theorem presents the main result of this paper on the nonlinear stability of the breather solutions of Definition 1. Theorem 2. The breather solutions (21) are nonlinearly stable in the following sense. For any initial condition \mathbf{u}_{0}\in H^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}), denote the global solution of the CNLS equations (1) by \mathbf{u}. Given any positive constant \epsilon>0, there exist \delta>0 such that if \|\mathbf{u}_{0}-\mathbf{q}^{[2]}(\cdot,0;a,b_{1},b_{2};c_{11}(0),c_{22}(0),c_% {12}(0),c_{21}(0))\|_{H^{2}}<\delta, for some breather solutions \mathbf{q}^{[2]} with parameters a\in\mathbb{R}, b_{1},b_{2}>0 such that b_{1}\neq b_{2}, and c_{ij}(0)\in\mathbb{C}, 1\leq i,j\leq 2, then there exist c_{ij}(t)\in C^{1}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}),1\leq i,j\leq 2 such that \|\mathbf{u}(\cdot,t)-\mathbf{q}^{[2]}(\cdot,t;a,b_{1},b_{2};c_{11}(t),c_{22}(% t),c_{12}(t),c_{21}(t))\|_{H^{2}}<\epsilon for any t\in\mathbb{R}. The rate of change of c_{ij}(t) are controlled by \sum_{i,j}|\partial_{t}c_{ij}(t)|\leq C\epsilon (22) for all t\in\mathbb{R} and some constant C. Remark 3. Compared to the standard applications of the Lyapunov method, it is not sufficient to use the translation and phase symmetries (13) of the CNLS equations (1), as well as the rotational symmetry (14), for the proof of the nonlinear stability of the non-degenerate vector solitons because the second variation of the corresponding Lyapunov functional is not coercive in the tangent plane related to these symmetries. The choice of the scattering parameters c_{11},c_{22},c_{12},c_{21}, which can be viewed as generalizations of symmetries in the Darboux transformation [31], addresses this issue. When the four complex-valued scattering parameters are perturbed, the non-degenerate vector solitons are not only translated according to the symmetries (13) and (14) but also transform into more general breather solutions. Therefore, it is natural to consider the nonlinear stability of the set of breather solutions. Evidences that breather solutions rather than the non-degenerate vector solitons are more appropriate objects in the construction of the nonlinearly stable orbits can be seen from various soliton interaction scenarios in a related complex short-pulse equation [9, 16]. 1.3 Main steps of the proof The CNLS equations (1) are given by the second flow of the Hamiltonian equations \mathbf{q}_{t}=\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{J}\frac{\delta H_{2}}{\delta\mathbf{q}}, (23) where \mathcal{J}=-{\rm i} is a skew-adjoint operator. The Hamiltonian formulation (23) is used in the construction of the first variational characterization of the non-degenerate vector solitons, as in (18). However, since this is not sufficient for the proof of their nonlinear stability, we proceed with the second variational characterization, which extends to the entire family of breather solutions of Definition 1. We define the following Lyapunov functional \displaystyle\mathcal{I}_{2} \displaystyle:=H_{4}-8aH_{3}+4(6a^{2}+b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2})H_{2}-16a(2a^{2}+b_{% 1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2})H_{1} \displaystyle\qquad+16(a^{2}+b_{1}^{2})(a^{2}+b_{2}^{2})H_{0}. (24) We show in Appendix A from the trace formula that \mathbf{q}^{[2]}(x,t;a,b_{1},b_{2};c_{11},c_{22},c_{12},c_{21}) is a critical point of \mathcal{I}_{2}. For the solution \mathbf{u}=\mathbf{u}(x,t) in Theorem 2, the continuity and conservation of the Lyapunov functional lead to \mathcal{I}_{2}(\mathbf{u}(\cdot,t))-\mathcal{I}_{2}(\mathbf{q}^{[2]}(\cdot,t)% )=\mathcal{I}_{2}(\mathbf{u}_{0})-\mathcal{I}_{2}(\mathbf{q}^{[2]}(\cdot,0))% \leq C\|\mathbf{u}_{0}-\mathbf{q}^{[2]}(\cdot,0)\|_{H^{2}}, for some C>0. On the other hand, for the perturbation \mathbf{p} added to \mathbf{q}^{[2]}, we can expand \mathcal{I}_{2} near \mathbf{q}^{[2]} and obtain \mathcal{I}_{2}(\mathbf{q}^{[2]}+\mathbf{p})=\mathcal{I}_{2}(\mathbf{q}^{[2]})% +\langle\mathcal{L}_{2}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P}\rangle_{L^{2}}+\mathcal{O}(\|% \mathbf{p}\|_{H^{2}}^{3}), (25) defined by a self-adjoint operator \mathcal{L}_{2} in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}) acting on \mathbf{P}:=(\mathbf{p}^{T},\mathbf{p}^{\dagger})^{T}. If \mathcal{L}_{2} were coercive in H^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}), then we could obtain the stability of the non-degenerate vector solitons. However, this is not the case. The self-adjoint operator \mathcal{L}_{2} admits a nontrivial kernel of dimension eight and a negative subspace of dimension two. Introducing the nonlinear orbit is a method to overcome this difficulty and obtain coercivity at the tangent plane defined by appropriate orthogonality conditions. To characterize the spectrum of \mathcal{L}_{2}, it suffices to study eigenfunctions of the operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2}. Using the higher flow in Hamiltonian equations, the spectrum of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2} can be determined by the method of squared eigenfunctions. The closure relation can then be used to calculate the inner product (\mathcal{L}_{2}\cdot,\cdot) through these squared eigenfunctions. This approach allows us to determine the number of negative eigenvalues and the kernel of \mathcal{L}_{2}. The spectrum of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2} is very similar to the spectrum of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1} in Theorem 1 but includes no additional eigenvalues on i\mathbb{R} (neither isolated nor embedded), see Theorem 3 in Section 4. Similarly, the spectrum of \mathcal{L}_{2} contains two negative eigenvalues, see Theorem 4, compared to the spectrum of \mathcal{L}_{1} which contains four negative eigenvalues, see Remark 9. The main difficulty in the proof of nonlinear stability of breather solutions lies in evaluating the inner product (\mathcal{L}_{2}\cdot,\cdot) on the subspace \mathrm{gKer}(\mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2})\backslash\mathrm{Ker}(\mathcal{J}% \mathcal{L}_{2}) in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}), which corresponds to the zero eigenvalue of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2} with high algebraic multiplicity. By defining the skew-symmetric differential form \omega(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{f})=(\mathbf{h}^{\dagger}\mathcal{J}\mathbf{f})% \mathrm{d}x,\quad\mathbf{f}\in\mathrm{Ker}(\mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2}),\,\,% \mathbf{h}\in\mathrm{gKer}(\mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2})\backslash\mathrm{Ker}(% \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2}) (26) and transforming the inner product (\mathcal{L}_{2}\cdot,\cdot) to the integral of the differential form \omega(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{f}), we transform the corresponding inner product (\mathcal{L}_{2}\cdot,\cdot) into the inner product between squared eigenfunctions and adjoint squared eigenfunctions. We present a new method to calculate the inner product between squared eigenfunctions and adjoint squared eigenfunctions, which relies on the properties of integrability rather than on the explicit expressions for eigenfunctions. In our approach, the inner product between squared eigenfunctions and adjoint squared eigenfunctions can be determined by analyzing the behavior of squared eigenfunction matrices at infinity. The connection arises from the symmetry of the potential in the Lax pair (2) and the differential equations satisfied by the squared eigenfunction matrices. The kernel \mathrm{Ker}(\mathcal{L}_{2}) can be obtained through derivatives of the four complex scattering parameters (c_{11},c_{12},c_{21},c_{22}) in the orbit of breather solutions (21). Moreover, functions corresponding to the negative subspace \mathcal{N}_{2}:=\{\mathbf{P}\in H^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}):\quad(% \mathcal{L}_{2}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P})<0\} can be derived from variations of conserved quantities that are linear combinations of conservation laws. By considering modulation and constructing the reduced Hamiltonian [21, 22], we derive the nonlinear stability result of Theorem 2. 1.4 Notations Let us consider the real Hilbert space \mathrm{X}=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}u_{1}&u_{2}&u_{1}^{*}&u_{2}^{*}\end{pmatrix}^% {T}:\quad u_{1},u_{2}\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C})\right\}\subset L^{2}(% \mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}), equipped with the inner product (\mathbf{f},\mathbf{g})=\mathrm{Re}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\mathbf{f}^{\dagger}% \mathbf{g}\mathrm{d}x. The decomposition for real Hilbert space L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4})=\mathrm{X}\oplus{\rm i}\mathrm{X} holds. Notation \cdot^{*} represents the complex conjugate and \cdot^{\dagger} represents the operator adjoint or conjugate and transpose for matrices. For example, ({\rm i}\partial_{x})^{*}=(-{\rm i})\partial_{x}\quad\mbox{\rm and}\quad({\rm i% }\partial_{x})^{\dagger}=(-\partial_{x})(-{\rm i})={\rm i}\partial_{x}. Then we can view any vector \mathbf{u}\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}) in the space \mathrm{X} through the bijection \iota(\mathbf{u})=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{u}\\ \mathbf{u}^{*}\end{pmatrix}\in\mathrm{X}. The bijection \iota is also an isomorphism between the Hilbert space L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}) and \mathrm{X} since (\iota(\mathbf{u}),\iota(\mathbf{v}))=2(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}). Then any operator \mathcal{A} acting on L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}) can naturally be extended on \mathrm{X}: \mathcal{A}^{\prime}\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{u}\\ \mathbf{u}^{*}\end{pmatrix}=\iota\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{u})=\begin{pmatrix}% \mathcal{A}\mathbf{u}\\ (\mathcal{A}\mathbf{u})^{*}\end{pmatrix}. For a functional \mathcal{K}(\mathbf{q}) on L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}), the first variation \frac{\delta\mathcal{K}}{\delta\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{q}) is given by \left(\mathbf{v},\frac{\delta\mathcal{K}}{\delta\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{q})\right)% =\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\frac{\mathcal{K}(\mathbf{q}+\epsilon\mathbf{v})-\mathcal% {K}(\mathbf{q})}{\epsilon} for \mathbf{v}\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}). The second variation is given by \frac{\delta^{2}\mathcal{K}}{\delta^{2}\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{q})[\mathbf{v}]=% \lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\frac{\frac{\delta\mathcal{K}}{\delta\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{q% }+\epsilon\mathbf{v})-\frac{\delta\mathcal{K}}{\delta\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{q})}{% \epsilon}. In the following, we abuse the notation \mathcal{A} to represent \mathcal{A}^{\prime} without ambiguity and sometimes we mean \mathbf{u} be \iota(\mathbf{u}) in \mathrm{X}. The reason why we consider \mathrm{X} instead of L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}) is that it makes the expression and calculation of functions more convenient compared to the separation of the real and imaginary parts of functions. The functions in \mathrm{X} can be obtained by the functions (\mathbf{q}^{T},\mathbf{r}^{T})^{T}\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}) with symmetries \mathbf{r}=\mathbf{q}^{*} which are the symmetries of potentials in the Lax pair (2). Hence it is natural to consider the space \mathrm{X} in the dynamics of the CNLS equations (1). It is important to note that both the space \mathrm{X} and L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}) can be interpreted as complex linear spaces. When we examine the eigenspace of an operator, we consider complex linear combinations of eigenfunctions. 1.5 Main contributions Our main contributions can be listed as follows. • The spectral stability for non-degenerate vector solitons is obtained by using the method of squared eigenfunctions. The spectral problem of the linearized operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1} is solved by squared eigenfunctions and the spectrum of the linearized operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1} is obtained with the dimension of the negative subspace \mathcal{N}_{1}. The non-degenerate vector solitons are spectrally stable. In addition, the linearized operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1} admits either embedded or isolated eigenvalues of negative Krein signature. • We connect the inner product (\mathcal{L}_{2}\cdot,\cdot) for eigenfunctions in the generalized kernel of the operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2} with the integral in the skew-symmetric differential form. This integral can be computed from the squared eigenfunction matrix due to integrability of the CNLS equations (1). The dimension of the negative subspace \mathcal{N}_{2} is calculated. Our method can be readily extended to the studies of stability of solitons or breathers in other integrable equations by using the integrability tools. • The nonlinear stability of the breather solutions in the CNLS equations (1) is derived for the first time. The nonlinear stability of the non-degenerate vector solitons with the spectral parameters a,b_{1},b_{2} holds when they are included in the orbit of the breather solutions of Definition 1 given by the scattering parameters c_{11},c_{22},c_{12},c_{21} in the relevant Darboux transformation. 1.6 Outline This paper is organized as follows. • In Section 2, we construct the non-degenerate vector soliton and breather solution by using Darboux transformation. We also introduce squared eigenfunctions and the squared eigenfunction matrix. The Lyapunov functional and the properties of its second variation are analyzed. • In Section 3, we investigate the spectral stability of non-degenerate vector soliton solutions. The proof of Theorem 1 relies on analyzing the spectrum of the linearized operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1} constructed by using squared eigenfunctions. • In Section 4, we construct the squared eigenfunctions in higher flow to prove that the squared eigenfunctions satisfy the spectral problem for \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2}. Subsequently, the closure relation induces the spectrum of \mathcal{L}_{2}. • In Section 5, we prove the nonlinear stability of breather solutions in Theorem 2."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08578v1,Double-flattop quantum droplets in,"We predict the existence of double-flattop quantum droplets in atomic Bose-Bose mixtures. Solutions of this type have two flattop regions of nearly uniform atomic density corresponding to a compressed central core surrounded by a rarefied layer. The birth of these double-flattop quantum droplets is analytically described using a perturbation theory, which in the leading order reduces the problem to the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Its properties are then used to predict the shape of double-flattop solutions and draw the conclusions about their stability. The analytical results apply to one- and multidimensional quantum droplets, provided that the energy density satisfies certain conditions. Using the numerical continuation from the asymptotic limit, we obtain the families of one- and two-dimensional double flattop quantum droplets and confirm the stability of the nodeless states of this type.","In the lowest-order approximation of Bogoliubov theory for a dilute gas of weakly interacting Bose particles Bogo1947 , the ground-state energy density is proportional to the squared particle density, and the coefficient of proportionality is positive or negative for repulsive or attractive interactions, respectively. For a nonuniform Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), this approximation can be developed into the well-known Gross-Pitaevskii equation Pita , which is widely and successfully used for theoretical description of BECs in a variety of realistic settings. At the same time, it has been predicted that in dilute two-component Bose-Bose mixtures, quantum corrections to the ground state energy LHY may become non-perturbative and, moreover, may enter into competition with the meanfield cubic nonlinearity Petrov2015 . A delicate balance between meanfield and beyond-meanfield nonlinearities enables the formation of quantum droplets, i.e., self-bound liquidlike states that can exist in stable form even in free space Bulgac ; Michi2002 . Quantum corrections play in this case a constructive role by stabilizing the condensate against collapse predicted by the meanfield theory. Another prominent property of quantum droplets (which further emphasizes the analogy with usual liquids) is the incompressibility: irrespective of the number of condensed atoms, the particle density cannot exceed a certain maximal value. As a result, for large numbers of atoms, quantum droplets tend to develop the so-called flattop shapes, i.e., broad plateaus of nearly uniform density (as it happens also in optical materials with competing nonlinearities Quiroga ). Soon after the theoretical prediction, quantum droplets in Bose-Bose mixtures were observed in several experiments Cabrera2018 ; Semeghini2018 ; Cheiney2018 ; 39K ; collisions ; hetero . Analogous quantum liquidlike states, resulting from the balance between repulsive and attractive terms, have been also observed in single-component dipolar condensates Schmitt2016 ; FerrierBarbut2016 ; Baillie2018 . Broad reviews of the progress made in rapidly developing area of multidimensional quantum droplets can be found in Luo2021 ; Malomed2021 ; Khan2022 ; Multidim2019 ; MaloBook ; Bottcher2021 . The beyond-meanfield theory of Bose-Bose mixtures can be generalized to low-dimensional liquids Petrov2016 ; Parisi1 ; Parisi2 , where the functional form of the energy density differs from that in the three-dimensional (3D) case, that results in different modifications of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with functional form of nonlinearity depending on dimensionality of the problem. Steady-state solutions corresponding to quantum droplets emerging in such models have been in the focus of numerous theoretical studies. The simplest solutionscan be obtained by assuming that density distributions in both components are proportional Li2018 ; Petrov2016 ; AstaMalo ; Katsimiga2023 ; Katsimiga2023CM ; Edmonds2023 ; Khan2022 ; Abdullaev ; Otajonov ; Paredes ; Dong2024 ; DongFan2024 ; Kartashov2019 ; Kartashov2018 ; Kartashov2021 ; Gangwar2024 ; Bougas2024 ; Flynn2023 . This assumption substantially simplifies the problem but, at the same time, it drastically restricts the set of available quantum droplet solutions. More complex, essentially two-component states, which cannot be described in terms of a single wavefunction, have also been addressed in several recent studies Mithun2020 ; Kartashov2020 ; Mista2021 ; Kartashov2022 ; KartashovZ2024 ; Gangwararx ; Englezos2024 ; Charalampidis2024 , but in general they received insufficient attention, especially in multidimensional geometries, where exploration of new types of self-sustained states that can be dynamically stable, is a task of considerable interest. Particularly interesting solutions, which cannot be implemented in the scalar case, correspond to structured quantum droplets with essentially different density distributions in two components. For instance, two wavefunctions describing components of the quantum droplet may have different parities KartashovZ2024 (in the 1D case) or different topological charges Kartashov2020 (for vortex states in the 2D case). The goal of this paper is to introduce a previously unexplored class of double-flattop quantum droplets that form in two-component mixtures. We demonstrate that the flattop region emerging in one of the components can serve as a background for the formation of a secondary droplet that is localized on the top of the already existed density plateau. As a result, the total density distribution acquires a double-flattop structure being composed of a compressed internal core surrounded by a rarefied shell. The analytical predictions are developed using a perturbation theory, which indicates that in the leading order the shape and stability of the emerging states is determined by the cubic nonlinear Schrïdinger (NLS) equation. Numerical results are obtained for one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) quantum droplets. In the 1D case, the obtained solutions are stable, whereas in the 2D case there is a countable set of families, and only the fundamental one includes stable solutions. The content of this paper can be outlined as follows. Section II introduces the general model and presents analytical results regarding the existence and stability of double-flattop states. Section III presents numerical results for 1D and 2D quantum droplets. Section IV concludes the paper."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08513v1,On the soliton solutions in a self-gravitating strongly coupled electron-ion-dusty plasma,"The effect of electrostatic strong-coupling of dust particles along with their self-gravitational force has been analyzed in a three component dusty plasma. The electrons and ions forming the charge neutral background where the electron distribution is assumed to be Maxwellian while the ion distribution is non-thermal. These days, one of the key topics in plasma physics is nonlinear waves in plasma. Thus using the reductive perturbation technique to the set of hydrodynamic equation considered for an electron-ion-dusty (e-i-d) plasma, a coupled KdV equation is derived. The impact of strong coupling and self-gravitation on the solitary wave profiles, nonlinear coefficient and dispersive coefficient are studied both analytically and by numerical simulation.","The studies of dusty plasma has become a crucial area of research due to the presence of dust in numerous natural environments, including radio-frequency discharges, near planets, and interstellar and circumstellar media. Due to its many applications to laboratory, space, and astrophysical plasma settings, such as asteroid zones, planatery rings, cometary tails, the interstellar medium, earth’s surroundings, etc., interest in the field of dusty plasma physics has been expanding quickly[1, 2, 3]. In reality, the charge on the dust grain varies with time and space because of electron and ion currents that flow into and out of the grain in addition to other processes like electron photoemission and secondary emission. This causes fluctuations in the dust charge. When these dust grains collide with other charged particles, such electrons, they get charged and become submerged in the surrounding plasma. In the majority of astrophysical scenarios, a grain becomes charged due to the radiative and plasma backdrop it is submerged in. The grains’ weights and sizes could very well be dependent on the same plasma environment, for instance. Larger and heavier grains could result from coulombic coagulation, but lighter and smaller grains could come from Maxwellian stress breaking apart the huge grains. These charged grains use electromagnetic (EM) forces to couple with the dynamics of the plasma. Low-frequency eigenmodes arise because the characteristic dust frequencies are significantly smaller than those of ions and electrons, due to the potentially very high effective charge and mass of these grains. Since each isolated dust grain has a mass that is typically between 10^{6} and 10^{12} times that of an ion[4, 5]. A new ultra low-frequency domain for the development of various acoustic mode types in dusty plasmas — which are absent in typical electron-ion plasmas — is created by the presence of such rather big particles. One such significant mode is the dust-acoustic mode, an Eigenmode of the dust-electron-ion plasma in which the restoring force is provided by the pressures of inertialess electrons and ions and the inertia is provided by the charged dust grains. As a result, in many laboratory studies, the dust-acoustic waves (DAW) have been seen with the unaided eye on a kinetic level[6, 7, 8, 9]. Dust acoustic waves, or DAWs, are the normal mode of a three-component dusty plasma made up of electrons, ions, and extremely huge micro-meter-sized charged dust grains. DAWs have a very low phase velocity (compared to the electron and ion thermal velocity). Star formation is one of the most significant of the many ancient issues that must be reconsidered in light of the many recent advances in our understanding of dusty plasma. The question of magneto-gravitational instability of stars is of great importance due to the competition between the gravitational and electromagnetic forces. Because of the increased mass of the grains, there is typically conflict between the gravitational and electromagnetic effects. Gravitational forces will prevail for very large grains, while electromagnetic and gravitational forces may compete for moderate-sized dusts. This equilibrium served as the foundation for the well-known Jeans instability, and serves as a standard for the disintegration of interstellar material. Interesting analyses of the modification of Jeans’ criterion resulting from the interaction of nonlinearity, gravitational force, and electromagnetic effect have previously been conducted by a few writers[10, 11, 12]. Naturally, the tale of dusty plasma is fairly ancient, with several models being postulated for various kinds of investigation[13, 14]. The electrostatic energy of the mutual interaction is unusually high due to huge charges carried by the grains (usually of the order of thousand elementary charges for a micron-size particle). Therefore, compared to the electron-ion subsystem, it is far easier to achieve significant electrostatic coupling in the dust subsystem. Transitions from a disordered gaseous-like phase to a liquid-like phase and the creation of organized structures from dust particles, known as plasma crystals, are observed in complex plasmas. In 1959, Wuerker et al.[15] reported the first experimental observation of the ordered (quasicrystalline) structures of charged microparticles formed in a modified Paul’s trap. It was Ikezi (1986)[16] who first hypothesized that dust subsystem crystallization may occur in a nonequilibrium gas discharge plasma. Because of its many applications, the physics of strongly coupled plasmas, where the average potential energy per particle predominates over the average kinetic energy, is of enormous interest. When such high coupling is present, the presence of a huge charged dust component in a typical electron-ion plasma can have a significant impact on the dynamics of the system. Recently, both theoretical and experimental investigations of complicated dynamics have been conducted in such a plasma system. The coupling parameter (\Gamma) is one of the essential features of a system where many particle interactions occur. The parameter ‘\Gamma’ is characterized as the ratio of the potential energy of interaction between the neighboring particles to their kinetic energy. The coupling parameter is expressed as \Gamma=\frac{q_{d}^{2}}{ak_{B}T_{d}}\exp[-\mathcal{K}], with \mathcal{K}=a_{d}/\lambda_{D}. The quantity ‘\mathcal{K}’ is known as the screening parameter. q_{{}_{d}} is the charge on each dust particle, a_{{}_{d}}(\approx n_{d}^{-1/3}) is the inter-dust particle distance, n_{d} and T_{d} are the dust density and temperature, \lambda_{D} is the plasma Debye length, k_{B} the Boltzmann constant. The possibility of a classical Coulomb plasma with a population of dust grains transitioning to a strongly coupled phase was first noted by Ikezi[16]. It had been nearly twenty-five years ago. The reason for this is that with high charge and low temperature, the coupling parameters approach or even surpass 1. In fact, the Debye-Huckel repulsive potential determines the way the negatively charged micro-particles interact with one another. It has been shown that a strongly coupled plasma can behave like a liquid or a solid, with viscosity and elasticity playing equally significant roles. Dust grains are known to have a quasi-crystalline structure, and these characteristics are referred to as visco-elasticity. Therefore, there should be strong correlation effects influencing the low frequency collective modes in such a new phase of plasma. Currently, there are two paths toward the development of a strongly linked plasma. Effective electrostatic force[17, 18, 19, 20] and visco-elastic effects[21, 22, 23] are the two types of forces. A number of these have applications in the study of charged particles in cryogenic traps[24], electrons trapped on the surface of liquid helium[25], and other astrophysical systems[26], including the ion-liquid inside white dwarf interiors, the crust of neutron stars, supernova cores, etc. As the diameters of the dust grains increase, the gravitational effects become significant. Similar to other plasma particles, trapping by magnetic field lines predominates for grains that are too tiny. Conversely, excessively big grains do not deviate from their gravitationally constrained orbits due to electromagnetic forces. There could be a struggle between the electrostatic repulsion and gravitational self-attraction of the grains in plasmas such as protostellar clouds. Dusty plasmas are susceptible to macroscopic instabilities of the Jeans type[27, 28, 29, 30], when self-gravitational interaction resulting from the behavior of dust component is taken into account. In contrast to the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force is solely attracting, which accounts for the Jeans instability of a huge system. El-Labany et al.[31, 32] recently obtained stationary modes, tiny amplitude DA solitons, and double layers while taking the dynamics of dust charge and trapped electrons/ions into account. It has already been demonstrated that the coexistence of rarefactive and compressive DA solitary structures and double layers is possible at the two-ion temperature. Nonetheless, these studies that disregard gravity are only applicable in the plasma phase, where the electrostatic force is significantly stronger than the gravitational pull. In many astrophysical environments, especially in dense regions like star-forming molecular clouds and accretion disks, dusty plasmas are both self-gravitating and can exhibit strong coupling. The interplay of gravity, electrostatic forces, and plasma dynamics can lead to complex behaviors, including clustering, filamentation, and large-scale structure formation[33]. Even in the laboratory, dusty plasmas are often studied under conditions where gravity can be minimized (such as in microgravity experiments aboard the International Space Station) to understand how dust particles behave in strongly coupled states[34, 35]. While several studies have examined the impact of trapped electrons or ions, variations in dust temperatures, and charge fluctuations, none have examined the consequences of electrostatic strong coupling in conjunction with self-gravitation. Using an appropriate reductive perturbation technique, we have analyzed both the linear and nonlinear regimes of a self-gravitating quantum dusty plasma in the current communication. Two coupled modified KdV equations have been derived in the nonlinear section, while a new dispersion relation providing precise information about different propagation modes is generated in the linear regime. The structure of our presentation is as follows: in Section II, we give the density distributions for the Maxwellian distributed electrons and non-thermal ions as well as the hydrodynamic equations for the strongly coupled as well as self-gravitating dust fluid. The goal of Section III is to derive the linear and nonlinear equations by analyzing different orders of perturbation terms that eventually makes us able to explain how large amplitude dust waves behave. The obtained results were discussed and explained precisely in SectionV as well."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07255v1,Pattern formation and global analysis of a systematically reduced plant model in dryland environment,"This paper delves into a systematically reduced plant system proposed by Jaïbi et al. [14, Phys. D, 2020] in arid area. They used the method of geometric singular perturbation to study the existence of abundant orbits. Instead, we deliberate the stability and distributed patterns of this system. For a non-diffusive scenario for the model, we scrutinize the local and global stability of equilibria and derive conditions for the existence or non-existence of the limit cycle. The bifurcation behaviors are also explored. For the spatial model, we investigate Hopf, Turing, Hopf-Turing, Turing-Turing bifurcations. Specially, the evolution process from periodic solutions to spatially nonconstant steady states is observed near the Hopf-Turing bifurcation point. And mixed nonconstant steady states near the Turing-Turing bifurcation point are observed. Furthermore, it’s found that there exist gap, spot, stripe and mixed patterns. The seed-dispersal rate enables the transformation of pattern structures. Reasonable control of system parameters may prevent desertification from occurring. Keywords: Turing bifurcation; Hopf bifurcation; Plant pattern; Stability","This paper explores the space-time dynamics of the following plant system proposed by Jaïbi et al. [14]. \begin{cases}(\partial_{\tau}-d_{B}\Delta)B(x,t)=\Theta BW(1-\frac{B}{K})(1+% \Lambda B)-NB,\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ x\in(0,\mathcal{l}% \pi),\\ (\partial_{\tau}-d_{W}\Delta)W(x,t)=P-QW(1-\frac{RB}{K})-MBW(1+\Lambda B),\ \ % \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ x\in(0,\mathcal{l}\pi),\\ B_{\textbf{n}}=W_{\textbf{n}}=0,\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ % \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ % \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ t\geq 0,x=0,\mathcal{l}\pi,\end{cases} (1.1) where B(x,t) and W(x,t) represent, respectively, plant biomass and soil-water density. And the biological explanations of the parameters are shown in Table 1. Desertification is an ecological issue characterized by the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas. This process involves the loss of vegetation, soil erosion, and the decline in biodiversity. Desertification poses significant environmental, economic, and social challenges, including reduced agricultural productivity, water scarcity, displacement of communities, and loss of livelihoods. Fortunately, vegetation conservation stands as an effective measure in combating desertification. Vegetation plays a crucial role in maintaining soil structure stability, reducing soil erosion, enhancing soil-water retention capacity, and promoting biodiversity [1, 4]. Mathematically, modeling the relationship between vegetation and water in arid regions, and studying their dynamic behaviors including plant patterns is essential. This is beneficial to understanding plant patterns and implementing effective conservation strategies. Over the past few decades, numerous plant models have been proposed and continually improved to explore plant dynamics. The earliest plant-water model, developed by Klausmeier [17], described the interaction between plant biomass and water in semi-arid regions. The pivotal role of nonlinear mechanisms in shaping the spatial structure of plant communities was elucidated [17]. By introducing a system that takes into account soil-water, Hardeberg et al. [11] presented a novel description to elucidate desertification phenomena and classify droughts. Later, Rietkerk and colleagues [28] partitioned water into soil moisture and surface water, and established a three-component model to investigate the positive feedback between water infiltration and vegetation density. Gilad et al. [7] presented a three-component model for arid regions, which seizes a variety of pattern structure of plants. One notable divergence between two models in [28] and [7] is that the latter incorporates lateral root water conduction as an additional mechanism for water transport. Based on Gilad et al. [7], Zelnik et al. [42] used a simplified version of the model to explore the dynamics in fairy circles. And their findings indicated that the formation and decay processes of fairy circles correspond to spatially constrained transitions between distinct stable states. The level of research attention is greater for the Klausmeier model and its extended versions [19, 8, 6, 41], including some delayed models [9, 20, 36]. Table 1: Parameter descriptions of system (1.1) Parameter Description K Maximal standing biomass M Water-uptake rate N Plant mortality rate P Precipitation rate Q Evaporation rate R Reduction evaporation rate because of shading, \Lambda Root-to-shoot ratio \Theta Biomass growth rate coefficient d_{B} Seed-dispersal coefficient d_{W} Soil-water diffusivity To better elucidate the impact of parameter perturbations on the formation of plant patterns, Sun et al. [34] conducted a thorough analysis of the model proposed by Zelnik et al. [42]. They found that the rate of water diffusion suppresses plant growth, while shading parameters facilitate an increase in plant biomass. By controlling properly parameters, the uniform state gradually transitions to gap patterns. In effect, a wide variety of patterns such as spot, strip and gap patterns are observed in plant system [3, 11, 28, 29, 34]. Turing bifurcation is indeed a significant mathematical concept in understanding pattern formation, especially in fields like nonlinear dynamics and mathematical biology. It has been used to explain various observed patterns in nature, such as animal coat patterns, chemical patterns, and even patterns in biological systems like the development of animal skin or the organization of cells in embryos. This has prompted scholars to investigate pattern formation across various systems, such as [10, 33, 37, 35, 26]. Motivation Based on Zelnik et al. [42], Jaïbi et al. [14] reduced systematically the model under one space dimension and obtain (1.1), which enables a more direct connection between ecological mechanisms and observations. They employed the geometric singular perturbation means to investigate localized patterns and showed the existence of numerous heteroclinic, homoclinic and periodic orbits. However, no one has studied the space-time dynamics of (1.1) so far. The mechanisms and patterns of spatial diffusion are particularly important for the study of biodynamics [2, 13, 24, 15, 16, 23, 21, 22, 32, 39, 38, 25, 31, 40, 44, 18]. In view of this, it is necessary to study bifurcation behaviors and the effect of parameter perturbation on patterned vegetation distribution for (1.1). Making conversions \displaystyle u=\sqrt{\frac{P\Lambda\Theta}{KN^{2}}}B,\ v=\frac{N}{P}W,\ t=N% \tau,\ a=\frac{P\Theta}{N^{2}},\ b=\frac{Q}{N}, \displaystyle c=\frac{MK-RQ}{\sqrt{\Lambda\Theta PK}},\ d=\frac{MNK}{P\Theta},% \ m=\frac{BK-1}{B}\sqrt{\frac{\Lambda\Theta P}{KN^{2}}},\ d_{1}=\frac{d_{B}}{N% },\ d_{2}=\frac{d_{W}}{N}, then (1.1) becomes \begin{cases}(\partial_{t}-d_{1}\Delta)u(x,t)=(av-1)u+mu^{2}v-u^{3}v,\\ (\partial_{t}-d_{2}\Delta)v(x,t)=1-(b+cu+du^{2})v,\end{cases} (1.2) where a,\ b,\ d\textgreater 0 and m,\ c\in\mathbb{R}. The remainder of this paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 deliberates the local and global stability of equilibria, analyzes the conditions for the existence and non-existence of limit cycles, and explores potential bifurcations that system (2.1) undergoes. Section 3 analyzes several bifurcations of codimension 2 for system (1.2). Section 4 firstly validates the complex theoretical analysis through numerical computation and provide simulation results. Additionally, abundant pattern structures of vegetation are observed. Eventually, Section 5 concludes this paper."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07953v1,Quantitative Phase-Field Modeling of Rapid Alloy Solidification,"We further develop a recently introduced phase-field model of rapid alloy solidification [K. Ji et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 026203 (2023)]. This model utilizes enhanced solute diffusivity within the spatially diffuse interface region to quantitatively capture solute trapping with a larger interface width, thereby making simulations on experimentally relevant length and time scales computationally feasible. The main developments presented here include testing the robustness of different variational formulations, extending the model to concentrated alloys by incorporating solid and liquid free energies from thermodynamic databases, as illustrated for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys with CALPHAD, extending convergence tests as a function of interface width to 3D, and carrying out simulations in both 2D and 3D to examine existing theories of microstructure development. Our results indicate that the simplest variational formulation that interpolates the bulk free-energy density between its solid and liquid forms is the most robust. Remarkably, for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys, this formulation yields a high-velocity nonequilibrium phase diagram that is independent of interface width, thereby demonstrating that the framework of enhanced solute diffusivity framework can be non-trivially extended to concentrated alloys. Other variational formulations have restricted ranges of materials or processing parameters that can be reliably modeled. We use 2D simulations to construct high-velocity microstructure selection maps for dilute Al-Cu alloys. The results validate the important role of latent heat rejection at the interface and extend the limited predictions of linear stability analysis [A. Karma and A. Sarkissian, Phys. Rev. E 47, 513 (1993)] and sharp-interface 1D simulations to fully nonlinear regimes. Furthermore, 3D simulations, carried out using a computationally tractable axisymmetric cellular/dendritic interface shape, demonstrate a good convergence similar to that observed in 2D as a function of interface width. Full 3D simulations, in turn, reveal that the standard theory of absolute stability is a good predictor of the upper critical velocity beyond which steady-state growth becomes unstable, despite the different morphological manifestations of this instability in 2D and 3D.","Alloy microstructures develop during solidification processes that range from conventional casting to advanced additive manufacturing techniques, where the solid-liquid interface velocity V spans six orders of magnitude from micron/s to m/s [1, 2]. Understanding the formation and evolution of these microstructures is essential for controlling the properties of the manufactured alloys, and it requires multiscale computational modeling. The phase-field (PF) method has emerged as a major contributor for modeling and predicting mesoscale microstructures during solidification processes [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This method describes a two-phase (solid-liquid) system by a scalar PF that takes constant values in each of the bulk phases and varies smoothly across interfaces of a characteristic thickness W. This scalar field can be coupled to the local thermodynamic state variables, such as temperature and solute concentration, and avoids the need for explicit front tracking. A number of PF studies have successfully predicted and elucidated microstructure patterns at length scales \sim 100 \mum observed in experiments, predominantly under slow solidification conditions where the interface is close to thermodynamic equilibrium [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Despite the physical solid-liquid interface thickness being around W_{0}\sim 1 nm—significantly smaller than the scale of microstructural patterns—PF simulations can be conducted at experimentally relevant length and times scales by upscaling the diffuse interface thickness [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], such that W\gg W_{0}. Techniques like the anti-trapping current help eliminate spurious effects from this upscaling [17, 18], ensuring local thermodynamic equilibrium at the interface. As a result, quantitative agreements between PF simulations and well-controlled experiments can be established [10, 12, 15]. Yet, modeling conditions far from equilibrium, as seen in rapid solidification processes like additive manufacturing, introduces unique challenges, encompassing two main aspects detailed below. The first challenge lies in modeling an out-of-equilibrium interface with complex morphologies, where nonequilibrium effects become dominant during rapid solidification. As the solid-liquid interface propagates at an increased velocity, the solid phase will trap excess solute, resulting in a reduction of the peak concentration as illustrated in the schematics of Fig. 1(a). This phenomenon, known as solute trapping, occurs when the semi-liquid interface region fully crystallizes before solute partitioning is complete, where the former takes a time \sim W/V for a diffuse interface moving at V, and the latter is established on the characteristic time \sim W^{2}/D_{l} for solute atoms of diffusivity D_{l} (in the liquid) to diffuse across the interface [22]. When these two time scales become comparable, i.e., V is close to a diffusive speed V_{d}\equiv D_{l}/W, the interface dynamics is largely controlled by the nonequilibrium effects. This is especially true for the range of V approaching or exceeding the so-called absolute stability limit V_{a}, beyond which the solid-liquid interface is theoretically expected to become morphologically stable [23, 24], when the stabilizing effect of surface tension surpasses the destabilizing effect of the solutal diffusion field. Except for very dilute alloy concentrations [25, 26], a smooth transition from cellular-dendritic to planar front growth is not typically observed. Instead, “banded microstructures” form [one example given in Fig. 1(b)], which consist of an alternation between bands exhibiting a microsegregation pattern characteristic of dendritic array growth, and microsegregation-free bands characteristic of planar front growth [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. Linear stability analyses that incorporate nonequilibrium effects have predicted the existence of oscillatory modes of the planar interface [37, 38, 39]. Nonlinear oscillations of the planar interface have indeed been shown to exist, but are insufficient to fully describe banding. Approximate analytical models of banding have also been developed, but assume instantaneous transitions between steady-state dendritic and planar front growth [29, 30, 34]. They also neglect latent-heat rejection found to strongly affect planar front oscillations [40, 39]. While these studies have provided useful insights, a quantitative modeling approach is essential to address basic questions about dendritic array pattern stability and the underlying mechanisms of banding. To achieve this objective, the computational modeling needs to incorporate alloy phase diagram, relevant thermal conditions, energetic and kinetic anisotropies of a solid-liquid interface, and importantly, nonequilibrium solute trapping effects over a broad velocity range, extending beyond the absolute stability limit. Figure 1: (a) Schematic representations of one-dimensional concentration c(x) and PF \phi(x) profiles during rapid solidification of binary alloys, where the positive x directs to the right side of the figure. c_{\infty} is the nominal concentration away from the interface. The solid and dashed c(x) curves represent lower and higher solidification velocities, respectively. (b)-(c) Comparison of banded microstructures for Al-9 wt.% Cu from the late stage of a thin-film resolidification experiment [36] and a 2D PF simulation with thermal diffusion [41] (\tilde{c}=c/c_{\infty} color map). Reproduced with permissions. The second challenge revolves around carrying out simulations on experimentally relevant length and time scales. While PF models have been shown to reproduce solute trapping properties for a physical choice of interface thickness W_{0}\sim 1 nm in one dimension [42, 43, 44, 45, 46], two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) simulations at the microstructural pattern scale generally necessitate the choice of an increased interface thickness in the PF model, i.e., S\equiv W/W_{0}\gg 1. This selection, however, induces spurious excess trapping. Given that the diffusive speed is inversely related to the chosen interface thickness S through the relation V_{d}\sim D_{l}/W\sim V_{d}^{0}/S (where V_{d}^{0}\equiv D_{l}/W_{0} is a constant), the excess trapping induced by S\gg 1 can profoundly influence interface dynamics, especially when nonequilibrium effects become dominant with V\sim V_{d}. In the context of slow solidification, this complication has been circumvented by introducing an anti-trapping current [17, 18], which effectively eliminates excess solute trapping, thereby restoring local equilibrium at the interface. The form of this current has been modified to also account for a moderate departure from equilibrium below the absolute stability limit [47]. Yet, to describe far-from-equilibrium phenomena, such as banding, a more quantitative strategy is needed to consistently eliminate this excess trapping across a wide velocity range from low to high V. In our recent study [41], a PF model was developed to address the aforementioned dual challenges. This model incorporates well-known nonequilibrium effects, including solute trapping characterized by velocity-dependent forms of the partition coefficient k(V) and liquidus slope m(V), as well as interface kinetics. A computationally tractable choice of W is used to model the solidification of a dilute Al-Cu alloy under far-from-equilibrium conditions. To compensate for the excess solute trapping, the model adopts a novel approach by enhancing the solute diffusivity D(\phi)\equiv D_{l}q(\phi) within the spatially diffuse interface region. Simple forms of q(\phi) are used to reproduce the desired V-dependent forms of k(V) and m(V) across an extremely wide velocity range, from near [k(V)\to k_{e} where k_{e} is the equilibrium value of the partition coefficient] to far from [k(V)\to 1] equilibrium conditions. 2D simulations revealed a new burgeoning instability in dendrite tip growth, driven by solute trapping at velocities nearing the absolute stability limit. These simulations also reproduced the formation of the widely observed banded microstructures and predicated band spacings that agree quantitatively with observations in rapidly solidified Al-Cu thin films [36], as shown in Fig. 1(b)-(c). Furthermore, the bands in the PF simulation form by the same lateral spreading mechanism as observed in the experiment, with a lateral velocity that remarkably matches the experimental measurements [48]. Furthermore, this PF model has recently been used to study the formation of banded microstructures during laser powder-bed fusion of a Magnesium alloy [49]. The strategy of enhancing solute diffusivity to upscale interface thickness has also been implemented in a recent formulation [50] with finite interface dissipation [46] to simulate banded microstructures during rapid solidification. In this paper, we revisit the aforementioned quantitative PF model [41], hereafter referred to as Model A, and present a derivative Model B based on a similar variational framework. We derive the evolution equations of each model from a free-energy functional and perform the 1D asymptotic analysis, demonstrating that the solute trapping properties of both PF models match the predictions of the microscopic Continuous Growth (CG) model [51] in the large V limit. While Model A is derived from a phenomenological free-energy functional introduced in Ref. [43] for a dilute binary alloy, Model B is based on a free energy that interpolates between bulk phases at the interface, allowing for the modeling of both dilute and non-dilute alloys with the integration of free-energy functions from the Calculation of Phase Diagrams (CALPHAD). In addition, we introduce a revised PF model that separates solute diffusion in normal and tangential directions to study the effects of excess surface diffusion. Furthermore, we expand the modeling capabilities by coupling latent-heat diffusion to the PF simulation and extending the simulation to 3D. Numerical simulations in 2D produce microstructure selection maps for dilute Al-Cu alloys under different thermal conditions, including the standard frozen temperature approximation assuming a fixed homogeneous temperature gradient and the time-dependent calculation of thermal diffusion within an adiabatic zone. In the latter, the banded microstructure is selected at a higher composition, which is in good agreement with the results of linear stability analyses [40, 39], demonstrating the significant effects of latent-heat diffusion on banding. The transitions from cellular/dendritic to planar/banding with various alloy compositions are investigated through 2D PF simulations. The PF results with S=1 agree well with the absolute stability limit that is analytically predicted when the cellular/dendritic solution loses stability. The PF model is also extended to 3D, with both axisymmetric and full 3D simulations conducted at velocities close to the absolute stability limit. The latter reveal a tail instability developing in the grooves of dendrite arms, which resembles the corrugated roofs observed in 2D simulations but differs from the hemispherical caps seen in axisymmetric cases. Moreover, we address a numerical issue specific to Model A under certain combinations of alloy and modeling parameters. The free-energy density f_{AB}(\phi,T) in Model A encompasses contributions from both the pure substance and the solute addition, where \phi is the PF varying from +1 in the solid to -1 in the liquid, and T denotes temperature. A phenomenological form of f_{AB}(\phi,T) [43] is chosen in Model A, such that the stationary solution of the PF profile is exactly a hyperbolic tangent function. This is achieved by using different functions of \phi to interpolate the pure-substance and chemical parts of the free energy between the solid and liquid phases. In the dilute limit, this PF formulation is equivalent to the Kim-Kim-Suzuki model [52] that interpolates the concentration in the interface region between its solid and liquid values, and a thermodynamically-based formulation that interpolates the grand potential [20]. The choice of f_{AB}(\phi,T) in Model A, however, can lead to the emergence of an additional spurious minimum of the bulk free-energy density at values other than \phi=\pm 1 within the interval -1<\phi<1 , thereby causing unphysical simulation results. As presented in Sec. III.1, we distinguish between the“safe” and “unsafe” regions within the parameter space. In the safe region, Model A operates under any interface driving force, whereas in the unsafe region, certain driving forces might induce the development of unphysical phases. Typically, the unsafe region is characterized by a high nominal concentration c_{\infty}, a small k_{e}, and/or a large interface thickness S. Even for the case of S=1, a sufficiently small k_{e} can lead to the appearance of unphysical phases under certain driving forces, which holds true for both Model A, as discussed here, and the PF models in Refs. [52, 20]. Within the unsafe region, simulations using these models are still feasible as long as the driving force does not trigger unphysical phases, though extra caution is required. This numerical issue does not arise in Model B, which interpolates the free energy of the solid and liquid phases across a diffuse interface. It should be noted that Model B in its S=1 case is equivalent to the PF formulation introduced in Refs. [53, 54], where the interface is assumed to be in an intermediate state between the two bulk phases. Although the solution of Model B deviates from the hyperbolic tangent profile of the stationary PF solution, this model reproduces the quantitative k(V) and m(V) curves similar to that of Model A for dilute alloys and circumvents the problem of unphysical phases for any combination of alloy and modeling parameters. However, given that Model B introduces a higher energy barrier, it requires more stringent conditions for numerical stability and results in higher computational costs. Thus, we primarily utilize Model A for PF simulations of dilute alloys, resorting to Model B only when parameters fall into the unsafe region. The approach of interpolating the free energy of bulk phases at the interface in Model B also provides additional flexibility. This allows for the integration of Gibbs free energy as functions of temperature and alloy concentration for each phase, commonly used to accurately predict phase properties in CALPHAD. By applying these experimentally verified free-energy functions and enhancing interfacial diffusion for an upscaled interface, we investigate solute trapping for concentrated Al-Ag alloys. The nonequilibrium liquidus and solidus predicted by the PF model are nearly S-independent, enabling the quantitative modeling of rapid solidification of non-dilute binary alloys at experimentally relevant time and length scales. An example 2D PF simulation for a concentrated Al-Ag alloy is provided. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we first introduce the sharp-interface equations for a moving solid-liquid interface. Then, we present detailed derivations of PF models in Sec. III. Asymptotic analyses, approximate and full PF solutions of solute trapping are presented in Sec. IV. Numerical results in both 2D and 3D are discussed in Sec. V. Lastly, conclusions and perspectives are given in Sec. VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07055v1,"Reconstruction of neuromorphic dynamics from a single scalar time series
using variational autoencoder and neural network map","This paper examines the reconstruction of a family of dynamical systems with neuromorphic behavior using a single scalar time series. A model of a physiological neuron based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is considered. Single time series of one of its variables is shown to be enough to train a neural network that can operate as a discrete time dynamical system with one control parameter. The neural network system is created in two steps. First, the delay-coordinate embedding vectors are constructed form the original time series and their dimension is reduced with by means of a variational autoencoder to obtain the recovered state-space vectors. It is shown that an appropriate reduced dimension can be determined by analyzing the autoencoder training process. Second, pairs of the recovered state-space vectors at consecutive time steps supplied with a constant value playing the role of a control parameter are used to train another neural network to make it operate as a recurrent map. The regimes of thus created neural network system observed when its control parameter is varied are in very good accordance with those of the original system, though they were not explicitly presented during training.","Reconstructing dynamical models from time series is an important task from a practical point of view and also is an interesting theoretical challenge. To date, a large number of approaches and methods for solving this problem have been developed Kantz and Schreiber (2004); Bradley and Kantz (2015); Bezruchko and Smirnov (2010). In connection with the intensive development of artificial neural network technologies, it seems interesting to study their capabilities in relation to the dynamical modeling. In this regard, without claiming completeness, we can mention some related works. In papers Scully, Neiman, and Shilnikov (2021); Kong et al. (2021); Hart (2024) a sort of neural networks techniques called reservoir computing is considered as tool for replicating the dynamics of chaotic systems and predicting their properties. Blending several dynamical systems into a single model built on the bases of reservoir computing is considered in papers Flynn, Tsachouridis, and Amann (2021, 2023). In paper Durstewitz, Koppe, and Thurm (2023) recurrent neural network is considered as a tool for reconstruction of a model of dynamics trained directly on the measured physiological data. Paper Zhang et al. (2019) reports a new framework, Gumbel Graph Network, which is a model-free, data-driven deep learning framework to accomplish the reconstruction of both network connections and the dynamics on it. Paper Almazova, Barmparis, and Tsironis (2021) is devoted to reconstruction of chaotic dynamic from scalar time series using plain autoencoder. Along with the reconstruction of dynamical systems, neural networks and machine learning methods inspire new ideas in other fields of nonlinear dynamics. In particular, a series of papers Wu et al. (2024a); Ye et al. (2024); Wu et al. (2024b) develops a technique of dynamical learning of synchronization (DLS) designed to control the synchronization state of a complex network composed of nonlinear oscillators. Paper Wu et al. (2024c) demonstrates that a three-layer neural network, comprising input, training, and output layers and utilizing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), can effectively learn the orderly propagation of signals between network layers under controlled synaptic conditions. Neural networks are used for adaptive modeling and control of dynamical systems Levin, Gewirtzman, and Inbar (1991), applied for El Niño attractor reconstruction Grieger and Latif (1994), employed for dynamics prediction based on state space reconstruction Zimmermann and Neuneier (2000). Also machine learning is utilized for biological models creations and analysis Gilpin, Huang, and Forger (2020). One of the most appealing characteristics of neural networks is their capacity for data generalization. This ability stems from the fact that a well-trained neural network is able to identify and extract from the data features and dependencies that may initially appear to be obscure. In the context of problems related to dynamics reconstruction, this aptitude should facilitate significant advancements in the direction of developing models based on experimental data. It is natural to expect that even with a limited amount of information about the system, such as its single scalar time series, it will be possible to use a neural network to construct a family of models, parameterized by control parameters, that will be able to predict a variety of system behaviors. Our paper considers this possibility in relation to a specific example: the neuromorphic dynamics of a system built on the basis of the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism. We avoid using simplified neuron models and focus on the realistic Hodgkin-Huxley one since planing in our future works to consider an experimental data obtained from a natural system described within the Hodgkin-Huxley framework. The main motivation of this paper is to contribute to the methods of studying dynamics based on experimental data. However, in this paper we define a modeled system using ODEs and get a time series from numerical solving the equations. It means that our data are devoid of the features inherent in the data of a real experiment: they are sampled with a small and constant time step, there are quite a lot of them, the readings are recorded without errors (except for numerical ones) and they are not noisy. The cases with non-perfect experimental data will be considered in our subsequent studies. We use variational autoencoder (VAE) Kingma and Welling (2019); Chollet (2021) and neural network map Kuptsov, Stankevich, and Bagautdinova (2023); Kuptsov and Stankevich (2024) as tools to perform reconstruction. The VAE is used to recover system state vectors by reducing the dimension of delay-coordinate embedding vectors from the original time series. The recovered state-space vectors are then used to train the neural network map, resulting in a reconstructed dynamical system with a single control parameter. An autoencoder is one of the standard neural network architectures, which is used, among other things, to reduce the dimension of data Chollet (2021). The main feature of an autoencoder is that the data vectors it process at some point passes through a bottleneck, that is, it turns out to be represented in the form of low-dimensional vectors. The first part of the autoencoder, called the encoder, is responsible for this. After this, the dimension is restored to the original value by the second part, called the decoder. The objective of training is to achieve a minimal discrepancy between the input and output vectors. To this end, all pertinent data must be compressed into the reduced vectors at the bottleneck. VAE differs from a plain autoencoder in that the output of the encoder is not the reduced vector itself, but parameters of the so-called latent space. The reduced vector is randomly selected from this latent space and passed to the decoder. Random sampling of the reduced vectors from the latent space during training is very important for the purposes of dynamics reconstruction, as it ensures proximity preservation. Thanks to this, it is guaranteed that fragments of the original trajectory that are close to each other will be represented by the close latent space vectors, which we use as the reconstructed state-space vectors of the modeled system. It is mathematically proven Kolmogorov (1956); Arnold (1957); Kolmogorov (1957); Cybenko (1989); Gorban (1998); Haykin (1998) that a two-layer fully connected, i.e., dense, neural network can be used to approximate arbitrary functions of many variables. It means that it can be suitable for reconstruction of a dynamical system. In paper Kuptsov, Kuptsova, and Stankevich (2021) a good quality of dynamics reproduction with such a simple network model was shown for different systems: Lorenz, Rössler, Hindmarch–Rose neuron model. However, already for the Hindmarch–Rose oscillator the quality of reconstruction was lower that for two other systems. It was found that a neural network map based on a simple two-layer structure is difficult to train for so called stiff systems where variables have very different time scales. Then in paper Kuptsov, Stankevich, and Bagautdinova (2023) a more advanced structure of the neural network map was suggested. Instead of a single network accepting the full state vector at once and returning the state vector on the next time step, subnetworks for each dynamical variable were introduced. Each subnetwork still has two-layer structure, but all other variables together with control parameters are injected after an additional dense layer. Such network is found to model stiff dynamics and also is able to discover correctly dynamical regime not shown during training. In paper Kuptsov and Stankevich (2024) it is shown that two neural network maps trained separately can model dynamics of two coupled systems without additional training. Thus the goal of this study is to reconstruct the dynamics of a system as completely as possible, given its single scalar time series, using neural networks. The result of the reconstruction will be a family of dynamical systems, parameterized by a control parameter. Our particular interest will be in the dynamical features of the modeled system that are not explicitly presented during training and nevertheless discovered by the reconstructed system."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06922v1,"Spontaneous modulational instability of elliptic periodic waves: 
the soliton condensate model","We use the spectral theory of soliton gas for the one-dimensional focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation (fNLSE) to describe the statistically stationary and spatially homogeneous integrable turbulence emerging at large times from the evolution of the spontaneous (noise-induced) modulational instability of the elliptic “dn” fNLSE solutions. We show that a special, critically dense, soliton gas, namely the genus one bound-state soliton condensate, represents an accurate model of the asymptotic state of the “elliptic” integrable turbulence. This is done by first analytically evaluating the relevant spectral density of states which is then used for implementing the soliton condensate numerically via a random N-soliton ensemble with N large. A comparison of the statistical parameters, such as the Fourier spectrum, the probability density function of the wave intensity and the autocorrelation function of the intensity, of the soliton condensate with the results of direct numerical fNLSE simulations with \mathrm{dn} initial data augmented by a small statistically uniform random perturbation (a noise) shows a remarkable agreement. Additionally, we analytically compute the kurtosis of the elliptic integrable turbulence, which enables one to estimate the deviation from Gaussianity. The analytical predictions of the kurtosis values, including the frequency of its temporal oscillations at the intermediate stage of the modulational instability development, are also shown to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations for the entire range of the elliptic parameter m of the initial \mathrm{dn} potential.","Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental physical phenomenon that has been attracting a major attention from various physics and mathematics communities over the last six decades [1]. Pioneered by Whitham, Lighthill, Benjamin and Feir, Ostrovsky, and Zakharov in 1960-s the theory of modulational instability has developed into a broad area of research with numerous applications in water waves [2], nonlinear optics [3], and condensed matter physics [4]. Typically, MI is manifested as a temporal growth of the amplitude of a small perturbation (modulation) of a weakly nonlinear periodic wave. In many scenarios the dispersion of the wave’s envelope plays the dominant role at the initial (linear) stage of the MI development. The initial exponential growth is saturated by nonlinear effects when the modulation amplitude becomes sufficiently large, leading at longer times to the emergence of coherent structures such as solitons and breathers. The eventual fate of the modulationally unstable periodic wave strongly depends on the type of dynamics (integrable vs non-integrable) and the shape of the initial perturbation (localised vs periodic vs random, cf. [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]). Some scenarios of the MI development involve the generation of rogue waves—localised coherent structures of unusually large amplitude that emerge unpredictably within otherwise moderate-amplitude wave landscape [12]. It has been well recognised that the one-dimensional cubic focusing NLS equation (fNLSE) represents a paradigmatic model for the description of MI of weakly nonlinear narrow-band short waves (also known as Stokes waves). In the standard normalized form the fNLSE is represented as i\psi_{t}+\psi_{xx}+2|\psi|^{2}\psi=0,\ \ \psi\in\mathbb{C}, (1.1) where \psi(x,t) is the wave envelope, t is the time-like variable and x – the space-like variable (depending on the application, the t-variable in (1.1) can have the meaning of a physical spatial variable, e.g. the propagation length in optical fibres, while the x-variable corresponds to the physical time). There have been numerous analytical, numerical and experimental investigations of various aspects of MI in physical systems modeled by the fNLSE (see [13, 14, 15, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and references therein). The central role in these studies is played by the integrability of the fNLSE in the framework of the inverse scattering transform (IST) developed by Zakharov and Shabat (ZS) [16]. The IST associates the fNLSE evolution with a pair of two linear problems (the so-called Lax pair) one of which is the scattering/eigenvalue problem for the non-self-adjoint Dirac (ZS) operator in which fNLSE solution \psi(x,t) plays the role of the potential. Of particular significance for the theory and applications of MI are two types of exact solutions to the fNLSE (1.1): the plane (continuous) waves described by the spatially uniform time-periodic exponential solution \psi=q\,e^{2iq^{2}t},\ \ q>0, (1.2) and nonlinear spatially periodic waves described by the Jacobi elliptic functions – the “cn” family and the “dn”family. In the literature both families of elliptic solutions are often called “cnoidal waves” and they are classified as genus one fNLSE solutions within the finite-gap theory (the plane waves (1.2) are genus zero solutions) [2, 17, 14]. At the same time, the \mathrm{dn} and \mathrm{cn} solutions have qualitatively different configurations of their ZS spectrum with the (finite-gap) spectrum of dn being located along the imaginary axis while the spectrum of cn solution lying along two Schwartz-symmetric arcs in \mathbb{C} [2, 14]. Both families are modulationally unstable with respect to small perturbations [18, 19]. In this paper we focus on the dn family only. The notion of integrable turbulence, both as a physical phenomenon and as a theoretical framework in which to study random solutions to integrable wave equations, was introduced by V. Zakharov in 2009 [20]. The relation between MI and integrable turbulence was first explored in [7] where the long-time development of a random noise perturbation of a plane wave fNLSE solution was studied numerically. It was shown that the development of spontaneous MI of a plane wave results, in the long time regime, in the emergence of strongly nonlinear statistically stationary integrable turbulence characterised by Gaussian single-point statistics and very peculiar behaviours of the Fourier power spectrum and the autocorrelation function [21]. The numerical results of [7] were extended in [22] to the case of the noise-induced MI of elliptic periodic solutions of fNLSE. It was shown in [22] that, similarly to the spontaneous MI of plane waves, the integrable turbulence developed in the long-time evolution of nonlinear elliptic \mathrm{dn} solutions augmented by a small noise is characterized by stationary statistical distributions, whose concrete form depends on the elliptic parameter m of the initial \mathrm{dn} wave. Specifically, the long-time asymptotic turbulent field was shown to exhibit Gaussianity when m\to 0, i.e. when the \mathrm{dn} function approaches the plane wave, and to display strong deviations from Gaussian statistics as m departs from 0. A soliton gas model of fNLSE integrable turbulence emerging from the development of spontaneous MI of plane waves was proposed in [23]. It was shown numerically that the statistical parameters of long-time integrable turbulence (the probability density function, the power spectrum, the autocorrelation of intensity) agree with high accuracy with those of a soliton condensate — a criticaly dense random N-soliton ensemble with N\gg 1, characterized by the so-called Weyl distribution over the IST spectrum and with the soliton phases (the phases of the norming constants in the N-soliton) being independent random values, each distributed uniformly on [0,2\pi). The theoretical notion of soliton condensates as the special class of soliton gases whose collective (emergent) dynamics are entirely dominated by soliton interactions with no individual soliton states discernible, was introduced in [24]. Various properties of soliton condensates were studied in [25] for the Korteweg-de Vies (KdV) equation and in [26] for the fNLSE. The kinetic theory of soliton gases as out of equilibrium infinite-soliton ensembles characterized by random amplitudes and positions/phases was initiated in 1971 by Zakharov [27] in the context of a low density (rarefied) gas of KdV solitons. This theory has been later generalized to the case of dense KdV gases [28] and further, in [29, 24], to fNLSE soliton and breather gases. The key quantities describing soliton gas in terms of the IST spectrum \lambda\in\mathbb{C} are the density of states (DOS) f(\lambda) and the spectral flux density g(\lambda), the respective analogues of the wavenumber and the frequency of a nonlinear periodic wave. These quantities satisfy the nonlinear dispersion relations (NDRs) first derived for the fNLSE soliton gas in [24]. The NDRs are a pair of integral equations (see (2.5)) parametrized by the so-called spectral scaling function \sigma(\lambda), which can be thought of as a certain analogue of temperature (see [30] for the statistical mechanics interpretation of the spectral theory of a soliton gas for the KdV equation). The soliton condensate limit is spectrally realized in the NDRs by letting \sigma\to 0. As a result, a soliton condensate is uniquely defined by its spectral support, i.e. the locus \Lambda\subset\mathbb{C} of the soliton IST eigenvalues \lambda. Note that generally, the spectral support \Lambda of a condensate can be composed of a finite number of disjoint 1D sets (line intervals, or arcs), \Lambda=\gamma_{1}\cup\gamma_{2}\cup\dots\cup\gamma_{n+1}, where n is called the genus of the condensate. Importantly, the NDRs for soliton condensates can be solved in an explicit form for certain configurations of the spectral support \Lambda, e.g. for the bound state fNLSE condensates with \Lambda\in i\mathbb{R} or for the condensates with a circular spectral support \Lambda=\{\lambda:|\lambda|=r>0\} [24]. The solution f(\lambda),g(\lambda) of the NDRs can then be used for the evaluation of various physical observables in the soliton condensate. Soliton condensates for the KdV equation were shown in [25] to (almost surely) coincide with finite-gap potentials [17, 2]. Such condensates can be viewed as “regular” or “deterministic” soliton gases, which were studied in [31, 32] via asymptotic analysis of the so-called primitive potentials [33]. From this perspective the KdV soliton condensates can be viewed as the “phase-locked”, macroscopically coherent dispersive-hydrodynamic states generalizing the notions of rarefaction and dispersive shock waves [34]. In contrast, the fNLSE soliton condensates are inherently random wave fields due to the random distribution of the soliton phases (which are independent of the soliton positions in space). We note here that in the literature on fNLSE the term “condensate” is often applied to the plane wave solution (1.2). Within the soliton gas framework this solution represents a particular realization of a genus zero bound state soliton condensate corresponding to a specially chosen set of soliton phases. Such solitonic approximation of the plane wave was numerically realized in [35]. The “full” genus zero condensate equipped with a random phase distribution was shown in [23] to accurately model the integrable turbulence resulting from the development of the spontaneous MI of a plane wave. Numerical implementation of a soliton gas is achieved via building N-soliton ensembles with N\gg 1 and appropriately configured distributions for the soliton spectra and norming constants. An effective algorithm of the numerical synthesis of fNLSE soliton gas based on the Darboux transform was developed in [36] (see also [23]). In this paper we extend the results of [23] on the solitonic model of MI of plane waves and show that genus 1 soliton condensates accurately describe the integrable turbulence of the long-time development of the spontaneous MI of the \mathrm{dn} family of nonlinear periodic fNLSE solutions (see Eq. (2.1)). We compare the statistical parameters of the soliton condensate model with the results of direct numerical simulations of fNLSE and observe excellent agreement. In particular, we evaluate analytically the fourth normalized moment of the wave field amplitude related to the kurtosis of the probability density function (PDF) in the soliton condensate and find that our analytical prediction is in excellent agreement with the corresponding value extracted from the numerical simulations of the spontaneous MI development. The obtained dependence of the kurtosis \kappa_{4} of the soliton condensate on the elliptic parameter m of the input \mathrm{dn} solution shows that \kappa_{4}>2 for m>0 indicating a heavy-tailed PDF and implying the presence of rogue waves in the developed “elliptic” integrable turbulence in agreement with earlier numerical results of [22]. The limiting value \kappa=2 corresponds to the Gaussian statistics and is realized for m=0 in the setting of this paper. This is also consistent with the previous results [7, 23] on the spontaneous MI of plane waves since the case m=0 corresponds to the degeneration of the \mathrm{dn} fNLSE solution (2.1) to the plane wave solution (1.2). In this connection we mention a related recent study [37] where the evolution of the elliptic data \psi(x,0)=\mathrm{dn}(x;m) augmented by a small noise perturbation was studied in the small-dispersion (semi-classical) fNLSE framework. In that case the \mathrm{dn} wave (2.1) is not an exact solution of the (small-dispersion) fNLSE, and the resulting integrable turbulence is not modeled by a “pure” soliton condensate as in the present paper but was shown to be approximated by a breather gas with a complex spectral structure. The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we provide a brief summary of the necessary results on MI, integrable turbulence and soliton gases with a particular emphasis on the spectral properties of soliton condensates. Section 3 is central and is devoted to the comparison of the statistical parameters of the genus one soliton condensate with the counterpart parameters obtained from the direct fNLSE numerical simulation of the long-time development of the MI of elliptic \mathrm{dn} wave augmented by random noise of small amplitude. In Section 4 we present conclusions and outloook of our study. The Appendix contains some technical details on the multisoliton solutions of the fNLSE and the description of the numerical methods used."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06853v1,Quartic soliton solutions of a normal dispersion based mode-locked laser,"We studied the characteristics, regions of existence and stability of different types of solitons for a distributed model of a mode-locked laser whose dispersion is purely quartic and normal. Among the different types of solitons, we identified three main branches that are named according to their different amplitude: low, medium and high amplitude solitons. It was found that the first solitons are always unstable while the latter two exist and are stable in relatively large regions of the parameter space. Moreover, the stability regions of medium and high amplitude solitons overlap over a certain range of parameters, manifesting effects of bistability. The energy of high amplitude solitons increases quadratically with their width, whereas the energy of medium amplitude solitons may decrease or increase with the width depending on the parameter region. Furthermore, we have investigated the long term evolution of the continuous wave solutions under modulational instability, showing that medium amplitude solitons can arise in this scenario. Additionally, we assessed the effects of second and third order dispersion on medium and high amplitude solitons and found that both remain stable in the presence of these terms.","Quartic solitons are solitons of optical models whose dispersion is dominated by a fourth order term, whereas the term pure quartic solitons is reserved for models where only the fourth order dispersion is considered. They have been predicted [1, 2, 3] and observed [4, 5] in conservative models but they have been more acclaimed in dissipative models for their advantages in mode-locked lasers and Kerr soliton frequency combs whenever the fourth order dispersion (4OD) is negative (anomalous 4OD). In fact, in mode-locked lasers the negative quartic dispersion may give rise to pulses whose energy scales inversely with the width cubed, enabling very energetic ultrashort pulses [6, 7, 8]. For Kerr combs presenting negative 4OD, the same energy-width relation was found but more importantly solitons spectra is flatter [9]. Quartic solitons have also been studied in more complex models like vectorial models for mode-locked lasers [10] and a fiber resonator model allowing orbital angular momentum carrying modes [11]. In case of positive 4OD (also named normal 4OD), solitons do not exist for conservative models based on Kerr nonlinearity [12] but do exist in dissipative models. A triangular-shaped pulse with a double peak spectrum has been reported by Runge et al. [13] for a modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) comprising positive 4OD, Kerr effect and gain as well as for a mode-locked laser lumped model. Note that, this kind of pulses was already reported as non-soliton solutions of the NLSE with positive second order dispersion (2OD) and positive 4OD [14]. Another type of soliton solution for mode-locked laser models with positive 4OD was reported in [15, 7] which also presents a double-peaked spectrum but whose temporal profile consists of a sech central part on top of a large pedestal. Recently and while we were obtaining the results here reported, existence regions for both solutions by considering the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) were reported elsewhere [16]. In [15], a third kind of solution that is asymmetrical was reported. Nevertheless, all the reported solutions of mode-locked lasers dominated by normal 4OD were not yet sufficiently studied in terms of pulse characteristics, energy-width relation, regions of existence and stability, coexistence and onset from continuous wave evolution. Here, we report a thorough study of soliton solutions of a distributed model for mode-locked lasers [17, 7] dominated by normal fourth order dispersion. Two of the solutions are similar to the above referred solutions, namely, the triangular-shaped and the sech-pulse above a pedestal. We have found that they coexist in some region of the parameter space, at which they are also stable, manifesting dynamics of bistability. The other ones were obtained by solving the associated ordinary differential equation but are shown to be unstable. Three main branches of those solutions (one always unstable and two stable in some regions) are characterized in terms of amplitude, phase and spectrum profiles and in terms of energy exchange with the exterior and within themselves. The other branches occur on a bifurcation region of parameters and only the amplitude profiles are presented. The parameter regions of existence and stability of the two stable solutions are determined and their energy-width scaling is analyzed. The model is also studied concerning the modulational instability of its continuous wave (cw) solution and the relation of the modulational instability and the onset of solitons is analyzed. The influence of lower order dispersion terms, namely, second order dispersion (2OD) and third order dispersion (3OD), on the existence and stability of the stable solitons is investigated."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06044v1,Thermal lifetime of breathers,"In this article, we explore the lifetime of localized excitations in nonlinear lattices, called breathers, when a thermalized lattice is perturbed with localized energy delivered to a single site. We develop a method to measure the time it takes for the system to approach equilibrium based on a single scalar quantity, the participation number, and deduce the value corresponding to thermal equilibrium. We observe the time to achieve thermalization as a function of the energy of the excited site. We explore a variety of different physical system models. The result is that the lifetime of breathers increases exponentially with the breather energy for all the systems. These results may provide a method to detect the existence of breathers in real systems.","Discrete breathers (DB) are exact localized vibrations in nonlinear lattices [1, 2, 3, 4]. They are also called Intrinsic Localized Modes (ILM) [5], to distinguish them from the localized Anderson modes due to disorder, an external impurity, a defect, or an interface in a lattice [6, 7]. Usually, discrete breather solutions cannot be obtained in closed analytical form. However, they can be constructed numerically with arbitrary machine precision, and, in that case, they are called exact breathers [8, 9, 10, 11]. Numerical simulations of the evolution of exact solutions can continue forever at zero temperature. This is because exact DB solutions are usually exponentially localized on an infinitely large lattice, such that the energy of these solutions is finite, and their average energy density is exactly zero. However, introducing the concept of temperature or simply finite energy density usually implies a finite lifetime for any coherent excitations, which is an important feature to measure or estimate when studying breathers in physical systems. The existence and lifetime of breathers can be of importance in environments where they will be created in large quantities, as fusion tokamak reactors [12], where the impact of neutrons and alpha particles will produce many of them. Their slow relaxation may prevent the evacuation of heat at the desired rate with undesirable consequences. The effect could be even more remarkable if breathers can bind to an electric charge in the materials used [13]. An early attempt to quantify the lifetimes of DBs on a nonzero thermal background was reported in [14], where simulations were performed to detect long-lasting local fluctuations and their lifetimes as a function of the energy density of the background. The fluctuation lifetime grew with the energy density, seemingly in an exponentially fast way. This approach was clearly not capable of measuring the lifetimes of strongly excited breathers due to computational limitations. Also, the energies of the longest-lasting local fluctuations depended on the computational time - the longer the time, the more probable a larger fluctuation becomes. A more recent study by Iubini et al [15] planted local breather excitations into a discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation (DNLS). They were motivated by the fact that the microcanonical DNLS dynamics features thermal states with Gibbs statistics but also non-Gibbs ones with nonergodic features [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] due to the presence of an additional (to the already existing energy) integral of motion related to the total norm or a classical analog of the total number of particles of quantum many-body systems. The study monitored the local norm at the original site of the breather excitation, introduced an ad hoc threshold to its value at which the breather was assumed to be destroyed, and measured the time to reach that threshold. The study found approximate exponential dependence of the breather’s lifetime on its norm. Finally, around the same time, Danieli et al [21] introduced a method to define and measure the lifetime of the fluctuation of any observable using the ergodic hypothesis. They applied this method successfully to measure the lifetime of long wavelength mode excitations in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) systems to address the FPUT paradox of lifetimes of anomalous initial states and quenches, but also to address the statistics of lifetime fluctuations at thermal equilibrium. We are going to use this method below. In this article, we address the issue of breather lifetimes by studying systems that are more general than the DNLS one, which in general lack nontrivial second integrals of motion, and which are supposed to show proper Gibbs statistics and ergodicity for any choice of the relevant energy density. Instead of an ad hoc threshold value for local energy, we use the participation number P as an observable and measure the inhomogeneity of energy density distribution in the system. At thermal equilibrium, the participation number P on any ergodic trajectory is forced to fluctuate around its temporal and thus phase space average endlessly. We compute the thermal average of P and measure the time interval it takes for a breather excitation on top of a thermal background to decrease the participation number down to its thermal average for the first time. We find strong exponential dependence of the thermalization time as a function of the breather excitation energy by studying four different, fairly generic systems, consisting of units described by a coordinate u_{n}, which can be a spacial coordinate or a different magnitude, and its momentum p_{n}. For simplicity, we will often refer to each unit as an oscillator or particle. Moreover, we find that the exponential dependence is strongly influenced by the temperature, i.e. energy density, of the system background. The first three systems represent a lattice of particles that experience an on-site potential V(u_{n}), where u_{n} is the coordinate of the n^{th} particle, and the particles are coupled with their nearest neighbors through an interaction potential U(u_{n+1}-u_{n}). The on-site potential represents an external field, or, if the described system is a subsystem of a larger system, the interaction with the rest of the system. The first two systems have a quartic on-site potential and harmonic coupling, that is: H=\sum_{n}\frac{1}{2}p_{n}^{2}+V(u_{n})+U(u_{n+1}-u_{n})=\sum_{n}\frac{% \displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle 2}p_{n}^{2}+\omega_{0}^{2}\left(\frac{u_{n}^{2}% }{2}+s\frac{u_{n}^{4}}{4}\right)+\kappa\frac{\displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle 2}% (u_{n+1}-u_{n})^{2}\,, (1) where the nonlinearity parameter s can be +1 or -1. If s is positive, an isolated particle will have a frequency that increases with the oscillation amplitude, or, as it is commonly called, a hard potential. This system, labeled QH, will be the first system studied, followed by the opposite case, that is, the quartic soft potential (QS) with s=-1, which becomes the second system. The third, more realistic system, has a Frenkel-Kontorova on-site potential [22, 23], that is, a sinusoidal function, which models the periodicity of the lattice. The coupling potential is the Lennard-Jones potential, which represents a realistic interaction between atoms, that repel very strongly when they get close and gradually vanishes when they move apart [24, 25, 26]. We will denote it as FKLJ. The fourth system will have no on-site potential, but a sinusoidal type coupling, and represents a Josephson junction network [27, 28]. As the coordinate describing an oscillator is an angle, it is also called a rotor, and the system can also represent a chain of coupled pendula [27] that can rotate. We will often refer to this analog as it is easier to understand. We will denote this system as JJN. In this study, the first step is to obtain information about the discrete breather energies and characteristics. In the appendices, we describe the method to obtain exact breathers from the anticontinuous limit and their properties in the four different systems. The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2, we introduce the participation number P, deduce its value at thermal equilibrium, and demonstrate that numerical simulations are coherent with this interpretation. Sec. 3 describes the creation of localized breather energy over a thermalized system and the system’s time evolution towards thermal equilibrium. The following Section 4 is dedicated to the computation of breathers’ lifetime and analysis of differences in numerical results in the systems under study. The different systems are analyzed in four subsections: the quartic hard and soft potentials in Sec. 4.1 and Sec. 4.2, respectively, the Frenkel-Kontorova Lennard-Jones system in Sec. 4.3 and the model for Josephson junction arrays in Sec. 4.4. The paper concludes with the conclusions, acknowledgments, funding, and a short reference to the computational means that have been used. The appendices include analytical and computational details about discrete breathers in the four different systems. Figure 1: (Left:) System QH with \omega_{0}=1 and \kappa=0.05: Evolution of the participation number P for the mean thermal energy h=0.02 with the hard quartic potential and with number of particles N=64. We can see that the time-averaged participation number \langle P\rangle is slightly above N/2. (Right:) System QS: Identical representation for the soft potential with the same parameters. In both cases, generally speaking, \langle P\rangle is 1-2 particles above N/2, but for some realizations, it can also be below depending on the length of the observation time window."
