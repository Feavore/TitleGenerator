https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10327v1,Radio-frequency induced Autler-Townes Effect for single- and double-photon magnetic-dipole transitions in the Cesium ground state,"We have observed the Autler-Townes effect in single- and suspected double-photon magnetic-dipole transitions in the Cesium ground-state magnetic-sublevel manifold. Experiments were performed in a Cesium vapor cell. The D1 line was excited by laser radiation to create ground-state optical polarization, and transitions between the ground-state magnetic sublevels were excited by radio-frequency (RF) radiation. Two different excitation geometries were studied: in one case the electric field vector of the linearly polarized laser radiation was parallel to the static magnetic field, whereas in the other case these vectors were perpendicular. The oscillating magnetic field produced by the RF coils was in the plane perpendicular to the electric field vector of the laser radiation. The Autler-Townes effect was confirmed by its linear dependence on the RF magnetic field amplitude, which is proportional to the Rabi frequency, in the case of single-photon transitions. We also observed peaks that by their position appeared to correspond to double and even triple photon transitions, which were more pronounced when the DC magnetic field and optical electric field vectors were perpendicular. In the peak at an energy that corresponds to two photons, splitting with a quadratic dependence on the RF magnetic field amplitude could be observed. The experimental measurements are supplemented by theoretical calculations of a model J=1\longrightarrow J=0 system.","Applying optical and radio frequency (RF) fields simultaneously to a multi-level system with Zeeman splitting in a magnetic field has long been used to study the Zeeman structure Brossel and Bitter (1952). Optical-RF double resonance techniques continue to be relevant for magnetometry applications Weis et al. (2006); Di Domenico et al. (2007); Zigdon et al. (2010); Le Gal et al. (2021); Bertrand et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2022); Le Gal and Palacios Laloy (2022). RF fields are simple to produce, and the external magnetic field value can be obtained easily from the position of the optical-RF double resonance peaks in absorption or fluorescence, making them very convenient for magnetometry. Moreover, with proper design, RF coils can be added to a 2-axis optical magnetometer Le Gal et al. (2019) to convert it into a 3-axis magnetometer. As is well known when the RF field is in resonance with a magnetic sublevel transition, the population distribution generated by the optical pumping is modified as transitions induced by the RF field take place between the magnetic sublevels. The result is a peak in the absorption or fluorescence signal, and the peak position can be directly connected to the external magnetic field strength. As usual, an optimization must be performed between the signal contrast and width, both of which are increased as the RF field Rabi frequency is increased. For particularly large RF field Rabi frequencies, these peaks are split into doublets as a result of the Autler-Townes (AT) effect Autler and Townes (1955). Autler and Townes used a strong RF field to excite electric-dipole transitions among the J=1 and J=2 sublevels of OCS molecules and probed the resulting energy-level splitting with a weaker microwave field that connected the J=1 ground state with the J=2 excited state. Later experiments used two optical fields, where a strong pump field induced the splitting in a transition while a weak probe field was scanned across this transition to show the characteristic double peak associated with the AT effect Gray and Stroud (1978); Delsart and Keller (1976). The magnitude of the splitting is proportional to the square root of the pump field intensity, which is to say, proportional to the pump field Rabi frequency. The AT effect was studied in an optical-RF double resonance experiment Bechtel and Fick (1987) by pumping the Na D1 line and probing with weak RF field that induced transitions in the ground-state magnetic sublevels. Again, the magnitude of the AT splitting was found to be proportional to the square root of the pump laser intensity. In this work we observed the AT splitting caused not by optical radiation that induced electric dipole transitions, but by an RF field that induced magnetic dipole transitions between the ground-state sublevels of Cesium while the D1 line was pumped with moderately intense, linearly polarized laser radiation. The transitions between the ground-state sublevels and the AT splitting of these transitions were observed by changes in the absorption of the optical light. Two cases were studied: (i) the electric field vector \mathbf{E} of the laser radiation was parallel to a DC, external magnetic field \mathbf{B} (\mathbf{E}\parallel\mathbf{B}), and (ii) the electric field vector of the laser radiation was perpendicular to the DC magnetic field (\mathbf{E}\perp\mathbf{B}). Both configurationas are shown in Fig. 1. In the second case, in addition to expected optical-RF double resonance transitions between ground-state magnetic sublevels, transitions were also observed at magnetic fields at which the energy difference between two adjacent magnetic sublevels corresponded to twice the RF photon energy, and these also displayed AT splitting at large amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field B_{RF}. While the magnitude of the AT splitting was linear in the Rabi frequency of the RF field for the standard, single-photon transitions, it was quadratic for the transitions corresponding to twice the photon energy. The energy difference and the quadratic dependence of the AT splitting on the Rabi frequency lead us to suspect that these peaks could be attributed to double-photon transitions, although as yet we have not been able to develop a numerical model to explain this little-studied effect. Figure 1: Excitation geometries: (a) \mathbf{E}\parallel\mathbf{B}; (b) \mathbf{E}\perp\mathbf{B} . For the standard case, the splitting between the two peaks \Delta E is given by \Delta E=E_{+}-E_{-}=\hbar\Omega_{RF}=\mu B_{RF}^{0}, (1) where E_{+} and E_{-} are the positions of the right and left peaks, respectively, and \Omega_{RF} is the Rabi frequency associated with the amplitude of the RF field B_{RF}^{0}, and \mu=\langle i|\hat{\mu}|j\rangle is the magnetic dipole transition strength between sublevels |i\rangle and |j\rangle in the hyperfine level under consideration. Finally, in both cases, we also observed a peak that corresponds to a transition that skipped a magnetic sublevel, which would normally be forbidden, being nominally a \Delta m=2 transition. However, in the geometry of case (ii) perhaps such a transition was allowed because of the magnetic sublevel mixing caused by the RF magnetic field perpendicular to the quantization axis. In addition to the experimental measurements, we have created a theoretical model based on the Liouville equation and implemented this model in the Julia language using the QuantumOptics.jl package Krämer et al. (2018). The model is implemented for a J=1\longrightarrow J=0 transition in order to calculate at least the single-photon AT effect and demonstrate qualitative agreement with the experiments."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10221v1,"Trajectory effects on charge exchange and energy loss in collisions of H, He, Li, and Be ions with atomic hydrogen","The charge exchange and energy loss processes provide insights into fundamental processes across physical, chemical, and engineered systems. While this field has been thoroughly investigated, a clear study on trajectory effects is lacking, particularly in the context of inelastic processes at low energies. In this work, we address this gap by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for the electron in a numerical lattice with a coupled electron-nuclear dynamics approach as well as a straight-line trajectory approximation for the nuclei to asses trajectory effects on charge exchange and energy loss. The collision dynamics are studied using bare ion projectiles with charge Z=1-4 incident on atomic hydrogen in an energy range of 0.1 to 900 keV/u. We find that the charge exchange process is trajectory-independent within the energy range considered, showing excellent agreement with available experimental and theoretical data. However, projectile energy loss exhibits strong trajectory dependence, with the straight-line approximation overestimating energy loss at low collision energies due to the forced linear path. Our results for electronic stopping cross sections with electron-nuclear coupled trajectories are consistent with the available experimental data at high collision energies. At low energies, nuclear energy loss becomes prominent, driven by polarization effects induced by the ion charge on the hydrogen target. Overall, our work highlights the importance of nuclear trajectory considerations in collision dynamics and offers a foundation for further investigations of more complex systems.","Ion-atom collisions have been researched for over a century due to their role in understanding fundamental atomic structure Rutherford (1911); Bohr (1948). Bare ions, which are completely stripped of electrons, are the simplest systems to conduct these studies with because they lack the complexity of multi-electron systems. In a collision, many inelastic processes can occur such as the transfer of an electron from the target to the projectile. This is called charge exchange or electron capture, and it plays a central role in the neutralization process Heisenberg (1926). The charge exchange process has been studied in many fields such as plasma and fusion research, astrophysics, and medicine. The necessity for diagnostics in plasma confinement devices such as tokamaks propelled the early interest for electron capture reactions, especially in fully stripped low-Z ions Isler (1994); Fonck et al. (1984). Solar wind, rich in protons and alpha particles, was found to drive charge exchange processes responsible for characteristic X-ray emissions from comets Cravens (1997), planetary atmospheres Carter et al. (2012), and even in regions of the interstellar medium Dennerl (2010). Additionally, charge exchange plays an important role in ion beam radiation therapy for cancer treatment Champion et al. (2015), particularly in the context of proton impact on hydrogen for water dissociation, where understanding radiation damage at the molecular level is crucial Luna et al. (2007). To maximize the efficacy of these applications, it is essential to understand the physics that governs the collision dynamics. For slow and low-Z ion-atom collisions, the atomic framework breaks down. In the energy region of less than 1 keV/u, a quasi-molecular representation becomes relevant, which treats the ion and atom as a single entity due to the sharing of the electron Bransden (1972); Gaussorgues et al. (1975). If the ion-atom pair exhibits nuclear symmetry, the lower-lying stationary states become degenerate. The H{}_{2}^{+} molecule is the simplest example, where the electron oscillates between the resonant molecular states Lichten (1963). This is known as resonant charge transfer, which was first observed in the H++H(1s) system by Lockwood and Everhart Lockwood and Everhart (1962). Since then, electron capture cross sections for low-Z bare ion collisions with atomic hydrogen have been extensively studied, especially for the H++H(1s) McClure (1996); Hvelplund and Anderson (1982); Gealy and Van Zyl (1987); Schwab et al. (1987), He2++H(1s) Havener et al. (2005); Shah and Gilbody (1978); Sant’Anna et al. (2000); Hoekstra et al. (1991); Basalaev et al. (2020), and Li3++H(1s) Seim et al. (1981); Shah et al. (1978) systems. However, the Be4++H(1s) collision remains experimentally untouched due to the poisonous nature of beryllium. In cases where experimental data is difficult or impossible to obtain, theoretical models are invaluable. These models also serve as complements to experimental results and help to contextualize findings. For instance, the resonant charge transfer process was investigated using the electron-nuclear dynamics (END) method for the H++H(1s) system Deumens et al. (1994) to understand the importance of non-adiabatic effects for higher collision energies Killian et al. (2004) and for the He2++1-3H systems to study isotopic effects on charge transfer Stolterfoht et al. (2007). The END method has also been used to study charge exchange and energy loss of the proton-hydrogen collision Cabrera-Trujillo et al. (2000). In fact, the development of computational approaches to study the inelastic processes of ion-atom collisions has been significant. The main methods and models include solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) Ludde and Dreizler (1983, 1982), lattice TDSE (LTDSE) Schultz et al. (1999); Minami et al. (2006, 2008); Kołakowska et al. (1999), GridTDSE (GTDSE) Jorge et al. (2016); Hill et al. (2023), basis generator method (BGM) Leung and Kirchner (2022); Hill et al. (2023), classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) Olson and Salop (1977); Minami et al. (2008); Botheron and Pons (2011); Schultz et al. (1991); Ziaeian and Tőkési (2021); Jorge et al. (2015); Abrines and Percival (1966); Elizaga et al. (1999); Errea et al. (2004); Hill et al. (2023), atomic orbital close-coupling (AOCC) Minami et al. (2008); Fritsch and Lin (1982, 1984); Agueny et al. (2019); Toshima (1994); Errea et al. (2006); Liu et al. (2014); Bransden et al. (1983); Hill et al. (2023), molecular orbital close-coupling (MOCC) Botheron and Pons (2011); Harel et al. (1998); Elizaga et al. (1999); Errea et al. (2004); Krstić (2004), and other close-coupling treatments such as the Sturmian-pseudostate Winter (2007), hidden crossing (HCCC) Havener et al. (2005); Janev and Ivanovskis (1996); Krstić (2004), hyperspherical (HSCC) Le et al. (2004), common-reaction-coordinates (CRC) Le et al. (2004), wave-packet convergent (WP-CCC) Antonio et al. (2021); Hill et al. (2023), and two-center quantum mechanical convergent (QM-CCC) Abdurakhmanov et al. (2016) methods. There are also perturbative methods which have been shown to be more successful for high energy collisions than most of the classical and semi-classical methods mentioned above. These include various distorted wave approximations such as boundary-corrected continuum-intermediate-state method (BCIS) Milojević et al. (2020), unitarized-distorted-wave-approximation (UDWA) Ryufuku (1982), and continuum-distorted wave (CDW) Sant’Anna et al. (2000)) models. Other perturbative approaches include adiabatic Lichten (1963), first Born Errea et al. (2006), and eikonal impulse approximations Jorge et al. (2015), as well as the Bohr-Lindhard model Ding et al. (2009). While there are extensive methods for studying ion-atom collisions, the primary theoretical works for calculating electron capture cross sections of bare ion projectiles include the (L)TDSE, AOCC, and CTMC methods. The first application of the TDSE method used a two-center-basis representation for fully stripped ions with charge Z=1-5, done by Lüdde and Dreizler Ludde and Dreizler (1983, 1982). However, the method required a large number of basis states, which made initial computations expensive. Later, the LTDSE solution was developed to bridge gaps between theoretical results and offered a level of precision that compared to that of the leading models including AOCC and MOCC, despite no use of basis sets Schultz et al. (1999). Among the AOCC approaches, methods used by Fritsch and Lin (AO expansion) (AO+) Fritsch and Lin (1982, 1984), Lin et al. (two-center (2C)-AOCC) Liu et al. (2014), and Toshima (AOCC) Toshima (1994) have been successfully applied to He2+, Li3+, and Be4+ projectiles for a wide range of energies. A comparative study by Minami et al. Minami et al. (2008) evaluated the LTDSE, AOCC, and CTMC methods in an energy range of \sim 1 to 1000 keV/u by comparing with experimental values for total and state-selective cross sections for electron capture in the He2++H(1s) collision. They found that while both LTDSE and AOCC agree well with experiment in the entire energy range, LTDSE is ideal for low energies where the atomic orbital framework breaks down. They also note that CTMC gains reliability for high energies and capture into higher n levels, which can be classically described. Previously considered less accurate for low energy collisions, the CTMC method has seen recent developments. Work by Ziaeian and Tőkési on the Be4++H(1s) system demonstrated that accounting for quantum behavior significantly improves the accuracy of CTMC, rivaling semi-classical models Ziaeian and Tőkési (2021). It is clear that theoretical studies within the field of atomic collision dynamics are plentiful, yet most rely on straight-line trajectories and overlook potential trajectory effects. In this work, we address this gap by investigating energy transfer in collisions by comparing the straight-line approximation with dynamic trajectories that account for electron-nuclear coupling. Our approach utilizes LTDSE solutions to evaluate the efficacy of the method with fully stripped ions. Motivated by the recent straight-line trajectory calculations for energy deposition within a time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) framework Ponomareva et al. (2024); Li et al. (2023); Nichols et al. (2023); Pang et al. (2022), we believe that settling the question of trajectory effects is necessary. We focus on charge transfer and energy deposition processes in collisions of H+, He2+, Li3+, and Be4+ ions with the ground state of atomic hydrogen over an energy range of 0.1 to 900 keV/u. By comparing trajectory calculation methods, we evaluate the role of nuclear motion and identify the limitations of the straight-line approximation in these systems. Our method enables precise convergence at each time step within the lattice structure, so that our results can serve as a benchmark not only for the current studied systems but also for more complex multi-electron systems."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10211v1,Mixing High Harmonic Generation and X-ray Second Harmonic Generation,"We theoretically demonstrate the mixing of laser-driven high harmonic generation (HHG) and x-ray second harmonic generation (SHG) in gas-phase atoms, highlighting its potential as a powerful spectroscopic tool for studying atomic and molecular systems. Our simulations confirm the generation of HHG with x-ray SHG (HHG-XSHG) from atomic core electrons through the rescattering of electrons from x-ray two-photon excitation and subsequent tunneling ionization in an optical laser field. The resulting HHG-XSHG spectrum features a broadband multi-peak structure and a distinct spectral cutoff in the x-ray regime. These findings indicate that HHG-XSHG is a valuable technique for probing core-electron dynamics, generating attosecond x-ray pulses, and exploring nonlinear interactions, effectively merging laser-driven attosecond technology with nonlinear x-ray methodologies provided by x-ray free-electron lasers.","Attosecond technology based on laser-driven high harmonic generation (HHG) has emerged as a powerful tool due to its attosecond temporal resolution [1]. Over the past decades, it has demonstrated numerous applications in gas-phase atomic, molecular physics, and condensed matter studies [2, 3]. However, one limitation of laser-driven HHG sources is the restricted photon energy due to low conversion efficiency in the x-ray regime. This limitation has urged the development of methods to extend the capabilities of HHG in the x-ray regime, where higher photon energies can offer deeper insights into core-electron dynamics and other fundamental processes. Simultaneously, the advent of x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) has revolutionized nonlinear spectroscopy, including second harmonic generation (SHG), by extending these techniques into the x-ray regime. XFELs offer unprecedented opportunities for material characterization with atomic precision, enabling the probing of core-level electronic transitions and providing element-specific information with atomic-scale spatial resolution [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 6, 9, 10]. This breakthrough has paved the way for studying complex systems, including nanostructures, multilayered materials, and materials with strong electron correlations and magnetic properties. The intense pulses from XFELs further facilitate the investigation of nonlinear interactions and higher-order effects, positioning x-ray SHG as a transformative approach for advancing research in material science, condensed matter physics, and nanotechnology. Since the invention of the laser, second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy and microscopy have evolved into highly sensitive nonlinear optical techniques extensively used for material studies [11]. By converting incident light into a new frequency that is double the original, SHG offers a sensitive means of probing surfaces, interfaces, and non-centrosymmetric systems inherently lacking inversion symmetry. SHG has found broad application across diverse fields, including surface science, biological imaging, and the characterization of nonlinear materials [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Moreover, time-resolved SHG techniques with ultrafast temporal resolution provide vital insights into rapid dynamical processes, making them indispensable for studying ultrafast structural changes and dynamics [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. However, achieving x-ray SHG in randomly oriented gas-phase atoms and molecules poses significant challenges due to the lack of global inversion symmetry. As a second-order nonlinear process, SHG is forbidden in centrosymmetric environments [11], and there have been no experimental reports of x-ray SHG in such systems. To address these limitations in HHG and x-ray SHG, we propose a method that combines laser-driven HHG with x-ray SHG (HHG-XSHG). This HHG-XSHG method uses an intense optical laser field along with an x-ray pulse to interact with core electrons in an atom, as illustrated in Fig. 1. This combined external field enables nonlinear interactions, facilitating the generation of HHG-XSHG. The optical laser perturbs the electron cloud populated through x-ray two-photon excitation, creating transient dipoles that allow the recombination of the electron with the core hole, thereby enabling HHG-XSHG. This approach extends the potential of HHG and nonlinear x-ray spectroscopy, enabling x-ray SHG in gas-phase systems where it was previously unfeasible. Figure 1: Schematic of the HHG-XSHG process. The 1s core electron of an atom is excited to an unoccupied ns state through the absorption of two x-ray photons. The electron in the ns state is driven by a near-infrared laser field, which enables recombination back to the 1s state, resulting in the emission of a photon with energy approximately twice that of the incoming x-ray photons. In this work, we simulate the HHG-XSHG process using the single active core electron approximation by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. To enhance the HHG-XSHG signal, we leverage a two-photon excitation resonance, where two x-ray photons excite the system from a core-level state to a valence state. By tuning the x-ray photon energy to match a core-to-valence transition, we significantly enhance the nonlinear interaction, leading to a substantial increase the generation efficiency of HHG in the x-ray regime. This resonant enhancement not only boosts the HHG-XSHG signal but also provides valuable insights into core-electron dynamics and ultrafast processes in gas-phase atoms and molecules."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10021v1,Measurement and feedforward correction of the fast phase noise of lasers,"Lasers are the workhorse of quantum engineering in the atomic-molecular-optic community. However, phase noise of the laser, which can be especially large in popular semiconductor-based lasers, can limit gate fidelity. Here, we present a fully-fiberized instrument detecting and correcting the fast, sub-microsecond, phase fluctuations of lasers. We demonstrate a measurement noise floor of less than 0.1 Hz2/Hz, and a noise suppression of more than 20 dB for Fourier frequencies in the 1 to 10 MHz region (reaching up to 30 dB at 3 MHz), where noise is critical for Rydberg-based quantum gates. Finally, we observe the improvement offered by this fast phase noise eater on a Raman transition driven by two such stabilized lasers. These measurement and correction techniques are important tools for high-fidelity manipulation of the excited electronic states of atoms and molecules.","Over recent decades, quantum simulation and computation have advanced considerably across platforms, including trapped ions [1, 2], superconducting qubits [3], photonic qubits [4], and cold atoms [5]. To ensure accurate outcomes of the machine, high-fidelity coherent control is crucial for each platform [6, 7, 8, 9]. While external factors often introduce decoherence, the control mechanisms themselves can also inadvertently contribute. Specifically, in neutral-atom or trapped-ion systems, where laser-driven dynamics of a valence electron play a central role, employing highly stable lasers is crucial. Focusing on the problem of driving transition of neutral atoms to Rydberg states, the dominant decoherence sources [10, 8, 11] include the Doppler effect, spontaneous emissions via the intermediate state used for the two-photon excitation, and laser intensity and phase noise [12, 13]—the latter being the focal point of this article. Intuitively, the laser phase needs to be stable on a timescale of 0.1 to 1 microsecond during which the electron is manipulated (literally, shaken) by the laser field. A naive, but illustrative, requirement to suppress the error of a laser-driven quantum gate at the 10^{-3} level (0.1 %) would be to ask for less than \phi_{\rm rms}=(2\pi)\times 10^{-3}=6 mrad of phase fluctuation in 1 microsecond. Assuming white frequency noise, this translates to a power spectral density (PSD) of phase noise S_{\phi}(f)=\phi_{\rm rms}^{2}/f=4\times 10^{-11} rad2/Hz at Fourier frequency f=1 MHz, or equivalently a white frequency noise of S_{\nu}(f)=f^{2}S_{\phi}(f)=40 Hz2/Hz. In fact, driven systems are more robust than this simple estimate, and recent analysis indicate that, at such level of PSD, error of manipulation are already suppress at the 0.01 % level [14, 11]. While sources of electromagnetic radiation in the microwave domain can easily pass such phase noise requirements, this can be harder to achieve with lasers, often for fundamental reasons (the Schawlow-Townes limit). The best performers are bulk-cavity solid-state lasers (TiSapph, Nd:YAG, …), with well below 1 Hz2/Hz at MHz Fourier frequencies, thanks to their narrow-linewidth cavity design, thus offering highly-stable drives already appreciated by the Rydberg-atom community [15, 16]. But they pose other challenges in terms of wavelength coverage, as well as size and cost (SWaP-C). A popular alternative are semiconductor-based lasers, displaying a much wider coverage and high-level of integration. However, these lasers have a large quantum-limited frequency noise floor (10^{6} Hz2/Hz, for a basic Fabry-Perot design). While this can be mitigated by more advanced architecture, such as with extended-cavity diode lasers (ECDLs), their noise level (10^{2}-10^{4} Hz2/Hz) are still too large. Promisingly, novel designs that recently reached commercialization — based on vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting laser (VECSEL) [17, 18], or self-injection-locked (SIL) laser diodes [19, 20] —, could pass the requirement. Easily measuring the frequency noise of such lasers is a first motivation of this work. Alternatively, the phase noise of a laser can be suppressed externally. A first solution is to pass the laser through a passive filter realized with a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity[21, 22], which demonstrated great improvements [13]. A drawback of this approach is the limited output power and tunability. Another approach is to actively correct the laser’s phase. There, feedback correction on the laser diode current or cavity length is commonly employed, and is hugely successful for suppressing slower technical noise from acoustic fluctuations or thermal drifts. However, this fails at suppressing the fast, sub-microsecond, phase fluctuation of interest here. The finite travel time of information around the feedback loop sets a maximum correction bandwidth of a few MHz [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. This limitation can be evaded if the correction is not fed back to the laser, but rather fed forward to a phase actuator [29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. Correcting the fast phase noise with a feedforward approach is the second aspect of this work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09958v1,Post-selection shifts the transition frequency of helium in an atomic beam,"Post-selecting output states in measurements can effectively amplify weak signals and improve precision. However, post-selection effects may also introduce unintended biases in precision measurements. Here, we investigate the influence of post-selection in the precision spectroscopy of the 2^{3}S-2^{3}P transition of helium (4He) using an atomic beam. We directly observe that post-selection based on atomic positions causes a shift in the measured transition frequency, amounting to approximately -55 kHz. After accounting for this post-selection shift, we obtain a corrected frequency of 276,764,094,712.45\pm 0.86 kHz for the 2^{3}S_{1}-2^{3}P_{0} transition. Combining this result with existing data for 3He, we derive a new value for the difference in squared nuclear charge radii, \delta r^{2}[r_{h}^{2}-r_{\alpha}^{2}]=1.0733\pm 0.0021 fm2. This value shows a 2.8\sigma deviation from measurements of muonic helium ions, potentially pointing to new physics that challenges lepton universality in quantum electrodynamics.","Over the past few decades, quantum mechanics has profoundly reshaped our understanding of nature, facilitating the development of technologies that defy classical intuitions. One of the intriguing quantum effects is post-selection (PS) and weak value amplification (WVA) [1, 2, 3]. By selectively detecting outcomes in a weak interaction measurement, PS and WVA can enhance the measurement signal, though this comes at the cost of discarding part of the observed data [4]. Despite some controversy surrounding its counterintuitive nature in recent years [5], WVA has found applications in precision measurement [6] and inspired new ideas in quantum technologies [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. This quantum mechanical effect has particular relevance for precision measurements, where even very tiny spectroscopic shifts in atoms and molecules can be crucial for tasks such as maintaining accurate time [14], detecting weak forces [15, 16], and testing fundamental physical models [17, 18]. Although post-selection can enhance the precision of measurements involving multiple degrees of freedom, it may also introduce systematic shifts that must be carefully accounted for. In this work, we investigate the impact of post-selection on the precision spectroscopy of the 2^{3}S-2^{3}P transition of 4He in an atomic beam. We observed an unexpected discrepancy in the results depending on how the experimental data is analyzed, which we attribute to PS effects. This interpretation is supported by theoretical analysis and simulations. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully considering subtle quantum effects, like post-selection, in high-precision measurements. Precise measurements of helium atom transition frequencies have long been used to determine nuclear charge radii, as electron penetration into the non-pointlike nucleus causes energy level shifts that depend on the nucleus’s size. Recent spectroscopy [19, 20, 21] of the 2^{3}S-2^{1}S transitions in 3He and 4He provided the difference between the squared charge radii of these two nuclei, \delta r^{2}[r_{h}^{2}-r_{\alpha}^{2}]=r^{2}(3He) -r^{2}(4He). This result deviated by 3.6\sigma from measurements derived from spectroscopy [22, 23] of the muonic helium ion (\mu-He+), in which the electron is replaced by a muon. A similar discrepancy was noted in measurements of the proton charge radius, which has been studied extensively using hydrogen atom (e-H) spectroscopy [24], but shows a significant deviation when measured using muonic hydrogen (\mu-H) [25], leading to the well-known “proton radius puzzle”. In light of these findings, our results of 4He, combined with the 3He result of Cancio Pastor et al. [26], allow us to compare the \delta r^{2} value from e-He spectroscopy with that from the precise spectroscopy of \mu-He+, providing a rigorous test of the equivalence of leptons in electromagnetic interactions. Should these deviations be confirmed, they could pose a significant challenge to the Standard Model, as the muon and electron are believed to share identical electromagnetic properties in quantum electrodynamics (QED)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09912v1,The hyperfine anomaly in mercury and test of the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule,"The Moskowitz-Lombardi rule gives a simple relation between the magnetic moment of an atomic nucleus and the effect of its radial distribution on the hyperfine structure – the magnetic hyperfine anomaly or “Bohr-Weisskopf” effect. It was originally formulated for mercury, for which experimental data for nuclear magnetic moments and hyperfine constants were available for a number of isotopes. While the relation for the differential effect between isotopes may be completely determined experimentally, the value for the additive constant that is needed to give the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) effect for a single isotope has remained untested. In this work, we determine the BW effect in singly-ionized and neutral mercury from experimental muonic-199Hg data together with our atomic calculations. We check this result by directly extracting the BW effect from the hyperfine constant for 199Hg+ using state-of-the-art atomic many-body calculations. From this we deduce an empirical value for the additive constant in the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule, which differs significantly from the values advocated previously.","References Ginges and Flambaum [2004] J.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09882v1,Design fast Rydberg blockade SWAP gates with synthetic modulated driving,"The cold atom qubit platform emerges as an attractive choice for the next stage of quantum computation research, where a special family of synthetic analytical pulses has considerably improved the experimental performance of Controlled-PHASE Rydberg blockade gates in recent studies. The success of Controlled-PHASE Rydberg blockade gates triggers the intriguing question of whether the two-qubit Rydberg blockade gate SWAP gate exists. Via investigating the transition linkage structure, we provide a definitive answer to this question and establish the method of fast SWAP Rydberg blockade gates with synthetic continuously-modulated driving. These gate protocols use careful analysis to properly generate coherent population transfer and phase accumulation of the wave function in the atom-laser interaction process. They can adapt to finite Rydberg blockade strengths and bear considerable resistance some major adverse effects such as laser fluctuations. Further examinations reveal that we can anticipate satisfying performances of the method with currently available experimental techniques in relevant research areas.","The cold atom qubit platform [1, 2, 3] has been evolving rapidly since the first experimental demonstrations of Rydberg blockade gate [4, 5]. Recently, the ground-Rydberg excitation laser has improved significantly [6, 7], the coherent quantum control of Rydberg atoms has been making steady progress [8, 9, 10, 11], and shuttling atoms to form defect-free array has become a helpful tool [12, 13, 14]. Most interestingly, on the subject of the two-qubit Controlled-PHASE gate as the essential ingredient of quantum computation hardwares, the Rydberg blockade gate has received substantial advancement in fidelity [15, 16], thanks to the method of continuously-modulated off-resonant pulse replacing the early proposal of discrete resonant pulse sequence [17, 18, 10]. Nevertheless, the Rydberg dipole-dipole interaction does not naturally extend to very long ranges [2, 19, 20], and therefore enhancing the connectivity of Rydberg blockade Controlled-PHASE gate has to resort to special techniques. Now that the number of cold atom qubits loaded in an array has convincingly surpassed the level of 1000 [21], finding a path to realize high-connectivity entangling quantum logic gates for very-large-scale array becomes an imminent challenge. We are looking forward to a realistic solution where qubit atoms can stay stationary during the gate operations such as the buffer-atom-mediated (BAM) gate and the buffer-atom framework [22], while mechanically shuttling the qubit atoms across the array seems slow in speed and may cause extra sources of leakage [23]. Like the role of SWAP gate in the superconducting qubit platform [24, 25, 26], to simultaneously obtain high connectivity, high speed and high fidelity for sizable quantum algorithms, the future cold atom qubit platform is calling for a fast SWAP gate that will eventually work together with the buffer atoms and ancilla atoms [22]. With the exciting achievements in the last decade, the Rydberg blockade effect [4, 27, 2, 19, 3] has been extensively adopted in various quantum information processing tasks for its robustness and versatility. So far, the Rydberg blockade effect has repeatedly proved its better experimental compatibility compared with other schemes utilizing the Rydberg dipole-dipole interactions such as Rydberg pumping or Rydberg anti-blockade [28, 29, 30] which often require a precisely fixed value of Rydberg dipole-dipole interaction strength. In particular, the recent success of applying synthetic continuously-modulated driving in constructing high-fidelity Rydberg blockade entangling phase gates inspires us to ask the question whether a fast Rydberg blockade SWAP gate is possible via similar methods. In this article, we provide a definitive answer that the Rydberg blockade SWAP gate protocol does exist. Moreover, we are going to design the fast Rydberg blockade SWAP gate to meet the current experimental conditions and analyze its principles and characteristics. Not surprisingly, the anticipated gate protocols have close ties with the quantum geometry [31, 32, 33]. The rest of contents are organized as follows. At first, we introduce the basic mechanisms of fast Rydberg blockade SWAP gate and demonstrate the typical routines of how to design proper gate protocols to satisfy the practical requirements. Subsequently we also discuss the influence of typical adverse effects that reduce the fidelity of Rydberg blockade gates, where we keep adopting the method of suppressing the high-frequency components in the driving waveforms [34]. While these contents focus on the one-photon ground-Rydberg transition, we observe that the main idea becomes immediately applicable to continuously-modulated pulse in two-photon ground-Rydberg transition [35] at almost no extra burden in designing. We will evaluate the two-qubit SWAP gate fidelity according to the well-established criteria [36, 37]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09727v1,"Hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution 
to 1S-2S transition in muonium","We study hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the energy interval 1S-2S in muonium. Various amplitudes of interaction of a muon and an electron are constructed, in which the effect of hadronic scattering of light-by-light is determined using the transition form factor of two photons into a meson. Their contributions to the particle interaction operator in the case of S-states are obtained in integral form, and to the energy spectrum in numerical form. The contributions of pseudoscalar, scalar, axial vector mesons are taken into account.","The study of the energy levels of the purely leptonic muonium system has played a central role in many decades of precision calculations with the simplest atoms in quantum electrodynamics [1]. The resulting pause in experimental studies of the fine and hyperfine structure of muonium was filled with theoretical calculations of various contributions of the sixth, seventh and higher orders in \alpha [2, 3]. As a result, the theoretical accuracy of calculating energy levels in muonium increased significantly and became a benchmark for new experiments. It can be said that new experiments on the hyperfine structure in muonium and the 1S-2S energy range are in their final stages. The latest experimental result on the measurement of the transition frequency (1S-2S) in muonium was obtained in the work [4]: \Delta E(1S-2S)=2455528941.0(9.8)\leavevmode\nobreak\ MHz. (1) The Muonium Laser Spectroscopy collaboration (the Mu-MASS experiment) aims to measure the (1S-2S) transition in muonium with a final uncertainty of 10 kHz, providing a 1000-fold improvement on accuracy [5, 6]. New result of measurement of the n=2 Lamb shift in muonium comprises an order of magnitude improvement upon the previous best measurement [7]. The MuSEUM (Muonium Spectroscopy Experiment Using Microwave) collaboration performed a new precision measurement of the muonium ground-state hyperfine structure at J-PARC using a high intensity pulsed muon beam [8]. The MuSEUM collaboration aims to precisely measure the ground-state hyperfine splitting of muonium atoms with the accuracy 1 ppb [9]. Further increase in the theoretical accuracy of calculations of energy levels in muonium is connected with the calculation of new previously unknown contributions. Along with purely quantum electrodynamic contributions, there are also contributions due to strong interactions. Thus, the contribution of hadronic scattering of light-by-light is connected with the production of mesons and cannot be calculated analytically with high accuracy. To calculate it, one can use experimental data on the form factors of the transition of two photons into a meson with certain quantum numbers. Experimental and theoretical data on the form factors of the transition of two photons into mesons with different spin and parity are constantly updated [10, 11, 12, 13]. The effect of hadronic light-by-light scattering makes an important contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon [14, 15]. Other problems in which this contribution was investigated are related to the hyperfine splitting of the ground state of muonium [16, 17] and to the Lamb shift and hyperfine structure in muonic hydrogen [18, 19, 20, 21]. The seventh order contributions in \alpha, to which this hadronic light-by-light contribution belongs, can have a significant numerical value: m\alpha^{7}=136 kHz. But in the case of the hadronic contribution there is an additional factor that leads to a decrease in this value for muonium: m^{3}\alpha^{7}/F^{2}_{\pi}\approx 4 Hz (pseudoscalar meson). Nevertheless, an exact calculation of such a contribution is of interest for reducing the overall theoretical error. In our previous works we have investigated the effect of hadronic light-by-light scattering in the Lamb shift and hyperfine structure of muonic hydrogen [22, 23], as well as in the hyperfine structure of muonium, for which contributions from horizontal and vertical exchanges of various mesons were calculated [24]. Using the previously obtained approaches to calculating this contribution, in this work we performed its calculation for the interval 1S-2S, which should be measured with an accuracy of several kHz. A large number of works are devoted to the study of the hadronic contribution of light-by-light scattering in solving various problems, among which we would like to note the papers [14, 25, 26], which contain references to many other publications."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09442v1,Role of the Coulomb Potential in Compton Scattering,"We report a fully differential study of ionization of the Ne L-shell by Compton scattering of 20 keV photons. We find two physical mechanisms which modify the Compton-electron emission. Firstly, we observe scattering of the Compton electrons at their parent nucleus. Secondly, we find a distinct maximum in the electron momentum distribution close-to-zero momentum which we attribute to a focusing of the electrons by the Coulomb potential.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09375v1,Vibrational excitation and dissociation of deuterium molecule by electron impact,"A theoretical investigation on electron-D2 resonant collisions – via the low-lying and the Rydberg states of D{}_{2}^{-} – is presented for vibrational excitation, dissociative electron attachment and dissociative excitation processes by using the Local-Complex-Potential approach. Full sets of vibrationally resolved cross sections, involving the ground electronic state – \textrm{X}\,^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g} – and the first two electronic excited states – \textrm{b}\,^{3}\Sigma^{+}_{u} and \textrm{B}\,^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u} – of the D2 molecule, are given for fusion plasma applications in their technologically relevant partially dissociated, detached divertor regimes. In particular, transitions between electronic excited states are also considered. Comparisons are made with cross sections present in the literature, where available.","Electron-impact vibrational excitation and dissociation of deuterium molecules are of primary importance in many fields, ranging from astrophysics and plasma discharges to nuclear fusion, including fundamental physics Krishnakumar et al. (2018). Molecular hydrogen H2, deuterated hydrogen HD and deuterium D2, the simplest and at the same time the most abundant species formed in the pregalactic gas prior to structure formation, played an important role in the cooling of the gas clouds which gave birth to the first stellar generation Dalgarno (2005); Galli and Palla (2013). In this regard, it has been shown that the D/H ratio in giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, is a fundamental parameter to understand the formation of the solar system from the primitive nebula Lecluse et al. (1996). Moreover, electron-impact cross sections for HD, D2 and the corresponding ions are needed to explain certain phenomena occurring in the different planetary atmospheres and their ionospheres Kim et al. (2014). Among technological applications, electron-D2 collision cross sections are strictly related to the important problem of plasma interaction with the neutral gas component originating from surface recombination, from volumetric recombination channels, and/or from external gas puffing (plasma fuelling). This is of particular relevance for the so-called “detached divertor regime” in magnetic fusion devices Sang et al. (2020); Verhaegh et al. (2021), which is currently intensively studied in existing tokamaks and stellarators, and is also foreseen as the standard operational mode for the ITER fusion reactor under construction in Cadarache (South France). In this detached plasma mode of operation the hydrogenic plasma chemistry plays a key role for critical issues such as plasma energy and momentum dissipation, high heat flux component protection and particle (ash) removal. There molecular reaction kinetics comprises an important sub-model of the integrated multi-physics boundary plasma code systems, such as e.g. SOLPS-ITER, which was and still is heavily used for guiding the ITER divertor design Pitts et al. (2019), and future experimental campaigns. Powerful volumetric plasma-gas interaction mechanisms are known to be operative in fusion machine reactors, involving both resonant electron collisions – via resonant D{}_{2}^{-} anion states – and near resonant positive atomic ion (ion conversion, such as charge transfer channels) reactions. Such resonant processes are believed to be a key ingredient towards quantitative understanding of the near target divertor plasma dynamics, with their prominent effects also on dissociation degree, perhaps molecular-assisted additional volumetric recombination channels, but certainly for establishing the vibrational distribution of electronic ground molecules. Eliminating this latter from the unknown parts of fusion divertor models by a reliable cross section database can be expected to greatly improve the predictive and interpretative quality in current fusion reactor divertor models and spectroscopy interpretation tools. A recent account of the status of including such resonant channels in fusion relevant collision radiative models is given in the Ref. Sawada and Goto (2016), in which data for these resonant channels are deduced from Horáček et al. (2006). Another very important application in nuclear fusion field is related to negative ion sources for neutral beam injection (NBI) system. In particular, electron-D2 vibrationally resolved processes are paramount importance for kinetic models Taccogna and Minelli (2017) simulating the production, transport, extraction, acceleration and neutralization of negative ion beams to heat thermonuclear reactors. In this regard, a relevant result is that sources operated with deuterium could not achieve the same performances as a source operated with hydrogen, at the same power and pressure Bacal and Wada (2020), indicating a strong isotopic dependence from nuclear motion effects in these resonance channels, quite distinct from non-resonant electron collision systems. A recent detailed experimental study of this well established isotope effect in dissociative attachment resonance channels is given by E. Krishnakumar et al. Krishnakumar et al. (2011). A complete and updated set of deuterium cross sections is crucial to model the plasma of negative ion sources for fusion, which are currently routinely operated both with hydrogen and deuterium Serianni et al. (2020). Since the availability and access of plasma diagnostics in these devices is limited due to construction and operation constraints imposed by source optimization, it is difficult to precisely monitor plasma parameters in the entire source volume. A small size low pressure helicon plasma such as RAID Furno, Ivo et al. (2017), able to achieve high power hydrogen and deuterium discharges and mimic the electron temperature and density conditions of both the driver and the expansion region of large negative ion sources for fusion, represents a versatile testbench to validate numerical models. Dedicated Particle-in-Cell (PiC) and fluid modeling are currently underway to shed light on transport and chemistry of hydrogen RAID plasma discharges Fubiani et al. (2021). Aimed at supplying data for non-equilibrium plasma modeling applications Taccogna et al. (2012); Celiberto et al. (2017); Wünderlich and Fantz (2016), a large number of theoretical Meltzer and Tennyson (2020); Scarlett et al. (2021); Zammit et al. (2014); Tapley et al. (2018) and experimental Allan (1985); van Wingerden et al. (1977); Corrigan (1965); Wrkich et al. (2002) works, including a review Tawara et al. (1990), have appeared for H2 cross sections. Moreover, recently, results for H{}_{2}^{+} collisions with electrons Zammit et al. (2013); Iacob et al. (2019); DJUISSI et al. (2020), for the process of dissociative recombination, have become available. In spite of that, very little information exists in the literature about D2 excitation and dissociation and, more generally, for the nuclear fusion relevant D2, DT and T2 collision systems proceeding via their anion resonances. In order to fill the lack of data, in this paper, we will consider vibrationally-resolved resonant collisions by electron-impact, for the processes of vibrational excitation (VE), dissociative attachment (DA) and dissociative excitation (DE), reported in the Table 1, involving the ground electronic state – \textrm{X}\,^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g} – and the first two electronic excited states – \textrm{b}\,^{3}\Sigma^{+}_{u} and \textrm{B}\,^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u} – of the D2 molecule, which proceed through the low lying and the Rydberg states of D{}_{2}^{-} resonances. With regard to resonant scattering, it has been largely demonstrated that, for the collisions with electrons at low energy, it gives the dominant contribution in plasma kinetics Chen (2016); Smirnov (2007); Capitelli et al. (2000). The cross section calculations we will be performed in the so-called “Local-Complex-Potential” (LCP) approach Bardsley and Mandl (1968); Domcke (1991); Dubé and Herzenberg (1979); Houfek et al. (2006) and for the first time this methodology will be applied for vibrational transitions among excited electronic states. In this work, we are interested in resonant scatterings: the adiabatic nuclei (AN) approximation, often used to study electron molecule collision systems (see e.g., the molecular convergent close-coupling (MCCC) calculations in Ref. Scarlett et al. (2021) and references therein), cannot be applied in this context. While the Rydberg resonances – via high lying Rydberg states of the D{}_{2}^{-} anion – have received attention in recent literature, the hitherto poorly studied low lying resonances (via the \textrm{X}\,^{2}\Sigma^{+}_{u} state of D{}_{2}^{-}), are of particular relevance for the 0.5 to 5 eV electron temperatures in typical fusion detached divertor plasma scenarios. It is particularly this gap which we aim at in this paper with up to date and ab initio theoretical calculations.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09370v1,Vibrational excitation cross sections for non-equilibrium nitric oxide-containing plasma,"A full set of vibrationally-resolved cross sections for electron impact excitation of NO(X {}^{2}\Pi,v) molecules is calculated from ab initio molecular dynamics, in the framework of the Local-Complex-Potential approach. Electron-vibration energy exchanges in non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions are studied from a state-to-state model accounting for all electron impact excitation and de-excitation processes of the nitric oxide vibration manifold, and it is shown that the calculated vibration relaxation times are in good agreement with the experimental data. The new vibrational excitation cross sections are used in a complete electron impact cross section set in order to obtain non-equilibrium electron energy distributions functions and to calculate electron transport parameters in NO. It is verified that the new cross sections bring a significant improvement between simulations and experimental swarm data, providing an additional validation of the calculations, when used within the complete set of cross sections investigated in this work.","Nitrogen molecule (N2) and its oxide compounds (NOx), in particular nitric oxide (NO), comprise a significant fraction of the Earth’s atmosphere and they are of primary importance for life on Earth and for many human activities. The vibrationally excited levels of NO, for example, play a fundamental role in understanding the chemical processes occurring in the upper atmosphere. In fact, it has been proven that their distribution is very sensitive to the fast auroral electrons in ionosphere, which are directly connected to the solar activity Bouziane et al. (2022). As a second example, the vibrational excitation of NO molecule is also very relevant in hypersonic applications and in the atmospheric reentry problem of shuttle spacecrafts, where it is related to the contribution to radiation heating Sahai et al. (2020); Munafò et al. (2015); Panesi and Lani (2013). From the biological side, NO molecule is a metabolic nitrogen compound in gas form, and it plays an important role in the physiological regulation of the cardiovasculature in the human body Naseem (2005); Feng (2012). Moreover, in novel generation of biosensors for real-time bioimaging, NO is a key signaling molecule for vasodilatation and neurotransmission at low concentrations and a defensive cytotoxin at higher concentrations Moncada and Higgs (2006); Jeon et al. (2014). As another example, from a technological point of view, nitrogen fixation processes, which refer to the formation of compounds such as ammonia and nitrate from nitrogen molecules, is one of the most important industrial activities in agriculture Chen et al. (2021). The key point is that current ammonia synthesis methods make use of large amount of fossil fuels, which contribute to the global current human CO2 emissions. In this respect, a worldwide interest about the possibility to explore sustainable nitrogen fixation processes by using cold plasmas has been growing in the last years and new green technologies have been proposed very recently Vervloessem et al. (2020); Rouwenhorst et al. (2021); Jardali et al. (2021). In order to study the transport properties and chemistry of NO-containing systems, several kinetic models appeared recently in literature Bahnamiri et al. (2021); Bak and Cappelli (2015); Bouziane et al. (2022) and, at same time, new sets of cross sections and rate coefficients for chemical reactions for the NO molecule have been proposed Campbell et al. (2004); Song et al. (2019); Itikawa (2016), including for heavy particle collisions Armenise and Esposito (2021); Esposito and Armenise (2021). To this purpose, in this work, we present a novel study of NO molecules interacting with electrons, covering ab initio molecular dynamics and non-equilibrium kinetics modelling. The paper is organized as follows. In sections II and III, we use the theoretical framework employed in recent papers Laporta et al. (2020a, b) to calculate dissociative cross sections by electron-impact for NO molecule, to extend the calculations to the process of vibrational excitation (VE) i.e.: e(\epsilon)+\mathrm{NO}(\mathrm{X}\,^{2}\Pi;v)\to\mathrm{NO}^{-}\to e+\mathrm{% NO}(\mathrm{X}\,^{2}\Pi;v^{\prime})\,,\qquad v,v^{\prime}=0,\ldots 53\,; (1) a comparison with data available in literature and an update of the data presented in the Ref. Laporta et al. (2012) is also included. In section IV, we discuss a 0D model for the vibrational relaxation of NO molecules in chemical non-equilibrium conditions when electrons are described by a Maxwellian distribution. The non-equilibrium effects for electrons are taken into account in section V. Finally, section VI summarizes the main conclusions and closes the paper."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08844v1,Trapped-ion Laser Cooling in Structured Light Fields,"Laser cooling is fundamental to quantum computation and metrology with trapped ions, and can occupy a majority of runtime in current systems. A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches’ passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling’s advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to {}^{40}\text{Ca}^{+}{}, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.","I Carrier-free Doppler cooling The treatment of Cirac et al. (1992) showed that Doppler cooling for ions within the LDR at SW nodes allows higher cooling rates via use of higher cooling beam intensities, as well as lower final \bar{n}_{ss}, than possible with RWs. Since SW cooling is limited by saturation on sideband transitions (\Omega_{\mathrm{SB}}\propto\eta\Omega_{0}) instead of the carrier (\Omega_{\mathrm{car}}=\Omega_{0}) as in the usual RW, in a SW configuration and for ions within the LDR, W_{c}\propto\Omega_{\mathrm{SB}}^{2} can be increased by of order {\sim 1}/\eta^{2} before saturating the two-level system. This delayed saturation enables a significant gain in W_{c} given that typically, \eta\sim 0.1. Furthermore, an approximately 2\times reduction in final phonon number \bar{n}_{ss} is predicted. However, significantly different behavior, including heating, appears at other positions in the SW profile Cirac et al. (1992). Wavefunctions of highly excited ions outside the LDR, of practical interest to Doppler cooling, span lengthscales comparable to the wavelength (Fig. 1b), and hence compromised SW cooling performance is expected as compared to within the LDR as treated in Cirac et al. (1992). To study the cooling behavior beyond the LDR, here we employ numerical Lindblad master equation simulations including higher-order expansion terms (see Appendix). Our simulation quantifies the enhancement of Doppler cooling using SWs as compared to RWs both outside and inside the LDR, including effects of saturation from sideband excitation. We also discuss experimental configurations of carrier-free Doppler cooling based on integrated photonic addressing Vasquez et al. (2023); Mehta et al. (2020). In particular, we simulate the eight-level {}^{40}\text{Ca}^{+} structure as an example with a \hat{\pi}-polarized cooling beam (\Omega_{c}, \Delta_{c}) addressing the S_{1/2}\leftrightarrow P_{1/2} transition and a repumper (\Omega_{r}=2\pi\times 10 MHz, \Delta_{r}) with polarization \hat{\epsilon}_{p}=\hat{\pi}/\sqrt{2}+(\hat{\sigma}_{+}-\hat{\sigma}_{-})/2 between D_{3/2}\leftrightarrow P_{1/2} as shown in Fig. 1a, and with a quantizing magnetic field of B=1 G. Time evolution of the expectation phonon number \bar{n}(t) starting from a thermal state \bar{n}(0) is extracted from master equation evolution. The cooling rate at a given \bar{n} is defined as W_{c}=-\dot{\bar{n}}/\bar{n}, and the cooling limit \bar{n}_{ss} the final steady-state expectation phonon number. Figure 2: (a) Cooling rate (line) and limit (point) for \omega_{m}=2\pi\times 3 MHz and \Delta_{c}=-\Gamma/2. EF=1.5 for n=50 (solid line), EF=4.9 for n=5 (dotted line). The additional D states decrease the cooling for both SW and RW but also reduce the RW carrier heating. (b) Time evolution of SW and RW cooling for \omega_{m}=2\pi\times 3 MHz. Using \Delta_{c}=-0.5\Gamma and starting at \bar{n}=50, SW Doppler cooling reaches \bar{n}=4 within 34~{}\mu s with optimal Rabi frequency \Omega_{sw}=1.8\Gamma, while RW Doppler cooling takes 75~{}\mu s with optimal \Omega_{rw}=0.8\Gamma. Fig. 2a shows W_{c} in the full eight-level system as a function of \Omega_{c} for \omega_{m}=2\pi\times 3 MHz. \Delta_{c} is set to -\Gamma_{c}/2 which optimizes the cooling limit \bar{n}_{ss}. For small \Omega_{0}, RW and SW Doppler cooling rates increase quadratically with \Omega_{0} both inside (\bar{n}=5) and outside the LDR (\bar{n}=50) before saturation. For higher \bar{n}, the EF drops but remains larger than 1, achieved around the same \Omega_{c} both outside and near the LDR. Combined with the consistent improvement in \bar{n}_{ss}, this validates the advantage of SW Doppler cooling in the experiments. In Fig. 2b, we simulate a complete Doppler cooling process from \bar{n}=50 outside the LDR to the Doppler limit, using the optimal parameters for cooling rate found in Fig. 2a. We observe SW Doppler cooling take less than half of the time as compared to RW to reach \bar{n}=4, a reasonable starting point for ground-state cooling. Experimental implementation of carrier-free Doppler cooling may employ the configurations shown in Fig. 1c. Though for practical beam waists, the TE10’s effective \eta is lower than in a RW, optimal sideband coupling can be recovered by increasing \Omega_{0} inside the LDR to hold \eta\Omega_{0} constant. This allows cooling radial modes of multi-ion strings without requiring precise positioning of multiple ions along a series of SW fringes. Outside the LDR, however, cooling through higher-order sideband excitations (with coupling strengths proportional to \eta^{k} for a kth order sideband) contribute significantly to cooling, which are attenuated for lower driving beam LD parameter \eta and fixed first-order coupling \eta\Omega. In contrast the heating through spontaneous decay on a kth order sideband is proportional to \eta_{0}^{k} which is independent of the driving beam profile. As a result, the EF in cooling rate achievable with SW cooling decreases outside the LDR when using lower \eta values. For example, in our eight-level system simulations we observe that the EF for SW cooling with \eta=\eta_{0}/4 compared to the best case RW with \eta=\eta_{0} drops to nearly unity for \bar{n}=50. Our results quantify the performance of carrier-free Doppler cooling beyond the LDR previously treated. Though using {}^{40}\text{Ca}^{+} in the simulation as an example, similar advantage would hold for other ion species and are more favorable for lower intrinsic \eta_{0} Xing and Mehta (2023). While the advantage offered is modest in comparison to well within the LDR, our results indicate that such configurations can still be applied for highly excited ions. Therefore, early cooling stages can share the same cooling beam profile with carrier-free GS cooling schemes, for which more substantial enhancements are predicted."

We also introduce a novel method to enhance the capture velocity of the narrow-line MOT by incorporating additional axial cooling beam, and achieve loading efficiency \eta=10\% of the second-stage MOT in the science chamber. Our approach could be extended to other atomic species with similar properties, like Sr, Yb, Dy and Er, serving as a convenient alternative for the traditional 2D-MOT schemes. Providing rapid loading of the MOT in the science chamber, it would reduce preparation time of the atomic ensemble leading to a shorter dead time in spectroscopy experiments and higher repetition rate.","Ensembles of ultracold atoms have become a popular platform for many experiments in the fields of quantum sensing Bongs et al. (2019), quantum metrology Ludlow et al. (2015), and quantum simulation Bloch, Dalibard, and Nascimbène (2012). With rapid progress in the field of atomic physics, a lot of attention goes to experiments with open-f-shell lanthanides such as Er, Dy, and Tm. These atoms possess complex energy structures that offer a diverse range of electronic transitions, like those in Sr and Yb, along with unique properties tied to their open 4f shell, such as a large effective spin and magnetic moment. This makes lanthanides a fascinating platform for many experiments, e.g., they offer opportunities to explore systems with long-range interactions Chomaz et al. (2022). An important characteristic of lanthanides is their high melting points at 1400-1550\,^{\circ}C, which leads to the necessity of operating an atomic oven at more than 700\,^{\circ}C. This has historically necessitated the use of Zeeman slower setups Phillips and Metcalf (1982), as the capture velocity in magneto-optical traps (MOTs) rarely exceeds 50 m/s even for broad transitions, which is significantly lower than the thermal velocity of atomic beams emitted from ovens. Consequently, these setups tend to be large and low-efficient, with a small fraction of the atomic flux successfully loaded into the remote MOT. Over the past decade, two-dimensional magneto-optical traps (2D-MOTs) have become a common and efficient alternative to traditional Zeeman slower systems. Initially demonstrated with Rb Dieckmann et al. (1998), this approach has since been successfully adapted for various alkali and alkaline-earth elements, including Li Tiecke et al. (2009), Na Lamporesi et al. (2013), K Sutradhar et al. (2023), Sr Nosske et al. (2017); Kwon et al. (2023), and Yb Dörscher et al. (2013); Wilson and Thompson (2019). 2D-MOT setups are not only compact and efficient due to the close proximity of the source of hot atoms to the 2D-MOT center, but they also facilitate reaching ultrahigh vacuum due to the spatial separation of the hot-atom oven and the science chamber. The latter is particularly advantageous for experiments involving Bose–Einstein condensates (BEC) and quantum information, where long atom lifetimes in dipole traps are crucial. Additionally, 2D-MOTs can provide a continuous flux of cold atoms, which could enable the development of a new generation of optical clocks that continuously interrogate a clock transition Katori (2021); Mishin et al. (2021); Dubey et al. (2024). This approach helps to suppress the Dick effect Dick (1987); Santarelli et al. (1998), which often limits stability of the optical clocks. Tm is a lanthanide with only one vacancy in the 4f shell which gives it a moderate magnetic moment of \mu=4\,\mu_{b} in comparison to Er (7 \mu_{b}) or Dy (10 \mu_{b}), where \mu_{b} is the Bohr magneton. On the other hand, Tm’s simpler energy structure and less dense Feshbach resonance spectrum, comparing to other open-f-shell lanthanides, make it a promising candidate for quantum simulation Davletov et al. (2020). Furthermore, Tm is an excellent fit for transportable optical lattice clock due to the low sensitivity to black-body radiation Golovizin et al. (2019), convenient magic wavelength for optical lattice formation Sukachev et al. (2016), and the synthetic frequency technique allowing to eliminate the second order of the Zeeman shift Golovizin et al. (2021a). Despite the widespread adoption of 2D-MOT setups for alkali and alkaline-earth elements, loading of a narrow-line MOT from a cold atomic beam for open-f-shell elements has been demonstrated only for Dy Jin et al. (2023). Here we report on the development of a pulsed source of cold Tm atoms, which is based on a first-stage MOT in a primary chamber, and the loading of the narrow-line MOT from the cold atomic beam in the separate science chamber. We introduce an innovative approach to enhance the capture velocity of the secondary MOT by leveraging a dual-chamber design. The manuscript is organized as follows: the Sec. II gives an overview of Tm energy level structure and describes the vacuum apparatus and optical part of the experiment. Sec. III is dedicated to characterizing the first-stage cooling performance. In the Sec. IV we investigate properties of the cold atomic beam generated from the primary chamber. Next, Sec. V presents the results of loading the narrow-line MOT in the science chamber. Finally, we summarize our findings in the Sec. VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08236v1,Enhancement of Rydberg Blockade via Microwave Dressing,"Experimental control over the strength and angular dependence of interactions between atoms is a key capability for advancing quantum technologies. Here, we use microwave dressing to manipulate and enhance Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in an atomic ensemble. By varying the cloud length relative to the blockade radius and measuring the statistics of the light retrieved from the ensemble, we demonstrate a clear enhancement of the interaction strength due to microwave dressing. These results are successfully captured by a theoretical model that accounts for the excitations dynamics, atomic density distribution, and the phase-matched retrieval efficiency. Our approach offers a versatile platform for further engineering interactions by exploiting additional features of the microwave fields, such as polarization and detuning, opening pathways for new quantum control strategies.","References Saffman et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08780v1,Measuring pair correlations in Bose and Fermi gases via atom-resolved microscopy,"We demonstrate atom-resolved detection of itinerant bosonic 23Na and fermionic 6Li quantum gases, enabling the direct in situ measurement of interparticle correlations. In contrast to prior work on lattice-trapped gases, here we realize microscopy of quantum gases in the continuum. We reveal Bose-Einstein condensation with single-atom resolution, measure the enhancement of two-particle g^{(2)} correlations of thermal bosons, and observe the suppression of g^{(2)} for fermions; the Fermi or exchange hole. For strongly interacting Fermi gases confined to two dimensions, we directly observe non-local fermion pairs in the BEC-BCS crossover. We obtain the pairing gap, the pair size, and the short-range contact directly from the pair correlations. In situ thermometry is enabled via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our technique opens the door to the atom-resolved study of strongly correlated quantum gases of bosons, fermions, and their mixtures.","References Zwerger [2012] W.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08779v1,imaging of the thermal de Broglie wavelength in an ultracold Bose gas,"We report the first in situ observation of density fluctuations on the scale of the thermal de Broglie wavelength in an ultracold gas of bosons. Bunching of 87Rb atoms in a quasi two-dimensional system is observed by single-atom imaging using a quantum gas microscope. Compared to a classical ensemble, we observe a 30 percent enhancement of the second-order correlation function. We show the spatial and thermal dependence of these correlations. The reported method of detecting in situ correlations can be applied to interacting many-body systems and to the study of critical phenomena near phase transitions.","Introduction. The original Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) experiment introduced the importance of correlations in photon detection and triggered the development of quantum optics Hanbury Brown and Twiss (1956a, b); Glauber (1963a, b). HBT observed a spatial correlation of the intensity fluctuations for light emitted from the distant star Sirius. These fluctuations represent an optical speckle pattern with a characteristic length scale of the optical wavelength \lambda on the star’s surface. As illustrated in Fig. 1, when light propagates from a distant star of radius R to the earth at distance D, the speckle size is magnified to \lambda D/R, which HBT determined to be around 5\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{m} for Sirius. Matter waves have an equivalent speckle pattern with a characteristic grain size of the thermal de Broglie wavelength \lambda_{\text{dB}}=h/\sqrt{2\pi mk_{B}T}. The atomic speckle is a quantum effect, given that its scale involves Planck’s constant, h. In contrast, a classical gas has purely Poissonian fluctuations, which has no length scale since there are no correlations in the gas. Similar to light propagation, ballistic expansion of ultracold atoms magnifies the in situ correlation length in the far-field by D/R Gomes et al. (2006). Consequently, HBT experiments have been extended beyond photons to include electrons Oliver et al. (1999); Henny et al. (1999); Kiesel et al. (2002), neutrons Iannuzzi et al. (2006), cold atoms Yasuda and Shimizu (1996); Dall et al. (2011); Schellekens et al. (2005); Jeltes et al. (2007); Manning et al. (2010, 2013); Thomas et al. (2024); Esteve et al. (2006); Perrin et al. (2012); Sunami et al. (2024); Fölling et al. (2005); Blumkin et al. (2013); Rom et al. (2006); Sanner et al. (2010); Müller et al. (2010); Guarrera et al. (2011), and cold molecules Rosenberg et al. (2022). As a result of limited detector resolution, the atomic speckle pattern has primarily been probed in the far-field after time-of-flight expansion. In situ studies have only probed enhanced density fluctuations on a length scale much larger than the de Broglie wavelength Esteve et al. (2006) or focused on temporal correlations Guarrera et al. (2011). For cold fermions in a lattice, Pauli antibunching between next-neighbor sites has been observed in Cheuk et al. (2015); Omran et al. (2015); Hartke et al. (2020). However, the counterpart of bosonic bunching is less studied. Figure 1: In situ and far-field speckle patterns. An ensemble of identical bosons exhibits a spatial length scale \lambda where density fluctuations are correlated. In photonic systems, the length scale of this speckle pattern is given by the optical coherence length, while for a gas of thermal atoms, it is the thermal de Broglie wavelength. In both the HBT experiment and previous cold atoms experiments, a free expansion over a distance D is employed to enlarge the far-field speckle size by D/R. In this work, we use a microscope with a spatial resolution smaller than the thermal de Broglie wavelength to directly image the atomic speckle in situ. In this Letter, we report the first in situ observation of the atomic correlation length in a bulk, thermal Bose gas. The correlations and speckle pattern are quantitatively described by the second-order correlation function, g^{(2)}, which gives the joint probability of detecting two particles. The g^{(2)} function is measured by cooling a small quasi two-dimensional ensemble of approximately 100 rubidium atoms to below 10\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{nK}, with a corresponding thermal de Broglie wavelength \lambda_{\text{dB}}\approx 2.3\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mu\mathrm{m}, larger than the a_{\text{lat}}=532\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{nm} pinning lattice spacing used for imaging. Detection of such sparse samples is enabled by using a quantum gas microscope with single-atom resolution. Herein, we show a clear bunching signal and observe its spatial extent to be the thermal de Broglie wavelength. Figure 2: Experimental overview. (a) Using a 87Rb quantum gas microscope, we probe in situ the density fluctuations in an ultracold, quasi two-dimensional thermal Bose gas. (b) We project the 2D Bose distribution onto a pinning lattice and reconstruct the site-by-site lattice occupation. To determine the bosonic enhancement, we count pairs of atoms separated by distance r and determine the enhancement factor g^{(2)}(r) over the classical distribution corresponding to fully distinguishable particles. On the lattice grid, we show the distance between three types of pairs, corresponding to the nearest-neighbor (NN, red), next-nearest-neighbor (NNN, blue), and third-nearest-neighbor (N3, green). (c) To experimentally determine g^{(2)}(r) with high signal-to-noise, we average over 650 experimental snapshots. The region of interest is sectioned into 10\times 10 boxes to address the spatial inhomogeneity of the harmonic trap. The mean occupancy \bar{n} on each lattice site averaged over all snapshots is plotted. We remain dilute (\bar{n}<0.15) to avoid double occupation and to ensure that we do not cross the BEC phase transition."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08776v1,Quantum Gas Microscopy of Fermions in the Continuum,"Microscopically probing quantum many-body systems by resolving their constituent particles is essential for understanding quantum matter. In most physical systems, distinguishing individual particles, such as electrons in solids, or neutrons and quarks in neutron stars, is impossible. Atom-based quantum simulators offer a unique platform that enables the imaging of each particle in a many-body system. Until now, however, this capability has been limited to quantum systems in discretized space such as optical lattices and tweezers, where spatial degrees of freedom are quantized. Here, we introduce a novel method for imaging atomic quantum many-body systems in the continuum, allowing for in situ resolution of every particle. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on a two-dimensional atomic Fermi gas. We probe the density correlation functions, resolving their full spatial functional form, and reveal the shape of the Fermi hole arising from Pauli exclusion as a function of temperature. Our method opens the door to probing strongly-correlated quantum gases in the continuum with unprecedented spatial resolution, providing in situ access to spatially resolved correlation functions of arbitrarily high order across the entire system.","Challenges Quantum gas microscopy was initially developed in the context of Hubbard physics [6, 7] and has so far been devoted to the study of lattice and spin-chain systems [1, 2], where atoms initially evolve in a discretized space and can tunnel from site to site. To image the system, atoms are first pinned by ramping up the lattice depth to a value preventing any tunneling according to a simple and well defined adiabaticity criterion, and subsequently exposed to fluorescence light allowing to detect each atom. Here, in contrast, we are interested in pinning the atoms of many-body systems that initially evolve in continuous space, whose projection dynamics is far more complex due to the absence of an initial energy gap and has not been studied to date. A first crucial challenge is therefore to ensure that the pinning of the many-body wave function preserves the collective information prior to pinning. A second difficulty stems from light-assisted collisions that occur during imaging when two atoms occupy the same lattice site, such that quantum gas microscopy only gives access to the parity of the occupation number. In the study of Bose- or Fermi-Hubbard systems, the occupation is typically of one or two atoms per lattice site such that this parity projection can be mitigated [1, 2]. In contrast, the high densities typically used in bulk systems correspond to having tens to hundreds of atoms per lattice site, such that parity projection would be crippling for most quantitative measurements. This detrimental effect can be circumvented by working with extremely dilute clouds, with about two orders of magnitude lower densities. The associated challenge is to prepare samples at accordingly lower temperatures in order to reach the deep quantum degenerate regime. In practice, this requires temperatures in the range of 1–20 nK, which are below or at the lowest end of the temperatures typically reached in bulk quantum gases. In this work, we tackle these two challenges and perform quantum gas microscopy in the continuum for the first time, which we describe in the following."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08356v1,Proposal for a Bell Test with Entangled Atoms of Different Mass,"We propose an experimental scheme for performing a Bell test using momentum-entangled pairs of atoms with different masses. This proposal uses the metastable isotopes of helium \operatorname{{}^{3}\mathrm{He}^{\ast}}and \operatorname{{}^{4}\mathrm{He}^{\ast}}for their single-atom detection capabilities, though the approach could be generalised to other atoms. The entangled state is generated by colliding these species and manipulated via two independent atom interferometers. This method enables precise control of the relative phases of each species, overcoming previous challenges in single-species atomic momentum Bell tests. Numerical simulations of the process show that it should be possible to achieve a significant violation of Bell’s inequality under realistic experimental conditions and within a quantum mechanics framework. This type of superposition is interesting from a general relativity perspective as it introduces ambiguity in determining spacetime curvature of the quantum state. Such experiments are necessary to better understand the intersection between quantum mechanics and gravity.","Quantum mechanics has profoundly affected our understanding of the natural world. One of its most intriguing consequences is the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, where two or more entangled particles exhibit correlations that defy classical intuition. These correlations are such that the measurement outcome of one particle directly affects the other, regardless of the spatial separation between them, challenging the concept of local realism. This concept was famously discussed in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox [1], which suggested that quantum mechanics might be incomplete and that hidden variables could account for the observed correlations to preserve local realism. To address this, John Bell formulated a theorem [2] that provides a way to experimentally distinguish between the predictions of quantum mechanics and those of local hidden variable (LHV) theories. The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) formulation [3] later refined Bell’s theorem, making it more amenable to experimental tests. While entanglement has been verified experimentally in many systems, mostly with photons, a relatively unexplored frontier is extending this framework to massive particles and exploring their behaviour under gravitational influences. Historically, Bell tests have predominantly been performed on photons and internal degrees of freedom of particles, yielding violations of Bell inequalities and thereby supporting quantum mechanics. In the field of optics, numerous experiments have tested Bell inequalities using various photonic degrees of freedom, such as polarisation [4, 5], time-bin encoding [6], spatial modes [7], orbital angular momentum [8], and their momentum [9, 10]. Similarly, Bell tests using atoms and electrons have primarily explored their internal degrees of freedom, e.g., experiments with trapped ions [11], particle spins [12, 13, 14]. While these experiments have provided strong evidence against local hidden variable theories, there remains a lack of experimental evidence for Bell tests involving the external degrees of freedom (momentum) of massive particles. Recent attempts at atomic momentum entanglement for Bell tests have faced significant experimental challenges [15]. Dussarrat et al. [16] experimentally interfered different modes of two particles and ruled out the possibility of a mixed state. Fadel et al. [17] and Lange et al. [18] showed spatial entanglement in cold atom experiments. Shin et al. [13] demonstrated Bell correlations between separated atomic pairs, using momentum as their particle label and atomic spin states of metastable helium (\operatorname{{}^{4}\mathrm{He}^{\ast}}) atoms to show entanglement in spin. Other attempts to produce entanglement in atomic momentum [19, 20, 16, 21], while successfully showing forms of non-classical correlations, possessed insufficient coherence to perform a full Bell test. Our recent attempt [22] used mixing between different momentum states in two separate s-wave scattering halos of \operatorname{{}^{4}\mathrm{He}^{\ast}}atoms to perform a Bell test [23], although with insufficient visibility to exclude LHVTs. In this paper, we propose an experiment to test Bell’s inequality using momentum-entangled \operatorname{{}^{3}\mathrm{He}^{\ast}}and \operatorname{{}^{4}\mathrm{He}^{\ast}}atoms. By inducing controlled collisions between these isotopes and utilising species-specific momentum-transfer pulses for independent control, we generate and manipulate entangled pairs suitable for a Bell test. We present theoretical modeling of the entangled state generation, followed by numerical simulations that demonstrate a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality under realistic experimental conditions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08213v1,"Quantum electrodynamic corrections for molecules:
Vacuum polarisation and electron self energy in a two-component
relativistic framework","Vacuum polarisation (VP) and electron self energy (SE) are implemented and evaluated as quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections in a (quasi-relativistic) two-component zeroth order regular approximation (ZORA) framework. For VP, the Uehling potential is considered, and for SE, the effective potentials proposed by Flambaum and Ginges as well as the one proposed by Pyykkö and Zhao. QED contributions to ionisation energies of various atoms and group 2 monofluorides, group 1 and 11 valence orbital energies, {}^{2}\mathrm{P}_{1/2}\leftarrow{}^{2}\mathrm{S}_{1/2} and {}^{2}\mathrm{P}_{3/2}\leftarrow{}^{2}\mathrm{S}_{1/2} transition energies of Li-, Na-, and Cu-like ions of nuclear charge Z = 10, 20, …, 90 as well as \Pi_{1/2}\leftarrow\Sigma_{1/2} and \Pi_{3/2}\leftarrow\Sigma_{1/2} transition energies of BaF and RaF are presented. Furthermore, perturbative and self-consistent treatments of QED corrections are compared for Kohn–Sham orbital energies of gold. It is demonstrated, that QED corrections can be obtained in a two-component ZORA framework efficiently and in excellent agreement with corresponding four-component results.","Relativistic effects play a crucial role for the quantitative description of heavy-element containing molecules Pyykkö (1988, 2012). The usual starting point for a relativistic description of the electronic motion in a molecule is the free-particle Dirac equation Dirac (1928a, b) combined with a classical Coulomb-type potential for the description of leading order particle-particle interactions Saue (2011). This formalism describes the motion of electrons in accord with special relativity, but not its interactions, which are due to the Coulomb potential instantaneous. Within quantum electrodynamics (QED), i.e. the relativistic theory of the electromagnetic force, interactions are not instantaneous but are mediated by virtual photons at the speed of light. Therefore, the Coulomb potential arises only as leading order contribution to the electromagnetic particle-particle interaction in a perturbation theory expansion in the fine-structure constant. Largest QED effects are expected for the electron-nucleus potential Greiner and Reinhardt (2009), to which we will refer in the following exclusively and as retardation effects of the electron-electron interactions. The latter are however usually not as important as QED corrections of the electron-nucleus potential. Larger corrections to the electron-electron interactions are expected via the Breit interaction Breit (1929), which appears due to consideration of current-current interactions and the inclusion of the correct gauge of the interaction within a Lorentz invariant framework. Photon-frequency dependent retardation corrections to the Breit interaction are usually less important than QED corrections of the electron-nucleus potential considered in this work. It is expected that QED corrections reduce the total relativistic effects by about 1 % in heavy atom containing-molecules Indelicato et al. (2011); Pyykkö (2012). For the hydrogen atom this QED correction of the electron-nucleus potential leads to the so-called Lamb shift, which splits n\mathrm{s}_{1/2} and n\mathrm{p}_{1/2} states in one-electron systems Lamb and Retherford (1947). In the search for new physics beyond the standard model, high-precision spectroscopy is an essential tool to test the fundamental symmetries, such as space- and time-reversal parity and its violations Safronova et al. (2018); Berger and Stohner (2019). Because of the numerically small effects, it is important to investigate systems with a number of traits, which enhance effects of these violations. Certain molecules are particularly suited for such purposes. One promising candidate is radium monofluoride (RaF). It was first proposed because of its predicted nuclear-spin-dependent parity violation and expected suitability for laser cooling Isaev et al. (2010); Isaev and Berger (2013). The pear-shaped octupole deformation Gaffney et al. (2013); Butler et al. (2020) of the heavy 222,224,226Ra isotopes enhances symmetry violation effects further. Synthesis of the open-shell short-lived isotopically pure radioactive RaF molecules and successive spectroscopy was first achieved with the collinear resonance ionisation spectroscopy (CRIS) method at the ISOLDE ion-beam facility at CERN Garcia Ruiz et al. (2020). Applicable for other molecules, such as RaOH, RaO, RaH, AcF and ThO, and nuclei with half-lives of just milliseconds, it paved the way for high-precision spectroscopy of radioactive isotope containing molecules. In recent experiments, the rovibronic structure of 226Ra19F was obtained with a resolution, which is two orders of magnitude larger compared to previous experiments Udrescu et al. (2024). Also, eleven electronic states and excitations were reported Athanasakis-Kaklamanakis et al. (2023). Thus, theoretical predictions and proposals of suited molecules for precision tests play an essential role. However, as the experiments have reached unprecedented accuracies, and the investigated symmetry violations are even smaller, it is necessary to develop sophisticated theoretical frameworks further as well. While QED corrections have been studied in atoms for a long time Mohr (1974a); Blundell (1993); Schneider et al. (1994); Mohr et al. (1998); Sunnergren et al. (1998); Labzowsky et al.

In high-precision calculations of atoms, the leading order QED corrections have shown to be the missing contributions to the first ionisation energy and electron affinity of the gold atom in order to reach meV accuracy, compared to the experimental values Pašteka et al. (2017). Pašteka et al. also noted, that higher excitations in the coupled cluster (CC) method have less impact on the result, compared to the QED corrections. Because QED contributions grow with increasing nuclear charge, as they are relativistic effects, they are expected to contribute mainly to molecules containing heavy nuclei such as RaF. Overall, the effects in molecules and the influence on properties are largely unknown and it is thus desirable to have efficient, yet accurate, options to approximate the corrections reliably. In this work, the leading order QED corrections are included as effective potentials within the two-component ZORA framework. Within this framework, one can obtain accurate results for the QED corrections, although the overall error of ZORA, compared to four-component approaches, is in the same order of magnitude. This incremental approach allows for an efficient treatment of QED effects in atoms and molecules, suited to predict size, trends and relevance. Results of variational and perturbative treatments are compared to four-component variational and numerical Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) calculations."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07726v1,Correlated Rydberg Electromagnetically Induced Transparencys,"In the regime of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency, we study the correlated behaviors between the transmission spectra of a pair of probe fields passing through respective parallel one-dimensional cold Rydberg ensembles. Due to the van der Waals (vdW) interactions between Rydberg atoms, each ensemble exhibits a local optical nonlinearity, where the output EIT spectra are sensitive to both the input probe intensity and the photonic statistics. More interestingly, a nonlocal optical nonlinearity emerges between two spatially separated ensembles, as the probe transmissivity and probe correlation at the exit of one Rydberg ensemble can be manipulated by the probe field at the input of the other Rydberg ensemble. Realizing correlated Rydberg EITs holds great potential for applications in quantum control, quantum network, quantum walk and so on.","1 Rydberg atoms, which are neutral atoms in a state of high principal quantum number, are often called big atoms with exaggerated physical properties [1]. These unusual properties result from the large orbit radius of Rydberg atoms, including long radiative lifetimes, high polarizability and large electric dipole moments. Due to their high polarizability and large electric dipole moments, Rydberg atoms strongly interact with other Rydberg atoms [2, 3] and are extremely sensitive to the surrounding electric fields [4]. Undoubtedly, these features make them the natural candidates for studying many-body physics [5, 6, 7, 8] and for precise measurement [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In addition, the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [16], as is well known in the field of quantum optics, could allow for an effective quantum interface between atoms and light without absorption. In general, photons do not directly interact with each other. However, by employing the EIT technique, the strong interactions between Rydberg atoms can be mapped onto photons, causing photons to become either strongly attractive or repulsive [17, 18]. Based on the modification of photonic statistics, the combination of EIT with Rydberg atoms allows us to investigate nonlinear quantum optics at the single-photon level [19] and explore quantum information applications, such as building single photon sources [20], quantum gate [21], transistors [22, 23], filters [24], subtractors [25, 26], and switches [27, 28]. Unlike typical linear EIT realized in an ensemble of independent atoms, Rydberg EIT spectra of the transmitted probe intensity can be influenced by the dipole blockade effect, where the excitation of two or more atoms into a Rydberg state within a mesoscopic volume is forbidden due to the dipole-dipole interaction. Specifically, the transmission coefficient and the photonic correlations become highly sensitive to the input probe intensity. Theoretical and experimental investigations on Rydberg EIT have recently attracted intense interest [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50]. To date, most investigations on Rydberg EIT have focused on one-dimensional systems, while studies on two-dimensional systems—specifically, to the best of our knowledge, studies on correlated Rydberg EITs—remain quite rare. In this paper, we investigate the correlated optical responses of two probe fields passing through closely spaced, parallel one-dimensional samples of cold Rydberg atoms in the EIT regime. Each EIT spectrum exhibits cooperative optical nonlinearities when the input probe intensity is strong enough. Moreover, by varying the input probe intensity of one probe field and keeping other parameters unchanged, we observe alterations in both the transmitted probe intensity and the second-order correlation function of the other probe field. Additionally, we thoroughly examine the extent to which one probe field is influenced by changing the other probe field. The realization of correlated Rydberg EITs enables quantum manipulation, the construction of quantum networks, the testing of quantum walk, and more. Figure 1: (Color online) (a) Upper: Two weak laser fields, \hat{\zeta}_{1} and \hat{\zeta}_{2}, propagate through two independent, parallel, one-dimensional atomic ensembles in the presence of the classical control fields \Omega_{1} and \Omega_{2}. In this case, d\gg R_{b}\gg r. Lower: The optical responses of the two weak laser fields are correlated by the vdW interactions when R_{b}\gg d\sim r. Throughout this paper, we use the values R_{b}=14.68 \mu\text{m}, d=0.5 \mu\text{m}, and r=0.5 \mu\text{m} for the numerical calculations. A rugby-shaped shaded region forms a shared blockade area, created by the overlap of two blockade spheres. (b) Atomic levels. A weak probe field (Rabi frequency operator \hat{\zeta}_{a} and detuning \delta_{a}) and a classical coupling field (Rabi frequency \Omega_{a} and detuning \Delta_{a}) couple the ground state |g\rangle, intermediate state |e\rangle and Rydberg state |r\rangle, respectively. vdW represents the long-range van der Waals interaction. (c) A superatom is composed of three collective states |G\rangle, |E\rangle and |D\rangle. In comparison to the single-atom case, the collective coupling strength between states |G\rangle and |E\rangle is increased by a factor of \sqrt{n_{a}} (a=1,2)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07100v1,Positron Channeling in Quasi-Mosaic Bent Crystals: Atomistic Simulations vs. Experiment,"This paper reports on a comprehensive study of an ultra-relativistic positron beam deflection by an oriented quasi-mosaic crystal. The analysis was carried out for the positron energy of 530 MeV incident on the quasi-mosaic bent Si(111) crystal. This particular case was chosen because it has recently been studied experimentally at the Mainz Microtron MAMI. The results of the relativistic molecular dynamics simulations were compared with the experimental observations and a good agreement was found. The presence of planar channeling, de-channeling, volume reflection and volume capture processes in the angular distribution of deflected positrons for different beam-crystal alignments has been studied. Predictions have been made for certain crystal orientations for which experimental data are lacking.","Inside a crystalline solid, the positions of the constituent atoms follow a regular geometric pattern. This gives rise to an ordered and periodic structure of the crystalline environment, which is slightly disordered by the presence of the atoms’ thermal vibrations. As a result, the atoms in the crystal are arranged in crystalline rows and planes. Therefore, when a high-energy charged particle collides with a crystal, the interaction between the particle and the crystal depends significantly on the orientation of the crystal with respect to the direction of the particle’s motion. In this context, the seminal work of Lindhard Lindhard_1965 showed that the ordered arrangement of atoms within a crystal generates an electrostatic field that significantly affects the motion of charged particles passing through the crystal at small angles with respect to the crystallographic planes or axes. This effect is known as channeling, in which particles that move along a crystallographic plane (or an axis) undergo correlated interactions with the atoms that make it up. The study of the transport of ultra-relativistic charged particle beam through oriented crystals, including the phenomenon of channeling, has become a field of broad scope and investigation Biryukov_1997 ; Uggerhoj_2005 ; Korol_2014 ; Sytov_2019 ; Korol_2022 . The extensive theoretical and experimental studies of channeling and other related phenomena have provided many valuable insights Korol_2021 ; Haurylavets_2021 ; Sushko_2022 ; Bandiera_2013_1 ; Sytov_2016 ; Wistisen_2016 ; Scandale_2020 ; Ivanov_2006 ; Bandiera_2021_1 . This paper is devoted to the study of the phenomena that occur when an oriented quasi-mosaic bent Si(111) crystal is exposed to a well collimated positron beam. Positrons entering the crystal nearly parallel to the atomic planes can be channeled through the crystal and follow the crystal curvature. This process is called planar channeling (CH). As the positrons propagate through the crystal in the channeling regime, scattering events can lead to dechanneling (DCH), i.e. the process by which the positrons are thrown out of the channel. If the crystal is tilted at a small angle with respect to the positron beam, the positron trajectories can be aligned with the crystalographic planes within the crystal. This situation can lead to the volume reflection (VR) events, where positrons are reflected from the bent atomic planes, or to the volume capture (VC) events, where positrons are captured by the bent planar channels and continue their motion in the channeling regime. Recent theoretical and experimental contributions explain these processes very well and describe them with sufficient accuracy Korol_2014 ; Korol_2021 ; Haurylavets_2021 ; Scandale_2019_1 ; Mazzolari_2024 ; Paulo_2024 . In recent years, a number of experiments have been carried out at various accelerator facilities with the primary aim of exploring the specific features of the channeling process for different crystalline samples and the emission of radiation in bent and periodically bent crystals Guidi_2012 ; Bandiera_2013_2 ; Bagli_2014 ; Nielsen_2019 ; Mazzolari_2014 ; Wienands_2015 ; Scandale_2019_2 ; Bandiera_2015 ; Wistisen_2016 ; Bagli_2017 ; Sytov_2017 ; Wienands_2017 ; Bandiera_2021_2 . The present study explores the intricate dynamics of ultra-relativistic positrons as they propagate through a crystalline medium and interact with the crystal’s electrostatic field. To unravel the complexity of this phenomenon, the powerful technique of relativistic molecular dynamics Sushko_2013 is used, taking advantage of the state-of-the-art capabilities of the MBN Explorer software package Solovyov_2012 ; Solovyov_2017 ; MBN_Explorer ; Sushko_2019 . A comprehensive understanding of the problem has been achieved by rigorously comparing the results of the simulations with the recently reported experimental results Mazzolari_2024 , obtained for a bent silicon crystal exposed to irradiation with the 530 MeV positron beam recently developed at the Mainz Microtron MAMI. The relativistic molecular dynamics approach used in this work is one of a set of algorithms implemented in MBN Explorer, the advanced software package for multiscale simulations of complex molecular structure and dynamics. The case study reported in this work is in line with the recent roadmap paper on multiscale theory, simulation, and experiment in radiation-exposed condensed matter systems Solovyov_2024 . The study of the behavior of charged ultra-relativistic particles within crystalline structures is of immense importance, as it underpins a wide range of applications, from particle accelerator technologies to advances in materials science and beyond. As is well known, the interaction between charged particles incident on a crystalline medium allows us to understand the fundamental mechanisms that govern their dynamics. This research aims to unravel the details of this dynamics. By exploiting the synergy between the advanced computational modeling and experimental results, this work aims is to push the frontiers of knowledge in this field and pave the way for innovative applications and further scientific discoveries. Section 2 provides an overview of the methodology used in this study, including the target parameters and the details of the simulations. Section 3 presents the numerical results obtained and, where possible, compares them with the experimental data collected at MAMI. It also analyses the deflection of the positron beam as a function of the parameters characterizing the crystal geometry and the divergence of the incident beam. This analysis is based on the atomistic simulations of positron trajectories using the relativistic molecular dynamics approach. Section 4 summarises the conclusions of this work and outlines future prospects."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06026v1,Sub-Doppler cooling of a trapped ion in a phase-stable polarization gradient,"Trapped ions provide a highly controlled platform for quantum sensors, clocks, simulators, and computers, all of which depend on cooling ions close to their motional ground state. Existing methods like Doppler, resolved sideband, and dark resonance cooling balance trade-offs between the final temperature and cooling rate. A traveling polarization gradient has been shown to cool multiple modes quickly and in parallel, but utilizing a stable polarization gradient can achieve lower ion energies, while also allowing more tailorable light-matter interactions in general. In this paper, we demonstrate cooling of a trapped ion below the Doppler limit using a phase-stable polarization gradient created using trap-integrated photonic devices. At an axial frequency of 2\pi\cdot 1.45~{}\rm MHz we achieve \langle n\rangle=1.3\pm 1.1 in 500~{}\mu\rm s and cooling rates of {\sim}0.3\,\rm quanta/\mu s. We examine ion dynamics under different polarization gradient phases, detunings, and intensities, showing reasonable agreement between experimental results and a simple model. Cooling is fast and power-efficient, with improved performance compared to simulated operation under the corresponding running wave configuration.","Author Contributions The photonic structures were designed by SC, AH, MN, RS, and TS.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07219v1,Spin Squeezing with Magnetic Dipoles,"Entanglement can improve the measurement precision of quantum sensors beyond the shot noise limit. Neutral atoms, the basis of some of the most precise and accurate optical clocks and interferometers, do not naturally exhibit all-to-all interactions that are traditionally used to generate such entangled states. Instead, we take advantage of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction native to most neutral atoms to realize spin-squeezed states. We achieve 7.1 dB of metrologically useful squeezing using the finite-range spin exchange interactions in an erbium quantum gas microscope. We further propose and demonstrate that introducing atomic motion protects the spin sector coherence at low fillings, significantly improving the achievable spin squeezing in a 2D dipolar system. This work’s protocol can be implemented with most neutral atoms, opening the door to quantum-enhanced metrology in other itinerant dipolar systems, such as molecules or optical lattice clocks, and serves as a novel method for studying itinerant quantum magnetism with long-range interactions.","Entangled states allow quantum sensors to overcome the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), and have enhanced optical clocks [1, 2], atom interferometers [3], and gravitational wave detectors [4]. One prominent method to generate large-scale entanglement is spin squeezing, where uncertainty is redistributed between quadratures of the collective spin of an atomic, solid state, or molecular ensemble, improving metrological precision [5, 6, 7, 8]. In cold atom systems, spin squeezing generation has been extensively studied in the context of all-to-all interactions or measurements, such as in single mode cavities [9, 10, 11] and single mode Bose Einstein Condensates [12, 13]. Recently, it was predicted that scalable spin squeezing can be achieved with finite range interactions [14, 15, 16]. This is remarkable from a fundamental perspective, as the nonequilibrium squeezing dynamics may be linked to equilibrium symmetry-broken phases with long-range order [17]. Additionally, squeezing from finite range interactions is very attractive for metrological applications, as such interactions are inherently present in many cold atom, molecule, and solid-state systems [18, 19, 20, 21]. Recently, squeezing was realized through induced Rydberg interactions, of dipolar [22] or van der Waals [23, 24] nature, and in trapped-ion platforms with tunable power-law interactions [25]. In this work, we demonstrate spin squeezing through magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. Such interactions are available natively in most atomic species. The spin squeezing is carried out in an erbium quantum gas microscope, in which we prepare \approx 10^{3} itinerant XY interacting fermions in an optical lattice. First, we describe novel methods for generating and imaging magnetically insensitive dipolar interacting spin states in fermionic 167Er, inspired by Zou et al. [26]. While benchmarking the platform, we observe indications of the ferromagnetic ordering expected of the many-body ground state at high filling, predicted to lead to an extensive squeezed state [16, 14, 17, 27]. Next, we generate and directly measure metrologically useful squeezing up to \qty{7.1(1.0)}{dB} with no corrections for experimental imperfections. Finally, we introduce a new degree of freedom, itinerancy, which has recently been proposed to enhance squeezing in finite-range interacting systems [28, 29]. While finite lattice fillings impede the formation of an ordered ground state [30] and thus a squeezed state, tunneling was recently numerically shown to help overcome this effect [29]. However, it remains an open question whether this enhancement survives at finite temperature and finite tunneling, where the partial delocalization of defects may impede local ordering. Additionally, the study of the interplay between tunneling and power law interactions has been of substantial recent interest due to advances in ultracold molecule experiments [31, 32, 33]. Remarkably, we observe that in dilute systems where we observe no metrological gain when the spins are static, the introduction of itinerancy protects the long range order and leads to metrologically useful squeezing of \qty5.2(0.6)dB."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07137v1,Experimental evidence for dipole-phonon quantum logic in a trapped calcium monoxide and calcium ion chain,"Dipole-phonon quantum logic (DPQL) offers novel approaches for state preparation, measurement, and control of quantum information in molecular ion qubits. In this work, we demonstrate an experimental implementation of DPQL with a trapped calcium monoxide and calcium ion chain at room temperature. We present evidence for one DPQL signal in two hours of data collection. The signal rises clearly above the characterized noise level and has a lower bound on the statistical significance of 4.1\sigma. The rate of observation is limited by the low thermal population in the molecular ground rotational state.","The coherent control of atoms has become an essential resource for studies of quantum physics and engineering quantum technologies. Diatomic molecules, with their additional vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, provide a broader spectrum that can be utilized for various purposes. The coherent control of the rich internal states of molecules has opened new opportunities for precision measurements [1], studies of quantum chemistry [2, 3], quantum simulation [4, 5] and quantum information processing [6, 7]. Like neutral molecules, the utility of molecular ions has been demonstrated in these applications [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In molecular ion research, quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS) is a powerful tool for state preparation and measurement of internal states of single molecular ions [16, 17, 18, 19]. Originally developed for use in trapped atomic ion clocks [20], QLS transfers the quantum information from a trapped molecular ion’s internal state to its motional state, which is then read out via a co-trapped atomic ion. This approach circumvents the need for molecular transitions with high photon cycling rates, often required for laser cooling in neutral molecule platforms [21], and is compatible with various molecular transitions, including hyperfine [16, 19], rotational [10, 22], rovibrational, and rovibronic transitions [17, 18]. Recently, a novel approach to QLS was proposed that uses the interaction of the permanent dipole of a polar molecular ion with the trap electric field. In this scheme known as dipole-phonon quantum logic (DPQL), opposite-parity states, such as \Lambda and \Omega doublet states [23] of certain rotational states, are used to facilitate the interaction. By carefully selecting the appropriate diatomic molecule, a doublet frequency splitting can be found that is comparable to the trapped ions’ secular oscillation frequency such that the doublet states may couple to and directly exchange energy with the motional mode [24]. This technique offers a new set of tools for molecular state preparation and measurement and may even be used for generating atom-molecule entanglement as well as for enabling long distance interactions between molecular ions via virtual phonons across a trapped ion chain [23]. Figure 1: Experimental setup and the energy structure and population distribution of CaO+ under room termperature. (a) A schematic of the experimental setup for the demonstration of dipole-phonon quantum logic. A single CaO+ and Ca+ are trapped in a segmented blade trap. A magnetic field of 6.2 G is aligned to the trap axis (z) to provide the quantization axis and break state degeneracies. A top view of the trap setup shows the laser wavelengths and orientations in which 397 nm and 866 nm are used for Doppler cooling, 729 nm laser for S_{1/2}\leftrightarrow D_{5/2} operation, and 854 nm laser for quenching D_{5/2} population. (b) The energy level structure of CaO+ ground electronic state X{}^{2}\Pi (not to scale) in the presence of a 6.2 G magnetic field. e-/f+ indicates the odd/even parity state of the \Omega-doublets. (c) The distribution of the first 71 rotational states in \Omega=3/2, v=0. (Inset) The distribution of the two fine structure states, \Omega, within each rotational manifold at room temperature. The calculation of the distribution is in Appendix A. In this work, we present evidence for the coherent control and detection of DPQL between a calcium oxide ion (CaO+) and the trap electric potential. In CaO+, the cation Ca2+, with a closed shell, and the anion O-, with a half-filled orbital, form an ionic bond. The half-filled 2p\pi orbital results in a ground state of X^{2}\Pi_{3/2} for CaO+, while the first excited 2p\sigma orbital gives rise to a low-lying A^{2}\Sigma^{+} electronically excited state. The combination of the rotational electronic Coriolis effect and the spin-orbit coupling between these two molecular orbitals leads to a degeneracy splitting of the \Omega-doublets, and the magnitude of this splitting increases with rotational number R [24]. Specifically, for the ground rotational state with total angular momentum J=R+\Lambda+\Sigma=3/2, where \Lambda=1 and \Sigma=1/2 are the projection of the electron orbital angular momentum and the electron spin on the internuclear axis respectively, the energy splitting between the lower energy doublet state |e\rangle and higher energy doublet state |f\rangle is calculated to be approximately \omega_{\text{mol}}=2\pi\times 450\,\text{kHz} [24] based on previously reported spectroscopic data [25]. In a linear Paul trap, CaO+ exhibits secular motion around its equilibrium position such that the ion experiences an oscillating electric field due to this motion. When this oscillation frequency \omega_{q} is near resonance with \omega_{\text{mol}}, the interaction between the electric field and the molecular dipole can be described by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian under the rotating wave approximation [23]: H_{\text{I}}/\hbar=\frac{\omega_{mol}}{2}\sigma_{z}+\omega_{q}\left(a_{q}^{% \dagger}a_{q}+\frac{1}{2}\right)+\frac{g_{q}}{2}\left(a_{q}\sigma_{+}+a_{q}^{% \dagger}\sigma_{-}\right), (1) where g_{q} is the vacuum Rabi frequency. For the ground rotational state, the vacuum Rabi frequency is calculated to be 2\pi\times 2.6\,\text{kHz}. Because the frequency of this \Omega-doublet has not yet been directly measured and the dipole-phonon coupling strength is small compared to the doublet splitting, we utilize adiabatic passage with constant ramping speed to facilitate the dipole-phonon interaction. By adiabatically ramping the trap frequency \omega_{q} through resonance with \omega_{\text{mol}}, the \Omega-doublet states will flip causing a corresponding change in the phonon state of the ion’s motion: |f,n\rangle\leftrightarrow|e,n+1\rangle. A calcium ion (Ca+) is co-trapped with the CaO+ to provide sympathetic ground state cooling and read out the phonon state."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06712v1,A non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations: technical details,"This work applies a reduced basis method to study the continuum physics of a finite quantum system—either few or many-body. Specifically, we develop reduced-order models, or emulators, for the underlying inhomogeneous Schrödinger equation and train the emulators against the equation’s bound-state-like solutions at complex energies. The emulators can quickly and accurately interpolate and extrapolate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian resolvent operator (Green’s function) in a parameter space that encompasses the complex energy plane as well as other real-valued parameters in the Schrödinger equation. The spectra, discretized and compressed as the result of emulation, and the associated resolvent matrix elements (or amplitudes), have the defining characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics calculations, featuring complex eigenenergies with negative imaginary parts and resolvent matrix elements with branch cuts moved below the real axis in the complex energy plane. Therefore, we now have a method that extracts continuum physics from bound-state-like calculations and emulates them in the input parameter space. Some significant results have previously been presented in a short report (arXiv:2408.03309). Here, we provide details of the study and an in-depth analysis, including how this method could be coupled with existing approaches to compute and emulate bound and continuum states.","In a recent paper Zhang (2024), we reported on a new application of the reduced basis method (RBM) Duguet et al. (2024); Drischler et al. (2023); Melendez et al. (2022) in the study of continuum physics of finite quantum systems. Technical details of the study are provided in this paper. Readers are advised to read the short report first, which could facilitate reading the current paper. By continuum physics, we mean the part of the spectrum of a Hamiltonian operator where the system can break up into subsystems (i.e., above the system’s lowest threshold) and the states and observables associated with that sector of the spectrum. To be quantitative, let H(\bm{\theta}) be the Hamiltonian operator. An important operator is H’s resolvent or Green’s function111We are working with time-independent Schrödinger equations in this work.. Its matrix element between two source states |{S}(\bm{\theta})\rangle and |\tilde{{S}}(\bm{\theta})\rangle is named amplitude \mathcal{A}, with \displaystyle\mathcal{A}(E,\bm{\theta})\equiv\left\langle\tilde{{S}}(\bm{% \theta})\left|\frac{1}{E-H(\bm{\theta})}\right|{S}(\bm{\theta})\right\rangle\,. (2) The vector \bm{\theta} collects the parameters of H, {S}, and \tilde{{S}}. \mathcal{A} represents an array of continuum physics observables, such as response functions and scattering amplitudes, depending on the construction of the source states. See Sec. II.1 for the details. The analytical properties of \mathcal{A} in the complex E plane, such as isolated poles and branch cuts (BCTs), are directly connected to the basic features of H’s spectrum Newton (1982). This informs an interesting numeric computational framework, called non-Hermitian quantum mechanics (NHQM) Reinhardt (1982); Moiseyev (2011), as discussed in Sec. II.2. Since the approximations of \mathcal{A} produced in a broad class of calculations (including NHQM) could be viewed as rational approximations Trefethen (2023) in terms of the variable E, a recent and relevant development on this subject is mentioned in Sec. II.3. In principle, we can solve the inhomogeneous Schrödinger equation, (E-H)|\Psi\rangle=|S\rangle\,, (3) or \langle\tilde{\Psi}|(E-H)=\langle\tilde{{S}}|\,, (4) and compute \displaystyle\mathcal{A}=\langle\tilde{{S}}|\Psi\rangle=\langle\tilde{\Psi}|{S% }\rangle\,. (5) To simplify our notation, we assume the E and \bm{\theta} dependence is implicit unless otherwise stated. These equations and \mathcal{A} are the main targets of this study. We aim to develop RBM-based reduced-order models (ROMs), or emulators, for the solutions of Eqs. (3) and (4) and \mathcal{A} so that we can extrapolate them in the complex E plane and interpolate them in the space of \bm{\theta}. Extrapolation in E is a crucial capability, from which \mathcal{A} at real Es can be inferred from the solutions at complex Es. Solving these equations directly at real Es poses severe numeric challenges, but at complex Es, it becomes a more feasible bound-state-like calculation. The emulation in \bm{\theta} enables rapid explorations of the continuum physics calculations in the parameter space, another helpful functionality. As a model-order-reduction (MOR) tool for a parameterized equation system Hesthaven et al. (2015); Quarteroni et al. (2016); Benner et al. (2017a, b, 2015), the RBM first constructs a subspace spanned by the equation’s full (or high-fidelity) solution at a sample of parameter sets, called snapshots, during the so-called offline training stage. Afterward, the equation system is projected into the subspace to form a ROM, which can be used to emulate the solutions and the associated observables in the parameter space. The dimension of the subspace is typically low and scales mildly with the number of parameters Duguet et al. (2024). Consequently, the computing cost for running emulators at the online emulation stage is dramatically reduced compared to simply repeating high-fidelity calculations, e.g., when exploring the parameter space of the calculations. The basic principle of the RBM was recently rediscovered in nuclear theory as the eigenvector continuation method Frame et al. (2018), where the focus was solving the eigenvalue problem. The RBM-based emulators have gained much attention and further development, including for nuclear-bound states Sarkar and Lee (2021a, 2022); König et al. (2020); Demol et al. (2020); Ekström and Hagen (2019); Demol et al. (2021); Yoshida and Shimizu (2022); Anderson et al. (2022); Giuliani et al. (2023); Yapa et al. (2023), resonant states Yapa et al. (2023, 2024) and general continuum scattering states Furnstahl et al. (2020); Drischler et al. (2021); Melendez et al. (2021); Zhang and Furnstahl (2022); Bai and Ren (2021); Drischler and Zhang (2022); Melendez et al. (2022); Drischler et al. (2023); Bai (2022); Garcia et al. (2023); Odell et al. (2024). One difference in our work’s RBM aspect is emulating inhomogeneous linear equations with continuous spectra222Ref. Melendez et al. (2022) surveyed different ROMs, including for the inhomogeneous equations. However, the continuous spectrum aspect was not illuminated.. In contrast, most previous quantum physics-related studies have considered emulating a specific eigenstate of a Hamiltonian operator, either a bound, resonance, or scattering state at a real energy E. More significantly, this is the first time to consider the complex E plane as part of the parameter space, in addition to the other model input parameters, such as \bm{\theta} in Eqs. (3) and (4). Our RBM formalism is discussed in detail in Sec. III. If we only consider the E variable, our complex-E emulation (CEE) is superficially similar to the rational Krylov methods Antoulas (2005); Van Beeumen et al. (2017); Peng et al. (2019) applied in studying finite linear equation systems. However, the CEE generalizes the Krylov methods to studying linear systems with continuous spectra. We also gain insights about a potential connection, mentioned throughout this paper, between the CEE and the (near)-optimal rational approximations Trefethen (2023) of a univariate function with branch points. Such a connection does not exist in the case of a linear system with only a discrete spectrum. When including emulation in other real-valued parameters, our study further extends the rational Krylov methods to the case with higher-dimensional parameter spaces; it also generalizes the univariate rational approximation to a multivariate one. We call it CERPE, an abbreviation for “complex-energy real-parameter emulator.” Further discussions on the related works can be found in Sec. III.5 On the physics front, our CEE is a new NHQM method for computing continuum states and observables. This is demonstrated numerically with two and three-body systems in Secs. IV and V. Some analytic understanding of the NHQM aspect of our CEE and the existing NHQM methods, including integration-contour deformation Glöckle (1983), complex scaling of different variants Reinhardt (1982); Moiseyev (2011); Myo et al. (2014); Lazauskas and Carbonell (2011); Lazauskas (2012); Papadimitriou and Vary (2015); Lazauskas (2015); Lazauskas and Carbonell (2020), and Berggren-basis based methods Michel and Płoszajczak (2021); Li et al. (2021); Berggren (1968); Michel et al. (2002, 2003); Id Betan et al. (2003); Hagen et al. (2006); Rotureau et al. (2006); Fossez et al. (2017); Hu et al. (2020); Michel et al. (2022), are presented in Sec. II.2. The generic strategies behind these methods are elaborated in that section using a simple model. However, our method differs significantly from existing NHQM approaches. The fundamental distinction is in constructing a finite-dimensional non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H matrix—a step we call “non-Hermitization.”333This can also be viewed as breaking time-reversal symmetry in the basis. This difference and its implications are discussed in Sec. III.3. The CERPE component of this study is also useful for continuum physics studies. Both Hamiltonian spectra and \mathcal{A} can be interpolated, extrapolated, or emulated in the space of \bm{\theta} in the inhomogeneous Schrödinger equations. The functionality of CERPE follows the same argument of existing emulators: they provide efficient interfaces for the users to access computationally expensive calculations with dramatically reduced computing costs Zhang and Furnstahl (2022). For example, with this emulator technology, model calibration and uncertainty quantification, particularly those based on Bayesian statistics, would become feasible for complex models and expensive calculations. In short, with CEE, continuum physics can potentially be extracted from bound-state-like calculations—an advantage of the NHQM methods. The CERPE further expands the functionality of such continuum physics calculations by reaching more users. Another new physics insight is concerned with complex-energy (CE) Schlessinger and Schwartz (1966); Schlessinger (1968a, b); McDonald and Nuttall (1969); Uzu et al. (2003); Deltuva and Fonseca (2012, 2013a, 2013b, 2014) and Lorentz integral transformation (LIT) methods Efros (1985a); Efros et al. (1994, 2007); Orlandini et al. (2014); Sobczyk et al. (2021, 2024); Bonaiti et al. (2024). The inhomogeneous Schrödinger equations are also solved at complex energies in the LIT calculations and effectively in the CE calculations.444In the existing implementation of the CE method Uzu et al. (2003); Deltuva and Fonseca (2012, 2013a, 2013b, 2014), the Lippmann-Schwinger and the Faddeev equations are solved for the on- and off-shell scattering amplitudes. However, the wave functions can be computed with those amplitudes and vice versa Schlessinger and Schwartz (1966). Using their procedures, these methods connect the complex-E results to the real-E ones. Our results suggest that these existing calculations can be viewed from the lens of the general NHQM framework. Perhaps more importantly, the CERPE developed here can be applied directly to emulate these existing calculations. The general procedures for achieving this can be found in Sec. VI. One counterintuitive understanding of computing continuum physics is worth a brief mention. The results shown in this work suggest that the CEE, which approximates \mathcal{A} using a small non-Hermitian H-matrix in Eq. (2), produces better results at real energies than the high-fidelity calculations based on a large Hermitian H-matrix. What is puzzling is that the two agree numerically in the instances with complex energies, i.e., the emulator is trained by these high-fidelity calculations. In contrast, in the existing emulator studies, emulators are supposed to reproduce high-fidelity calculations, including during extrapolations. We inevitably conclude that the CEE (and thus CERPE) as an extrapolant for E is biased to the physical continuum physics instead of the high-fidelity results based on a discrete spectrum. The non-Hermitization of H plays a key role here. This is further discussed in Sec. VII. We emphasize that although numerical results are only presented for simple two- and three-body systems with short-range interactions, both CEE and CERPE should work for general finite systems, as the applicability of the RBM method and the working of non-Hermitization are general, without specific reference to the size and the interaction nature of the system. The RBM method requires smooth dependence of the solution on the input parameters, which have been found to hold up in few and many-body studies. Meanwhile, as explained later, the non-Hermitization depends on the spectrum’s continuous nature and the training points’ setup in the complex E plane. However, we also need to point out that all the numeric calculations here are performed with high accuracy, with relative errors on the order of 10^{-12} in the training calculations. Our understanding of the methods developed here is based on such calculations. In practice, the training calculations, although attainable using bound-state methods, can have more significant errors. How the errors impact the performance of the emulator’s extrapolation and ways to stabilize the extrapolation need to be studied in the future. A summary of the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, a general discussion about H’s spectrum, its resolvent operator, and their connections to the continuum observables are provided. Recent developments in rational approximation studies are mentioned in light of their relevance in this work. Section III discusses the RBM framework used in this study. Numerical experiments of the CEE and CERPE in both two and three-body systems are discussed and analyzed carefully in Secs. IV and V. In Sec. VI, we discuss the potential couplings between our methods and other calculation methods. In Sec. VII, a summary is provided. The appendices collect some detailed information needed to reproduce the numerical calculations in this work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06607v1,High-Fidelity Individual Addressing of Single Atoms in Quantum Registers at Three-Photon Laser Excitation of Rydberg States,"Precise individual addressing of single atoms in quantum registers formed by optical trap arrays is essential to achieve high-fidelity quantum gates in neutral-atom quantum computers and simulators. Two-qubit quantum gates are typically realized using coherent two-photon laser excitation of atoms to strongly interacting Rydberg states. However, two-photon excitation encounters challenges in individual addressing with tightly focused laser beams due to atom position uncertainty and the spatial inhomogeneity in both Rabi frequencies and light shifts. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that the fidelity of individual addressing can be improved by employing coherent three-photon laser excitation of Rydberg states. For a specific example of 5s_{1/2}\!\xrightarrow{\Omega_{1}}\!5p_{3/2}\!\xrightarrow{\Omega_{2}}\!6s_{1/% 2}\!\xrightarrow{\Omega_{3}}\!np excitation in 87Rb atoms, we find that upon strong laser coupling in the second step (Rabi frequency \Omega_{2}) and moderate coupling in the first and third steps (Rabi frequencies \Omega_{1} and \Omega_{3}), the three-photon Rabi frequency is given by \Omega\!=\!\Omega_{1}\Omega_{3}/\Omega_{2}. If the spatial distributions of (\Omega_{1}\Omega_{3}) and \Omega_{2} are arranged to be identical, \Omega becomes independent of atom position, even within very tightly focused laser beams. This approach dramatically improves individual addressing of Rydberg excitation for neighboring atoms in trap arrays compared to conventional two-photon excitation schemes. Our findings are crucial for large-scale quantum registers of neutral atoms, where distances between adjacent atoms should be minimized to ensure stronger Rydberg interactions and compact arrangement of atom arrays.","References Saffman et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06199v1,"Control of the classical dynamics of a particle in the 
Morse-soft-Coulomb potential","We introduce the one-dimensional Morse-soft-Coulomb (MsC) potential consisting of a Morse repulsive barrier smoothly connected with a soft-core Coulomb potential at the origin. This new potential has a single parameter that controls the softness of the repulsive barrier and the well depth. When this softening-depth parameter tends to zero, the MsC potential approaches the Coulomb potential with an infinite repulsive barrier, a known successful model for the hydrogen atom. We investigate the classical chaotic dynamics of the MsC potential subjected to time-dependent external fields, comparing the results with the Coulomb potential. We show that the MsC potential reproduces the dynamics and the ionization probabilities of the Coulomb potential for sufficiently small values of the softening parameter. We also investigate the role of the softening parameter in the phase-space structures, showing that the increasing of its value leads to the increasing of the chaotic sea and consequently to the rise of the ionization probability. Finally, we address the problem of controlling the dynamics of a particle in the MsC potential from the perspective of optimal control theory, which cannot be easily applied in the case of the Coulomb potential due to the singularity at the origin. We analize a particular optimal solution to the problem of transferring a given amount of energy to the system at minimum cost. Our results show that the MsC potential can be a useful simple model for investigating the hydrogen atom.","One-dimensional model potentials are of fundamental importance for Physics since they contribute to a clear understanding of diverse complex atomic and molecular processes such as ionization and dissociation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Standard examples are the Morse potential and the one-dimensional Coulomb potential used, respectively, in the study of dissociation of diatomic molecules and ionization of the hydrogen atom [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. These models in conjunction with the tools of classical nonlinear dynamics provide important means of gaining physical insight in complicate situations. In particular, the classical approach has been proved to be a powerful tool for analysing the ionization of hydrogen atoms. For instance, the classical driven one-dimensional hydrogen atom yields good agreement with the experimentally determined ionization thresholds [13, 14, 15]. Nonlinear dynamics provides a general description for the escaping of a particle from a potential well, which can be regarded as atomic ionization or molecular dissociation depending on the model potential [8, 16, 17, 18, 19]. In the absence of external fields, the phase space is composed by a bound region, where the particle undergoes periodic motion, and by an unbound region, where the particle can depart from the potential well. Periodic time-dependent external fields can induce transitions from the bound to the unbound region by means of chaotic routes. For small field strength, some invariant curves remain in phase space, the so-called Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM) tori, except in the vicinity of the nonlinear resonances, where resonance islands emerge enclosed by a localized chaotic regions. In this scenario, no escaping occurs, since the motion is still restricted in phase space. However, with increasing field strength, the resonance islands grows and overlap each other leading to the destruction of the KAM tori. The phase-space is then dominated by resonance islands and by a connected chaotic sea, where the particle can diffuse erratically and eventually escapes from the potential well. Although this the the main known escaping mechanism, we mention in passing that there exist also nonchaotic routes which leads to the escaping of the particle through deformed KAM tori [20]. When referring to the one-dimensional hydrogen atom model, two distinct Coulomb-like potentials are often considered: one is symmetric around the origin V(r)\propto-1/|r|, and the other has an infinite repulsive barrier at the origin V(r)\propto-1/r, such that the particle is constrained to move in the positive semi-axis r\geq 0. In both cases, the singularity has to be tackled to perform numerical calculations and to this end some techniques based on extended phase space have been developed [21, 22]. However, the issue with the singularity becomes more severe, or even prohibitive, when one tries to apply optimal control theory to these problems because the associated Euler-Lagrange equations involves spatial derivatives of the potential function. Since the optimal control of classically chaotic system is an important part of the control of molecular system [23, 24, 25], alternative approaches to the classical control of these singular potentials should be developed. To circumvent the singularity problem in the case of the symmetric Coulomb potential, Eberly and co-workers proposed the soft-Coulomb potential V(r)\propto-1/\sqrt{r^{2}+\alpha^{2}}, a well-behaved potential with a softening parameter \alpha [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 2, 31, 32]. However, there has been no singularity-free, simple potential to mimic the Coulomb potential with an infinite repulsive barrier. To fill this gap, we introduce the Morse-soft-Coulomb (MsC) potential consisting of a Morse repulsive barrier smoothly connected with a soft-core Coulomb potential at the origin. This potential is differentiable up to second order while possessing a single parameter that sets the softness of the repulsive barrier and the well depth. The MsC potential approaches the Coulomb potential with an infinite repulsive barrier as the softening-depth parameter tends to zero. We consider the chaotic dynamics of the MsC potential subjected to harmonic driving field and show that the MsC potential reproduces the dynamics and the ionization probabilities of the Coulomb potential for small values of the softening parameter. We analyze the impact of the softening parameter in the phase-space structures, verifying that the increasing of its value leads to the increasing of the chaotic sea and to the rise of the ionization probability. We also address the problem of controlling the dynamics of a particle in the MsC potential using optimal control theory. We consider the problem of transferring a given amount of energy to the system at minimum effort and investigate a particular solution, termed intrinsic optimal solution [33]."
