https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10380v1,Forecast of solar activity based on mean-field dynamo model and neural network,"We discuss a prediction of the solar activity on a short time-scale applying the method based on a combination of a nonlinear mean-field dynamo model and the artificial neural network. The artificial neural network which serves as a correction scheme for the forecast, uses the currently available observational data (e.g., the 13 month running average of the observed solar sunspot numbers) and the dynamo model output. The nonlinear mean-field \alpha\,\Omega dynamo produces the large-scale magnetic flux which is redistributed by negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI) producing sunspots and active regions. The nonlinear mean-field dynamo model includes algebraic nonlinearity (caused by the feedback of the growing magnetic field on the plasma motion) and dynamic nonlinearities (related to the dynamics of the magnetic helicity of small-scale magnetic field). We compare the forecast errors with a horizon of 1, 6, 12 and 18 months, for different forecast methods, with the same corrections on the current monthly observations. Our forecast is in good agreement with the observed solar activity, the forecast error is almost stably small over short-medium ranges of forecasting windows. Despite a strong level of chaotic component in the solar magnetic activity we present quantitative evidence that the solar activity on a short range can be stably well predicted, by the joint use of the physically based model with the neural network. This result may have an immediate practical implementation for predictions of various phenomena of solar activity and other astrophysical processes, so may be of interest to a broad community.","Predictions of the solar activity is a crucial problem related to a fundamental solar physics that have important applications. Various methods including the mean-field dynamo models have been applied to predict the solar activity (see, e.g., Dikpati & Gilman, 2006; Choudhuri et al., 2007a; Kane, 2007; Bushby & Tobias, 2007; Obridko & Shelting, 2008; De Jager & Duhau, 2009; Kitiashvili & Kosovichev, 2011; Pesnell, 2012; Tlatov, 2015; Kitiashvili, 2016; Usoskin, 2017; Safiullin et al., 2018). Besides that there are other numerous methods to predict the solar activity using various sets of data as precursors or signatures of the forthcoming solar activity level. Most of solar activity predictions are focused on the magnitude of the nearest solar cycle maximum, or the minimum, or even the magnitude of the further several cycles. However, in spite of the numerous studies, improvement of the solar activity forecast is still a subject of active discussions. Our approach is aimed for prediction of the 13-monthly running average mean solar sunspot number. We challenge our method for a predictions that is shifted a month ahead (or 6, 12, and 18 months ahead) with respect to the last available 13-month running mean average (i.e., with correction by up-to-date observations). Our method has been checked in real time with available observations over the last six years. The results and statistical data on the forecast since 2021 are available on the web111https://github.com/rodionstepanov/SolarActivityPrediction. In our approach to the forecast of solar activity, we take into account the following: • We use a nonlinear dynamo model (Kleeorin et al., 2016; Safiullin et al., 2018) that is able to reproduce properties and long-term dynamics of the mean magnetic field up to several hundreds of solar cycles. This model describes the main cyclic oscillations of the large-scale magnetic field with an intrinsic chaotic behaviour caused by the dynamics of the magnetic helicity of small-scale magnetic fields. The mean-field dynamo produces the large-scale magnetic flux (see, e.g., Moffatt, 1978; Parker, 1979; Krause & Rädler, 1980; Zeldovich et al., 1983; Moffatt & Dormy, 2019; Rogachevskii, 2021). • The redistribution of the large-scale magnetic flux by the large-scale negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI) results in formation of sunspots and active regions (Kleeorin et al., 1989, 1990). This instability has been investigated theoretically using various analytical approaches (Kleeorin & Rogachevskii, 1994; Kleeorin et al., 1996; Rogachevskii & Kleeorin, 2007) and detected in direct numerical simulations in various setups (see, e.g., Brandenburg et al., 2011, 2016; Warnecke et al., 2013, 2016). NEMPI has a threshold in the magnitude of the mean magnetic field. In the process triggered by this instability, no new large-scale magnetic flux is produced in contrast to the dynamo process. • There are three characteristic times of interest concerning the solar activity prediction: (i) long-term evolution of the mean magnetic field associated with the effect of magnetic helicity relaxation (Kleeorin & Ruzmaikin, 1982; Kleeorin et al., 1995); (ii) turbulent diffusion of the dynamo generated large-scale magnetic fields at the scale of the solar convective zone depth. These processes are described by the non-linear \alpha\Omega dynamo model which takes into account evolution of small-scale magnetic helicity. (iii) Short-term evolution at the scales of super-granulation related to formation of sunspots and active regions. This is entirely connected with NEMPI process. Decay of sunspots and active regions is included in this process, too. • To predict the solar activity on a short time-scale, we combine the two approaches of the numerical solution of the nonlinear mean-field dynamo equations and the artificial neural network. The latter serves here as a correction scheme for the forecast, which uses the currently available observational data (the 13 month running average of the observed solar sunspot numbers time series) and the dynamo model output. The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively analyse the results of several years of practical forecasting of solar activity by the novel method (Safiullin et al., 2018) which combines the solar dynamo model with magnetic helicity evolution and the neural network, estimate the errors of forecasting and demonstrate its capabilities through newly observable data in comparisons with other forecasting methods. Despite a strong level of chaotic component in the solar magnetic activity we will present quantitative evidence that the solar activity on a short range can be reliably predicted, and it would give a positive example of the joint use of the physically based model plus the neural network."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10341v1,"Self-Excited Pulsations and the Instability Strip of Long-Period Variables:
the Transition from Small-Amplitude Red Giants to Semi-Regular Variables","We use one-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations combined with synthetic stellar population models of the Magellanic Clouds to study the onset of self-excited pulsation in luminous red giants. By comparing the results with OGLE observations in the period-luminosity diagram we are able to link the transition from small-amplitude red giants to semi-regular variables with a shift from stochastic driving to self-excited pulsations. This is consistent with previous studies relating this transition with an increase in mass-loss rate, dust formation, and the appearance of long secondary periods. The luminosity and effective temperature at the onset of pulsation are found to depend on metallicity, hydrogen content, and the adopted mixing length parameter. This confirms the role of partial hydrogen ionization in driving the pulsation, supporting the idea of a heat mechanism similar to that of classical pulsators. We examine the impact of turbulent viscosity, and find clear evidence that it must be adjusted according to the stellar chemical and physical parameters to fully match observations. In order to improve the predictive power of pulsation models, the turbulent viscosity and the temperature scale of pulsating red giants must be jointly calibrated. This is critical for model-based studies of the period-luminosity relations of evolved stars and to exploit their potential as distance and age indicators, in particular given the sensitivity of the onset of pulsation to the envelope composition. The grid of models is made publicly available with a companion interpolation routine.","Figure 1: Period-luminosity diagrams of LPVs in the SMC (left-hand panel) and in the LMC (right-hand panel) from OGLE-III observations cross-matched with 2MASS photometry. Orange and green symbols mark OSARGs and SRVs, respectively (Miras are omitted). Dashed lines are the best-fits to sequences A, B, C′, C and D determined by Soszyński et al. (2007, based on their tables 1 and 2, and adopting the labels indicated in their figures 2 and 4). For clarity we do not distinguish bewteen O- and C-rich SRVs in the scatter plot, but we show the best-fit lines to sequences C′ and C for the respective populations following Soszyński et al. (2007). The dotted lines indicate the approximate magnitude at the tip of the RGB. Density contour lines corresponding to 10 per cent of the maximum density of SRVs are overlaid. Long-period variables (LPVs) represent a rather heterogeneous family of pulsating red stars. From the standpoint of stellar evolution, they consist primarily of red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with low- to intermediate-mass (1\lesssim M_{\rm i}\,/\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\lesssim 8) progenitors (Herwig, 2005; Wood, 2015), although more massive stars (up to \approx 25\,{\rm M}_{\odot}) that become red supergiants during late core He-burning stages may also exhibit LPV-like variability (e.g. Kiss et al., 2006). They cover a vast range in terms of variability properties, with periods spanning from a few days to several years and photometric amplitudes up to about 10 mag in visual bands. As a result, observational limitations and research scopes have affected their classification, and a number of schemes have been proposed to distinguish between different sub-types of LPVs. Following a long-standing practice, stars with visual amplitudes larger than 2.5 mag are classified as Mira variables. These are among the most evolved and intrinsically brightest AGB stars, and have periods from a few months to a few years. Moving towards fainter and less evolved objects, one encounters shorter periods, smaller amplitudes, and a lesser degree of regularity, often related to the presence of multiple periods in the light curve. Some of these stars are classified as semi-regular (SR) variables, of which several subclasses exist (Samus’ et al., 2017). Other stars are often labelled as irregular variables or small-amplitude red variables/giants (see e.g. Eggen, 1977). An overview of the variability classification of red giants can be found in Catelan & Smith (2015). Large-scale optical microlensing surveys initiated in the 1990’s resulted in a wealth of photometric time series of variable stars in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), and played an central role in the study of LPVs (Wood et al., 1999; Wood, 2000). In particular, the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE Udalski et al., 1992) delivered a catalog of LPVs (Soszyński et al., 2009, 2011, 2013b; Iwanek et al., 2022) that represents a gold standard for the investigation of this type of stars. The catalog employs its own classification scheme based on the features of photometric time series in the Cousins I band. Miras are identified by their peak-to-peak amplitude \Delta I larger than 0.8 mag, whereas the remaining stars are classified either as semi-regular variables (SRVs) or OGLE small amplitude red giants (OSARGs) based on their periods ratios and on the location of their multiple periods in the sequences and ridges of the period-luminosity (PL) diagram (Soszyński et al., 2007). There is evidence of an evolutionary sequence through these variability types (e.g. Soszyński et al., 2013a; Trabucchi et al., 2019), yet the relationships and differences between them are not entirely clear. OSARGs and SRVs populate distinct regions of the PL diagram (PLD, Fig. 1), the former being found primarily on sequences A and B, whereas the latter are located along sequences C′ and C. However, both sequences B and C′ are associated with pulsation in the first-overtone mode (Yu et al., 2020), thus the difference between OSARGs and SRVs is not only a matter of dominant pulsation modes. Even though the gap between sequences B and C′ has been linked with the appearance of long secondary periods (LSPs, Trabucchi et al., 2017), the difference in character between OSARGs and SRVs suggests a more fundamental physical transition, supported by observational evidence of increased mass-loss rates (McDonald & Trabucchi, 2019). One possibility is that they differ in the driving mechanism of pulsation (Soszyński et al., 2004). Stellar oscillations are very common in stars with an extended convective envelope, and they can often be attributed to acoustic standing waves (e.g. Aerts et al., 2010). It is widely accepted that a solar-like stochastic convective driving is the cause of these oscillations in RGB stars at relatively low luminosity (see e.g. the review by Chaplin & Miglio, 2013), while the situation is less clear for the more evolved LPVs. Early dynamical models of LPVs (e.g. Keeley, 1970; Wood, 1974), later complemented with linear stability analysis (e.g. Fox & Wood, 1982; Ostlie & Cox, 1986) largely revolved around the notion that LPVs result from a \kappa/\gamma-type heat mechanism similar to that of Cepheid variables and other classical pulsators, and highlighted the importance of the zone of partial hydrogen ionization in the driving mechanism. The interplay between convection and pulsation is a notoriously complex problem (see e.g. the review by Houdek & Dupret, 2015), that created difficulties in early studies, somewhat mitigated in more recent iterations (e.g. Olivier & Wood, 2005; Keller & Wood, 2006). Such works shed light on the role of convection in the driving of pulsation (e.g. Munteanu et al., 2005; Xiong & Deng, 2013), although a definitive identification of the driving mechanism remains elusive. Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (2001) were among the first to propose solar-like stochastic driving as an alternative for the excitation of SR variables (see also Bedding, 2003). As outlined by Hartig et al. (2014), and more recently by Yu et al. (2020), the notion that LPVs might be solar-like oscillators has been extensively explored with the advent of modern asteroseismology, and has gathered substantial support both on observational and theoretical grounds (e.g. Dziembowski & Soszyński, 2010; Takayama et al., 2013; Mosser et al., 2013; Stello et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2020; Cadmus, 2024). A recurring argument in favour of this hypothesis is that the global solar-like oscillation pattern can be extended from the red giant branch to brighter magnitudes findinding a good agreement with the PL relations of LPVs. Yet the latter can be reproduced comparably well invoking stochastic driving (e.g. Wood, 2015; Trabucchi et al., 2019). Using linear, nonadiabatic pulsation models with a non-local and time-dependent treatment of convection, Xiong et al. (2018) concluded that red giants transition from stochastic to self-excited pulsation with increasing luminosity. This appears consistent with the transition in variability properties observed by Bányai et al. (2013). Cunha et al. (2020) reach similar conclusions based on a phenomenological model, and identify both SR and Mira variables as classic-type pulsators. Moreover, self-excited hydrodynamic models are necessary to reconcile stellar evolution models with observations of Miras (Trabucchi et al., 2021b). Further evidence in favor of self-excitation comes from full “star-in-a-box” three-dimensional simulations of the entire convective envelope of AGB stars, which show a high degree of compatibility with variability observations (e.g. Freytag et al., 2017; Ahmad et al., 2023) and near-infrared interferometric measurements (Paladini et al., 2018; Rosales-Guzmán et al., 2024). Whether they argue in favor of the solar-like or self-excited mechanism, most of these studies are based on linear models, which are not able to capture the full complexity of the pulsation in LPVs. The early hydrodynamic models and the very recent three-dimensional simulations represent notable exceptions, but they cover a restricted space of parameters and are limited in scope. In this work, we compute a grid of one-dimensional hydrodynamic pulsation models to address systematically the onset of self-excited pulsation in bright red giants, and to investigate the transition from small-amplitude red giants to SRVs. This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe our methods, and in Section 3 we present the results of our analysis. In that same section, we address the comparison of our predictions with observations. We discuss the implications of our findings in Section 4 and draw our conclusions in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10270v1,"Strong magnetic fields of old white dwarfs 
are symmetric about the stellar rotation axes","Many magnetic white dwarfs exhibit a polarised spectrum that periodically varies as the star rotates because the magnetic field is not symmetric about the rotation axis. In this work, we report the discovery that while weakly magnetic white dwarfs of all ages with M\leq 1\,M_{\odot} show polarimetric variability with a period between hours and several days, the large majority of magnetic white dwarfs in the same mass range with cooling ages older than 2 Gyr and field strengths \geq 10 MG show little or no polarimetric variability. This could be interpreted as extremely slow rotation, but a lack of known white dwarfs with measured periods longer than two weeks means that we do not see white dwarfs slowing their rotation. We therefore suggest a different interpretation: old strongly magnetic white dwarfs do not vary because their fields are roughly symmetric about the rotation axes. Symmetry may either be a consequence of field evolution or a physical characteristic intrinsic to the way strong fields are generated in older stars. Specifically, a strong magnetic field could distort the shape of a star, forcing the principal axis of maximum inertia away from the spin axis. Eventually, as a result of energy dissipation, the magnetic axis will align with the angular momentum axis. Alternatively, symmetry could be the hallmark of a dynamo that operates after the beginning of core crystallisation. We also find that the higher-mass strongly magnetised white dwarfs, which are likely the products of the merging of two white dwarfs, may appear as either polarimetrically variable or constant. This may be the symptom of two different formation channels or the consequence of the fact that a dynamo operating during a merger may produce diverse magnetic configurations. Alternatively, the massive white dwarfs with constant polarisation may be rotating with periods much shorter than the typical exposure times of the observations.","Most white dwarfs do not show any variability, and more than 97% of them can be safely considered as suitable flux standard stars (Hermes et al. 2017). Because of flux stability, it is generally impossible to measure the rotation period of white dwarfs except when they pulsate or when they have a magnetic field. It is well known that magnetic white dwarfs often show periodically variable signals of polarisation and sometimes also periodic photometric variability. In the local 20 pc volume, more than 20% of white dwarfs have a magnetic field (Bagnulo & Landstreet 2021), and about 20% of the magnetic white dwarfs are photometrically variable (Farihi et al. 2024). Polarimetric variability is explained in terms of a magnetic field not symmetric about the rotation axis so that the magnetic configuration seen by the observer (as encoded in the polarisation signal) varies as the star rotates. The causes of photometric variability are not well understood (see, e.g., Bagnulo et al. 2024b), yet photometric variability of non-pulsating white dwarfs is so clearly correlated with the presence of the magnetic field variations that one may hypothesise that all non-pulsating white dwarfs with light variations are magnetic. If a star belongs to the small class of white dwarfs with a well-detected light curve, then the rotational period may usually be deduced from photometry (see Brinkworth et al. 2013; Hernandez et al. 2024; Oliveira da Rosa et al. 2024), but, in general, the time series of polarisation measurements may allow one to recover the rotational period of a larger sample of magnetic white dwarfs. Investigations of magnetic fields and of rotational periods are closely related not only because the presence of a magnetic field enables period measurements but also because one could expect that the occurrence of a magnetic field and its strength is physically related to stellar rotation. For example, should the field be supported by a dynamo, one could predict fields to be stronger in more rapidly rotating stars than in those that are more slowly rotating. Correlations between the presence of a magnetic field and the rotational period of a star exist even when the field has a fossil origin. Most of the chemically peculiar stars of the main sequence (Ap and Bp stars) have a fossil magnetic field, and they all rotate more slowly than the non-magnetic non-chemically peculiar stars in the same region of the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (e.g. Donati & Landstreet 2009). Some of the magnetic Ap and Bp stars have well measured rotational periods as long as several months, years, or even decades (e.g. \gamma Equ, Leroy et al. 1994). There is no clear explanation for this well-established correlation between magnetic fields and slow stellar rotation. In the case of white dwarfs, various samples of data have gradually become available in the past few years to constrain possible scenarios for the evolution of their magnetic fields. It now appears that among the normal-mass white dwarfs (M\simeq 0.6M_{\odot}) that largely descend from single-star evolution, magnetic fields are very rare and weak during the first 1–2 Gyr of cooling but then gradually become much more common and often very strong after about 2–3 Gyr of cooling (Bagnulo & Landstreet 2021). This evolution may occur as a result of gradual relaxation to the surface of fields present in stellar cores during earlier evolution and/or as a result of the operation of a dynamo during core crystallisation (Isern et al. 2017; Schreiber et al. 2021; Bagnulo & Landstreet 2021, 2022; Ginzburg et al. 2022). Among normal-mass stars, those with a magnetic field seem to rotate faster than non-magnetic white dwarfs (Hernandez et al. 2024), supporting the idea that crystallisation-driven dynamo may play a role in the formation of their magnetic fields. Many highly massive white dwarfs (M\geq 1.0\,M_{\odot}), which are probably the product of mergers of two white dwarfs, appear magnetic very early in their cooling age, and the origin of the magnetic field may be due to a dynamo operating during the merging (Tout et al. 2008; García-Berro et al. 2012; Briggs et al. 2015; Bagnulo & Landstreet 2022). This idea is supported also by the evidence that some white dwarfs have very short rotation periods (e.g. Feige 7: 131 min, Liebert et al. 1977; Cl Oct: 12.1 min, Barstow et al. 1995; WD 2209+113: 70 s, Kilic et al. 2021). At the same time, some polarimetric studies have hinted that a few old magnetic white dwarfs with a field strength of the order of tens of to a hundred megagauss have extremely long rotational periods, showing at most quite small variations even on timescales of decades (e.g. Berdyugin & Piirola 1999; Bagnulo & Landstreet 2019b). Traditionally, this lack of obvious variability is explained by the assumption that such non-varying magnetic white dwarfs have very long rotation periods of the order of centuries (Schmidt & Norsworthy 1991). In the absence of clear observational support or contradiction, this assumption has been widely accepted (e.g. Ferrario et al. 2015). The conclusion is basically that the known periods, P, fall into two very different families: one with P\la 2 weeks, characterising most of the sample, and a few percent with strong fields that have periods of centuries (i.e. no clearly detected rotation). There is no explanation as to why some old white dwarfs would have extremely long rotation periods. Magnetic braking has generally been invoked but without the support of numerical calculations. In this work, we report new polarimetric observations and combine them with data collected from the literature. We analyse the magnetic variability and thus the rotation of a sample of 74 white dwarfs, and we discuss the constraints that these data place on possible evolution paths for magnetic fields in white dwarfs."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10215v1,Simulation of Thermal Nonequilibrium Cycles in the Solar Wind,"Thermal nonequilibrium (TNE) is a condition of the plasma in the solar corona in which the local rate of energy loss due to radiation increases to the point that it cannot be sustained by the various heating terms acting on the plasma, precluding the existence of a steady state. The limit cycles of precipitation and evaporation that result from TNE have been simulated in 1D models of coronal loops, as well as 2D and 3D models of the solar chromosphere and lower corona. However, a careful study of TNE in the solar wind has not been performed until now. Here we demonstrate that for suitable combinations of local and global heating rates it is possible for the plasma to exhibit a TNE condition, even in the context of a transonic solar wind with appreciable mass and energy fluxes. This implies limits on the amount of foot-point heating that can be withstood under steady-state conditions in the solar wind, and may help to explain the variability of solar wind streams that emanate from regions of highly concentrated magnetic flux on the solar surface. The implications of this finding pertain to various sources of high-density solar wind, including plumes that form above regions of mixed magnetic polarity in polar coronal holes and the slow solar wind (SSW) that emanates from coronal hole boundaries.","The condensation and precipitation of coronal plasma, commonly referred to as “coronal rain,” has been a ubiquitous feature in H-\alpha observations of the solar corona ever since the first birefringent filter telescope was designed and constructed by Evans (1949, 1958) at the High Altitude Obseratory in Boulder, CO. Initially this phenomenon was discussed in the context of coronal prominences (see, e.g., Newkirk, 1957; Kawaguchi, 1970; Leroy, 1972), but was later found in observations of coronal loops by such authors as Schrijver (2001), using the TRACE instrument (Handy et al., 1999), and De Groof et al. (2004), using SOHO/EIT (Delaboudinière et al., 1995) and, later, the Big Bear Solar Observatory (De Groof et al., 2005). In the era of AIA/SDO (Lemen et al., 2012) such observations have become common, particularly in coronal active regions where the stored magnetic energy is large. Recently, Mason & Kniezewski (2022) performed a survey of 241 solar flares from 2011 to 2018 and determined that most (>90\%) X-class flares and a majority (>70\%) of M-class flares exhibited coronal rain along the post-flare magnetic arcade over a period of several hours following the peak in flare brightness. This suggests that the conditions under which coronal condensates form are ubiquitous in the solar corona, especially where there is strong heating, as is common in solar active regions (Fisher et al., 1998). Additionally, there is evidence that coronal rain may occur preferentially near magnetic null points and along field lines that pass near to them. Mason et al. (2019) reported on observations of coronal rain along the separatrix surfaces of coronal null points above embedded magnetic bipoles observed by AIA/SDO. They even observed condensations forming above the (observationally inferred) location of the null point, along its open spine. This suggests that such condensates may not develop exclusively in the closed corona, as has typically been assumed. Some authors have even gone as far as to link the formation of coronal rain with the process of interchange reconnection (Li et al., 2020), although the causal mechanism underpinning this connection remains to be determined. The first computational model of coronal condensation was developed by Antiochos & Klimchuk (1991) to describe the physics of prominence formation. Building on previous results by Serio et al. (1981), they showed that for sufficiently strong foot-point heating rates the density at the apex of a coronal loop can increase to the point that the radiated power exceeds the power supplied by all other sources of heating, after which the plasma undergoes a localized thermal runaway that ultimately leads to catastrophic cooling and condensation. This phenomenon, which is now referred to as thermal nonequilibrium, or TNE, has since been confirmed in field aligned (1D) simulations by Antiochos et al. (1999), Antolin et al. (2008, 2010), Downs et al. (2016), Froment et al. (2018), Johnston et al. (2019), and others. Moreover, Klimchuk & Luna (2019) have developed scaling laws for determining the availability of steady state solutions on closed coronal loops with prescribed heating, and these have proven to be highly predictive of TNE conditions in numerical simulations. Although the majority of TNE studies have been performed in 1D models of closed coronal loops, the condensation of coronal plasma has also been observed in 2.5D and 3D simulations by Fang et al. (2015), Kohutova et al. (2020), Li et al. (2022), Antolin et al. (2022), and others. In a few cases, these have been observed to form along “open” field lines that extend from the model chromosphere to the top of the numerical domain. This suggests that TNE is insensitive to magnetic connectivity, meaning that it may occur in coronal holes or near coronal hole boundaries. However, because the spatial domains in these simulations typically don’t extend beyond about 50\,\rm Mm above the solar surface, they do not support an outward-flowing solar wind with a sonic point. As a result, the gas dynamics along open field lines in such models may not be representative of the conditions found in the regions whence the solar wind emanates. One exception is the study by Schlenker et al. (2021), who performed a 2.5D simulation of TNE conditions in a magnetic helmet streamer with a self-consistent, transonic solar wind in the adjacent coronal hole region. They found that certain values of the foot-point heating rate caused coronal condensates to form along the flank of the helmet streamer, and that the critical condition predicted by Klimchuk & Luna (2019) was approximately recovered when the loop length was replaced with the gravitational scale height to establish the natural length scale of the system. Notably, some of the condensates observed by Schlenker et al. (2021) appeared to be raining down along open field lines that were outside of the helmet streamer separatix surface (i.e., the open-closed boundary); however it was not clear from their simulations whether the condensates originated in the open field region or were released into it following magnetic reconnection at the helmet streamer apex. In this paper we report on the formation of coronal rain and the emergence of TNE-driven limit cycles of precipitation and evaporation (hereafter “TNE cycles”) in numerical simulations of the solar wind. Our model solves the time-dependent field-aligned Navier-Stokes equations from the chromosphere, through the transition region and lower corona, and into the extended corona and heliosphere, with empirical heating, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction. As this model explicitly assumes an open magnetic geometry, which naturally supports a transonic outflow, the condensates that form within the model, which are found in the subsonic region between the solar surface and the sonic point, are unambiguously embedded in and consistent with the conditions of the solar wind. In the following section (2) we briefly describe the design of our numerical model. Then, in sections 3 and 4, we describe the equilibrium conditions and subsequent loss of equilibrium as a consequence of enhanced foot-point heating. The TNE cycles that emerge following the loss of equilibrium are discussed in sections 5 and 6. In section 7 we discuss the implications of TNE cycles to heliospheric observations, before concluding with a summary discussion in section 8."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10110v1,Filament eruption deflection and associated CMEs,"We present the observations of a quiescent filament eruption and its deflection from the radial direction. The event occurred in the southern solar hemisphere on 2021 May 9 and was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), by the STEREO -A Observatory and GONG. Part of the filament erupted in the west direction, while major part of the filament deviated towards east direction. LASCO observed a very weak CME towards the west direction where it faded quickly. Moreover, the eruption was associated with CME observed by STEREO A COR1 and COR2. Our observations provide the evidence that the filament eruption was highly non-radial in nature.","Solar filament eruptions are one of the most studied phenomena in the field of solar physics. Filaments can erupt fully or partially and these erupted material can be observed in form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) (Webb et. al (1976); Munro et. al (1979); Gopalswamy (2000, 2003); Schmieder et. al (2013); Seki et. al (2021) , and references cited therein). There are cases of the deflection of CME during its propagation near to Sun or in the interplanetary space (for example: Zuccarello et. al (2012); Koleva et. al (2024). The study of the deflection of filament eruption and CMEs can be a crucial study to understand the geoeffectiveness of solar eruptions. In this work we present the study of a sigmoid filament eruption that occurred in the southern solar hemisphere on 2021 May 9. The kinematics and morphology of the event were investigated by Koleva et. al (2021). Here we focused on the associated CME and its offset from the radial propagation. The used data and observations from two points of view are introduced in Section 2. Section 3 provides our interpretation of the observations."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10011v1,"Temporal evolution of axially standing kink motions in solar coronal slabs:
An eigenfunction expansion approach","Aims. We aim to provide more insights into the applicability to solar coronal seismology of the much-studied discrete leaky modes (DLMs) in classic analyses.Methods. Under linear ideal pressureless MHD, we examine two-dimensional (2D) axial fundamental kink motions that arise when localized velocity exciters impact some symmetric slab equilibria. Continuous structuring is allowed for. A 1D initial value problem (IVP) is formulated in conjunction with an eigenvalue problem (EVP) for laterally open systems, with no strict boundary conditions (BCs) at infinity. The IVP is solved by eigenfunction expansion, allowing a clear distinction between the contributions from proper eigenmodes and improper continuum eigenmodes. Example solutions are offered for parameters typical of active region loops.Results. Our solutions show that the system evolves towards long periodicities due to proper eigenmodes (of order the axial Alfv\acute{\rm e}n time), whereas the interference of the improper continuum may lead to short periodicities initially (of order the lateral Alfv\acute{\rm e}n time). Specializing to the slab axis, we demonstrate that the proper contribution strengthens with the density contrast, but may occasionally be stronger for less steep density profiles. Short periodicities are not guaranteed in the improper contribution, the details of the initial exciter being key. When identifiable, these periodicities tend to agree with the oscillation frequencies expected for DLMs, despite the differences in the BCs between our EVP and classic analyses. The eigenfunction expansion approach enables all qualitative features to be interpreted as the interplay between the initial exciter and some response function, the latter solely determined by the equilibria.Conclusions. Classic theories for DLMs can find seismological applications, with time-dependent studies offering additional ways for constraining initial exciters.","The past two decades have seen considerable progress in solar coronal seismology (e.g., the reviews by De Moortel & Nakariakov, 2012; Nakariakov & Kolotkov, 2020). One key factor has been the increasingly refined theories for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) 111Please see Appendix A for a full list of abbreviations. waves in structured media (see recent topical collections by Nakariakov et al., 2022; Kolotkov et al., 2023). This can be said even for waves in such canonical equilibria as straight cylinders where the physical parameters are structured only radially (see the textbooks by Roberts, 2019; Goedbloed et al., 2019, for classic treatments). Indeed, kink motions have been better understood theoretically, facilitating fuller seismological applications of, say, the cyclic transverse displacements extensively observed in active region (AR) loops (e.g., the dedicated review by Nakariakov et al., 2021). Likewise, substantial theoretical progress has been made for sausage motions (see the review by Li et al., 2020), enabling one to better exploit, say, the abundantly measured quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in flares (see e.g., Van Doorsselaere et al., 2016; Zimovets et al., 2021, for reviews). Whatever observable to be used for seismology needs to be offered an unambiguous theoretical understanding, which is not always possible though. It suffices to regard “observables” only as such timescales as periods or damping times. It also suffices to consider kink motions in a z-aligned cylindrical setup and consider only those temporal intervals where one may invoke the expectations in classic mode analyses. By “classic” we mean the customary procedure that starts by Fourier-decomposing any perturbation as \exp[-i(\Omega t-kz)], where k is the axial wavenumber and the possibly complex-valued \Omega is found by seeking nontrivial solutions to some boundary value problem (BVP, see e.g., Chapter 6 in Roberts 2019). Consider only small k given that AR loops are of primary interest throughout. Let “long” (“short”) refer to timescales on the order of the axial (transverse) Alfv\acute{\rm e}n time. The periodicities at large times for kink motions are accepted to be long and pertain to the kink frequency \Re\Omega_{\rm kink} (see e.g., Eq.(1) in Edwin & Roberts 1983) 222Here and hereafter, we use \Re and \Im to denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex-valued quantity, respectively., as has been extensively implemented (e.g., Nakariakov et al., 1999; Nakariakov & Ofman, 2001). That said, some controversy exists as to whether the accompanying damping is solely due to the resonant absorption in the Alfv\acute{\rm e}n continuum (see Goossens et al., 2011, for conceptual clarifications). Some “principal fast leaky kink” mode (PFLK) with \Re\Omega_{\rm PFLK}\approx\Re\Omega_{\rm kink} was additionally found in the mode analysis by Cally (1986; see also Meerson et al. 1978; Spruit 1982). Given a non-vanishing \Im\Omega_{\rm PFLK}, it was proposed by Cally (2003) that PFLK may occasionally play some role in the observed damping. However, Ruderman & Roberts (2006b) argued otherwise, thereby leading to some extensive discussions regarding whether the timescales of PFLKs can make it into the system evolution (Cally, 2006; Ruderman & Roberts, 2006a; Andries & Goossens, 2007). Evidently, this controversy may be partially settled by examining kink motions as an initial value problem (IVP). Terradas et al. (2007) offered such a study, reporting no evidence of PFLKs in their 1D solutions found with a finite-element code. Instead, temporal signatures were clearly demonstrated for the “trig” modes that solve the same dispersion relation (DR) that governs PFLKs in Cally (1986). Note that some key features of the expected spatial signatures can also manifest themselves, as evidenced by a recent 3D numerical study based on the finite-volume approach (Shi et al., 2023). Note further that trig modes are not of concern in the above-mentioned controversy, even though they are subject to some further debate. Some clarifications on the nomenclature prove necessary. By “classic BVPs” we refer to those that arise in classic mode analyses; the associated governing equations are ordinary differential equations (ODEs) given that only 1D structuring is of interest. By “modes” we specifically mean the nontrivial solutions to classic BVPs, and a mode is characterized by a pair of “mode frequency” (\Omega) and “mode function”. Let “spectrum” refer to the collection of \Omega. Two reasons are typically responsible for \Im\Omega not to vanish in our context, one being the physical relevance of the Alfv\acute{\rm e}n continuum (e.g., Goedbloed, 1998; Goossens et al., 2011) and the other being that the lateral domain is open. We focus on the latter. The boundary condition (BC) at infinity in classic analyses then amounts to that no ingoing waves are allowed (e.g., Andries & Goossens, 2007; Wang et al., 2023; Goedbloed et al., 2023). This BC yields two distinct types of mode behavior at large lateral distances, enabling the spectrum to be divided as such. One subspectrum comprises the well known “trapped modes”, the mode functions being evanescent at large distances and the mode frequencies being purely real (\Im\Omega=0, e.g., Edwin & Roberts, 1982, 1983). In contrast, the modes in the other subspectrum are characterized by a non-vanishing \Im\Omega, and the mode functions are oscillatory. A rich variety of modes have been reported in this subspectrum, the PFLK and trig modes being examples (e.g., Fig. 1 in Cally, 2003). We concentrate on the trig modes, which feature that the elements in the set \{\Re\Omega\} for small axial wavenumbers all correspond to short periodicities and are roughly equally spaced (Cally, 1986; Terradas et al., 2005). However, we follow Wang et al. (2023) to call them “discrete leaky modes” (DLMs). We choose not to use the customary term “leaky modes” to avoid confusions; in the literature this term may include PFLKs (e.g., Cally, 2003; Ruderman & Roberts, 2006b) or may actually refer to the entire \Im\Omega\neq 0 subspectrum (Cally 1986; also Zajtsev & Stepanov 1975; Spruit 1982). Our study will address kink motions in slab equilibria from an IVP perspective, paying special attention to the relevance of the DLM expectations to our time-dependent solutions. We stress that the slab geometry, although in less frequent use, may be relevant for interpreting the oscillatory behavior measured in, say, post-flare supra-arcades (Verwichte et al., 2005), streamer stalks (e.g, Chen et al., 2010; Feng et al., 2011; Decraemer et al., 2020), and flare current sheets (e.g., Jelínek & Karlický, 2012; Karlický et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2016). More importantly, key to our study is the wave behavior far from wave-guiding inhomogeneities, meaning that our qualitative findings are applicable to more general geometries. That said, DLMs in a slab geometry are indeed the subject of some controversy. The classic mode analysis in Roberts (2019, Sect. 5.6) indicates that no kink DLM exists that solves the classic BVP when the slab is density-enhanced relative to its ambient corona, in contrast to earlier mode analyses that suggest the opposite (e.g., Terradas et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2018). Accepting DLMs as mathematical solutions, one further subtlety is that DLMs may have no physical meaning as argued on energetics grounds by Goedbloed et al. (2023). Note that this argument holds regardless of geometries, and hence apparently contradicts direct numerical simulations that quantitatively display some expected DLM signatures (e.g., Terradas et al., 2005, 2007; Shi et al., 2023). Our study is partly motivated by these inconsistencies. Our essentially analytical approach builds on the standard spectral theory of differential operators (e.g., Richtmyer, 1978) or more intuitively on the Fourier-integral-based method (e.g., Whitham, 1974). Key is that one formulates an eigenvalue problem (EVP) consistent with the IVP in both the spatial operator and the BCs. Given localized initial exciters, what happens at infinity should not affect the perturbations at any finite distance. Consequently, the BCs at infinity in both our IVP and EVP are only nominal; no definitive requirement is specified. Formally speaking, this condition is the only difference between our EVP and the pertinent “classic BVP”. This difference turns out to be crucial, to clarify which we will use “eigen” in any term that arises in our EVP whenever possible. By “eigenmode” we refer to a nontrivial solution jointly characterized by an eigenfrequency (\omega) and an eigenfunction. By “eigenspectrum” we mean the collection of \omega. We emphasize “eigen” because the nontrivial solutions qualify as such, the defining features being that all eigenfrequencies are real-valued and the set of eigenfunctions is orthogonal and complete. Somehow intricate is that the absence of a definitive BC at infinity introduces a continuous eigenfrequency distribution in situations where one expects DLMs in classic BVPs. These details notwithstanding, the wave field at any instant can be decomposed into the eigenfunctions, any coefficient depending only on time as a simple harmonic oscillator. The initial conditions (ICs) for the IVP then fully determine all coefficients and hence a time-dependent solution. We choose to call this approach “the method of eigenfunction expansion” to avoid confusions with the Fourier-decomposition in classic mode analyses. Although well established, this approach has been adopted in solar contexts only occasionally (Oliver et al. 2014, 2015; Li et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2023; also see e.g., Cally 1991; Soler & Terradas 2015; Ebrahimi et al. 2020 for related studies). The above-outlined steps were seen as self-evident, but are offered here to clarify matters. This manuscript will examine the response of symmetric slab setups to localized kink exciters. We will allow for continuous nonuniformities, but restrict ourselves to strictly 2D motions to make the Alfv\acute{\rm e}n continuum irrelevant (see Goossens et al., 2011, for reasons). We will largely focus on conceptual understandings behind “How do the periodicities in the t-dependent solutions connect to classic mode analysis?” and “What role may be played for these periodicities by the equilibrium quantities and initial exciters?”. Our study is new in the following aspects, relative to the most relevant studies in the literature. Firstly, an analytical study dedicated to our purposes with our approach is not available. Similar questions were addressed by Ruderman & Roberts (2006b) and Andries & Goossens (2007) for step profiles. However, the Laplace transform approach therein is quite involved, and such complications as the multi-valued-ness of the Green function may potentially obscure the relevance of DLMs. On the other hand, our approach bears close resemblance to a few available studies, which nonetheless also adopted step profiles and were devoted to different contexts (e.g., Oliver et al., 2014; Li et al., 2022). By addressing continuous profiles, our study will not only demonstrate the generality of the eigenfunction expansion approach, but also shed more light on how the profile steepness impacts the system evolution. Secondly, there exist a considerable number of numerical studies in various contexts that partially overlap what to be examined here (e.g., Terradas et al., 2005, 2007; Nakariakov et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2020, to name only a few). However, the numerical schemes therein are exclusively grid-based, and hence do not explicitly involve such concepts as modes or eigenmodes. Our EVP-based approach makes it easier to explore the connection between a t-dependent solution and modal expectations. This manuscript is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the steps that eventually lead to a 1D IVP, for which the analytical solution is then formulated in Sect. 3 with the eigenfunction expansion method. Section 4 proceeds to present a rather systematic set of example solutions, thereby better visualizing our conceptual understandings. Our study is summarized in Sect. 5, where some concluding remarks are also offered."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09905v1,Eccentricities of Close Stellar Binaries,"Orbits of stellar binaries are in general eccentric. This encodes information about the formation process. Here, we use thousands of main-sequence binaries from the GAIA DR3 catalog to reveal that, binaries inwards of a few AU exhibit a simple Rayleigh distribution with a mode \sigma_{e}\simeq 0.30. We find the same distribution for binaries from M to A spectral types, and from tens of days to 10^{3}days (possibly extending to tens of AU).This observed distribution is most likely primordial. Its Rayleigh form suggests an origin in weak scattering, while its invariant mode demands a universal process. We experiment with exciting binary eccentricities by ejecting brown dwarfs, and find that the eccentricities reach an equi-partition value of \sigma_{e}\simeq\sqrt{M_{\rm bd}/M_{*}}. So to explain the observed mode, these brown dwarfs will have to be of order one tenth the stellar masses, and be at least as abundant in the Galaxy as the close binaries. The veracity of such a proposal remains to be tested.","Binary stars are common in the Galaxy (Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Fischer & Marcy, 1992). Their orbits are invariably eccentric. The distribution of these eccentricities encodes accessible information about their formation, and is a useful property invoked in a wide range of studies. Surprisingly, for binaries closer than tens of AU (’close binaries’), such a fundamental property is not well known. Multiple lines of evidences suggest two main modes of binary formation (see Duchêne & Kraus, 2013; Offner et al., 2023, for reviews). Wide binaries (>50 AU,111Interestingly, 50AU, or P\sim 10^{5}days, is roughly the peak of the binary distribution for Sun-like stars (Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Raghavan et al., 2010). see, e.g., Parker et al., 2009) likely form following direct collapse of individual components. These are either weakly bound at birth or are captured after birth. Their occurrence is insensitive to or rises with stellar metallicity (El-Badry & Rix, 2019; Hwang et al., 2021), and the two components appear to be randomly paired in mass (Moe & Di Stefano, 2017). Close binaries, on the other hand, are now thought to have formed through gravitational fragmentation in massive circum-stellar disks (see review by Kratter & Lodato, 2016). Their occurrence anti-correlates with stellar metallicity (Moe et al., 2019), and the two masses are correlated (Raghavan et al., 2010; Duchêne & Kraus, 2013; Moe & Di Stefano, 2017) with an excess at equal-mass (’twin-binaries’, Moe & Di Stefano, 2017; El-Badry et al., 2019). These different formation pathways also manifest in binary eccentricities – a property that is observationally accessible and dynamically informative. Wide binaries are observationally determined to have a thermal distribution (dN/de\propto e), as inferred from spectroscopic binaries (Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Raghavan et al., 2010) and visual binaries(Tokovinin, 2020; Hwang et al., 2022).222Very wide binaries (>10^{3} AU) also appear to be super-thermal (Tokovinin, 2020; Hwang et al., 2022), suggesting another mechanism at play. This reflects a dynamic past in the birth clusters (Parker et al., 2009), where plentiful scatterings with other stars have relaxed the binaries towards a ’thermal’ equilibrium (Jeans, 1919; Heggie, 1975). This concordance between theory and observation does not, however, extend to close binaries. There are no theoretical predictions for their e-distribution, owing to the uncertain fragmentation process. On the observational side, their e-distribution remains murky, though it clearly differs from that of the wide binaries. The current wisdom is that they are consistent with being uniform,333Binaries with massive primaries (O/B stars) appear ’thermal’, down to periods as short as tens of days, possibly related to their higher triple fraction (Moe & Di Stefano, 2017). dN/de\propto e^{0} (Raghavan et al., 2010; Duchêne & Kraus, 2013; Moe & Di Stefano, 2017; Tokovinin, 2000; Geller et al., 2021; Hwang et al., 2022), but this is only a best-guess estimate that is based on small samples444Some studies have suggested a more ’bell-shaped’ e-distribution (Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Geller & Mathieu, 2012), but Moe & Di Stefano (2017) concluded that the data are too sparse to tell. and has no ready theoretical explanation. For instance, selecting from the volume-complete (to 25pc) Solar-type sample (Raghavan et al., 2010; Moe & Di Stefano, 2017), for binaries with periods 10^{2}-10^{3}d, so as to exclude binaries that may have experienced tidal circularization or may have been disturbed by passing-by stars, we are left with only 18 binaries. It is clear a much larger sample is sorely needed. The Gaia mission (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2016, 2023a), especially with its most recent non-single-star catalogue published in DR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2023b), provides just this sample. The GAIA binaries, as we show here, sharpen our vision dramatically. The e-distribution for those inward of a few AU follows, distinctly, a Rayleigh distribution."

high-angular-resolution imaging of the AGB star W Hya in
vibrationally excited  lines and visible polarized light
with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL","Aims. We present contemporaneous high-angular-resolution millimeter imaging and visible polarimetric imaging of the nearby asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star W Hya to better understand the dynamics and dust formation within a few stellar radii.Methods. The star W Hya was observed in two vibrationally excited H2O lines at 268 and 251 GHz with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at a spatial resolution of 16\times20 mas and at 748 and 820 nm at a resolution of 26\times27 mas with the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE)-Zurich Imaging Polarimeter (ZIMPOL).Results. ALMA’s high spatial resolution allowed us to image strong emission of the vibrationally excited H2O line at 268 GHz (\varv_{2} = 2, J_{K_{a},K_{c}} = 6_{5,2}–7_{4,3}) over the stellar surface instead of absorption against the continuum, which is expected for thermal excitation. Strong, spotty emission was also detected along and just outside the stellar disk limb at an angular distance of \sim40 mas (\sim1.9 R_{\star}), extending to \sim60 mas (\sim2.9 R_{\star}). Another H2O line (\varv_{2} = 2, J_{K_{a},K_{c}} = 9_{2,8}–8_{3,5}) at 251 GHz with a similar upper-level energy was tentatively identified, which shows absorption over the stellar surface. This suggests that the emission over the surface seen in the 268 GHz H2O line is suprathermal or even maser emission. The estimated gas temperature and H2O density are consistent with the radiatively pumped masers. The 268 GHz H2O line reveals global infall at up to \sim15 km s-1 within 2–3 R_{\star}, but outflows at up to \sim8 km s-1 are also present. The polarized intensity maps obtained in the visible reveal clumpy dust clouds forming within \sim40 mas (\sim1.9 R_{\star}) with a particularly prominent cloud in the SW quadrant and a weaker cloud in the east. The 268 GHz H2O emission overlaps very well with the visible polarized intensity maps, which suggests that both the nonthermal and likely maser H2O emission and the dust originate from dense, cool pockets in the inhomogeneous atmosphere within \sim2–3 R_{\star}.","Mass loss on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) plays an important role not only in stellar evolution but also in the chemical evolution of galaxies. The initial–final mass relation of low- and intermediate-mass stars shows that stars can lose up to \sim80% of their initial mass before they evolve to white dwarfs (Cummings et al. cummings18 (2018)). Despite such importance, the mass-loss mechanism in AGB stars is not yet fully understood. According to the pulsation-enhanced dust-driven outflow scenario, large-amplitude stellar pulsation levitates the material, which leads to density enhancement at the cool, upper atmosphere, where dust can form, and the radiation pressure on the dust grains can drive the mass loss (Höfner & Olofsson hoefner18 (2018)). The recent 3D models of AGB stars show that convection can also levitate the material, which leads to clumpy stellar winds (Freytag & Höfner freytag23 (2023)). To clarify the long-standing problem of the AGB mass loss, it is indispensable to probe the region within \sim10 R_{\star}, where dust forms and the wind accelerates. The oxygen-rich AGB star W Hya has been studied with various observational techniques from the visible to the infrared to the radio (e.g., Zhao-Geisler et al. zhao-geisler11 (2011); Khouri et al. khouri15 (2015) and references therein) because of its proximity (98^{+30}_{-18} pc, Vlemmings et al. vlemmings03 (2003)). The light curve shows clear periodicity (Woodruff et al. woodruff08 (2008)) with a period of 389 days (Uttenthaler et al. uttenthaler11 (2011)). Woodruff et al. (woodruff09 (2009)) show that the minimum near-infrared uniform-disk (UD) diameter of W Hya at phase 0.58 (near minimum light) is \sim36 mas at 1.2–1.3 \mum. This is considered to correspond to the star’s angular diameter as seen in the deepest photospheric layers. We converted the UD diameter to the fully darkened disk diameter by multiplying it by the factor 1.15 derived by Zhao-Geisler et al. (zhao-geisler11 (2011)). This resulted in a stellar angular diameter of 41.4 mas (i.e., 20.7 mas as the star’s angular radius R_{\star}). Taking advantage of visible polarimetric imaging with the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE)-Zurich Imaging Polarimeter (ZIMPOL) instrument (Beuzit et al. beuzit08 (2008); Schmid et al. schmid18 (2018)) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), Ohnaka et al. (ohnaka16 (2016)) spatially resolved the clumpy dust clouds forming around W Hya at an angular distance of \sim50 mas (\sim2.4 R_{\star}), which is similar to the angular distance derived by Norris et al. (norris12 (2012)) based on polarimetric aperture-masking experiments. The modeling of Norris et al. (norris12 (2012)) and Ohnaka et al. (ohnaka16 (2016)) suggests a predominance of large (0.3–0.5 \mum), transparent grains of Al2O3, Mg2SiO4, or MgSiO3 in the clumpy clouds, lending support to the scenario of scattering-driven mass loss (Höfner hoefner08 (2008)). Furthermore, the second-epoch ZIMPOL observations by Ohnaka et al. (ohnaka17 (2017)) revealed the morphological change in the dust clouds as well as a change in the grain size from 0.4–0.5 \mum to \sim0.1 \mum. Similar clumpy dust cloud formation has been imaged in other nearby AGB stars, R Dor, IK Tau, and o Cet (Khouri et al. khouri16 (2016), khouri18 (2018); Adam & Ohnaka adam19 (2019)). Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Takigawa et al. (takigawa17 (2017)) imaged W Hya in the gas-phase AlO line at 344 GHz at an epoch between two ZIMPOL observations of Ohnaka et al. (ohnaka16 (2016), ohnaka17 (2017)). Takigawa et al. (takigawa17 (2017)) found that the distribution of AlO is in excellent agreement with the clumpy dust clouds seen in the polarized intensity maps. In this Letter, we present contemporaneous high-angular-resolution imaging of W Hya in two vibrationally excited H2O lines with ALMA and visible polarimetric imaging with VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL. Figure 1: Continuum-subtracted channel maps of W Hya obtained in the vibrationally excited H2O maser line (\varv_{2} = 2, J_{K_{a},K_{c}} = 6_{5,2}–7_{4,3}, E_{u} = 6039.0 K) at 268.149117 GHz.

In the lower right corner of each panel, the LSR velocity and the relative velocity (\mbox{$V_{\rm rel}$}\ =\mbox{$V_{\rm LSR}$}-\mbox{$V_{\rm sys}$}, \mbox{$V_{\rm sys}$}=40.4 km s-1) are shown.

The channel maps at the velocities more redshifted than V_{\rm rel} = 3.0 km s-1 are not shown, because the signals are affected by the adjacent Si17O line (\varv=0, J = 6 – 5) at 250.744695 GHz."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09743v1,Tidally distorted stars are triaxial pulsators,"Stars in close binaries are tidally distorted, and this has a strong effect on their pulsation modes. We compute the mode frequencies and geometries of tidally distorted stars using perturbation theory, accounting for the effects of the Coriolis force and the coupling between different azimuthal orders m of a multiplet induced by the tidal distortion. For tidally coupled dipole pressure modes, the tidal coupling dominates over the Coriolis force and the resulting pulsations are “triaxial”, with each of the three modes in a multiplet “tidally tilted” to be aligned with the one of the three principal axes of the star. The observed amplitudes and phases of the dipole modes aligned orthogonal to the spin axis are modulated throughout the orbit, producing doublets in the power spectrum that are spaced by exactly twice the orbital frequency. Quadrupole modes have similar but slightly more complex behavior. This amplitude modulation allows for mode identification which can potentially enable detailed asteroseismic analyses of tidally tilted pulsators. Pressure modes should exhibit this behavior in stellar binaries close enough to be tidally synchronized, while gravity modes should remain aligned with the star’s spin axis. We discuss applications to various types of pulsating stars, and the relationship between tidal tilting of pulsations and the “single-sided” pulsations sometimes observed in very tidally distorted stars.","Most asteroseismic calculations assume that stars are spherical, simplifying calculations of their oscillation modes. Pulsations of rotating stars are subject to Coriolis and centrifugal forces, which break the spherical symmetry and define the rotation axis as the symmetry axis of the pulsations. The majority of models thus assume that each stellar oscillation mode has an angular pattern of a spherical harmonic Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi) defined relative to the star’s rotation axis. Exceptions to this are the rapidly oscillating Ap stars (Kurtz 1982) where the pulsation symmetry axis closely aligns with the oblique magnetic axis. See Holdsworth (2021) and Kurtz (2022, section 2.5.12) for introductions and reviews of these stars. Stars in close binaries, however, are distorted by the tidal force of the companion, which is symmetric about the tidal axis (i.e., the line connecting the two stars). Many such stars are also tidally synchronized so that the rotation rate is equal to the orbital frequency. In this case, centrifugal and tidal distortion are of similar magnitude, but symmetric about orthogonal axes. Such stars are hence triaxial ellipsoids, with their shortest axis (the z-axis) along the rotation/orbital axis, their longest axis along the tidal axis (the x-axis), and their intermediate axis perpendicular to these two (the y-axis). The goal of this paper is to compute the pulsation geometries of such triaxial stars. Initial work investigating pulsations of tidally distorted stars (e.g., Chandrasekhar 1963; Chandrasekhar & Lebovitz 1963; Tassoul & Tassoul 1967; Denis 1972 largely focused on mode stability, often investigating the fundamental modes of constant density or polytropic stellar models. Subsequent work investigated the frequency perturbations of modes due to small tidal distortion Saio (1981); Martens & Smeyers (1982); Smeyers & Martens (1983). Perhaps the most crucial effect of tides is to change the pulsation geometry such that the modes are no longer spherical harmonics with respect to the rotation axis. Reyniers & Smeyers (2003a, b) computed the pulsation geometry of tidally distorted stars, showing that tidal distortion couples modes of different azimuthal order m, such that the eigenmodes are superpositions of modes of differing m (see also Martens & Smeyers 1986). They found that modes have the tidal axis as their symmetry axis, and so the (2\ell+1) modes of a multiplet with angular degree \ell are split into (\ell+1) different frequencies in the rest frame of the star. However, those works did not include the centrifugal force which disrupts the symmetry around the tidal axis by making the stars triaxial. Fuller et al. (2020) used a similar method to compute the pulsations of heavily tidally distorted stars. They accounted for tidal coupling between modes of different angular degree \ell and radial order n_{\rm pg}, which can cause a mode’s surface flux perturbations to be confined primarily to one side of the star. However, they assumed that the modes are aligned with the tidal axis, i.e., each mode has a single azimuthal number m that defines the mode pattern number around the tidal axis. This assumption is not justified when one considers the Coriolis and centrifugal forces that break the symmetry around the tidal axis and creates triaxially distorted stars. If a mode produces a spherical harmonic pattern aligned with the tidal axis rather than the rotation axis, its amplitude and phase will be observed to vary over the course of the orbit. Such a “tidally tilted” pulsation is split into multiple components in the observed power spectrum, spaced by integer multiples of the orbital frequency. This modulation is straightforward to predict (Reed et al., 2005; Balona, 2018), causing dipole modes to typically produce a triplet spaced by the orbital frequency in the observed power spectrum. However, we will demonstrate that this is not the correct geometry of tidally tilted oscillations, altering expectations for the observed power spectra. Observations of pulsating and tidally distorted stars have increased enormously due to data from the Kepler and TESS satellites. Handler et al. (2020) and Kurtz et al. (2020) found tidally distorted \delta Scuti stars whose pulsations are confined to the side of the star facing its companion. Rappaport et al. (2021) found a \delta Scuti star with a pulsation confined to the tidal equator. Kahraman Aliçavuş et al. (2022) examined a \delta Scuti pulsator in a close binary with several doublets spaced by twice the orbital frequency, indicative of tidally tilted pulsations. Jayaraman et al. (2022) found an sdB pulsator in a close binary that exhibits a rich diversity of tidally tilted pulsations, showing that most of these could be identified as primarily \ell=1 or \ell=2 tidally tilted modes. The density of low-\ell modes also suggested the presence of mixed modes, which indicated the star had recently finished helium core-burning. Other pulsating stars which appear to exhibit tidally perturbed p modes include KPD 1930+2752 (Reed et al., 2011), U Gru (Bowman et al., 2019; Johnston et al., 2023), KIC 4142768 (Balona, 2018), and KIC 9851944 (Jennings et al., 2024). Tidally perturbed g modes have also been observed in several stars (Van Reeth et al., 2022, 2023). Most recently, Zhang et al. (2024) found a \delta Scuti pulsator with many tidally tilted \ell=1 modes. Each such mode forms a nearly equal-amplitude doublet in the power spectrum spaced by 2\times the orbital frequency. Importantly, they showed that the observed pulsation amplitude and phase modulation could not arise from spherical harmonics aligned with the tidal axis. Instead, they showed that the data could be explained by “triaxial” pulsations, each symmetric about one of the star’s three ellipsoidal axes, and they presented a theoretical calculation demonstrating why this is expected in tidally distorted stars. Jayaraman et al. (2024) also found a \delta Scuti pulsator with a large number of predominantly triaxial modes. In this work, we expand upon the simple calculation of Zhang et al. (2024) to compute the mode frequencies and mode geometry of a tidally distorted star, including the effects of tidal distortion, centrifugal distortion, and the Coriolis force. We show that the pulsations of triaxial stars are themselves triaxial, as proposed by Zhang et al. (2024). For the three \ell=1 modes of a given radial order, the modes are each aligned with one of the three principal axes of the triaxial star, creating three unique mode frequencies in the frame of the star. In the observer’s frame, however, the changing viewing angle during the orbit causes the observed amplitudes and phases to vary, causing each mode to appear as a doublet or singlet in the power spectrum. We perform the same calculations for the star’s five quadrupole (\ell=2) pulsations, finding the angular pattern and frequency perturbation for each. We provide simple formulae to accurately estimate the tidal frequency perturbations in Section 3, we apply our method to \delta Scuti pulsators in Section 4, and we discuss when we expect to observe triaxial and tidally tilted pulsations in Section 5."

RR Lyrae
V338 Boo During the Disappearance of a Pulsation Mode","New results on the behavior of the double-mode RR Lyrae V338 Boo are presented. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observed this star again in 2022, and an observing campaign of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) was completed after the TESS observations as a follow-up. We find that the first overtone pulsation mode in this star completely disappears during the TESS observing window. This mode reappears at the end of the TESS observations, and the AAVSO observing campaign shows that in the months that followed, the first overtone mode was not only present, but was the dominant mode of pulsation. This star, and potentially others like it, could hold the key to finally solving the mystery of the Blazhko effect in RR Lyrae.","1.1 Background Pioneering work in the late 19th century using the new technique of photography led to the discovery of a bright (seventh magnitude) variable star in the constellation of Lyra by Williamina Fleming (Pickering, 1901) that was designated RR Lyrae. This star became the archetype of a distinct class of variable star identified in old stellar populations. Bailey (1902) sub-classified RR Lyrae into three types (a, b, and c) that were simplified into two types that are still in use today: ab (RRab) and c (RRc). These are now believed to be evolved He-core burning, low-mass stars in the instability strip of the HR Diagram with radial pulsations in the fundamental (RRab) and first overtone (RRc) modes (more detail, and additional references, can be found in Smith, 1995; Catelan & Smith, 2015). It was noted early on that some RRc types had a scatter not explainable by observational error. It was not until much later, however, that changes in the light curve due to mode mixing of the fundamental and first overtone radial pulsation modes were found in AQ Leo (Cox et al., 1980) and RR Lyrae in the globular cluster M15 (Cox et al., 1983). This sub-class of double-mode pulsators, which simultaneously pulsate in both the fundamental and first overtone modes, is classified as type d (RRd). The comprehensive review of pulsation theory up until that point by Christy (1966) set the stage for Jørgensen & Petersen (1967) to recognize that double-mode pulsations could be important probes of physical properties of these stars. Then Petersen (1973) introduced the diagram (later named after him) that allows a mass estimate of double-mode pulsators. RRd stars in particular were used to test differences between stellar evolution and stellar pulsation models using opacities in stellar interiors (Cox, 1991) and to improve and verify nonlinear stellar pulsation models that include time-dependent turbulent convection (Feuchtinger, 1998). More recently, luminosities of RRd stars from models and observations were compared (Kovacs & Karamiqucham, 2021), which may help resolve the current so-called “Hubble tension” by using Population II stars (Beaton et al., 2016). Other multi-periodic behavior has been identified among the RR Lyrae variables. The Blazhko effect, a periodic modulation of the primary light cycle, was identified in RRab stars by Blažko (1907) and Shapley (1916), and was later identified in RRc type stars. The Blazhko period is often tens of days long, and the physical mechanism causing this behavior remains uncertain, making the Blazhko effect one of the longest unanswered questions in all of astrophysics. With the unique insight available with RRd type stars, however, any of these variables exhibiting the Blazhko effect are much more interesting and important, and could hold the key to solving this more than century-old puzzle. 1.2 V338 Boo The RRd star V338 Boo has been studied for almost two decades now, and with each set of observations there are new and interesting results. The work of Oaster et al. (2006) showed that the period ratio of the first overtone to fundamental modes was normal for an RRd (P_{1}/P_{0} = 0.743) but the fundamental mode amplitude was twice as large as the first overtone. Follow-up observations that were published four (Hurdis & Krajci, 2010) and six (Hurdis & Krajci, 2012) years later showed that the amplitude ratio of the two pulsation modes was changing over time. In our original paper (Carrell et al., 2021), hereafter C21, we presented Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS, Ricker et al., 2015) observations of V338 Boo from 2020 (Sectors 23 and 24). These observations showed that this star was actually undergoing changes in the amplitudes of its pulsation modes over the course of tens of days, and we were able to explain what was seen from earlier, ground-based, data. The survey strategy of TESS is such that most targets are re-observed every other year, which was the case for V338 Boo - it was observed again by TESS in Sectors 50 and 51, which correspond to 2022 March 26 to April 22 and 2022 April 22 to May 18, respectively. Because we knew this star would be observed again by TESS in 2022, we were able to plan a campaign through the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) to extend the baseline of observations and verify what was seen in TESS data. In the following, we will describe the newer TESS observations (Section 2.1), the follow-up observations by AAVSO observers (Section 2.2), and new behavior for V338 Boo (Section 3). In the end we will describe our conclusions and discuss what they might mean (Section 4)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10402v1,"A Small Brown Dwarf in an Aligned Orbit around a Young, Fully-Convective M Star","A star’s spin-orbit angle can give us insight into a system’s formation and dynamical history. In this paper, we use MAROON-X observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect to measure the projected obliquity of the LP 261-75 (also known as TOI-1779) system, focusing on the fully-convective M dwarf LP 261-75A and the transiting brown dwarf LP 261-75C. This is the first obliquity constraint of a brown dwarf orbiting an M dwarf and the seventh obliquity constraint of a brown dwarf overall. We measure a projected obliquity of 5^{+11}_{-10} degrees and a true obliquity of 14^{+8}_{-7} degrees for the system, meaning that the system is well-aligned and that the star is rotating very nearly edge-on, with an inclination of 90^{o}\,\pm\,11^{o}. The system thus follows along with the trends observed in transiting brown dwarfs around hotter stars, which typically have low obliquities. The tendency for brown dwarfs to be aligned may point to some enhanced obliquity damping in brown dwarf systems, but there is also a possibility that the LP 261-75 system was simply formed aligned. In addition, we note that the brown dwarf’s radius (R_{C}\,=\,0.9 RJ) is not consistent with the youth of the system or radius trends observed in other brown dwarfs, indicating that LP 261-75C may have an unusual formation history.","A system’s obliquity (\psi) is the angle between a star’s rotation axis and the angular momentum of its companions’ orbits. The obliquity of a planetary system can give us insight about a system’s formation and dynamical history. Alignment (zero obliquity) makes sense assuming a planet and its stars form out of the same rotating gas cloud, and implies a dynamically inactive system (or, alternatively, alignment due to tidal interactions between the star and its companions- see, e.g., Albrecht et al., 2022, and the references therein). Misalignment may be a sign of past dynamical interactions, but some studies have shown that some systems may form misaligned, due to magnetic disk-star interactions (Lai et al., 2011) or chaotic accretion processes during formation (Takaishi et al., 2020), though chaotic accretion cannot account for \psi\,>\,20^{o}. Measuring \psi directly is difficult. However, we can measure a star’s projected obliquity (\lambda) using the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect (Rossiter, 1924; McLaughlin, 1924), which utilizes high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements of the host star in order to track the transiting companion’s passage over the surface of the star. As the companion travels over the rotating star’s surface, it will eclipse blueshifted and redshifted portions of the star, making the stellar surface appear to be “redder” and “bluer” respectively. This will cause a RV anomaly whose precise shape depends on the orientation of the companion’s orbit. The RM effect has been used to great success to study the orbits of many exoplanet systems (e.g., Queloz et al., 2000; Winn et al., 2005, 2006). Several trends have emerged from the ensemble of well-characterized planet orbits to-date. It appears that planets orbiting stars with T_{\mathrm{eff}}\,>\,6250 K tend to have misaligned orbits, while cooler stars tend to have more aligned orbits (Winn et al., 2010). The location of this break point is comparable to the Kraft break (Kraft, 1967), above which stars lack convective envelopes. This seems to imply that the characteristics of a star’s convective envelope could influence the realigning timescale (or primordial alignment) of its companions, with highly convective stars having more aligned companions (see, e.g., Albrecht et al., 2022). However, it is difficult to extrapolate this trend to fully-convective stars (which are stars with masses below about 0.35 M_{\odot}, see Chabrier & Baraffe, 1997), as there are relatively few obliquity measurements of M dwarfs. Currently, there are only seven systems around M dwarfs with measured obliquities: AU Mic (Addison et al., 2021), TRAPPIST-1 (Hirano et al., 2020; Brady et al., 2023), GJ 436 (Bourrier et al., 2022), GJ 3470 (Stefánsson et al., 2022), K2-25 (Stefànsson et al., 2020), K2-33 (Hirano et al., 2024), and TOI 4201 (Gan et al., 2024). The small number of obliquities is due to several factors. Firstly, M dwarfs tend to be dim, making it difficult to perform the high-precision spectrograph measurements necessary to measure a planet’s obliquity. Additionally, the RM effect signal is directly proportional to the star’s rotation velocity, and there are relatively few known M dwarfs with both high rotational velocities and known transiting planets. This is exacerbated by the fact that rapidly-rotating M dwarfs tend to be highly active, which can obscure transiting planet signals in their photometry. Of the well-studied M dwarf systems, two (AU Mic and K2-33) have ages below 30 Myr (Mamajek & Bell, 2014; Mann et al., 2016). Both stars have strong activity signals in their RVs that complicate the measurements of their obliquities (and lower their precision), but both are consistent with being well-aligned. If we consider the obliquity damping timescale for stars with convective envelopes (utilizing equilibrium tide theory) from Albrecht et al. (2012), we find that both systems are unlikely to have undergone significant realignment over their lifetimes. It is thus reasonable to assume these obliquities are primordial. This seems to imply that M dwarf systems may tend to have low primordial obliquities, but additional (and higher-precision) measurements of young M dwarf planet obliquities are necessary to support this hypothesis. Turning our attention to the remaining older M dwarfs, we expect that, due to the convective nature of their host stars, their planets would have low obliquities. However, two of the five systems (GJ 436 and GJ 3470) have misaligned, near-polar orbits. This is especially interesting given their similar masses (within a factor of two) to one of the well-aligned M dwarfs, K2-25. The obliquity damping timescales discussed in the previous paragraph indicate that none of these three systems have had time to damp their stars’ obliquities, so it is unexpected that one is aligned while the other two are not. While this could be the result of primordial obliquity differences, it is also notable that the two misaligned planets orbit stars with M\,>\,0.35\,M_{\odot} (and are thus unlikely to be fully convective), while K2-25’s host is likely fully convective, with a mass of 0.26 M⊙ (Stefànsson et al., 2020). This seems to point to some change in obliquity damping processes at the fully-convective boundary. However, given the small sample size, we need to increase the number of M dwarfs with well-characterized obliquities in order to explore this trend. In this paper, we measure the obliquity of the LP 261-75 system. LP 261-75A is a small, nearby mid-M dwarf. It has a mass of around 0.3 M_{\odot} (Irwin et al., 2018; Paegert et al., 2021), meaning that it is likely to be fully convective (Chabrier & Baraffe, 1997). LP 261-75 is fairly unique compared to other M dwarfs with RM measurements. Its membership in the AB Doradus Moving Group (Sun et al., 2022) means that it is likely around 100 Myr old, making it intermediate in age between K2-33 and the older M dwarfs with measured obliquities. Unlike the other young M dwarfs, however, LP 261-75A has an extremely large transiting companion- the brown dwarf LP 261-75C is about 30% the radius of the primary. As the strength of the RM signal is proportional to the ratio of the radii of the companion to the host squared, it provides us with a uniquely large RM signal to study. LP 261-75C also has a <\,2d orbital period that places it well within the brown dwarf desert, a well-known under-density of brown dwarfs at orbital periods <\,100 days (Grether & Lineweaver, 2006), which may be due to their different formation mechanisms compared to planets. There are currently only RM obliquity measurements for six other brown dwarf systems: CoRoT-3b (Triaud et al., 2009), KELT-1b (Siverd et al., 2012), WASP-30b (Triaud et al., 2013), HATS-70b (Zhou et al., 2019), GPX-1b (Giacalone et al., 2024), and TOI-2533b (Ferreira et al., 2024). Additionally, there are no obliquity measurements for brown dwarfs around M dwarfs. Despite their different formation mechanisms, brown dwarfs may still have high obliquities. Jennings & Chiang (2021) showed that the turbulence and collisions between fragments in a disk can create brown dwarfs with obliquities up to 90o. While Marcussen & Albrecht (2022) found that the majority of close double stars are aligned, their studied sample primarily consisted of stars with much earlier spectral types than LP 261-75A, making it difficult to generalize their results. LP 261-75C’s large radius, short orbital period and rapidly-rotating host star thus give us the unique opportunity to perform a very high-precision RM measurement of a star in a young system, bridging the gap between the uncertain obliquities of the young M dwarfs and the precise obliquities of the older M dwarfs. It also provides us with the chance to study a young brown-dwarf desert object in a system with a well-characterized age. This is the first measurement of a brown dwarf obliquity around a cool host star. In Section 2, we will summarize the properties of the LP 261-75 system. In Section 3, we describe the MAROON-X RVs that we have collected on the LP 261-75A, as well as all other observations available on the system. Section 4 details our analyses on the photometry, spectra, and RVs of the system. Section 5 touches on the implications our our results, and Section 6 concludes."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10372v1,Compressible turbulent convection at very high Rayleigh numbers,"Heat transport in highly turbulent convection is not well understood. In this paper, we simulate compressible convection in a box of aspect ratio 4 using computationally-efficient MacCormack-TVD finite difference method on single and multi-GPUs, and reach very high Rayleigh number (Ra)— 1015 in two dimensions and 1011 in three dimensions. We show that the Nusselt number Nu \propto\mathrm{Ra}^{0.3} (classical scaling) that differs strongly from the ultimate-regime scaling, which is Nu \propto\mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}. The bulk temperature drops adiabatically along the vertical even for high Ra, which is in contrast to the constant bulk temperature in Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RBC). Unlike RBC, the density decreases with height. In addition, the vertical pressure-gradient (-dp/dz) nearly matches the buoyancy term (\rho g). But, the difference, -dp/dz-\rho g, is equal to the nonlinear term that leads to Reynolds number \mathrm{Re}\propto\mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}.","Turbulent thermal convection occurs in a wide range of geophysical and astrophysical flows, as well as in many natural and industrial processes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. There are various models of turbulent convection, the leading one being Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RBC) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] that follows Oberbeck-Boussinesq (OB) approximation. In RBC, a horizontal layer of fluid confined between two parallel plates is heated from below and cooled from above. In the OB approximation, the density of the fluid is nearly constant, except for a small variation in the buoyancy term. For example, for water, whose thermal expansion coefficient \alpha\approx 3\times 10^{-4}~{}\mathrm{K}^{-1} at room temperature, the relative change in density (\delta\rho)/\rho\approx\alpha(\Delta T)\approx 10^{-3} when the temperature difference between the two plates is around 30 K [5]. However, (\delta\rho)/\rho in a turbulent star is of the order of unity [9]. Let us assume that the star is made of ideal gas, whose thermal expansion coefficient is 1/T, where T is the gas temperature. Hence, (\delta\rho)/\rho\approx\alpha(\Delta T)\approx 1 when (\Delta T)\approx T. Therefore, the OB approximation and the RBC equations become invalid for stars and related astrophysical systems [6, 10, 11, 12]. To study such systems, researchers often employ equations for compressible convection or intermediate models that employ non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects [13, 14, 15] or anelastic approximations [16, 17]. In this paper, we employ fully compressible equations to study turbulent convection at very large Rayleigh numbers (Ra)—up to 10^{15} for two-dimensions (2D), and 10^{11} for three-dimension (3D). Note, however, that the solar convection has even larger Ra (\sim 10^{24}) than the above [6]. Many aspects of turbulent convection, which is more complex than hydrodynamic turbulence, are understood quite well, in particular for RBC systems. Grossmann and Lohse (GL in short) [18, 19] modelled the Reynolds number (Re) and Nusselt number (Nu) scaling using the relations for viscous and thermal dissipation rates [20, 21]. The GL relations have been verified by many experiments and numerical simulations [22]. Recently, Bhattacharya and Verma [23] employed machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more accurate dissipation rates for Ra and Pr predictions. In addition, it has been shown that for small and moderate Prandtl numbers (Pr \lessapprox 1), turbulent convection has properties similar to hydrodynamic turbulence [5, 24]. For example, the energy spectrum for turbulent convection follows Kolmogorov’s 5/3 spectrum. For the RBC setup, while the Reynolds number scaling is reasonably well established, the properties of velocity fluctuations remains to be quantified [25]. Additionally, accurate characterization of the Nusselt number scaling remains a challenge. Two main theories describe the dependence of Nu on Ra. In the extreme turbulent regime, known as ultimate regime, Kraichnan argued that Nu scales as \mathrm{Ra}^{1/2} [26, 27]. On the contrary, Malkus [28] proposed that Nu is proportional to \mathrm{Ra}^{1/3}, referred to as the classical scaling [1, 2, 3, 4, 18, 27]. It is reported both in experiments and numerical simulations that up to \mathrm{Ra}=10^{12}, the Nu scaling exponent is near 0.30. However, Chavanne et al. [29], He et al. [30], Zhu et al. [31] and some others argued that the Nu exponent gradually increases to about 0.38 near \mathrm{Ra}=10^{15}. Therefore, some researchers believe that the exponent might reach the value 1/2 at extreme Ra’s [27]. But, some others, based on different experiments and related simulations, argue that the classical scaling will remain valid for all Ra’s [6, 32, 33, 34]. The scaling of Nu is discussed in detail in recent articles [27, 35]. Turbulent compressible convection behaves very differently than RBC turbulence [36]. Unlike the constant bulk temperature in RBC, the bulk temperature in compressible convection falls adiabatically [17]. In compressible convection, the fluid at the bottom is heavier than that at the top, which is in sharp contrast to that in RBC. Unfortunately, compressible convection has not been studied extensively. In recent times, Verhoeven et al. [17], and John and Schumacher [36, 37, 38] analyzed turbulent compressible convection. Verhoeven et al. [17] performed a comparative study of the anelastic approximation and fully compressible turbulent convection. John and Schumacher [36, 37] performed numerical simulations of fully compressible convection up to \mathrm{Ra}=10^{7} and explored different regimes of compressible convection. Some compressible simulations use inviscid flows [39] whose Ra estimates are somewhat uncertain. We find that there are no existing studies on fully compressible convection at very high Rayleigh numbers. The present paper aims to fill this gap. In this paper, we simulate turbulent compressible convection using a computationally-efficient MacCormack-TVD (total variation diminishing) finite difference method that eliminates numerical oscillations [40]. Our method is an extension of the novel and stable numerical scheme proposed by Ouyang et al. [40], Yee [41], and Liang et al. [42] for shallow water equations to compressible turbulent convection. Our stable numerical scheme enabled us to perform convection simulations at very large Ra’s, e.g., 10^{15} for 2D flows, and 10^{11} for 3D flows. We quantify various quantities using the data generated by our numerical simulations. Our numerical data show that the internal energy dominates the fluid kinetic energy even at very large Ra. We attribute adiabaticity to this effect. In addition, we study the superadiabatic temperature and density of the flow. Based on numerical data, we report that \mathrm{Nu}\sim\mathrm{Ra}^{0.3} up to \mathrm{Ra}=10^{15} in 2D and up to 10^{11} in 3D. We caution that our results differ significantly from those for RBC, which is very different from compressible convection. Among the two, compressible equations model the astrophysical systems better. Simulations of 3D turbulent convection at extreme Ra’s are very expensive. Fortunately, in the RBC framework, the scaling of Nu and Re for 2D and 3D flows are reasonably similar for Pr \gtrapprox 1 [43, 44, 45]. Motivated by these observations, we examine the Nu and Re scaling for extreme Ra in 2D, and for moderate Ra in 3D. We believe that these important findings will improve the models of stellar and planetary convection. We have organised the paper as follows. In Sec. 2, we describe the physical system along with the governing equations. Sec. 3 discusses the numerical scheme along with the simulation parameters. In Secs. 4 and 5, we describe the adiabaticity and boundary layers in turbulent convection. Section 6 contains discussions on Nu and Re scaling. We conclude in Sec. 7.

Understanding of cloud microphysics and the evolution of cloud structures in sub-stellar atmospheres remains a key challenge in the JWST era. The abundance of new JWST data necessitates models that are suitable for coupling with large-scale simulations, such as general circulation models (GCMs), in order to fully understand and assess the complex feedback effects of clouds on the atmosphere, and their influence on observed spectral and variability characteristics.Aims. We aim to develop a 2-moment, time-dependent bulk microphysical cloud model that is suitable for GCMs of sub-stellar atmospheres.Methods. We derive a set of moment equations for the particle mass distribution and develop a microphysical cloud model employing a 2-moment approach. We include homogeneous nucleation, condensation, and collisional microphysical processes that evolve the moments of a particle size distribution in time. We couple our new 2-moment scheme with the Exo-FMS GCM to simulate the evolution of KCl clouds in a T_{\rm int} = 400 K, log g = 4.25 Y-dwarf atmosphere and examine the effect of cloud opacity on the atmospheric characteristics.Results. Our results show a generally homogeneous global KCl cloud, with only slight variations occurring in the equatorial regions. The atmosphere is generally sluggish and stagnant, with near-zero vertical velocities throughout most of the atmosphere. Only very small grains \sim0.01 \mum remain lofted in the atmosphere. Our results conform with dynamical theories for this parameter regime, with our model showing minimal (\sim0.2%) spectral variability at mid-infrared wavelengths.Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that the 2-moment bulk cloud microphysical scheme is a highly suitable method for investigating cloud characteristics and feedback in GCMs and other large scale simulations of sub-stellar atmospheres. Split moment schemes and mixed material grains will be explored in a follow up study.","JWST has revolutionised both the quantity and detail of data available for characterising the atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. In addition to offering clearer signatures of the gas phase compositions of sub-stellar atmospheres compared to previous data, JWST provides valuable constraints on the global cloud components in these atmospheres through measuring their wavelength dependent impacts on the spectrum. This presents an opportunity to model and gain deeper insights into the 3D processes of cloud formation in these atmospheres. It also allows us to understand their feedback effects on thermal profiles, gas phase chemistry, and dynamical flows. Unveiling how each microphysical process affects global cloud structures and goes on to impact observed properties of sub-stellar objects will be key questions to answer in the coming years. Before JWST’s launch, several studies looked at the possibility of detecting the infrared features of cloud particle absorption by different condensates for hot Jupiter exoplanets (Wakeford & Sing, 2015), as well as possibly inferring differences in the east-west limb-to-limb variance in cloud coverage (Parmentier et al., 2016; Powell et al., 2019). Recently, evidence for these effects in JWST data have been discovered, with silicate features present in WASP-17b (Grant et al., 2023), WASP-107b (Dyrek et al., 2024), and HD 189733b (Inglis et al., 2024) as well as cloud and chemistry limb asymmetry found in WASP-39b (Espinoza et al., 2024) and WASP-107b (Murphy et al., 2024). The evidence of limb asymmetry shows that cloud formation is inherently a 3D problem in gas giant atmospheres, with the microphysical properties of the clouds interacting with the dynamical flows of the atmosphere giving rise to this inhomogeneity. Moran et al. (2024) suggest that the shape of the SiO2 absorption features in hot Jupiters could infer the specific temperature-pressure dependent crystal structure of the cloud particles, further linking the local atmospheric thermochemical environment to the observed cloud properties. Emission spectra are also aiding the characterisation of clouds, for example Bell et al. (2024) reported that the phase curve of WASP-43b showed consistent evidence of strong cloud coverage on the nightside of the planet. Schlawin et al. (2024) also reported strong temperature and cloud inhomogeneity on the dayside of WASP-69b from its JWST emission spectrum. Studies coupling time-dependent clouds in multi-dimensional simulations for hot Jupiter atmospheres have been explored in recent years, with several schemes available in the literature. Lines et al. (2019) and Christie et al. (2021) couple the diagnostic eddysed model of Ackerman & Marley (2001) to the Unified Model UK Met Office GCM to model the clouds on HD 209458b. Komacek et al. (2022) present a single moment saturation adjustment scheme with relaxation timescale based on the model presented in Tan & Showman (2019). This model was applied in an ultra hot Jupiter context in Komacek et al. (2022), with similar saturation adjustment schemes now being used by several groups (e.g. Teinturier et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024). Lee et al. (2016) and Lines et al. (2018) use a moment scheme based on the Helling et al. (2008) methodology coupled to a GCM to examine 3D cloud microphysics in the canonical hot Jupiters HD 189733b and HD 209458b. Lee (2023) present the ‘mini-cloud’ 4-moment scheme based on the asymptotic giant branch outflow dust formation theory in Gail & Sedlmayr (2013), with additions for ‘dirty’ mixed composition grains following Helling et al. (2008). Powell & Zhang (2024) used a pseudo-2D version of the CARMA bin microphysical cloud model (Gao et al., 2018; Gao & Benneke, 2018), showing a complex dynamic exchange of vapour and condensed species across the globe compared to static 1D models. They show that differences in cloud composition and particle sizes are driven by dynamical processes as well as microphysical processes. Despite this progress, modelling cloud microphysics self-consistently in exoplanet dynamical models remains a challenging prospect, but is key goal required for deeper understanding of the effect of clouds in hot Jupiter atmospheres. In brown dwarf atmospheres, evidence of silicate features were seen in Spitzer IRAC data of L-dwarfs (e.g. Cushing et al., 2006; Suárez & Metchev, 2022), suggesting that active cloud formation was occurring in these objects. In addition, photometric surveys using ground based instruments and Spitzer showed signs of variability in T and L dwarf atmospheres, in particular at the L-T transition (e.g. Radigan et al., 2014; Apai et al., 2017; Vos et al., 2019), which suggested cloud formation was driving atmospheric variability. HST observations, sometimes with combined with Spitzer, also provided evidence of cloud driven spectral variability in some objects (e.g. Yang et al., 2015; Biller et al., 2018; Bowler et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), with large \gtrsim 10% variations in the amplitude of the near-infrared \ceH2O features found in a variety of objects. With this evidence of the effects of cloud coverage in brown dwarfs, the launch of JWST offers the ability to fully characterise the complexity of these clouds to understand their compositions, effect on the thermal and mixing properties of the atmosphere, and how they interact with chemical species. Miles et al. (2023) report a wide wavelength range spectrum of VHS 1256 b, finding disequilibrium chemistry and a silicate feature. Biller et al. (2024) recently published spectral variability light curves across the NIRSpec Prism and MIRI Low Resolution Spectrograph (LRS) wavelength ranges for WISE 1049A and WISE 1049B, finding evidence for chemical species and cloud coverage variability in their atmospheres, in addition to a variable silicate absorption feature for WISE 1049A. This suggests a strongly inhomogenous atmosphere with dynamically driven small and large scale dynamical features forming and dissipating in these atmospheres at shorter timescales than the rotational period. Previous theoretical and modelling studies of brown dwarfs have revealed the time-dependent connection between atmospheric temperatures, dynamics, cloud coverage and chemistry. Zhang & Showman (2014) used a pulsing thermal perturbation scheme to imitate the temperature forcing induced by convection near the radiative-convective boundary coupled to a global shallow-water model. They found the strength of the atmospheric temperature variability greatly depended on the dynamical regime of the atmosphere. Robinson & Marley (2014) used a 1D model with deep temperature perturbations to investigate the connection between deep convective motions and the observed spectral features. Morley et al. (2014) modeled variability of T- and Y-dwarfs with patchy sulfide and salt cloud layers. Tan & Showman (2019) find that cloud opacity feedback can trigger convective motions, giving rise to cloud condensation and evaporation cycles. Tremblin et al. (2020) apply modified temperature-pressure (T-p) profiles to mimic thermal variability and also investigate the effects of non-equilibrium chemistry on the variability and strength of spectral features. Luna & Morley (2021) use the Ackerman & Marley (2001) equilibrium cloud model to produce vertical cloud profiles that attempt to fit the Spitzer IRS silicate feature in brown dwarfs (Cushing et al., 2006; Looper et al., 2008) and Spitzer photometric band variability (Metchev et al., 2015). Hammond et al. (2023) found four main dynamical regimes for brown dwarfs, depending on the non-dimensional radiative timescale and thermal Rossby number. Lacy & Burrows (2023) show significant effects when considering the impact of \ceH2O clouds on Y-dwarf thermal structures. Lee et al. (2023) and Lee et al. (2024) examine the impact of large scale dynamical features in brown dwarfs and directly imaged exoplanets on the 3D chemical, cloud and variability characteristics of the atmosphere. Owing to the continued release of JWST data starting to characterise the cloud structures of sub-stellar atmospheres in detail, microphysical models are warranted to deeply understand the processes that give rise to the specific features and effects seen in the spectra of sub-stellar objects. Bulk, also known as moment, schemes remain a popular option in Earth Science for modelling cloud microphysics due to their relative simplicity and computational efficiency (for review, see e.g., Morrison et al., 2020). Only a few moments (in this paper, two) are required to be evolved in the dynamical system, with each moment representing an average value of the particle size distribution and the microphysical processes altering these mean values in time. For sub-stellar atmospheres, bulk schemes have been developed by a few groups (e.g. Helling et al., 2008; Ohno & Okuzumi, 2017, 2018; Ormel & Min, 2019; Woitke et al., 2020; Lee, 2023; Huang et al., 2024) but only a few studies have used bulk schemes directly coupled time-dependently to 3D atmospheric simulations (e.g. Lee et al., 2016; Lines et al., 2018; Lee, 2023). Bulk schemes are contrasted with bin or spectral models (e.g. CARMA, Gao et al., 2018), which evolve the discretised particle size distribution in time through calculating the fluxes in and out each bin size. Typically 40-70 or more mass or size bins are required to adequately resolve the size distribution in these models (e.g. Adams et al., 2019), making them much more computationally demanding than bulk methods and more challenging to include in large scale 3D atmospheric modelling with present resources. In this study, we expand the mini-cloud code package (Lee, 2023) to include a new 2-moment cloud microphysical scheme able to be efficiently coupled to time-dependent sub-stellar atmosphere simulations in a simple manner. The present 2-moment scheme also newly implements the collision growth of cloud particles, which is a key process to produce rain droplets in Earth clouds (Morrison et al., 2020). In Section 2, we present the mass moment scheme and detail the individual microphysical source and sink terms in the set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In Section 3, we couple our new 2-moment scheme to the 3D Exo-FMS GCM to simulate a Y-dwarf as a test application. In Section 5, we post-process our simulation and generate emission spectra and variability light curves. In Section 6, we discuss our results in context to other modelling efforts and observational data. Section 7 contains the summary and conclusions of our study. Each of the new moment schemes are available online111https://github.com/ELeeAstro/mini_cloud."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10256v1,"Mass-loss, composition and observational signatures of stellar winds from X-ray bursts","X-Ray bursts (XRBs) are powerful thermonuclear events on the surface of accreting neutron stars (NSs), which can synthesize intermediate-mass elements. Although the high surface gravity prevents an explosive ejection, a small fraction of the envelope may be ejected by radiation-driven winds. In our previous works, we have developed a non-relativistic radiative wind model and coupled it to an XRB hydrodynamic simulation. We now apply this technique to another model featuring consecutive bursts. We determine the mass-loss and chemical composition of the wind ejecta. Results show that, for a representative XRB, about 0.1\% of the envelope mass is ejected per burst, at an average rate of 3.9\times 10^{-12}\,\text{M}_{{\odot}}\texttt{yr}^{-1}. Between 66\% and 76\% of the ejecta composition is 60Ni, 64Zn, 68Ge, 4He and 58Ni. We also report on the evolution of observational quantities during the wind phase and simulate NICER observations that resemble those of 4U 1820-40.","Type I X-ray bursts (XRBs) are powerful, recurrent thermonuclear explosions on the surface of accreting neutron stars in binary systems (Strohmayer \BBA Bildsten, \APACyear2006; Keek \BBA in’t Zand, \APACyear2008; Galloway \BOthers., \APACyear2008; José, \APACyear2016). They occur when accreted material builds up under moderately degenerate conditions, triggering nuclear reactions and a thermonuclear runaway. This leads to a sharp increase in luminosity and the production of intermediate-mass elements, mainly around A=64 (Woosley \BOthers., \APACyear2004; Fisker \BOthers., \APACyear2008; José \BOthers., \APACyear2010). A typical neutron star (NS), with an escape velocity near \tfrac{2}{3}c, allows only a limited envelope expansion before the nuclear reactions stop due to nuclear fuel consumption. However, at certain accretion rates, significant photospheric radius expansion (PRE) can occur, with luminosity reaching or exceeding the Eddington limit, and potentially leading to material ejection via a radiation-driven wind (see Herrera \BOthers., \APACyear2020, and references therein –\al@HSJ2020, from now on). The contribution of XRBs to Galactic abundances is still debated and is one of the goals of this study. In addition, the study of XRB winds in PRE bursts can lead to the determination of neutron stars radii and masses, therefore providing constraints on the equation of state of NS matter (Lattimer \BBA Prakash, \APACyear2006; Damen \BOthers., \APACyear1990; Steiner \BOthers., \APACyear2010; Güver \BOthers., \APACyear2012; Sala \BOthers., \APACyear2012), but several simple assumptions are usually taken for the determination of the NS mass (maximum luminosity at the Eddington limit) and radius (touch-down of photospheric radius at NS surface). The simulation of the NS envelope during XRB winds can help to reduce uncertainties and test the validity of those assumptions. The last years have witnessed a renewed interest in the modeling of XRB winds. H. Yu \BBA Weinberg (\APACyear2018) performed MESA (Paxton \BOthers., \APACyear2011) simulations of the hydrodynamics of the wind after the Eddington limit is reached; and Guichandut \BOthers. (\APACyear2021) studied the transition from static expanded envelopes to radiatively driven stellar wind and discussed the applicability of steady-state models. In \al@HSJ2020 we determined the conditions for the presence of a radiative wind in a generic NS scenario, we explored the wind model parameter space in terms of energy and mass outflows (\dot{E},\dot{M}), and analyzed possible predictions related to observable variables. Subsequently, in Herrera \BOthers. (\APACyear2023) –\al@HSJ2023 from now on–, we applied the wind model to a more realistic XRB scenario by coupling it to the results of a high resolution (200 shells) hydrodynamic simulation by José \BOthers. (\APACyear2010) –\al@Jose2010 from now on–, which modeled the thermonuclear reactions and complex hydrodynamics of the XRB in the accreted envelope. This way we could self-consistently simulate the evolution of the entire NS envelope, from the nuclear burning shells to the photosphere of the expanding wind, allowing us to study the evolution of observable quantities for the XRB-wind model, to obtain the composition of the envelope layers blown away by the wind, and ultimately to assess the possible contribution of XRBs to Galactic abundances. As a natural continuation to the work presented in \al@HSJ2023, here we present the wind model coupled to another simulation of \al@Jose2010. While this time we use a lower resolution simulation (60 shells) than the one studied in \al@HSJ2023, it simulates four consecutive bursts in a continuous time sequence, accounting for the accretion between bursts and thus the natural chemical evolution. Additionally, we were able to reconstruct the continuous evolution of the photospheric properties of each burst, featuring both the radiative wind and the wind-free phases, for which we have also simulated observations with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer Mission (NICER)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09940v1,Modeling protoplanetary disk heating by planet-induced spiral shocks,"We investigate the heating of protoplanetary disks caused by shocks associated with spiral density waves induced by an embedded planet. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the dependence of shock heating rates on various disk and planetary parameters. Our results show that the shock heating rates are primarily influenced by the planet’s mass and the disk’s viscosity, while being insensitive to the thermal relaxation rate and the radial profiles of the disk’s surface density and sound speed. We provide universal empirical formulas for the shock heating rates produced by the primary and secondary spiral arms as a function of orbital radius, viscosity parameter \alpha, and planet-to-star mass ratio q. The obtained formulas are accurate within a factor of a few for a moderately viscous and adiabatic disk with a planet massive enough that its spiral arms are strongly nonlinear. Using these universal relations, we show that shock heating can overwhelm viscous heating when the disk viscosity is low (\alpha\lesssim 10^{-3}) and the planet is massive (q\gtrsim 10^{-3}). Our empirical relations for the shock heating rates are simple and can be easily implemented into radially one-dimensional models of gas and dust evolution in protoplanetary disks.","Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets. Their physical properties, such as temperature and ionization structures, influence the characteristics of the planets that form within them. The disk’s temperature structure is of particular interest because it plays a crucial role in determining the chemical composition of forming planets (e.g., Bitsch et al., 2019). For instance, the location of the snow line significantly influences the water content of protoplanets (e.g., Sato et al., 2016), although other internal processes can also affect their water budgets (Lichtenberg et al., 2019; Johansen et al., 2021). Most models of disk thermal evolution (e.g., Bitsch et al., 2015; Mori et al., 2021) assume that disks are primarily heated by stellar irradiation and/or accretion heating. However, this assumption may not hold for disks that already harbor a massive planet. A planet embedded in a gas disk excites spiral density waves (e.g., Goldreich & Tremaine, 1979), which eventually shock as they propagate away from the planet (Goodman & Rafikov, 2001; Rafikov, 2002). These shocks generate entropy, causing secular heating of the disk gas (Rafikov, 2016). If the planet is massive and the disk is optically thick, this shock heating can raise the disk temperature (Richert et al., 2015; Lyra et al., 2016; Rafikov, 2016; Ziampras et al., 2020), potentially altering the chemical composition of the gas and dust remaining in the disk. Recent discoveries of protoplanetary disk substructures (e.g., Andrews, 2020; Bae et al., 2023) and isotopic dichotomies in meteorites (e.g., Kruijer et al., 2020; Kleine et al., 2020) suggest that giant protoplanets may have formed while their parent disks, including the solar nebula, were still abundant in solids. This implies that planet-induced shock heating could have impacted the composition of solar system bodies and exoplanets that formed from solids in the vicinity of giant planets. Recently, Ziampras et al. (2020) conducted a systematic study of planet-induced shock heating using two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic simulations of disks with an embedded giant planet. They demonstrated that shock heating by a Jupiter-mass planet can significantly alter the disk’s temperature profile and even shift the location of the snow line. However, the disk temperature obtained directly from such simulations depends not only on shock heating but also on the disk’s radiative cooling (i.e., opacity) and accretion heating. Both the disk’s opacity and accretion heating rate are largely uncertain and can change with dust evolution (e.g., Oka et al., 2011; Kondo et al., 2023; Delage et al., 2023; Fukuhara & Okuzumi, 2024). To model planet-induced shock heating as independently as possible from these uncertainties, it is necessary to extract the shock heating rate from these simulations and analyze its dependence on the planet’s mass and distance from the planet. In this paper, we model the planet-induced shock heating rate using 2D hydrodynamic simulations of disks with an embedded planet. From these simulations, we extract the radial profiles of the shock heating rates by directly measuring the jumps in the disk’s specific entropy across planet-induced shock waves. We discover universal scaling relations for the radial heating rate profiles from the simulations and provide simple analytic expressions for these universal relations. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the simulation setups and analysis methods. Section 3 presents our simulation results and analysis. Section 4 discusses an application and caveats of our study, and Section 5 presents a summary."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09934v1,Surface accretion as a dust retention mechanism in protoplanetary disks. I. Formulation and proof-of-concept simulations,"Planetesimal formation via the streaming and gravitational instabilities of dust in protoplanetary disks requires a local enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio. Radial drift of large grains toward pressure bumps in gas disks is a plausible mechanism for achieving the required dust concentration. However, recent millimeter disk observations suggest that the maximum sizes of dust grains in these disks are considerably smaller than predicted by dust evolution models that assume sticky grains. This indicates that the grains may be more strongly coupled to the gas and hence drift more slowly than previously anticipated. In this study, we propose a new dust retention mechanism that enables an enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio in disks with slowly drifting grains. This mechanism assumes that a surface accretion flow driven by magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) winds removes disk gas while retaining the slowly drifting grains below the flow. This process is expected to occur when the timescale of gas removal is shorter than the timescale of dust radial advection. To test this, we develop a radially one-dimensional framework for the transport of gas and dust in a disk with a vertically nonuniform accretion structure. Using this framework, we simulate the growth, fragmentation, and radial transport of dust grains in surface-accreting disks. Our simulations confirm a significant enhancement of the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratio when the predicted conditions for dust retention are met. Dust retention by MHD-driven surface accretion flows may thus pave the way for planetesimal formation from poorly sticky grains.","How dust grains in protoplanetary disks form kilometer-sized planetesimals remains an outstanding question in planet formation theory. It is widely accepted that (sub)micron-sized grains in these disks coagulate through mutual sticking, forming macroscopic aggregates, often called “pebbles” (Johansen et al., 2014). However, the extent to which these aggregates can grow is much less clear, as their collision velocities often exceed 1–10 \rm m~{}s^{-1}, potentially leading to fragmentation or bouncing rather than sticking upon collision (e.g., Güttler et al., 2010; Zsom et al., 2011; Birnstiel et al., 2012; Dominik & Dullemond, 2024). In addition, aerodynamic drag causes macroscopic aggregates to drift radially, either inward or outward, relative to the background gas (Whipple, 1972; Adachi et al., 1976; Weidenschilling, 1977). Growth of the aggregates can only occur if they grow faster than they drift. If the grains are extremely sticky, they may form highly porous aggregates and grow faster than they drift (Okuzumi et al., 2012; Kataoka et al., 2013). Otherwise, the aggregates can only grow to the maximum size limited by bouncing, fragmentation, or radial drift (Birnstiel et al., 2012). In this case, planetesimal formation is expected to occur via the gravitational collapse of dust overdensities produced by dust settling and radial pile-up (e.g., Goldreich & Ward, 1973; Sekiya, 1998; Youdin & Shu, 2002; Ida & Guillot, 2016; Hyodo et al., 2021), the streaming instability (e.g., Youdin & Goodman, 2005; Johansen & Youdin, 2007; Carrera et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017; Li & Youdin, 2021), pressure bumps (e.g., Whipple, 1972; Haghighipour & Boss, 2003; Pinilla et al., 2012), vortices (e.g., Barge & Sommeria, 1995), or secular gravitational instability (e.g., Youdin, 2011; Takahashi & Inutsuka, 2014; Tominaga et al., 2020). The stickiness of dust grains dictates which pathway of planetesimal formation is likely to be realized. However, the stickiness of real dust grains in protoplanetary disks is poorly understood from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. In principle, the stickiness of grains depends on their size, surface roughness, and material composition (Dominik & Tielens, 1997). Until recently, it was believed that grains coated with water ice are so sticky that they can stick at collision velocities up to 10–70 \rm m~{}s^{-1}, depending on the size of the grains constituting the aggregates (Dominik & Tielens, 1997; Wada et al., 2009, 2013; Gundlach & Blum, 2015). This led to the conventional idea that grains in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks, which are presumably ice-rich, could grow to sizes ranging from centimeters to even decimeters (e.g., Birnstiel et al., 2010; Okuzumi et al., 2012). However, more recent experiments (Gundlach et al., 2018; Musiolik & Wurm, 2019) suggest that water ice is not as sticky at low temperatures (\lesssim150–200 K) as previously thought. Additionally, other experiments (Musiolik et al., 2016a, b; Fritscher & Teiser, 2021) indicate that CO2 ice, which likely exists in disk regions with temperatures below 80 K (e.g., Okuzumi et al., 2016), is less sticky than water ice (see Arakawa & Krijt 2021 for a possible explanation of why CO2 ice is less sticky). Clearly, further theoretical and experimental investigations are needed to fully understand the sticking properties of dust grains of various compositions. On the other hand, growing observational evidence suggests that grains in the outer parts of protoplanetary disks are indeed less sticky than previously expected. Multiwavelength and polarimetric observations of dust thermal emission at (sub)millimeter wavelengths provide information about the size distribution of dust grains/aggregates in disks (for a review, see Miotello et al., 2023). Uniformly polarized (sub)millimeter emission from a number of disks (e.g., Stephens et al., 2017, 2023; Hull et al., 2018) is widely interpreted as evidence for \sim 0.1–1 mm-sized grains being abundant, at least in the outer parts of these disks (Kataoka et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016; Ueda et al., 2021). The necessity for abundant 0.1–1 mm-sized grains also aligns with the spectral slopes of the (sub)millimeter emission (Liu, 2019; Zhu et al., 2019; Ueda et al., 2020; Chung et al., 2024). Since turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks is generally weak (for a review, see Rosotti, 2023), the dominance of 0.1–1 mm-sized grains suggests that they are poorly sticky; otherwise, they would grow larger in such a quiescent environment. These observations are consistent with dust evolution models that assume poorly sticky grains, with maximum sticking velocities as low as 0.2–1 \rm m~{}s^{-1} (Okuzumi & Tazaki, 2019; Jiang et al., 2024; Ueda et al., 2024). The possibility that dust grains in protoplanetary disks may be poorly sticky has significant implications for our understanding of dust evolution and planetesimal formation. Firstly, it seems extremely unlikely that dust coagulation alone leads to planetesimal formation. Secondly, since poorly sticky grains stop growing while still being strongly coupled to the gas disk, they would only drift radially at a slow speed. Interestingly, millimeter disk observations show that the dust disks in the \sim5-Myr-old Upper Scorpius star-forming region are, on average, smaller than those in \sim1–2 Myr-old star-forming regions, but only by a factor of \sim2 (Hendler et al., 2020). This could potentially indicate that the grains only drift on a timescale of several Myr. In comparison, conventional sticky icy grains would grow to 1–10 cm in size and drift toward the central star within 1 Myr (e.g., Birnstiel et al., 2012; Okuzumi et al., 2012), unless they are trapped by pressure bumps (Pinilla et al., 2012). Recently, Lee (2024) analyzed the masses of dust rings found in recent millimeter disk observations and concluded that the grains would be considerably coupled to the gas, meaning they would drift inward only slowly. This is because the inferred dust ring masses are considerably smaller than what would be expected if the pressure bumps had already trapped all the grains in the outer disks. A low speed of dust radial drift could severely limit the potential pathways for planetesimal formation. Both runaway dust settling toward the midplane (Sekiya, 1998; Youdin & Shu, 2002) and strong dust clumping by the streaming instability (Carrera et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017; Li & Youdin, 2021) require a prior enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio. Radial dust drift toward pressure bumps has been considered a plausible mechanism for local dust concentration leading to planetesimal formation (e.g., Haghighipour & Boss, 2003; Johansen et al., 2014). However, slow radial drift delays this concentration process. The analysis by Lee (2024) suggests that the observed dust rings are stable against strong clumping by the streaming instability. Even if radial dust concentration is inefficient, increasing the disk’s dust-to-gas mass ratio is possible by removing gas. Previous studies have proposed that gas removal by photoevaporative (Gorti et al., 2015; Carrera et al., 2017) and magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) disk winds (Suzuki et al., 2010; Bai, 2016) can potentially lead to planetesimal formation. However, the efficiency of planetesimal formation via wind mass loss critically depends on the assumed mass loss rate and its radial profile (Ercolano et al., 2017). In this study, we propose surface gas accretion driven by MHD winds as an alternative mechanism for dust retention in disks with slowly drifting grains. Global non-ideal MHD simulations of protoplanetary disks show that gas accretion is narrowly concentrated on the surface of inner disk regions having a poorly ionized interior (e.g., Bai, 2013, 2017; Bai & Stone, 2013; Gressel et al., 2015; Riols et al., 2020; Lesur, 2021; Iwasaki et al., 2024). The emergence of this surface accretion flow is a consequence of the disk surface being relatively well-ionized and, therefore, well-coupled to the magnetic field threading the disk. The wind, driven by the global magnetic field, extracts angular momentum from the disk surface, driving a surface accretion flow. This flow transports gas, but will not transport dust that has already settled on the midplane due to stellar gravity. In this study, we demonstrate that surface gas accretion, combined with slow radial dust drift, can indeed lead to the enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio required for planetesimal formation. Figure 1: Schematic showing gas and dust transport in protoplanetary disks with uniform and surface accretion flows (left and right figures, respectively). In a disk with a vertically uniform accretion flow, the gas flow around the midplane flushes the vertically settled dust toward the central star. In a disk with an accretion flow localized near its surface, the settled dust avoids accretion toward the star. As long as the disk gas remains approximately in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium, the decrease in gas surface density due to surface accretion always results in a decrease in midplane gas density (see text). Therefore, the dust-to-gas ratio at the midplane in the surface-accreting disk would increase over time, provided that the radial inward drift of the dust due to gas drag is slow. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the basic mechanism of dust retention proposed in this study. We then formulate the radial transport of gas and dust in surface-accreting disks in section 3. Our proof-of-concept simulation models are presented in section 4 and their results are provided in section 5. Our conclusions are presented in section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09889v1,Kinematics of Young Stellar Objects Under Various Stellar Feedback,"Based on the Gaia Data Release 3 and APOGEE datasets, we investigate the kinematic differences between young stellar objects (YSOs) and their parent clouds in five nearby star-forming regions. Overall, the 1D velocity differences between Class II YSOs and their parent molecular cloud range from [0, 1.4] km s-1. In feedback environments dominated by outflows, massive stars, and supernova feedback, the corresponding velocity differences range from [0, 1.4] km s-1, [0.1, 0.4] km s-1, and [0.1, 1] km s-1, respectively. These results indicate that YSO kinematics are not significantly affected by these different types of feedback environment. Additionally, compared to the Class II YSOs, Class III YSOs have slightly larger velocities and dispersions.","1 introduction The vast majority of stars form in clusters within molecular clouds, subsequently evolving into star clusters, associations, or isolated stars, and eventually dissolving into the Galactic gravitational field (e.g., de Zeeuw et al., 1999; Lada & Lada, 2003; Buckner et al., 2019; Krause et al., 2020). Stars form in molecular clouds through gravitational collapse, and are influenced by turbulence (e.g., Hennebelle & Falgarone, 2012; Guerrero-Gamboa & Vázquez-Semadeni, 2020), stellar feedback (e.g., Lada & Lada, 2003; Rey-Raposo et al., 2017), and magnetic fields (e.g., Ostriker et al., 2001; McKee & Ostriker, 2007). Currently, our understanding of the kinematic processes of star formation remains quite limited. Young stellar objects (YSOs), which are very young and still associated with their parent molecular clouds, can potentially serve as tracers to reveal the kinematics of the star formation process. In recent studies, researchers have made significant progress in understanding the relationship between molecular clouds and star formation by combining observations of YSOs and molecular gas. For example, Gaia astrometry data of YSOs have been used to explore the structure of molecular clouds (e.g., Kounkel et al., 2022; Tu et al., 2022), the history of star formation (e.g., Großschedl et al., 2021; Krolikowski et al., 2021), and the expansion of young star clusters (Kuhn et al., 2019). In these studies, researchers generally assume that the parallaxes and proper motions of the YSOs can serve as proxies for the distances and proper motions of the molecular gas therein. However, due to stellar feedback, the kinematics of the YSOs may not be entirely consistent with that of their parent molecular clouds. During the star formation process, various feedback environments such as protostellar outflows (e.g., Arce et al., 2010; Dionatos & Güdel, 2017), stellar winds from massive stars and H ii regions (e.g., Pabst et al., 2019; Grudić et al., 2022), and supernova explosions (e.g., Wareing et al., 2017; Krumholz et al., 2019) inject momentum into star-forming regions. These processes are theoretically capable of displacing surrounding material and potentially influencing the kinematics of newly formed stars within the cloud. However, to date, there remains a lack of research comparing the kinematic characteristics of YSOs with their parent molecular clouds, which is the purpose of our research. By revealing the kinematic differences and their extent between YSOs and their parent molecular clouds, we aim to provide a foundation for studying star formation and kinematic evolution. Now, we have the opportunity to explore the kinematic characteristics of YSOs and compare them with the motions of their parent molecular clouds. First, molecular line surveys provide us with distribution and kinematic information of molecular clouds (Dame et al., 2001). Second, a large number of YSOs have been identified through previous surveys, such as Gutermuth et al. (2009); Megeath et al. (2012); Furlan et al. (2016). Thus, by crossmatching infrared-selected YSOs with Gaia’s high-precision astrometric data (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2023), we can obtain kinematic information for a significant number of YSOs. The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 describes the star-forming regions and the corresponding YSO samples. Section 3 presents the distribution and kinematics of the star-forming regions and YSOs. Section 4 provides a statistical analysis of the kinematic characteristics of YSOs in different feedback environments. Finally, Section 5 provides a summary."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09566v1,"New orbital periods of high-inclination dwarf novae based on
 Alerts photometry","The orbital period of a cataclysmic variable stands as a crucial parameter for investigating the structure and physics of these binary systems, as well as understanding their evolution. We use photometric Gaia data for dwarf novae (DNe) in the quiescent state —which are available for a number of years— to determine new orbital periods and improve or modify previously suggested period values. Two approaches are implemented for selecting high-inclination targets, either eclipsing or with ellipsoidal variations. We determine new orbital periods for 75 DNe and improve ephemerides for 27 more (three of which change significantly), contributing 9.4% of the known DNe periods of between 0.05 and 2.0 days, and doubling the number of known periods exceeding 0.44 days. Their phase-folded light curves are presented and arranged by orbital period, illustrating the transition from short-period systems, dominated by radiation from the accretion disc and the hot spot, to longer-period DNe, where the Roche-lobe-filling secondary star is the primary visual flux source. This transition —which occurs around the well-known period gap (between \sim 2 and 3 hours)— is expected, as DNe with larger orbital periods typically harbour more massive donors, which contribute to the visible flux. However, this transition is not abrupt. Within the same range of periods, we observe systems dominated by ellipsoidal variations, where the companion star is clearly visible, as well as others dominated by the disc and the hot spot. The presence of some DNe with ellipsoidal variations near the lower edge of the period gap is striking, as the companions in these systems are expected to be cool low-mass M-dwarfs not visible in the light curve. This could indicate that we are observing systems where the donor star was originally much more massive and underwent significant nuclear evolution before mass-transfer began, as has been suggested previously for QZ Ser.","Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binary systems consisting of a white dwarf steadily accreting from a low-mass companion, typically a main sequence star (see Warner 1995 for a comprehensive review). Among all observational parameters that can be determined for a CV, the orbital period is by far the one that can be derived with the highest precision. It is also a crucial parameter, as it is directly linked to the size of the binary, as the secondary stellar component of a CV always fills its Roche lobe. An intriguing observational feature of CVs is the notable dearth of systems with periods of between \sim 2 and 3 hours, known as the ‘period gap’. The disrupted magnetic braking model for angular momentum loss (AML) in CVs was postulated by Rappaport et al. (1983) to explain the existence of the gap. CVs evolve towards shorter periods due to AML caused by the emission of gravitational waves (Paczynski & Sienkiewicz 1981) and wind magnetic braking (Verbunt & Zwaan 1981). The disrupted magnetic braking model assumes that magnetic braking dominates over gravitational radiation when the donor star retains a radiative core and becomes significantly less efficient once the donor becomes fully convective. This transition typically occurs in main sequence stars with masses of \sim 0.3 M⊙, corresponding to an orbital period of \sim 3 hours for a Roche-Lobe-filling main sequence star in a binary system with a white dwarf primary. Therefore, CVs above this period have larger AML rates, leading to higher mass-transfer rates and donors that are out of thermal equilibrium. The strong reduction in the efficiency of magnetic braking at \sim 3 hours results in a steep decline in the AML along with the mass-transfer rate, allowing the donor star to contract towards its equilibrium radius, temporarily halting mass transfer until it refills its Roche lobe at an orbital period of \sim 2 hours. Observational support for a strong reduction of the AML rate at the fully convective boundary comes from the mass-transfer rates derived for the observed CV population (Pala et al. 2022) as well as the observed inflation of donors above the period gap (Knigge 2006; Knigge et al. 2011). However, recent studies have raised doubts about the validity of the disrupted magnetic braking model, particularly in light of substantial contradictions between the model’s predictions and observations (e.g. Schreiber et al. 2024; Sarkar et al. 2024; Schaefer 2024). These studies suggest that the model’s original formulation may not fully account for all observed phenomena in CVs, and alternative models are being explored. CVs often exhibit brightness variations due to the mass transfer from the companion star onto the surface of the white dwarf. This mass transfer usually occurs via an accretion disc around the white dwarf and can lead to sudden and dramatic increases in brightness, the so-called dwarf nova (DN) outbursts, with typical amplitudes of between 4 and 7 magnitudes. These DN outbursts are caused by a thermal instability in the accretion disc, which leads to a sudden increase in the rate of accretion, resulting in a temporary brightening of the system (Osaki 1974; Cannizzo et al. 1988). DN outbursts typically occur at semi-regular intervals, ranging from days to a few years, and are observed in DNe within the entire orbital period range of CVs (between \sim1.3 hours and \sim3 days). Eclipsing CVs are particularly useful because their time-resolved photometry, combined with spectroscopy, allows us to derive the orbital inclination. This enables the determination of all the physical and geometrical parameters of the binary system. The same is true for CVs exhibiting ellipsoidal variations in their light curves. This phenomenon can be observed in systems with high inclination angles and low mass-transfer rates, where the tidally distorted donor star dominates the overall flux (e.g. Szkody & Mateo 1986). Here we present two effective methods for selecting targets with high orbital inclination (either eclipsing or ellipsoidal systems) among the more than 6 000 DNe observed by the Gaia space telescope (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) over the past decade. Generally, Gaia’s photometric errors are of the order of a few percent, even down to a g-band magnitude of \sim 20. In many cases, this allows us to obtain reliable orbital periods and phased light curves from Gaia data of DNe during their quiescent state, even though these data often have sparse and irregular time distributions, including large gaps of months or years."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09408v1,New results on the onset of a coronal mass ejection from 5303Å emission line observations with VELC/ADITYA-L1,"We report on the onset of a coronal mass ejection (CME) using spectroscopic observations in 5303Å coronal emission line with the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) onboard ADITYA-L1, the recently launched first Indian space solar mission. The CME was observed on 16 July 2024 in association with a X1.9 class soft X-ray flare from heliographic location S05W85. The VELC observations were near the west limb of Sun during the CME. The results obtained helped to constrain the onset time of the CME. In addition, they indicate {\approx}50{\approx}10 km/s. The non-thermal velocity associated with the line broadening is {\approx}24.87 km/s.","The green line (5303Å) is the brightest of all solar coronal emission lines in the visible spectral range. It is a forbidden line in the coronal spectrum, and caused by transition between the ground state fine structure levels of Fe XIV. The emission peaks at a temperature of {\approx}1.8{\times}10^{6} K. The 5303Å line is an useful tracer of solar activity and loops in the corona. Observations of the solar corona in 5303Å emission line with ground based coronagraphs are known for several decades (Evans, 1957; Orrall & Smith, 1961; Bruzek & Demastus, 1970; Demastus et al., 1973; Tsubaki, 1975; Sykora, 1992; Guhathakurta et al., 1993; Ichimoto et al., 1995a; Sakurai, 1998; Bagala et al., 2001; Singh et al., 1999, 2004, 2011a). The Upgraded Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (UCoMP; Landi et al., 2016), commissioned recently at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, is capable of observing several emission lines in the range 5303Å - 10830Å. Observations in the 5303Å line from space with the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph C1 (LASCO-C1, Brueckner et al., 1995) onboard Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) have been reported by Schwenn et al. (1997); Inhester & Schwenn (1997); Mierla et al. (2008). There are several observations in the green line during the total solar eclipses also (Koutchmy et al., 1983; Ichimoto et al., 1995b; Rušin et al., 1994; Pasachoff et al., 2002, 2009; Minarovjech et al., 2003; Singh et al., 2011a; Voulgaris et al., 2012; Caspi et al., 2020; Muro et al., 2023). But reports of dynamic events, particularly related to CMEs, are rare (Dere et al., 1997; Plunkett et al., 1997; Hori et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2006). Such observations are important to understand the thermodynamic changes in the near-Sun corona due to CMEs and other solar eruptions as shown by Boe et al. (2020) using total solar eclipse data obtained from multiple sites. Alzate et al. (2017) showed the presence of atypical large scale structures in coronal images obtained from two successive eclipse observations in two successive years. In both cases, the shapes of the structures were similar to that of the CME shock fronts that propagated through the same region of the corona few hours prior to the eclipse observations. In one case, the atypical structure was dominated by cool chromospheric material. These limited studies are primarily due to the unfortunate loss of SoHO/LASCO-C1 in 1998, and practical difficulties in the observations of solar corona with ground based coronagraphs. In this Letter, we present comprehensive measurements of the intensity, width, and Doppler shift of the 5303Å emission line before, during, and after a CME using spectroscopic observations with VELC/ADITYA-L1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09319v1,Solar flares in the Solar Orbiter Era: Short exposure EUI/FSI observations of STIX flares,"Aims. This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of short-exposure extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations of solar flares in the study of particle acceleration, heating and energy partition in flares. This work highlights the observations now available from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument suite onboard Solar Orbiter while operating in short exposure mode.Methods. A selection of noteworthy flares observed simultaneously by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) and the Full Sun Imager of EUI (EUI/FSI) are detailed. New insights are highlighted and potential avenues of investigation are demonstrated, including forward modelling the atmospheric response to a non-thermal beam of electrons using the RADYN 1D hydrodynamic code, in order to compare the predicted and observed EUV emission.Results. The examples given in this work demonstrate that short exposure EUI/FSI observations are providing important diagnostics during flares. A dataset of more than 9000 flares observed by STIX (from November 2022 until December 2023) with at least one short exposure EUI/FSI 174 Å image is currently available. The observations reveal that the brightest parts of short-exposure observations consist of substructure in flaring ribbons which spatially overlap with the hard X-ray emission observed by STIX in the majority of cases. We show that these observations provide an opportunity to further constrain the electron energy flux required for flare modelling, among other potential applications.","During solar flares, the emission at ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths can become locally enhanced by several orders of magnitude on a timescale of seconds to minutes. Even moderately sized C-class flares typically saturate current EUV and UV imagers as well as soft X-ray imagers. This means that spatial information in the saturated pixels is lost. Further, depending on the type of detectors used (CMOS vs. CCD), the total flux may or may not be conserved and neighbouring pixels might be affected (so called “bleeding”). Saturation during enhanced solar flare emission in such instruments is due to the fact that they are not exclusively designed to study flares. It is challenging to design an instrument with a sufficiently large dynamic range that can observe both the faintest solar emission and the largest flares for a given exposure time. The saturation effect leads to challenges in many flare studies, particularly for relating coronal and chromospheric UV/EUV emission to observations from hard X-ray emission during the impulsive phase of flares. One way to address the saturation issue of EUV imagers is to shorten the exposure time used. Some EUV/UV imagers, such as Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, use automatic exposure control, in which flight software determines the exposure time based on count flux (Lemen et al., 2012). However, with variations in this exposure time over the course of a flare, it can become a challenge to study given that the response of the detectors may be non-linear in exposure time which can introduce artificial variations linked to the exposure time changes. Regardless, despite the variable exposure time setting, the exposure time is often too long and AIA observations of flares are frequently still saturated. Efforts have been made to overcome saturation issues through a reconstruction approach which utilises the knowledge of the AIA diffraction pattern (Raftery et al., 2011; Krucker et al., 2011; Schwartz et al., 2014; Torre et al., 2015; Guastavino et al., 2019; Krucker et al., 2021). However, there are still challenges with total flux conservation and dealing with pixel bleeding. Kazachenko et al. (2017) also tackled this issue by linearly interpolating the flux prior to and post saturation in order to infer spatial information about flare ribbons. An approach of this kind, is, however, not suitable for photometric analysis. In the era of multi-messenger observations, the availability of EUV imagers on the far side of the Sun from Earth has become increasingly important for event studies since we cannot rely on Earth-based assets like AIA. For example, the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) (Rochus et al., 2020; Berghmans et al., 2023) onboard Solar Orbiter (Müller et al., 2020) provides EUV images for observations taken by the Solar Orbiter instrument suite as the spacecraft sweeps out an elliptical orbit spending half of the mission duration on the far side of the Sun from Earth. EUI consists of three telescopes, the Full Sun Imager (EUI/FSI) and two High Resolution Imagers, which observe in Lyman \alpha, 174 Å and 304 Å passbands. The focus of this work is on EUI/FSI observations. To combat the aforementioned saturation issues, EUI/FSI has been regularly taking short exposure observations alongside normal exposure frames in both the 174 Å and 304 Å channels since the end of 2022. This paper demonstrates the value of short exposure EUV observations in flare studies and details the invaluable new datasets provided by EUI/FSI as well as recent observations with EUI’s High Resolution Imager, EUI/HRIEUV . In this work, a subset of interesting flares co-observed by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) are presented and new insights enabled by this observation mode are discussed."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09292v1,The rotation properties of \delta Sct and \gamma Dor stars,"Based on the LAMOST spectroscopy and TESS time-series photometry, we have obtained a main-sequence star sample of \delta Scuti and \gamma Doradus stars. The sample includes 1534 \delta Sct stars, 367 \gamma Dor stars, 1703 \delta Sct|\gamma Dor stars, 270 \gamma Dor|\delta Sct stars, along with 105 ‘dsct candidates’ and 32 ‘gdor candidates’. After correcting for projection effects, we derived the equatorial rotational velocity distribution for \delta Sct and \gamma Dor stars and compared it with that of normal stars. The rotational velocity distributions of \delta Sct and \gamma Dor stars are extremely similar, with the only difference potentially due to the rotational variable stars that have not been completely removed. In contrast, the rotational velocity distribution of normal stars is more dispersed compared to pulsating stars. Additionally, the peak rotational velocity of the pulsating stars is about 10 km s-1 higher than that of normal stars. Unlike the normal stars, which show a monotonic increase in peak velocity with mass between 1.8 and 2.5 M_{\odot} , the rotational velocity distribution of \delta Sct stars does not exhibit a strong mass dependence. We also found that normal stars accelerate during the late main-sequence evolutionary phase, while \delta Sct stars decelerate. Furthermore, there may still be unclassified stars with diverse rotational properties in the normal star sample compared to the \delta Sct stars, which is likely to be an important contributor to the broader dispersion observed in its rotational velocity distribution. The photometric amplitude in \delta Sct stars is modulated with rotational velocity, with high-amplitude stars typically rotating slowly and low-amplitude stars showing a broad distribution of rotational velocities.","The \delta Scuti and \gamma Doradus pulsators, are located at the intersection of the classical instability strip and the zero-age main sequence. \delta Sct stars falls into the category of short-period variable stars with a mass range of 1.5 to 2.5 M_{\odot} (0.01 d <P< 0.25 d), showing typical V-band amplitudes ranging from 3 mmag to 0.9 mag (GCVS; Samus’ et al., 2017). The majority of \delta Sct stars exhibit multi-period pulsations characterized by high-amplitude radial pulsations and low-amplitude non-radial pulsations. These pulsations are mainly induced by the opacity mechanism (the \kappa mechanism) in the He II ionization zone (Aerts et al., 2010), usually resulting in low-radial order, low-degree modes. In contrast, \gamma Dor stars is categorized as a type of long-period variable star with a mass range of 1.2 to 2.0 M_{\odot} (0.3 d <P< 3 d), typically showing {\rm Amp}_{V} below 0.1 mag. The pulsations observed in \gamma Dor stars are primarily high-order non-radial g-mode pulsations excited by the convective flux blocking mechanism (Dupret et al., 2005; Grigahcène et al., 2010). However, there exists an instability overlap region in the HR diagram for \delta Sct and \gamma Dor stars, which are referred to as ‘hybrid stars’ (Handler et al., 2002; Henry & Fekel, 2005; Uytterhoeven et al., 2011; Lampens et al., 2018; Netzel et al., 2022). In these stars, we observe pressure mode and gravity mode simultaneously. The evolution of the stellar rotation profile is driven by the long-term evolution of angular momentum loss and redistribution, which begins during the stellar formation phase (Matsumoto et al., 1997), influencing various aspects of stellar evolution (Maeder & Meynet, 2000). The velocity distribution of stellar rotation plays a crucial role in comprehending the evolution of stellar populations (Pinsonneault et al., 1990; Maeder & Meynet, 2000). At approximately 1.2 M_{\odot} , there is a significant contrast in the rotational speeds of stars (Kraft, 1970). More massive stars, which lack deep convective zones and strong magnetic fields that hinder their rotation, can reach velocities of several hundred kilometers per second (Spruit, 1999; Sun et al., 2021a). Stellar pulsations play a critical role in the transport of angular momentum within a star’s interior, significantly impacting its surface rotation. In slowly pulsating B-type stars (SPB), g-mode pulsations driven by heat remove angular momentum from the surface and redistribute it to particular regions within the interior (Townsend et al., 2018). Similarly, in the convective cores of Be stars, g-mode and r-mode pulsations that are stochastically excited help in transferring angular momentum from the core to the surface (Neiner et al., 2020). Notably, \delta Sct and \gamma Dor stars, which have a specific mass range, typically exhibit strong rotation. Rotation leads to an increase in the degeneracy of non-radial pulsations, which in turn causes frequency splitting. (Aerts et al., 2010). The degree of frequency splitting in the periodogram of non-radial pulsation peaks is directly linked to the rotational speed (Aerts et al., 2010; Chen & Li, 2017). Observations suggest a correlation between the rotation and the photometric amplitudes of pulsating stars (Aerts et al., 2014; Gaia Collaboration et al., 2023). In the case of \delta Sct stars, the projected rotational velocities of high-amplitude \delta Sct stars generally do not exceed 30 km s-1, while normal \delta Sct stars display a wider range of rotational velocities (Breger, 2007; Chang et al., 2013). Undoubtedly, there exists a intricate coupling between stellar rotation and pulsation, exerting profound effects on stellar evolution. However, our current understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. Therefore, we employ variables such as \delta Sct and \gamma Dor stars, which exhibit similar characteristics but differ in the pulsation modes, to investigate the influence between rotation and pulsations. To determine the pulsation frequencies of variable stars, it is essential to have uninterrupted data sets characterized by a high signal-to-noise ratio and precise frequency resolution (Aerts, 2021; Kurtz, 2022). In recent decades, a plethora of space telescopes such as WIRE (Buzasi et al., 2005), MOST (Matthews, 2007), CoRoT (Auvergne et al., 2009), Kepler (Borucki et al., 2010; Koch et al., 2010; Grigahcène et al., 2010), TESS (Ricker et al., 2015), among others, have supplied copious amounts of precise and detailed data through continuous long-term photometric observations, enabling the detection of pulsation modes in variable stars. Furthermore, ASAS-SN (Jayasinghe et al., 2020), ATLAS (Heinze et al., 2018), WISE (Chen et al., 2018), and ZTF (Chen et al., 2020) have also contributed significant datasets for comparative reference purposes. The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the data sample and the treatment of the contaminants. We classify the resulting catalog in Section 3. Section 4 describes how the equatorial rotation velocity distribution of the sample stars is obtained, and Section 5 discusses its influencing factors. Section 6 addresses the relationship between amplitude and rotation in sample stars. Finally, Section 7 provides a summary."

microlensing events involving two lens masses and two source stars","Aims. We carried out a project involving the systematic analysis of microlensing data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network survey. The aim of this project is to identify lensing events with complex anomaly features that are difficult to explain using standard binary-lens or binary-source models.Methods. Our investigation reveals that the light curves of microlensing events KMT-2021-BLG-0284, KMT-2022-BLG-2480, and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 display highly complex patterns with three or more anomaly features. These features cannot be adequately explained by a binary-lens (2L1S) model alone. However, the 2L1S model can effectively describe certain segments of the light curve. By incorporating an additional source into the modeling, we identified a comprehensive model that accounts for all the observed anomaly features.Results. Bayesian analysis, based on constraints provided by lensing observables, indicates that the lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are binary systems composed of M dwarfs. For KMT-2022-BLG-2480, the primary lens is an early K-type main-sequence star with an M dwarf companion. The lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are likely located in the bulge, whereas the lens of KMT-2022-BLG-2480 is more likely situated in the disk. In all events, the binary stars of the sources have similar magnitudes due to a detection bias favoring binary source events with a relatively bright secondary source star, which increases detection efficiency.","Since the mid-2010s, the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) team has been conducting gravitational microlensing experiments using a network of three wide-field telescopes deployed in the Southern Hemisphere (Kim et al., 2016). The data collected from these observations are transmitted almost in real-time to the headquarters of the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) for processing. A self-developed algorithm (Kim et al., 2018) is employed to identify lensing events, and the light curves of these detected events are meticulously examined for any discontinuous anomalies. These anomalies undergo careful analysis by multiple researchers to determine their origins and confirm whether they are caused by planetary companions to the lens, which is the primary objective of the experiment. Currently, the KMTNet experiment detects over 3,000 gravitational lensing events annually, with about 10% of these events exhibiting anomalies of various origins (Zang et al., 2021b, 2022). Of these anomalies, approximately 10% are confirmed to be of planetary origin (Gould et al., 2022). Anomalies in lensing light curves can arise from various factors. The most common cause is the binarity of the lens (Mao & Paczyński, 1991). In these binary-lens single-source (2L1S) events, caustics form on the source plane, and the source’s passage through these caustics results in light curves that differ from those of single-lens single-source (1L1S) events (Schneider & Weiss, 1986). These caustics exhibit complex patterns depending on the separation and mass ratio between the lens components and, along with various source trajectories, produce a wide range of anomaly patterns (Erdl & Schneider, 1993; Han, 2006; Cassan, 2008; Gaudi, 2012). Another important cause of anomalies is the binarity of the source. In these single-lens binary-source (1L2S) cases, the event’s light curve is the superposition of the lensing events occurring for each individual source, which leads to deviations in the lensing light curves (Griest & Hu, 1992; Di Stefano & Esin, 1995; Han & Gould, 1997; Dominik, 1998; Han & Jeong, 1998). In some rare cases, the observed anomalies cannot be explained by a three-body lensing model (lens plus source) and require a four-body lensing model, which includes an additional lens or source component. To date, 14 events have been identified as 3L1S events, in which the lens consists of three masses. Of these, six events correspond to planetary systems consisting of a host star and two planets, seven involve binary systems that include a planet, and the remaining event has been identified as a triple stellar system composed of three stars. Another type of four-body event occurs when both the lens and the source are binaries, known as a 2L2S event. So far, ten such events have been identified, four of which involve binary lenses that include planetary companions. In Table 1, we provide a summary of some of the known four-body lensing events, along with a brief description of the corresponding lens systems.

In the initial phase, we examined lensing events from the KMTNet survey that exhibited anomalies in their light curves, which were then independently analyzed by multiple modelers. Most of these anomalies were successfully explained using either 2L1S or 1L2S models. However, for a small subset of events in which these three-body models could not account for the anomalies, we carried out more detailed analyses using advanced models. These analyses revealed that the difficulty in explaining the anomalies in some events was due to significant higher-order effects, such as lens orbital motion, as seen in events like OGLE-2018-BLG-0971, MOA-2023-BLG-065, and OGLE-2023-BLG-0136 (Han et al., 2024a). In other cases, the anomalies were caused by the presence of an additional source or lens component, as shown in the 2L2S and 3L1S events summarized in Table 1. It is important to note that the list of four-body lensing events in the table is not complete, as the nature of the anomalies in some events remains unclear, and more advanced models are currently being tested to interpret them. In this work, we present analyses of three lensing events with complex anomalies in their light curves that were successfully interpreted using 2L2S models. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we detail the observations conducted to collect the data used for our analyses, including a brief description of the instrumentation. We also outline the procedures for data reduction and photometry. Section 3 begins with the definition of the lensing parameters used in our modeling across different interpretations of lensing events. We then describe the procedure of light curve modeling employed to determine these parameters. Subsequent subsections present the analysis process and results for each individual event. Each subsection discusses specific anomalies observed in the event’s light curve, provides model parameters derived from the analysis, and outlines the configuration of the lens system. In Sect. 4 we identify the source stars associated with each event and estimate the angular Einstein radius based on the derived information on the source star. Section 5 outlines the physical quantities of the lens determined based on the observables of individual events. Lastly, Sect. 6 summarizes our findings and presents the conclusions drawn from the study."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09506v1,Gl 725A b: a potential super-Earth detected with SOPHIE and SPIRou in an M dwarf binary system at 3.5 pc,"We report the discovery of a super-Earth candidate orbiting the nearby mid M dwarf Gl 725A using the radial velocity (RV) method. The planetary signal has been independently identified using high-precision RVs from the SOPHIE and SPIRou spectrographs, in the optical and near-infrared domains, respectively. We modelled the stellar activity signal jointly with the planet using two Gaussian Processes, one for each instrument to account for the chromaticity of the stellar activity and instrumental systematics, along with a Keplerian model. The signal is significantly detected with a RV semi-amplitude of 1.67\pm 0.20 m/s. The planet Gl 725A b is found to be in an orbit compatible with circular with a period of 11.2201\pm 0.0051 days. We analysed 27 sectors of TESS photometry on which no transit event was found. We determined a minimum mass of M_{p}\sin{i}=2.78\pm 0.35\,M_{\oplus} which places the planet in the super-Earth regime. Using Mass-Radius relationships we predict a planetary radius to be between 1.2 and 2.0\,R_{\oplus}. The proximity of Gl 725A, of only 3.5 pc, makes this new exoplanet one of the closest to Earth and joins the group of S-type low-mass planets in short orbits (P<15 d) around close M dwarfs.","M dwarfs are cool and low-mass stars that comprise the most abundant stellar type in our Galaxy, reaching up to 75% of the galactic stellar population (Henry et al. 2006). They are attractive targets for exoplanetary science, in particular for the search of Earth-mass planets. Due to their low mass and size, the Doppler shift and transit depth produced by a small planet orbiting an M dwarf is larger than that of a Sun-like star, for a given planet mass/radius, and orbital distance. Reylé et al. (2021) found that 61\% of stars and brown dwarfs within the Solar neighborhood (d¡10 pc) are M dwarfs. However, only 24\% of these group of close M dwarfs have known exoplanets111As of March 2024, source: the Exoplanet Archive exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu. Most of the exoplanets around M dwarfs in the Solar neighbourhood have been discovered with the radial velocity (RV) technique and therefore, only a minimum mass can be determined. Regarding the multiplicity of the stellar host, Reylé et al. (2021) found a stellar multiplicity frequency of 27\% in the Solar neighbourhood. However, only nine multiple M dwarf systems have been confirmed as exoplanet hosts, and for all the them, the planets found only orbit one component of the system. This type of planet is known as circumstellar or S-type planet (Dvorak 1986). Several surveys focused on searching for planets around M dwarfs have started in the last decades, using transit photometry and RV techniques. On the photometry side, some examples of projects are MEarth (Nutzman & Charbonneau 2008), TRAPPIST (Gillon et al. 2011), SPECULOOS (Delrez et al. 2018), and TIERRAS (Garcia-Mejia et al. 2020). On the other hand, projects such as: HPF (Mahadevan et al. 2012), HARPS (Bonfils et al. 2013), HARPS-N (Covino et al. 2013), IRD (Kotani et al. 2014), CARMENES (Quirrenbach et al. 2018), MAROON-X (Seifahrt et al. 2018), SOPHIE (Hobson et al. 2018), SPIRou (Donati et al. 2020), and NIRPS (Artigau et al. 2024), rely on high-precision Doppler spectroscopy. One key results of these surveys is that low-mass planets (1 ¡ M_{p}\sin{i}/M_{\oplus} ¡ 10) are common around M dwarfs (Bonfils et al. 2013; Kopparapu 2013; Dressing & Charbonneau 2013, 2015; Sabotta et al. 2021) and their frequency may be closely related to the spectral type (e.g., Pinamonti et al. 2022). However, despite the technical developments and efforts to discover low-mass planets around M dwarfs, stellar activity is currently one of the main challenges that hinders their detection. Cool stars host magnetic fields that generate activity features all over the stellar surfaces (Reiners 2012). These features co-rotate with the star producing quasi-periodic variations in the observed RVs. These RV variations induced by stellar activity can reach amplitudes of a few meters per second, even for less active stars, which can lead to false-positive exoplanet detection (e.g., Queloz et al. 2001; Huélamo et al. 2008; Carolo et al. 2014; Bortle et al. 2021). The development of near-infrared (NIR) spectrographs has been fundamental to enriching our understanding of the activity of M dwarfs. These stars emit most of their flux at NIR wavelengths, allowing to achieve higher sensitivity and precision than in the optical domain. Moreover, the spot-induced RV variability tends to decrease as a function of wavelength (Martín et al. 2006; Desort et al. 2007; Reiners et al. 2010; Mahmud et al. 2011; Cale et al. 2021) since the flux contrast between the stellar surface and the dark spots is smaller at NIR wavelengths, and therefore the induced RV jitter decreases (Reiners et al. 2010; Andersen & Korhonen 2015). As the stellar activity signal is chromatic, optical and NIR observations are of great help to disentangle the stellar activity jitter from the Keplerian signals (Reiners et al. 2013; Robertson et al. 2020). TW Hydrae (Huélamo et al. 2008), and AD Leo (Carleo et al. 2020; Carmona et al. 2023) are two examples of how multi-wavelength observations helped to reject the planet candidates as activity-induced false positives. SOPHIE and SPIRou are high-precision spectrographs in the optical and NIR domains, respectively. Our team is carrying out a synergy program in which dozens of early to mid-M dwarfs are observed with both instruments, providing in many cases contemporary observations. This allows us to have a better phase coverage of planet candidates and to study the chromaticity of the stellar activity signatures in the RVs. The results from this program (e.g., Carmona et al. 2023, Cortés-Zuleta et al. 2023) highlight the importance of using multi-wavelength observations to understand the activity of M dwarfs and their planets. In this work, we present the analysis of Gl 725 A, the brighter component of an M dwarf binary system in the Solar neighbourhood, located at only 3.5 pc from Earth. The mean angular separation of the binary system is of 14.9′′ which allows gathering individual high-precision spectroscopy. Gl 725 A is a mid M dwarf with low activity levels and a rotation period previously measured at 103.1\pm 6.1 d (Donati et al. 2023). The analysis of SOPHIE and SPIRou high-precision RV time series indicates the presence of a low-mass planet in a 11-day orbit, potentially in the super-Earth regime. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 details the observations and data reduction. Sections 3 and 4 describe the stellar properties and activity analysis, respectively. The detection and characterization of the planet Gl 725A b is detailed in Sect. 5. The limits of planet radius and the search for transits in TESS data is discussed in Sect. 6. Finally, discussions and conclusions are detailed in Sects. 7 and 8, respectively. Table 1: Identifiers and stellar parameters of Gl 725 A and Gl 725 B.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09311v1,Compression Method for Solar Polarization Spectra Collected from Hinode SOT/SP Observations,"The complex structure and extensive details of solar spectral data, combined with a recent surge in volume, present significant processing challenges. To address this, we propose a deep learning-based compression technique using deep autoencoder (DAE) and 1D-convolutional autoencoder (CAE) models developed with Hinode SOT/SP data. We focused on compressing Stokes I and V polarization spectra from the quiet Sun, as well as from active regions, providing a novel insight into comprehensive spectral analysis by incorporating spectra from extreme magnetic fields. The results indicate that the CAE model outperforms the DAE model in reconstructing Stokes profiles, demonstrating greater robustness and achieving reconstruction errors around the observational noise level. The proposed method has proven effective in compressing Stokes I and V spectra from both the quiet Sun and active regions, highlighting its potential for impactful applications in solar spectral analysis, such as detection of unusual spectral signals.","Observational spectral data encapsulates important and varied physical information with a multi-dimensional structure about astronomical bodies, necessitating thorough investigation and analysis for a comprehensive understanding of space. The increase in the number of observatory instruments in recent years has led to a substantial growth in the volume of astronomical data. This surge not only emphasizes the significance of studying such data but also opens up promising opportunities for leveraging deep learning techniques in the processing and analysis of these vast datasets in the big data era. One approach to handling such intricate data is the feature extraction technique, which takes the high-dimensional raw data as input, compresses it, and reconstructs it to the original size. The most important features of the original high-dimensional data are extracted in the compressed part, enabling them to serve as representatives of the original complex dataset in subsequent studies. Autoencoders (LeCun, 1987; Kramer, 1991; Goodfellow et al., 2016) play a powerful role in deep learning-based dimensionality reduction. Through this compression approach, further studies such as anomaly detection (Chen et al., 2018; Ryu et al., 2023) and classification (Gogoi and Begum, 2017; Yeom et al., 2021) of data can also be accomplished. In the latter part of the 2010s, several studies aimed to develop and apply compression methods for spectral data, particularly in the context of galaxy observations. Portillo et al. (2020) utilized variational autoencoder models to compress galaxy spectra by reducing it to six parameters, offering more accurate reconstructions than principal component analysis (PCA). Melchior et al. (2023) introduced an architecture to represent and generate restframe galaxy spectra from 6 to 10 latent parameters, resulting in accurate reconstructions with superresolution and reduced noise. When compared to data in other fields of space science, solar spectral data stand out in terms of their increased precision and complexity in higher dimensionality, encompassing details about light polarization, temperature, and the magnetic field on the solar surface. Therefore, processing this type of observational data poses a significant challenge. Previous works referring to the representational dimension of solar polarimetric spectra include, Asensio Ramos (2006)’s two-part minimum description length principle for approximation model selection, which suggests the optimal eigenvector dimension for denoising PCA, and Asensio Ramos et al. (2007)’s intrinsic dimensionality estimation method for spectropolarimetry data. López Ariste and Casini (2002) implemented a PCA inversion technique using 10 eigenprofiles for a single Stokes profile. A feature extraction technique by Socas-Navarro (2005) for simulated solar profiles, based on a multi-layer perceptron, represents one of the first uses of a neural network for solar spectra, achieving higher accuracy than previous methods such as PCA but requiring significant computational expense. Studies conducted on inversion techniques using deep learning, include Gafeira et al. (2021)’s convolutional neural network-based inversion method for Stokes profiles using Hinode (Kosugi et al., 2007) data. Additionally, Asensio Ramos and Díaz Baso (2019) introduced convolutional neural networks that output thermodynamic and magnetic properties from synthetic Stokes profiles, and achieved a precision comparable to the standard technique. Regarding deep learning-based solar spectral compression, Sadykov et al. (2021) used a fully connected autoencoder to reduce one-dimensional quiet Sun spectra, collected by NASA’s IRIS (De Pontieu et al., 2014) satellite, from 110 to 4 in size, achieving an average reconstruction error comparable to the variations in the line continuum. Upon reviewing previous works, it becomes apparent that compression techniques for observational solar spectra have primarily been developed for one-dimensional spectra related to spatial positions in the quiet Sun. However, active regions cannot be disregarded, as they are associated with a variety of significant solar phenomena—such as solar flares, solar jets, and coronal mass ejections—necessitating thorough study as important regions of interest. This motivates our proposal to develop an efficient compression method for solar polarization spectra, applicable to both the quiet Sun and active regions, by utilizing two-dimensional key polarimetric parameters. We conduct our study using observational solar spectra from Hinode SOT/SP (Tsuneta et al., 2008; Suematsu et al., 2008; Lites et al., 2013), a collaborative mission of JAXA, NASA, and ESA. This mission has been collecting solar spectro-polarimetric data since 2006, constituting an extensive solar spectral database suitable for our work. Our study introduces the compression of solar spectra through the development of two distinct models: a deep autoencoder (DAE) and a 1D-convolutional autoencoder (CAE). Considering the intricate nature of Stokes profiles characterized by high noise levels, we exclusively focus on Stokes I (total intensity) and Stokes V (circular polarization) selected from the set of four parameters. In Section 2, we provide a description of the Hinode data, followed in Section 3 by a comprehensive explanation of the methods applied in our study. Sections 4 and 5 present the results and discussion, respectively. In Section 6, we conclude the paper with a brief summary."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09195v1,"The origin channels of hierarchical binary black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O1, O2, and O3 runs","We infer the origin channels of hierarchical mergers observed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O1, O2, and O3 runs using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis under a parametric population model. By assuming the active galactic nucleus (ANG) disk and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, we find that NSCs likely dominate the hierarchical merger rate in the universe, corresponding to a fraction of f_{\rm NSC}=0.87_{-0.29}^{+0.10} at 90% credible intervals in our fiducial model; AGN disks may contribute up to nearly half of hierarchical mergers detectable with LVK, specifically f_{\rm det,AGN}=0.34_{-0.26}^{+0.38}. We investigate the impact of the escape speed, along with other population parameters on the branching fraction, suggesting that the mass, mass ratio, and spin of the sources play significant roles in population analysis. We show that hierarchical mergers constitute at least \sim10\% of the gravitational wave events detected by LVK during the O1-O3 runs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is challenging to effectively infer detailed information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of black hole merger parameters if multiple formation channels are considered.","During the first three observing runs, the LIGO (LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al., 2015), Virgo (Acernese et al., 2015), and KAGRA (Somiya, 2012; Aso et al., 2013) (LVK) Collaboration reported nearly a hundred binary compact merger events (Abbott et al., 2019, 2021; The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al., 2021; Abbott et al., 2023a). The majority of binary black hole (BBH) mergers could be explained by first-generation (1G) mergers formed from the collapse of stars. These primarily arise from isolated binary evolution, as well as dynamical formation in young/open star clusters and globular clusters (Mapelli, 2021; Mandel & Farmer, 2022). Others might stem from second (or higher) generation mergers, referred to hierarchical (repeated) mergers (O’Leary et al., 2016; Gerosa & Berti, 2017; Fishbach et al., 2017), which could mainly originate from active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks and nuclear star clusters (NSCs) (Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021; Arca Sedda et al., 2023b), although hierarchical mergers can also occur in globular clusters (GCs) and young massive clusters (YSCs). Because they are less frequent in the latter environments, which strongly depends on the escape speed of their dynamical environments (see e.g., Antonini & Gieles, 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2019; Mapelli et al., 2021; Kimball et al., 2021; Arca Sedda et al., 2023a). Hierarchical mergers can efficiently bridge the pair-instability (PI) mass gap predicted by PI supernovae (Heger et al., 2003) and Pulsational PI supernovae (Woosley et al., 2007; Belczynski et al., 2016), explaining the growth of intermediate-mass black holes (BHs) in dense stellar environments (e.g., Di Carlo et al., 2020b, a; Tagawa et al., 2021; Fragione et al., 2022; González Prieto et al., 2022; Kritos et al., 2023; Di Cintio et al., 2023). In the active phase of galactic nuclei, a high-density gas disk can efficiently capture stellar-mass BHs and facilitate binary formation and mergers (Bellovary et al., 2016; Bartos et al., 2017; Tagawa et al., 2020b). This unique environment leads to distinctive characteristics of BBHs. The BH mass spectrum is expected to undergo hardening due to the orbital alignment of BHs with the AGN disks, which preferentially selects heavier BHs (Yang et al., 2019a). Under accretion, the spin magnitudes of BHs are likely to be higher, with spin directions tending to align or anti-align with the disk (Bogdanović et al., 2007; Tagawa et al., 2020a; Yi & Cheng, 2019; McKernan et al., 2020). Moreover, migration and migration traps efficiently promotes BH hierarchical growth with extreme mass ratio mergers (Yang et al., 2019b; Li, 2022a). NSCs are also efficient sites for the occurrence of hierarchical mergers (Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021). BBHs in NSCs are formed through dynamical pairing, either via exchanges between a binary star and an intruder, or via dynamical encounters of three initially single bodies (Heggie, 1975; Hills & Fullerton, 1980). The remnant of a 1G BBH merger can be retained by the host cluster if the escape speed of the host cluster is larger than its kick velocity. This surviving remnant can then pair up with another BH to form a hierarchical BBH. Therefore, the crucial condition for hierarchical mergers in NSCs is the escape speed of the host cluster—higher escape speeds result in more efficient hierarchical mergers (Gerosa & Berti, 2019; Li, 2022b; Li et al., 2023a). Additionally, the occurrence of relatively symmetric binary for hierarchical mergers may be preferential in NSCs due to mass segregation (Pavlík & Vesperini, 2022). As a result, the difference in hierarchical mergers lies in the presence of additional changes in the mass and spin of BHs in NSCs compared to those in AGN disks. This implies that the mass and effective spin distributions of hierarchical mergers in AGN disks are higher than those in NSCs (Li et al., 2023a). Regarding the mass ratios of hierarchical mergers, unequal-mass pairings are favored in AGN disks, represented by the hierarchical branch of NG+1G mergers (NG refers to the BH generation), while in NSCs, relatively equal-mass pairings are still favored, represented by the hierarchical branch of NG+NG mergers. In addition, it is generally agreed that the efficiency of BH hierarchical growth in AGN disks may be higher than in NSCs (e.g., Yang et al., 2019b; Li et al., 2023a), although it depends on several parameters that are currently unknown. These parameters include the formation channel of NSCs, the real structure and dynamics of an AGN disk, the possible existence of migration traps, the presence of a supermassive BH in the NSC, and the dynamical evolution of the NSC and its co-evolution with the surrounding environment (Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021; Arca Sedda et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023b). Primarily focusing on 1G mergers, previous research has examined the branching fractions of their isolated binary evolution or cluster channels for BBH mergers (Zevin et al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2023; Iwaya et al., 2023; Vaccaro et al., 2024). However, some of the BBH mergers detected by LVK might be hierarchical mergers originating from dynamical channels, such as AGN disks and NSCs. In this study, our objective is to infer the branching fractions of the AGN disk and NSC channels for hierarchical mergers. Our focus is on investigating the population parameters (see Table 1) that influence branching fractions, which suggests that effectively inferring information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of BBH merger parameters presents a significant challenge."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09179v1,Solar Energetic Particle Track Accumulation in Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt Dust Grains,"Interplanetary dust grains (IDPs) originate from a variety of sources and are dynamically transported across the solar system. While in transport, high-Z solar energetic particles (SEPs) with energies of \sim1 MeV/nuc leave damage tracks as they pass through IDPs. SEP track densities can be used as a measure of a grain’s space exposure and in turn, help to constrain their lifetimes and origins. Stratospherically collected IDPs with relatively high track densities (>10^{10} cm-2) have been interpreted as originating from the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. To further test this hypothesis, we use a dynamical dust grain tracing model to explore the accumulation of SEP tracks within EKB dust grains. We demonstrate that, neglecting collisions, dust grains with radii up to 500 \mum are capable of transiting from the EKB to 1 au despite gravitational perturbations from the outer planets, albeit with decreasing probability as a function of size. Despite this, we find that EKB grains cannot accumulate sufficient tracks to match those reported in the terrestrial stratospheric IDP collection when applying SEP track accumulation rates established from lunar samples at 1 au and assuming the SEP flux scales with heliocentric distance as r^{-1.7}. By exploring the radial scaling of the SEP flux, we find that a shallower SEP radial distribution of r^{-1.0} does allow for the accumulation of >10^{10} tracks cm-2 in EKB dust grains that reach 1 au. We urge further research into the propagation and distribution of high-Z SEPs throughout the heliosphere in order to better constrain track accumulation in IDPs.","Interplanetary dust grains (IDPs) originate from a wide variety of sources in the solar system, including asteroids, comets, and Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt (EKB) objects (e.g., see review by Koschny et al., 2019). After their birth, these grains are subject to several forces, including gravity, solar radiation pressure, Poynting-Robertson and solar-wind drag, and electromagnetism (e.g., Burns et al., 1979; Gustafson, 1994), which in turn allows IDPs to migrate long distances from their birthplace (e.g., Grün et al., 1985; Jackson & Zook, 1992; Liou et al., 1995; Landgraf et al., 2002; Moro-Martín & Malhotra, 2003). Thus, the influx of interplanetary dust grains to any object in space is dependent both on the location of such object and the time-integrated dynamics of IDPs originating from various sources. At Earth, for example, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the IDP influx is primarily composed of dust originating from Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) (e.g., Nesvorný et al., 2010; Carrillo-Sánchez et al., 2016) with smaller contributions from Oort Cloud comets (Nesvorný et al., 2011), Halley-type comets (Pokorný et al., 2014), and the main asteroid belt (e.g., Durda & Dermott, 1997; Nesvorný et al., 2010). In contrast, the IDP influx in the outer solar system is believed to transition from JFC-dominated near Jupiter to EKB-dominated near Neptune (e.g., Kuchner & Stark, 2010; Vitense et al., 2012; Poppe, 2016; Poppe et al., 2019; Piquette et al., 2019; Bernardoni et al., 2022). Additionally, dynamical simulations have also suggested the possibility that IDPs from the EKB could potentially migrate all the way to 1 au and comprise a component of the zodiacal cloud at Earth (e.g., Liou et al., 1996; Moro-Martín & Malhotra, 2003); however, supporting evidence for an influx of EKB grains to Earth has, until recently, remained lacking. As interplanetary dust grains migrate through the solar system, they are subjected to charged-particle irradiation over a wide range of species and energies. Among these various populations, high-Z (Z\geq 26) ions with energies of \sim1 MeV/nuc leave visible damage tracks within meteoritic minerals due to local melting and subsequent amorphization (e.g., Fleischer et al., 1975; Szenes et al., 2010). These track-inducing particles, comprised mainly of iron (Fe, Z=26) with minor contributions from even heavier elements (e.g., Ni, Zn, etc.), primarily originate from solar flares near the Sun’s surface or from coronal mass ejections that propagate through the heliosphere and are part of a broader population of ‘solar energetic particles’ (SEPs) (e.g., Reames, 2013, 2019). The convolution of the track-inducing SEP distribution throughout the heliosphere and the time history of IDP trajectories governs the rate at which IDPs accumulate damage tracks. Additionally, energetic particle irradiation of interplanetary dust grains by both SEPs and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) can also stimulate the formation of cosmogenic radionuclides (e.g., 10Be, 26Al, 53Mn, 60Fe), observations of which have recently been used to infer an outer solar system origin for several terrestrial micrometeorites (e.g., Feige et al., 2024). While highly complementary to the analysis of SEP-induced track densities studied here, we note that the production of cosmogenic nuclides within IDPs is not the focus of the current study and is left to future work. At Earth, interplanetary dust grains that have entered the terrestrial atmosphere can be collected in the stratosphere for inspection and analysis in ground-based laboratories. Bradley et al. (1984) reported the first discovery of SEP-induced tracks in stratospherically collected IDPs and subsequent studies have used SEP track densities to establish the exposure ages of IDPs and by extension, constrain their parent populations (e.g., Sandford, 1986; Flynn, 1989; Thiel et al., 1991). Building on this idea, Flynn (1994) and Flynn (1996) suggested that one could identify EKB grains that managed to transit to 1 au based on an unusually high amount of space exposure in the form of SEP-induced tracks. Recently, Keller & Flynn (2022) have reported the possible discovery of such EKB grains in the stratospheric IDP collection, based on a combination of unusually high SEP-induced track densities within some IDPs, \sim0.4–5\times 10^{11} tracks cm-2, and a revised calibration for the SEP track-production rate at 1 au based on lunar samples returned from the Apollo missions (Keller et al., 2021). By employing an analytical model of interplanetary dust grain dynamics under the influence of only Poynting-Robertson drag (i.e., without planetary perturbations), Keller & Flynn (2022) noted that grains released from the EKB region (\sim40-50 au) tended to accumulate between 0.4–4.0\times 10^{10} tracks cm-2, somewhat lower than their observed distribution. Keller & Flynn (2022) further suggested that, based on the dynamical results of Liou et al. (1996), trapping within MMRs outside the orbit of Neptune could yield the additional fraction of accumulated track densities needed to achieve a more satisfactory comparison with the observed high-track-density SEPs; however, an explicit dynamical calculation of this potential effect was not performed. Here, we build upon and extend the work of Keller & Flynn (2022) by using a dynamical dust grain model that includes all major perturbing forces to investigate the dynamics and track accumulation of interplanetary dust grains originating from the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. In particular, we explicitly assess the role that planetary perturbations, including trapping within MMRs, play in the overall accumulation of SEP-induced tracks within IDPs. Section 2 describes the modeling approach used in the study, including both the interplanetary dust dynamics model and the distribution of track-inducing SEPs. Section 3 presents the results of our simulations while Section 4 provides a discussion of our findings in the context of explaining high-track-density IDPs at 1 au. Finally, we conclude in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08960v1,NGTS-33b: A Young Super-Jupiter Hosted by a Fast Rotating Massive Hot Star,"In the last few decades planet search surveys have been focusing on solar type stars, and only recently the high-mass regimes. This is mostly due to challenges arising from the lack of instrumental precision, and more importantly, the inherent active nature of fast rotating massive stars. Here we report NGTS-33b (TOI-6442b), a super-Jupiter planet with mass, radius and orbital period of 3.6 \pm 0.3 MJ, 1.64 \pm 0.07 RJ and 2.827972\pm 0.000001 days, respectively. The host is a fast rotating (0.6654\pm 0.0006 day) and hot (Teff = 7437 \pm 72 K) A9V type star, with a mass and radius of 1.60 \pm 0.11 M⊙ and 1.47 \pm 0.06 R⊙, respectively. Planet structure and Gyrochronology models shows that NGTS-33 is also very young with age limits of 10-50 Myr. In addition, membership analysis points towards the star being part of the Vela OB2 association, which has an age of \sim 20-35 Myr, thus providing further evidences about the young nature of NGTS-33. Its low bulk density of 0.19\pm0.03 g cm-3 is 13\% smaller than expected when compared to transiting hot Jupiters with similar masses. Such cannot be solely explained by its age, where an up to 15\% inflated atmosphere is expected from planet structure models. Finally, we found that its emission spectroscopy metric is similar to JWST community targets, making the planet an interesting target for atmospheric follow-up. Therefore, NGTS-33b’s discovery will not only add to the scarce population of young, massive and hot Jupiters, but will also help place further strong constraints on current formation and evolution models for such planetary systems.","The detection of the first hot Jupiters (HJ; Mayor & Queloz, 1995; Charbonneau et al., 2000) set a great milestone in the exoplanet field, paving the way to the detection of several more extra-solar planets. Ground-based spectroscopic (Valenti & Fischer, 2005; Jenkins et al., 2009) and photometric surveys (Bakos et al., 2004; Pollacco et al., 2006; Wheatley et al., 2013) were initially responsible for the detection and characterisation of several massive HJs. Yet, though challenging, a few Neptunes (e.g., HAT-P-11b, NGTS-14Ab; Bakos et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2021) have also been confirmed. Such selection bias towards massive planets is mostly due to the larger Doppler signal as well as transit depths induced by HJs given their mass and short orbital periods (P < 10 days), making their detection more favourable compared to less massive and/or longer period worlds. Besides that, ground-based missions are limited by atmospheric conditions (Cubillos et al., 2016; O’Brien et al., 2022) as well as the day-night cycle, hence challenging the discovery of long-period planets. On the other hand, space-based missions such as CoRoT (Auvergne et al., 2009), Kepler/K2 (Borucki et al., 2010) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; Ricker et al., 2015) were free of such atmospheric limitations, helping to reduce the bias by increasing the number of planet detections1115675 planets on 15 May 2024 according to https://exoplanet.eu/ significantly, with Kepler being responsible for the discovery of several (mini-)Neptunes (10M⊕\leqM<38M⊕) and (super-)Earths (1M⊕\leqM<10M⊕), whilst providing robust statistical constraints on planet occurrence rates (Mulders et al., 2015; Hsu et al., 2019), as well as the multiplicity nature of rocky worlds (Cochran et al., 2011; Gillon et al., 2017). In addition, the dearth of Neptune planets with orbital periods interior to 4 days, known as the Neptune desert, first dropped out of the Kepler data, and subsequently corroborated by the relatively low Neptune discoveries from TESS mission. Though rare, planets have been detected and characterised in this region (e.g., LTT9779b; Jenkins et al., 2020; Hoyer et al., 2023; Fernández Fernández et al., 2024), which were fundamental to constrain the most likely scenario for these planets. In addition, the evolution of giant planets may even be associated to the emergence and form of the desert, where a combination of tidal migration with atmospheric photoevaporation (Lopez & Fortney, 2013; Owen & Wu, 2017) may have been able to strip off the migrating giants’ envelopes, giving rise to a population of Neptune-desert planets. Like the Neptune desert planets, the HJ population remains subjected to intense scrutiny, especially the transiting HJs (THJs), where besides their masses, radii (Rp) and bulk densities (\rho_{\rm p}) can be estimated at high precision. Moreover, atmospheric follow-up may help reveal key properties (e.g, day-night temperatures, albedos/reflectivity and atmosphere abundances), making them great test beds for probing giant planet formation and evolution histories. For instance, HJs are not expected to form in-situ but farther out in the disc where an initial \sim 10 M⊕ protocore mass is fundamental to the onset of a runaway gas accretion process leading to the formation of giant planets (Pollack et al., 1996; Alibert et al., 2005; Piso & Youdin, 2014). In addition, HJs formation and disc migration must occur quickly (\sim 5-10 Myr), with timescales being a function of the protostar mass as well as the disc properties, specially its mass and metallicity (see, Fortney et al., 2021). In fact, it has been noted that stellar metallicity ([Fe/H]) correlates with giant planet fraction (fp), indicating that such planets are formed more effectively around metal-rich stars (Gonzalez, 1997; Santos et al., 2001; Fischer & Valenti, 2005; Osborn & Bayliss, 2020). Moreover, an increase in [Fe/H] leads to a higher fp, providing further evidences that disc metallicity plays an important role in the formation of giant planets (Santerne et al., 2016; Buchhave et al., 2018; Barbato et al., 2019). For instance, Jenkins et al. (2017) finds a correlation between giant hosts [Fe/H] and P, where the population of giants exterior to P\leq100 days are more metal-rich with a [Fe/H] mean difference \sim 0.16 dex. Therefore, they point out that such correlation may indicate the initial location where giant planets formed in the protoplanetary disc. Finally, giant planets seem to be more abundant around more massive stars, where higher fp are observed as a function of stellar mass (Johnson et al., 2010; Reffert et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2016). Such results point to a correlation between the central star and disc masses, where the former plays an important role in the type of planets that will be formed. In other words, an increase in the stellar mass leads to higher disc masses, hence more material with which to quickly form massive giant planets before the disc disperses. Therefore, these results are in agreement with the current findings of massive stars harbouring massive gas giant planets, particularly at short periods where the HJ population is located. As mentioned, the evolution of giant planets may have been subjected to disc migration rather than in-situ formation. Further evidence against the latter include the detection of atmospheric escape in HJs (e.g., HD209458b, HD 189733b, KELT-19b; Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Des Etangs et al., 2010; Wyttenbach et al., 2020) and high obliquities of close-in giants, which may be explained by the planets’ evolution through high eccentricity (e) migration by secular interactions with outer companions (Fortney et al., 2021; Vick et al., 2023). In fact, a handful of hot hosts have massive HJs with non-zero obliquities (e.g., KELT-17b, MASCARA-1b, TOI-1431b), with some even retrograde (HAT-P-14b; Winn et al., 2011), whereas cool stars tend to have HJs with low obliquities (Winn et al., 2011), thus showing that massive giant planets might have gone through multiple migration channels. Here, we report the detection of NGTS-33b, the first NGTS discovery of a super-Jupiter hosted by a massive star. This detection will add to the small, but growing number of massive systems, that will help us to better understand the formation and evolution processes of massive planets around hot stars. The manuscript is organised as follows, in \S 2, we present the photometry extraction from NGTS and TESS lightcurves, spectroscopic follow-up with FEROS, HARPS and CORALIE and their respective spectral line activity diagnosis. \S 3 describes the data analysis, where we extract stellar parameters (\S 3.2), assess its age (\S 3.2.1), perform a global modelling to derive the planetary parameters (\S 3.3). Stellar rotation period, transit timing variation as well as dynamical stability were probed in \S 3.1, 3.4, and 3.5, respectively. Finally, we discuss our results in \S 4 and set out the conclusions in \S 5. 1.1 The Next Generation Transit Survey The Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS; Chazelas et al.,, 2012; McCormac et al.,, 2017; Wheatley et al.,, 2018) is located at the ESO Paranal Observatory in Chile, with the objective of detecting new transiting planetary systems. The consortium has 12 telescopes with 0.2 m diameter each, and individual fields of view of 8 deg2, which combined provides a wide-field of 96 deg2. The NGTS detectors host 2K\times2K pixels, with individual pixels measuring 13.5 \mum, which corresponds to an on-sky size of 5 arcseconds/pixel, thus providing high sensitivity images over a wavelength domain between 520-890nm. This combination allows 150 ppm photometry to be obtained on bright stars (V<10 mags) for multi-camera observations, while for single telescope mode at 30 min cadence, a precision of 400 ppm is achievable (Bayliss et al., 2022). The project has been operational since February 2016, and over the past 8 years has so far acquired over 400 billion measurements of over 30 million stars. Within this treasure-trove of data, the NGTS has discovered 26 new planetary systems (e.g., Bayliss et al.,, 2018; Bryant et al.,, 2020; Tilbrook et al.,, 2021; Bouchy et al.,, 2024), with more yet to be confirmed. A few of the highlights include the discovery of the Neptune desert planet NGTS-4b (West et al., 2019), an ultra short period Jupiter NGTS-6b (Vines et al., 2019), the shortest period hot Jupiter NGTS-10b around a K5V star (McCormac et al., 2020), an inflated HJ around a low-mass and metal-poor K dwarf (Alves et al., 2022), and a few warm planets (e.g., NGTS-29b, NGTS-30b; Gill et al., 2024; Battley et al., 2024)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08959v1,A complete Herbig disk mass survey in Orion,"Context. Disks around intermediate mass stars called Herbig disks are the formation sites of giant exoplanets. Obtaining a complete inventory of these disks will therefore give insights into giant planet formation. However, until now no complete disk survey has been done on Herbig disks in a single star-forming region. Aims. This work aims to obtain the first complete survey of Herbig disks. Orion is the only nearby region with a significant number of Herbig disks (N=35) to carry out such a survey. The resulting dust mass distribution is compared to other dust mass distributions of disks around proto- and pre-main sequence stars in Orion. In addition we ascertain if previous ALMA observations have been biased towards the most massive and brightest Herbig disks.Methods. Using new NOEMA observations of 25 Herbig disks, in combination with ALMA archival data of 10 Herbig disks, results in a complete sample of all know Herbig disks in Orion. Using uv-plane analysis for the NOEMA observed disks, and literature values of the ALMA observed disks, we obtain the dust masses of all Herbig disks and obtain a cumulative dust mass distribution. Additionally, six disks with new CO isotopologues detections are presented, one of which is detected in \ceC^17O. We calculate the external ultraviolet (UV) irradiance on each disk and compare the dust mass to it.Results. We find a median disk dust mass of 11.7 M_{\oplus} for the Herbig disks. Comparing the Herbig disks in Orion to previous surveys for mainly T Tauri disks in Orion, we find that while \sim 50% of the Herbig disks have a mass higher than 10 M⊕, this is at most 25% for the T Tauri disks. This difference is especially striking when considering that the Herbig disks are around a factor of two older than the T Tauri disks. Comparing to the Herbig disks observed with ALMA from a previous study, no significant difference is found between the distributions. We find a steeper (slope of -7.6) relationship between the dust mass and external UV irradation compared to that of the T Tauri disks (slope of -1.3). Comparing our results to a recent SPHERE survey of disks in Orion, we see that the Herbig disks present the largest and brightest disks and have structures indicative of gas-giant formation.Conclusions. Herbig disks are on average more massive compared to T Tauri disks. This work shows the importance of complete samples, giving rise to the need of a complete survey of the Herbig disk population.","Herbig disks are disks around pre-main sequence stars with spectral types of B, A, and F, and stellar masses of 1.5-10 M⊙ with H\alpha indicating ongoing accretion (Herbig, 1960; Brittain et al., 2023). These disks are the prime formation site of giant exoplanets: directly imaged exoplanets are often found around early spectral type stars (Marois et al., 2008, 2010; Lagrange et al., 2010), and exoplanet population studies show that the occurrence rate of massive exoplanets is highest around intermediate mass stars (e.g., Johnson et al., 2010; Nielsen et al., 2019). Recent work by Stapper et al. (2022) has shown that the mean mass of Herbig disks is higher compared to disks around lower mass T Tauri stars. The interpretation of these higher disk fluxes are still being discussed: either as a consequence of massive exoplanets forming in these disks stopping radial drift and keeping the emitting area of the dust large (Stapper et al., 2022), and/or high dust masses causing massive exoplanets to form in these disks (e.g., Guzmán-Díaz et al., 2023). Regardless of interpretation, massive exoplanets are likely forming in these disks. Some of the most well-known protoplanetary disks are Herbig disk. These millimeter-bright disks display many different types of structures, and are therefore especially favored for in-depth morphological (e.g., Andrews et al., 2018), kinematical (Pinte et al., 2018, 2019; Izquierdo et al., 2022), and chemical studies (e.g., Öberg et al., 2021; Booth et al., 2024). Stapper et al. (2022) compiled all ALMA data available of Herbig disks within 450 pc, including these well-studied disks. They found a clear increase in the mean dust mass compared to disks in the Lupus and Upper Sco star-forming regions, which primarily consist of T Tauri stars, showing that the stellar mass - disk mass relationship extends to the intermediate mass regime. Still, both Herbig and T Tauri disks span the same range of masses, although their distributions are skewed to different averages. Since the T Tauri samples are complete and the Herbig sample of Stapper et al. (2022) is constructed from Herbig disks studied in a variety of ALMA projects (still 64% complete including all nearby star-forming regions), the question remains if the ALMA coverage of Herbig disks is biased toward well-known and ‘interesting’ objects with higher disk masses. Figure 1: Positions on the sky of the Herbig disk sample used in this work shown as the gray markers. The numbers next to the markers correspond to the numbers in Table 1. The background is an IRAS 100\mum image (Neugebauer et al., 1984). The positions of six disk surveys have been indicated as well: \sigma Ori (Ansdell et al., 2017), ONC (Eisner et al., 2018), OMC-2 (van Terwisga et al., 2019), \lambda Ori (Ansdell et al., 2020), NGC 2024 (van Terwisga et al., 2020), and L1641/L1647 (SODA, van Terwisga et al., 2022). Orion (\sim300–475 pc, Großschedl et al. 2018) is the closest star-forming complex with enough pre-main-sequence stars to harbor a sizeable number of Herbig Ae/Be stars. Many population studies have been done in different parts of Orion, tracing different star-formation environments from tranquil regions to more UV-dominated regions. In the \sigma Orionis cluster, an intermediate aged region of 3 Myr old, the disk dust masses were found to depend strongly on the distance to the O9 star at its center (Ansdell et al., 2017). Only 12% of their disks were more than 10 M⊕ in mass. Furthermore, CO was only detected in disks more than 1.5 pc separated from the O-star. On the other hand, the disks in the older \lambda Orionis cluster of 5 Myr have not been significantly impacted by the massive stars or the supernova which occurred in the cluster (Ansdell et al., 2020). Interestingly, there is one significant outlier, HD 245185 which is a Herbig disk, which has a more than an order of magnitude higher disk mass than any of the other disks in this region. The younger (0.5 Myr) NGC 2024 cluster was surveyed by van Terwisga et al. (2020). This cluster consists of two populations, the eastern population is shielded from FUV irradiation and is similar to other isolated regions, while the western population is older and may be affected by the FUV irradiation. Other younger clusters such as the Orion Nebula Cluster and Orion Molecular Cloud-2 have been surveyed as well (Eisner et al., 2018; van Terwisga et al., 2019), and even class 0 and I surveys have been done (Tobin et al., 2020). Lastly, the largest population study of disks to date, consisting of 873 disks, has been done in the L1641 and L1647 regions of the Orion A cloud (SODA, van Terwisga et al. 2022, for L1641 also see Grant et al. 2021). The plethora of population studies available in Orion gives a solid basis for a comparison between T Tauri disks and Herbig disks. In this work we present new Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations of all Herbig disks in Orion. Section 2 shows how the targets were selected, the NOEMA data were reduced, and the dust masses were obtained. In Section 3 the resulting dust mass distribution is presented and compared to distributions of other proto- and pre-main sequence stars in Orion, in addition CO spectra are presented. In Section 4.1 the dust mass distribution is compared to the one of ALMA from Stapper et al. (2022). The impact of external UV irradiation on the dust masses is determined in Section 4.2, and a comparison to scattered light is made in Section 4.3. Our results are summarized in Section 5.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08953v1,Intermediate mass T Tauri disk masses and a comparison to their Herbig disk descendants,"Context. Herbig disks are the prime sites for the formation of massive exoplanets, so looking into the precursors of these disks can give us clues in planet formation timescales. The precursors of Herbig stars are called Intermediate Mass T Tauri (IMTT) stars, which have spectral types later than F, but stellar masses between 1.5 and 5 M_{\odot}, and will eventually become Herbig stars with spectral types of A and B.Aims. The aim of this work is to obtain the dust and gas masses and radii of all IMTT disks with ALMA archival data. The obtained disk masses are then compared to Herbig disks and T Tauri disks and the obtained disks sizes to those of Herbig disks.Methods. ALMA Band 6 and 7 archival data are obtained for 34 IMTT disks with continuum observations, 32 of which have at least \ce^12CO, \ce^13CO, or \ceC^18O observations although most of them at quite shallow integrations. The disk integrated flux together with a stellar luminosity scaled disk temperature are used to obtain a total disk dust mass by assuming optically thin emission. Using thermochemical Dust And LInes (DALI) models from previous work, we additionally obtain gas masses of 10/35 of the IMTT disks based on the CO isotopologues. From the disk masses and sizes cumulative distributions are obtained.Results. The IMTT disks in this study have the same dust mass and radius distributions as Herbig disks. The dust mass of the IMTT disks is higher compared to that of the T Tauri disks, as is also found for the Herbig disks. No differences in dust mass are found for group I versus group II disks, in contrast to Herbig disks. The disks for which a gas mass could be determined show similar high mass disks as for the Herbig disks. Comparing the disk dust and gas mass distributions to the mass distribution of exoplanets shows that there also is not enough dust mass in disks around intermediate mass stars to form the massive exoplanets. On the other hand there is more than enough gas to form the atmospheres of exoplanets.Conclusions. We conclude that the sampled IMTT disk population is almost indistinguishable compared to Herbig disks, as their disk masses are the same, even though these are younger objects. Based on this, we conclude that planet formation is already well on its way in these objects, and thus planet formation should start early on in the lifetime of Herbig disks. Combined with our findings on the group I and group II disks, we conclude that most disks around intermediate mass pre-main sequence stars converge quickly to small disks unless prevented by a massive exoplanet.","Herbig disks are planet-forming disks around pre main-sequence stars called Herbig stars characterized by spectral types of B, A, and F, and stellar masses of 1.5 M_{\odot} to 10 M_{\odot} (e.g., Herbig, 1960; Brittain et al., 2023). These disks are the precursors of famous directly imaged planetary systems such as HR 8799 (Marois et al., 2008, 2010), \beta Pic (Lagrange et al., 2010), and 51 Eri (Chauvin et al., 2017), and host some of the first kinematically detected planets (Pinte et al., 2018; Izquierdo et al., 2023). How these planets have formed is not known, but we do know from exoplanet statistics that the prevalence of giant planets is highest around intermediate mass stars (e.g., Johnson et al., 2007, 2010; Nielsen et al., 2019; Fulton et al., 2021). Comparing dust structures and planet occurrence rates indeed shows a positive correlation between the two, and an increase in the prevalence of dust structures with stellar mass (van der Marel & Mulders, 2021). Hence, Herbig disks are an important piece of the planet formation puzzle. Figure 1: An HR-diagram of the Herbig star sample of S22, and the compiled IMTT sample in this work. The effective temperatures and luminosities are taken from Vioque et al. (2018) and Valegård et al. (2021) for the Herbig stars and IMTT stars respectively. Pre-main sequence tracks of different intermediate mass stars, and an isochrone of 2.5 Myr as the dashed line, are shown from Marigo et al. (2017). Figure 2: Histogram of the spectral types (left panel) and stellar masses (right panel) of the IMTTs in this work (from Valegård et al., 2021) compared to the Herbig star sample of S22 and references therein, and the surveys of Lupus (Ansdell et al., 2016) and Upper Sco (Barenfeld et al., 2016). However, Herbig disks are generally quite old (a median age of 6 Myr for Herbig Ae stars, Vioque et al. 2018), many showing structures indicative of planet formation making these some of the most famous and best investigated disks (e.g., HD 100546, HD 163296, MWC 480; Fedele et al. 2017; Teague et al. 2018; Öberg et al. 2021; Booth et al. 2023). Planets may already form early on in the lifetime of the disk, as there is an apparent lack of solids in class II disks to form the observed family of giant exoplanets (Manara et al., 2018; Tychoniec et al., 2020), and structures are already visible in earlier stages (ALMA Partnership et al., 2015; Segura-Cox et al., 2020). While the recent ALMA large program eDisk (Ohashi et al., 2023) does not show as many substructures in class 0 and class I objects as expected, possibly because these structures have not formed yet or have high continuum optical depth, planetesimals, i.e., planets’ building blocks, are likely to already form in these younger objects (e.g., Dr\każkowska & Dullemond, 2018). Hence, these younger objects can still give us insights into planet formation timescales. In total around 380 Herbig stars are known (Vioque et al., 2018; Wichittanakom et al., 2020; Guzmán-Díaz et al., 2021; Vioque et al., 2022). In addition, around 1500 more Herbig candidates have been identified by Vioque et al. (2020), so the total population size is expected to be much larger. A recent compilation of all available ALMA archival data out to Orion (\sim 450 pc) has shown that these Herbig disks are more massive in dust mass than the disks around their lower stellar mass counterparts (with spectral type F and later, and a stellar mass of \lesssim 1.5 M_{\odot}) called T Tauri stars (Stapper et al., 2022). This could naturally result in the higher prevalence of giant exoplanets around higher mass stars (e.g., Johnson et al., 2010). Moreover, work by Stapper et al. (2024) indicates that the Herbig disks are much warmer compared to T Tauri disks, causing less CO freeze-out and reprocessing in Herbig disks, consistent with thermo-chemical models (Bosman et al., 2018). This makes CO a viable mass tracer in Herbig disks. However, due to the relatively horizontal pre main-sequence evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, there are intermediate mass objects which were not part of the analysis of Stapper et al. (2022, 2024) which have the same stellar mass as Herbig stars but a spectral type later than F. These are called Intermediate mass T Tauri (IMTT) stars, the precursors of Herbig stars, with spectral types of F to K3 and stellar masses between 1.5 and 5 M_{\odot}, which look like T Tauri stars but have an intermediate mass star (Calvet et al., 2004; Valegård et al., 2021). This is shown in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram in Fig 1 in which the difference in effective temperatures can be seen between the Herbig stars and IMTT stars. As a reference the 2.5 Myr isochrone is shown, which clearly indicates that the IMTT stars are younger than their Herbig star descendants, though the ages can be relatively uncertain. Valegård et al. (2021) has compiled a sample of 49 IMTTs based on optical photometry. All stars within 500 pc with spectral types ranging from F0 to K3, and with a stellar luminosity of at least 2.1 L_{\odot} (i.e., M_{\star}\geq 1.5 M_{\odot}) were selected. The resulting sample, while not as young as class I objects, has a median age of 4 Myr, ranging from 0.3 Myr to 9 Myr, based on isochrones. We note that, like the Herbig disks, the IMTT disks are likely biased towards the high accretors and brightest disks (see, e.g., Figure 1 of Grant et al. 2023). A millimeter study into this sample will give insight into the evolution of the dust and gas around these intermediate mass objects. A significant fraction of the IMTTs compiled by Valegård et al. (2021) has ALMA millimeter observations. In this work we compile the available ALMA data and compare the obtained dust masses to previous works of Herbig disks (Stapper et al., 2022, hereafter S22), and gas masses to Herbig disks (Stapper et al., 2024, hereafter S24), and to T Tauri disks (e.g., Ansdell et al., 2016, 2017; Barenfeld et al., 2016; van Terwisga et al., 2020, 2022; Manara et al., 2023). In Section 2 the data selection and reduction procedures are set out. In Section 3 we explore if new models are needed compared to the DALI (Bruderer et al., 2012; Bruderer, 2013) thermochemical models run for Herbig disks in S24, which can then be used to determine the gas masses from the CO observations. In Section 4 we show the resulting continuum and gas images in §4.1 and §4.2 respectively, obtain a dust mass and dust radius distribution and compare these to previous works in §4.3, and obtain the gas masses and radii in §4.4 and compare these to previous works. We discuss these results in Section 5, in the context of the Meeus et al. (2001) groups and the evolution of disks around intermediate mass stars in §5.1, and discuss the implications on planet formation around intermediate mass stars in §5.2. Lastly, Section 6 summarizes our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08921v1,"The equilibrium configurations of neutron stars in the optimized f(R,T) gravity","We construct equilibrium configurations for neutron stars using a specific f(R,T) functional form, recently derived through gaussian process applied to measurements of the Hubble parameter. By construction, this functional form serves as an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration, circumventing the cosmological constant problem. Here, we aim to examine its applicability within the stellar regime. In doing so, we seek to contribute to the modified gravity literature by applying the same functional form of a given gravity theory across highly distinct regimes. Our results demonstrate that equilibrium configurations of neutron stars can be obtained within this theory, with the energy density and maximum mass slightly exceeding those predicted by General Relativity. Additionally, we show that the value of some parameters in the f(R,T) functional form must differ from those obtained in cosmological configurations, suggesting a potential scale-dependence for these parameters. We propose that further studies apply this functional form across different regimes to more thoroughly assess this possible dependence. Keywords: tov equation; neutron stars; modified gravity","Modified gravity is a highly active area of research in physics, as it has the potential to explain the cosmic acceleration without relying on the cosmological constant. The advantage of that is the evasion of the infamous cosmological constant problem, which is the tremendous discrepancy between the theoretically predicted and observed values of the vacuum energy density [1, 2, 3, 4]. The operational framework of modified gravity is outlined in the following. General Relativity field equations in the presence of the cosmological constant can be obtained from the variation of the following action S=\frac{1}{16\pi}\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}(R-2\Lambda)+\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\mathcal% {L}_{m}, (1) in which g is the metric determinant, R is the Ricci or curvature scalar, \Lambda is the cosmological constant, \mathcal{L}_{m} is the matter lagrangian density and natural units are assumed. Modified gravity (usually) neglects \Lambda and substitutes R by a function of it, namely, f(R), and even of other scalars. The variation of these augmented actions yields field equations with extra terms in comparison with General Relativity field equations, and those extra terms may be capable of explaining the cosmic acceleration in accordance with observations. Some successful examples of that are presented, e.g., in [5, 6, 7, 8]. The extra terms of the modified gravity field equations must be negligible in regimes where General Relativity is already probed. In other words, for a modified gravity theory to be acceptable, it must converge to the results of General Relativity in the regimes where the latter has already been experimentally validated. Some severe solar system constraints were put to modified gravity in [9, 10, 11]. It is an unpleasant current feature of modified gravity theory applications that usually there is no concern with the behaviour of a particular model in different regimes of application. That is, when one applies a particular modified gravity to a particular field of applications (equilibrium configurations of compact objects, solar system, galactic dynamics, structure formation, cosmological models etc.), there is usually no consideration of the outcomes obtained in the remaining applications. Let us exemplify such an argumentation in the following. In a paper by Capozziello and collaborators [12], the rotation curves of 15 low surface brightness galaxies were examined, showing no need for dark matter, in the f(R)=f_{0}R^{n} gravity, with f_{0} a constant that accounts for the correct units and n=3.5. Later, Faraoni showed that in order for the scalar field in the scalar-tensor version of R^{n} gravity to be non-tachyonic, one must have 1\leq n\leq 2 [13]. More dramatically, by writing n=1+\delta, the precession of the perihelion of Mercury yields \delta=(2.7\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-19} [14, 15, 16], a stringent limit often ignored in R^{n} gravity (check References [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], among others). Allemandi and Ruggiero have written a quite interesting paper in which they use gravitational redshift, light deflection, gravitational time-delay and geodesic precession to constrain different f(R) gravity models [25]. Remarkably, they obtained that the estimated values of the f(R) functional form parameters are orders of magnitude bigger than the values obtained in the cosmological framework. As one would expect, this is not a feature of f(R) gravity theory only. Exactly motivated by severe weak field constraints on f(R) theory that, as a matter of fact, rule out most of the suggested models [26, 27, 32, 28, 29, 30, 31], Harko and collaborators proposed the f(R,T) gravity theory [33], for which T is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The motivations to insert terms on T in the gravitational action will be provided next. For now, let us mention that the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation was derived for the first time for the f(R,T) gravity in [34]. The functional form chosen for f(R,T) was f(R,T)=R+2\lambda T, with constant \lambda, and such a constant presented different values - around one order of magnitude - when solutions were obtained for neutron stars and strange stars, being lower in the former case. Later, the same approach was applied to white dwarfs and a lower limit for \lambda was found, namely |\lambda|>3\times 10^{-4} [35]. The examples on the above regard are numerous and spread to several modified gravity theories. They point to an incoherence in the results of a given theory when applied to different regimes or to a hidden scale-dependence of these “constants”. It is the purpose of the present article to verify the neutron stars equilibrium configurations viability of a particular functional form of the f(R,T) gravity which is well succeeded, by construction, in the cosmological scenario. We will work with the functional form found by Fortunato et al. [36]. In [36], the f(R,T) functional form was constructed through gaussian process [37], that was applied through the use of a series of measurements of the Hubble parameter. The result obtained was f(T)=\alpha T^{2}+A\tanh[\lambda(T+T_{0})]+\beta T+\gamma. (2) More details on this result as well as the values obtained for the constants \alpha,A,\lambda,T_{0},\beta and \gamma will be given in the following. The article is organized as follows. In Section II we present the basis of the f(R,T) gravity. In Section III, we derive the TOV-like equation. In Section IV we present our results, which are obtained by particularizing f(T) as according to Eq.(2). Those are discussed in Section V, in which we also provide some perspectives for applications of (2)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08837v1,A massive white dwarf or low-mass neutron star discovered by LAMOST,"We report the discovery of a close binary J0606+2132 (Gaia DR3 3423365496448406272) with P_{\rm obs}=2.77 days containing a possible massive white dwarf or a neutron star using the LAMOST spectroscopic data. By a joint fitting of the radial velocity from LAMOST and the light curve from TESS, we derived a circular Keplerian orbit with an inclination of i=81.31∘{}^{+6.26^{\circ}}_{-7.85^{\circ}}, which is consistent with that derived from v{\rm sin}i. Together with the mass of the visible star, we derived the mass of the invisible object to be 1.34{}^{+0.35}_{-0.40}M_{\odot}. Spectral disentangling with the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra shows no absorption feature from an additional component, suggesting the presence of a compact object. No X-ray or radio pulsed signal is detected from ROSAT and FAST archive observations. J0606+2132 could evolve into either a Type Ia supernova or a neutron star through accretion-induced collapse if it is a white dwarf, or into an intermediate-mass X-ray binary if it is a neutron star.","Radial velocity (RV) monitoring method has been widely applied to detect compact objects. Compared to the traditional X-ray method, the RV method can detect quiescent compact objects in binaries, which comprise the majority of binary systems including compact companions in the universe. Recently, the RV method has found about 10 X-ray quiescent black hole (BH) candidates (e.g., Casares et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2019; Shenar et al., 2022; Mahy et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024), which is about half the number of BHs discovered by X-rays over the past 60 years. A sample of star-white dwarf (WD) and star-neutron star (NS) binaries have also been discovered through the RV method (e.g., Li et al., 2022; Mazeh et al., 2022; Yi et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2024a, b). For binaries including an early-type star, the large mass of the early-type star implies a massive companion, even if the system has a small binary mass function. Thus, these binaries are promising targets for the search for massive compact objects, such as massive WDs, NSs, and BHs. Recently, RV monitoring has identified several systems containing a massive compact object and an early-type star (e.g., Casares et al., 2014; Khokhlov et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2022; Mahy et al., 2022; Shenar et al., 2022). The discovery of more compact objects can help to construct a comprehensive mass distribution, which is essential for advancing our understanding of binary evolution. Based on data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), we conducted a campaign to search for compact objects hidden in binaries including early-type stars. This search utilized several catalogs of early-type stars (Shridharan et al., 2021; Xiang et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2022) that were constructed using LAMOST spectra. First, we cross-matched these catalogs with LAMOST DR9 low-resolution and medium-resolution general catalogs. Second, we focused on the sources which have more than two LAMOST medium-resolution spectral observations with r-band signal-to-noise ratio (S/Nr) greater than 5 and show clear RV variation. Finally, we identified a close binary Gaia ID 3423365496448406272 (R.A. = 91.7051933o; Decl. = 21.5425898o; hereafter J0606+2132) which has a large binary mass function, suggesting the possible presence of a compact object. This source has been recognized as a binary system in several studies (Zhang et al., 2021, 2022; Tian et al., 2020), but its properties haven’t been investigated in detail. Additionally, Liu et al. (2024) proposed J0606+2132 as a compact object candidate based on its RV variation. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we detail the spectroscopic and photometric observations. Section 3 presents stellar information of the visible star, including the distance, atmospheric parameters, and the mass, etc. In Section 4, we estimate the systematic information of J0606+2132 through RV fitting and light curve (LC) fitting. Section 5 discusses the nature of the companion and gives possible evolution scenarios for J0606+2132. Finally, we provide a summary in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08827v1,"ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP): 
Nested Morphological and Kinematic Structures of Outflows Revealed in SiO and CO Emission","The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP) reveals complex nested morphological and kinematic features of molecular outflows through the CO (J=2-1) and SiO (J=5-4) emission. We characterize the jet and outflow kinematics of the ALMASOP sample in four representative sources (HOPS 10, 315, 358, and G203.21-11.20W2) through channel maps and position–velocity diagrams (PVDs) parallel and transverse to the outflow axes. The combined CO and SiO emission exhibits the coexistence of the conventional extremely–high-velocity (EHV) jets and shell-like low-velocity (LV) cavity walls and new features. More complex, nested bubble-like and filamentary structures in the images and channel maps, triangle-shaped regions near the base of the parallel PVDs, and regions composed of rhombus/oval shapes in the transverse PVDs, are also evident. Such features find natural explanations within the bubble structure of the unified model of jet, wind, and ambient medium. The reverse shock cavity is revealed on the PVD base regions, and other features naturally arise within the dynamic postshock region of magnetic interaction. The finer nested shells observed within the compressed wind region reveal previously unnoticed shocked emission between the jet and the conventional large cavity walls. These pseudopulse-produced filamentary features connect to the jet-like knotty blobs, creating an impression of episodicity in mass ejection. SiO emission is enhanced downstream of the reverse shock boundary, with jet-like excitation conditions. Combined, these observed features reveal the extended structures induced by the magnetic interplay between a jet-bearing magnetized wide-angle wind and its ambient magnetized surrounding medium.","Molecular outflows from young stellar objects (YSOs) are probes of the stellar vicinity and its immediate surrounding environment through the interaction between the jets, winds, and ambient medium. Observed around Class 0 to early Class II YSOs, molecular outflows exist across the evolutionary stages of star formation with various morphological and kinematic properties (e.g., Arce & Sargent, 2006). Interferometric observations have been used to reveal the morphological and kinematic structures within molecular outflows. Molecular outflows observed in CO emission are often dissected into roughly two morphologically distinct components when viewed through channel maps: a shell-like wide-angle outflow lobe in lower velocity channels surrounding jet-like emission in the highest velocity channels. Such a conventional jet–shell structure has been revealed in several Class 0/I outflow sources by the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA), including HH 211 (Gueth & Guilloteau, 1999; Palau et al., 2006), IRAS 04166+2706 (Santiago-García et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2014), and L1448C-N (Hirano et al., 2010). The jet-like structure is often referred to as the extremely–high-velocity (EHV) component, and the outer shell structure is referred to as the low-velocity (LV) component, which, along with the intermediate-velocity (IV) wing, is part of the standard–high-velocity (SHV) component of the molecular outflow (Bachiller, 1996; Bally, 2016; Tafalla et al., 2010). Spectroscopically, the LV component has a profile peaked close to the systemic velocity with the IV wing toward higher velocities, whereas the EHV component usually demonstrates a distinct peak. The EHV jet typically exhibits higher density than the IV wing in that the SiO transitions tend to be present in the EHV jet but absent in the IV wing (Tafalla et al., 2010). Detailed analyses of jet and outflow signatures require careful consideration of features produced by the EHV jet, the LV outflow cavities, and the intermediate regions connecting the two. With higher sensitivity and resolution, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revealed more complex kinematic features in the outflow lobes. These structures include multiple molecular layered features shown in Class 0/I sources (e.g., Plunkett et al., 2015; Tafalla, 2017; Lee et al., 2018) and low-velocity molecular outflows from Class I/II sources with known optical jets (e.g., Louvet et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; de Valon et al., 2020; Güdel et al., 2018). Such complex kinematics have provoked subsequent investigations and examinations as to how they can be consistently interpreted. From a theoretical perspective, Shu et al. (1991) extended our understanding of the nature of these molecular outflows by predicting the morphology and kinematics of outflows driven by a spherically distributed radial wind with a fundamental momentum-conserving law, yielding a momentum-conserving thin shell with a “Hubble-law” velocity pattern. Alternatively, a jet-driven mechanism was proposed to account for outflows with large length-to-width ratios. Lee et al. (2001) found reasonable results by fitting these kinematic properties of a hydrodynamic thin shell driven by both a wind and a pure cylindrical jet against radio observations. The unified model of bipolar outflows developed by Shang et al. (2006) naturally produces the features expected in the jet-driven and the wind-driven momentum-conserving shells. In the new framework of the magnetic interplay between magnetized winds and ambient toroids advanced by Shang et al. (2020), combinations within the parameter space of the wind magnetization (in terms of Alfvénic Mach number of the wind M_{\mathrm{A}}), ambient toroid flattening n, and ambient magnetization produce systematic nested kinematic and morphological features, for which Shang et al. (2023b) advanced a wide variety of kinematic features potentially observable within molecular outflows resulting from the interplay. Position–velocity diagrams (PVDs) parallel and transverse to the outflow axis are determined to be especially powerful in probing the key kinematic features predicted in Shang et al. (2023b), and for probing mixing of the entrained ambient material with the pristine wind in the shocked region (Shang et al., 2020). Ai et al. (2024) demonstrated how the multiple velocity components of HH 30 observed at both optical and radio wavelengths can be unified through an inner atomic wind interacting with the ambient surroundings without the requirement to invoke a separate slow molecular wind. The ALMA 12CO channel maps of the HH 30 outflow system show multiple filamentary structures surrounding the EHV optical jet. The observations also reveal nested kinematics of layered velocity components as intersecting ovals on the transverse PV diagrams, predicted in Shang et al. (2023b). The low-velocity \sim 5 {{\mathrm{\,km}}{\mathrm{\,s}}^{-1}} CO emission is therefore taken to be the ambient material mixed into the outflow lobe by the high-velocity \sim 100 {{\mathrm{\,km}}{\mathrm{\,s}}^{-1}} wide-angle magnetized atomic wind, with the velocity differences mainly due to the density contrast between the wind and surroundings together entrained via momentum-conserving shell formation. This work utilizes channel maps and position–velocity diagrams to investigate the morphological and kinematic properties of a selected sample of outflows from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP, Dutta et al., 2020). ALMASOP covers the Orion A/B and \lambda-Orionis regions and provides an unbiased survey of Class 0 and I sources, all at a similar distance of \sim 400{\mathrm{\,pc}}. An overview of the survey, including the properties of 1.3 mm continua and detection and identification of outflows through 12CO and SiO, has been summarized by Dutta et al. (2020). Subsequent analyses of the dataset have been performed on aspects including chemistry, hot corinos, and multiplicity (e.g., Hsu et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2022; Sahu et al., 2023). A series of outflow studies have also been undertaken for this sample, including detection and analysis of SiO jets from likely the earliest Class 0 phase and the late Class I phase (Dutta et al., 2022a, b) and analysis of 6 SiO jets with distinct knot structure along the jet allowing the derivation of inclination angles, jet velocities, and potential ejection periods (Jhan et al., 2022; Dutta et al., 2024). The outline of this work is as follows. Section 2 summarizes the properties of the ALMASOP dataset and the analyses performed. Section 3 demonstrates the properties of four representative outflow sources in the ALMASOP sample in both CO and SiO emission by identifying the morphological and kinematic features in the outflow lobes. Section 4 discusses the implication and interpretation of the outflow kinematic structures. A historical account of the theory and simulation aspects of molecular outflows is provided in Section 4.1. The advancement of the unified wind-blown bubble model and its applications to the observed features are discussed in Section 4.2, starting with a recapitulation of the selected samples in 4.2.1. Its insight to the previously unnoticed signature of the reverse-shock cavity and to the nested kinematic signatures are discussed in Sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3. Section 4.2.4 discusses the origins of the SiO emission in embedded young stellar systems. Section 4.2.5 discusses the appearance of apparent and real episodicity in molecular outflows using this subset of the ALMASOP sample as examples. Next, Section 4.3 discusses the problems of applying the conventional pictures of thin-shell, jet-driven, and wind-driven outflow models, and discusses the difficulties of the alternative slow wind model. Section 4.4 concludes the discussion with prospective to the broader ensemble of ALMASOP outflows. Section 5 summarizes our findings."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08801v1,Identifying Spicules in Mg II: Statistics and Comparisons with H\alpha,"The Sun’s chromosphere is a critical region to understand when considering energy and mass deposition into the transition region and corona, but many of the smaller, faster events which transport a portion of this mass and energy are still difficult to observe, identify and model. Solar Spicules are small, spike-like events in the solar chromosphere that have the potential to transfer energy and mass to the transition region, but whose energetic origins are still being researched. Chromospheric spicule activity on-disk can be identified by observing temporary excursions in the red and blue wings of chromospheric emission lines. Researchers have demonstrated this in Hydrogen Alpha (H\alpha, 6563 Å), Ca ii (8542 Å, k 3934 Å), Mg ii (h 2803 Å, k 2796 Å), and Si iv (1394 Å, 1405 Å) spectral observations, with the vast majority of identification efforts focused on lower chromospheric observations of H\alpha and Ca ii. Because any spicules which deposit mass and energy into the transition region must necessarily pass through the upper chromosphere, observations from this region such as Mg ii or Hydrogen Lyman Alpha (Ly\alpha 1216 Å) in enough quantity to perform proper statistics will be critical to fully characterizing spicules’ impact on mass and energy transfer in the Sun. This research proposes a definition with numerical limits for how spicules appear in Mg ii wavelengths, tunes an algorithm for automatically detecting spicules in Mg ii spectral observations, and uses K Means Clustering to identify and display the full range of spicule spectrum shapes. This work will help allow statistical studies on spicules in the upper chromosphere to be as thorough as those of the lower chromosphere, allowing researchers to better understand the physical nature of spicules and their role in energy transfer and deposition in the solar atmosphere.","The Sun’s chromosphere is a region which is highly dynamic on all scales and has historically been difficult to study. This region changes from being plasma dominated (\beta>1) with strong flows and convection re-arranging the magnetic field, to being magnetic field dominated (\beta<1) where magnetic fields define structures, plasma volumes, and movements. In addition, all energy which heats the inexplicably-hot corona passes through this region to be deposited at its upper boundary in the transition region, where the majority of the temperature change takes place. Modeling the magnetic field is critical to understanding and predicting the trajectory for CMEs and the risks of SEPs and solar flares, while modeling plasma and energy movement are critical to understanding the source of coronal heating. One current issue facing researchers is the inability to fully recreate solar spicules in modeling efforts. Spicules are fine, hair-like features on the Sun extending from the top of the photosphere up into the chromosphere, sometimes reaching as far as the solar transition region (TR). They are spikes of hot plasma enclosed within magnetic flux tubes which carry mass and energy up from the photosphere. We know that some spicules reach the TR to deposit their mass and energy while others do not, but we do not know how often this happens or how much mass and energy are deposited. A number of models have investigated spicule formation energy sources including Alfvén waves Cranmer & Woolsey (2015); Iijima & Yokoyama (2017), shocks and wave action Sterling et al. (2010); De Pontieu et al. (2004a), magnetic tension Martínez-Sykora et al. (2017), and magnetic reconnection Ding et al. (2011); Shelyag et al. (2018). Several groups have been studying spicule-like features in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models Martínez-Sykora et al. (2017); Chintzoglou et al. (2018); González-Avilés et al. (2020); Dover et al. (2020); Srivastava et al. (2023) This includes two groups that have managed to simulate solar spicules in MHD models, but the drivers behind those efforts differ. Martínez-Sykora et al. (2017) found that including ambipolar diffusion created long, finger-like structures in the model results which seemed to agree with Ly\alpha observations by Chintzoglou et al. (2018). On the other hand, Iijima & Yokoyama (2017) formed spicule-like structures in their model, concluding that Lorentz forces as opposed to heating drove spicule formation. Rapid time cadence upper chromospheric observations have the potential to differentiate between the models. There have been many studies of on-disk solar spicules, but the vast majority focused on observations in the lower chromosphere with more than 45,000 identifications in H\alpha (6563 Å) and Ca ii (8542 Å) (Hansteen et al., 2006; De Pontieu et al., 2007; Rouppe van der Voort et al., 2007; Langangen et al., 2008; Vourlidas et al., 2016; Rouppe van der Voort et al., 2009; Sekse et al., 2012, 2013b; Yurchyshyn et al., 2013; Rouppe van der Voort & de la Cruz Rodriguez, 2013; Sekse et al., 2013a; Yurchyshyn et al., 2014; Rouppe van der Voort et al., 2015; Henriques et al., 2016; Shetye et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2016; Lipartito et al., 2014; Skogsrud et al., 2016; Bose et al., 2019; Samanta et al., 2019; De Pontieu et al., 2009; Rutten et al., 2019; De Pontieu et al., 2011; Yurchyshyn et al., 2020; Sterling et al., 2020; Dover et al., 2020; Nived et al., 2022; Vilangot Nhalil et al., 2022; Chaurasiya et al., 2024; Bose et al., 2021a, 2019), while a few hundred spicules had been identified in upper chromospheric Mg ii (2796.34 Å, 2803.52 Å) and Ly\alpha (1215.67 Å) or TR Si iv (1403 Å) observations (Tian et al., 2014; Rouppe van der Voort et al., 2015; Skogsrud et al., 2016; Henriques et al., 2016; Bose et al., 2019; Narang et al., 2016; Chintzoglou et al., 2018, 2021; Vilangot Nhalil et al., 2022; Chaurasiya et al., 2024; Bose et al., 2023). This has resulted in a relative lack of spicule examples in the upper chromosphere, a region which is critical to our understanding of how energy and mass are deposited into the TR. However, Herde et al. (2023) (hereafter referred to as Paper I) demonstrated the feasibility of a new untuned method for using Mg ii observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph [IRIS] De Pontieu et al. (2014a) to identify a large number of on-disk upper-chromospheric spicule identifications for the purpose of statistical studies. This research builds on that paper by setting out the limits for how spicules appear in Mg ii spectra, tuning the method, and applying it to a greater range of datasets. With access to large-scale Mg ii spicule identifications, researchers can use this to understand how spicules evolve as they fade out of traditional H\alpha and Ca ii observations and into hotter, higher emissions. This information would help close the observational gap between the lower chromosphere and the transition region, allowing for a more full understanding of solar spicules’ energetic interactions with that boundary layer. 1.1 Spicules Spicules are small, ubiquitous, jet-like features in the solar chromosphere which, when observed on the solar limb (edge), look like slender threads sticking out from the Sun’s surface Roberts (1945). Physically, they are upflowing or downflowing streams of plasma constrained within small magnetic flux tubes above the Sun’s surface. They were first identified on the solar limb by Italian priest and astronomer Angelo Secchi in 1871 Secchi (1871) and have since been matched to their disk-counterparts called Rapid Blueshift/Redshift Excursions (RBEs/RREs) Langangen et al. (2008); Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2009); Sekse et al. (2012). RREs and RBEs are so named because they appear to redshift or blueshift the spectral line wing for a short period of time. Their importance in impacting the dynamics of the solar atmosphere has long been recognized (Beckers, 1968, 1972) and they have formed a part of numerous reviews such as Beckers (1968, 1972), Roberts (1945), and more recently Tsiropoula et al. (2012). Spicules are found in both active and quiet regions on the Sun(Athay & Holzer, 1982; De Pontieu et al., 2011), and estimates suggest that there are more than a million spicules on the Sun at any given time (Beckers, 1972). Over the past 20 years, a great deal of detail has emerged on their spectral and general characteristics (e.g. De Pontieu et al., 2004a; De Pontieu et al., 2007; Rouppe van der Voort et al., 2009; Sekse et al., 2012; Yurchyshyn et al., 2013; Bose et al., 2019, 2021b; Bate et al., 2022; Bose et al., 2023), thanks primarily to the development of high resolution ground-based and space-based telescopes that achieve a spatial resolution better than 0.1′′. The interest in their study was massively revived after seeing-free, high-cadence observations were made possible by the Hinode spacecraft Tsuneta et al. (2008). The original spicules observed (now called Type I, also referred to as dynamic fibrils or mottles) are longer in duration (3-5 min) and less energetic than their later-discovered counterparts. Dynamic fibrils appear primarily in active regions Pereira et al. (2012) while mottles are their quiet sun counterparts Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2007). Type I spicules receive energy from the leakage of photospheric oscillations (p-modes) which steepen into shocks in the chromosphere De Pontieu et al. (2004b); Hansteen et al. (2006). Later, in 2007, De Pontieu et al. (2007) discovered a new class of spicules called Type II. These spicules are shorter-lived (1-3 min), highly dynamic, and appear more often in regions of quiet Sun and coronal holes De Pontieu et al. (2007); Pereira et al. (2012). Unlike the Type-Is, the origin of Type II spicules is still debated, with magnetic reconnection Ding et al. (2011), non-linear propagation of Alfvénic waves Matsumoto & Shibata (2010) and release of amplified magnetic tension through ambipolar diffusion Martínez-Sykora et al. (2017) being the prime candidates. As spicules evolve, their changing temperature shifts them into and out of different elemental spectral emission lines. H\alpha and Ca ii emissions form lower in the chromosphere and at cooler temperatures while Mg ii h 2803.52 Å and k 2796.34 Å emissions and Ly\alpha 1215.67 Å form higher in the chromosphere and at higher temperatures Leenaarts et al. (2013). This means if a spicule is heated, it is first detectable in H\alpha and Ca ii wavelengths, and may then switch into emitting at Mg ii, Ly\alpha, or even transition region Si iv wavelengths at high enough temperatures. This was discovered when Type II spicules were first identified and researchers noticed that they would appear to “fade” during their evolution. This rapid fading was correctly perceived as a sign of heating and/or opacity changes during their evolution, and was confirmed after the launch of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS; De Pontieu et al., 2014b) mission, where the fading Ca ii H spicules subsequently appeared in the hotter Mg ii ultraviolet and sometimes Si iv passbands Pereira et al. (2014). Over the course of these studies, Type II spicules were sometimes found to be heated to TR Pereira et al. (2014); Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2015) and even coronal temperatures De Pontieu et al. (2011); Henriques et al. (2016); Samanta et al. (2019) and a study by (Samanta et al., 2019) found that most spicules observed in a quiet sun region appeared to transfer hot plasma into the corona, supporting similar observations of active regions De Pontieu et al. (2011); Ji et al. (2012). These properties make them a potential candidate that can contribute to the energy balance of the Sun’s outer atmosphere. Understanding spicule activity in the upper chromosphere, including how often lower-chromospheric spicules reach all the way through to the TR, is critical in being able to fully describe how spicules contribute mass and energy to the Sun’s upper atmosphere and to modeling their associated magnetic field behavior. With the tools to easily identify thousands of spicules across multiple datasets, researchers will be able to better study upper-chromospheric activity for comparison with much better understood lower-chromospheric activity."

The primary aim is to use a rapid spectral-fitting method, specifically the spectral emulator with the grouping optimization strategy, to create a comprehensive catalog for stars of all types within LAMOST, addressing the shortcomings in parameter estimations for both cold and hot stars present in the official LAMOST AFGKM-type catalog. This effort is part of our series of studies dedicated to establishing an empirical spectral library for LAMOST. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effectively applicable to parameter prediction for LAMOST, with the single-machine processing time within 70 hr. We observed that the internal error dispersions for T_{\text{eff}}, log g, [Fe/H], and [\alpha/Fe] across different spectral types lie within the ranges of 15-594 K, 0.03-0.27 dex, 0.02-0.10 dex, and 0.01-0.04 dex, respectively, indicating a good consistency. A comparative analysis with external data highlighted deficiencies in the official LAMOST catalog and issues with MaStar parameters, as well as potential limitations of our method in processing spectra with strong emission lines and bad pixels. The derived atmospheric parameters as a part of this work are available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101402/.","A main task of modern astrophysics is to understand when and how galaxies formed and evolved. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, offers a unique opportunity to study galaxies in considerable detail by measuring and analyzing the properties of stars (Jurić et al., 2008; Ivezić et al., 2008). The principal properties of stars, such as effective temperature (T_{\text{eff}}), surface gravity (log g), metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the abundance of alpha elements with respect to iron ([\alpha/Fe]), can be measured from spectra. At present, more and more large surveys, such as the Radial Velocity Experiment (Steinmetz et al. 2006), the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE; Yanny et al. 2009), the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST; Zhao et al. 2012; Cui et al. 2012; Luo et al. 2015), the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (De Silva et al. 2015), the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE; Majewski et al. 2017), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS; Almeida et al. 2023), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI; DESI Collaboration et al. 2016a, 2016b; Abareshi et al. 2022), Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2023), the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer (Jin et al. 2023b), the Multi-Object Optical and Near-infrared Spectrograph (Cirasuolo et al. 2020), the upcoming the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (de Jong et al. 2022), the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST; Gong et al. 2019), provide a large amount of spectra to help us understand the evolution and chemical formation of the Milky Way and even the Universe. These large surveys have been specially designed to yield full sets of atmospheric parameters for a wide variety of stars, and the methods for constructing spectral emulators 111Spectral Emulator: A method using machine learning to map stellar parameters to spectra (Czekala et al., 2015; Tabernero et al., 2022). based on theoretical and empirical spectral libraries are the most widely used spectroscopic techniques for determining stellar atmospheric parameters. Their widespread adoption is evidenced by a variety of publicly available implementations within the community. These methods are foundational to several analytical tools, including the SEGUE atmospheric parameter Pipeline (Lee et al. 2011), My God It’s Full Of Stars (Sbordone et al. 2014), the LAMOST atmospheric parameter Pipeline (LASP; Luo et al. 2015), the APOGEE atmospheric parameter and Chemical Abundance Pipeline (Pérez et al. 2016), Self-consistent ab initio Fitting of Stellar Spectra (The Payne; Ting et al. 2019), Spectrophotometric Modeling of Stars in the Gaia Era (MINESweeper; Cargile et al. 2020), the LAMOST atmospheric parameter Pipeline for M-type stars (LASPM; Du et al. 2021), and a Bayesian code to infer stellar atmospheric parameters using spectral emulators (STEPARSYN; Tabernero et al. 2022). However, the aforementioned methods have certain limitations. For instance, the spectral emulators for atmospheric parameter determination often involves \chi^{2} optimization, a process that has always been extremely time consuming, especially for millions of spectra. Furthermore, while these methods perform well in predicting parameters for FGK-type stars, catalogues have generally struggled to provide reliable parameters for stars outside of the FGK regime, such as OBA and M stars. For the LAMOST survey, such a vast data set also includes O-M-type stars, but currently, LAMOST has not officially provided atmospheric parameters for O- and B-type stars, and issues still exist in the parameters of A- and M-type stars. Considering the above problems, we used a spectral emulator based on the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) Stellar Library (MaStar; Yan et al. 2019; Abdurro’uf et al. 2022) and the new proposed strategy of grouping optimization to estimate T_{\text{eff}}, log g, [Fe/H], and [\alpha/Fe] for O-M-type stars within the LAMOST low-resolution spectra. Our spectral emulator, integrating a principal component analysis (PCA; Abdi & Williams 2010; Jolliffe & Cadima 2016) and Gaussian process regression (GPR; Rasmussen & Williams 2005), produces spectra for specified T_{\text{eff}}, log g, [Fe/H], and [\alpha/Fe]. The grouping optimization strategy was employed to achieve a balance between efficiency and accuracy in solving for the minimum \chi^{2}. Experimental results show that the combination of the spectral emulator and grouping optimization strategy yields reliable atmospheric parameter predictions while enhancing the efficiency of the spectral-fitting method, making it suitable for large-scale surveys. The measurements of LAMOST low-resolution atmospheric parameters using this approach are viable for the subsequent establishment of an empirical spectral library for LAMOST. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We introduce methodology in Section 2, including motivation and workflow. Then, we describe the data sets used in this work in Section 3. We discuss the results and compare them to those in previous works in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08492v1,Zones of Tayler Instability in Stars,"The Tayler instability (TI) of toroidal magnetic fields is a candidate mechanism for driving turbulence, angular momentum transport, and dynamo action in stellar radiative zones. Recently Skoutnev & Beloborodov (2024) revisited the linear stability analysis of a toroidal magnetic field in a rotating and stably stratified fluid. In this paper, we extend the analysis to include both thermal and compositional stratification, allowing for general application to stars. We formulate an analytical instability criterion for use as a “toggle switch” in stellar evolution codes. It determines when and where in a star the Tayler-Spruit dynamo may be responsible for angular momentum transport. We implement such a “toggle switch” in the MESA stellar evolution code and map out the stability of each mode of the TI on a grid of stellar evolution models. In evolved lower mass stars, the TI becomes suppressed in compositionally stratified regions, undermining the Tayler-Spruit dynamo as an explanation of the core-envelope coupling. In higher mass stars, the TI is active throughout the radiative zones, but at different wavenumbers than previously expected.","Angular momentum transport in the radiative zones of stars remains an important problem in stellar physics. Evolving stars experience structural adjustments and surface torques from winds that lead to differential rotation of their interiors (Maeder & Meynet, 2000; Maeder, 2008). Without redistribution of angular momentum, the compact cores of evolved stars would rotate orders of magnitude faster than their envelopes and leave behind rapidly rotating stellar remnants. By contrast, observations show relatively slow internal stellar rotation rates (Eggenberger et al., 2012; Ceillier et al., 2013; Marques et al., 2013; Den Hartogh et al., 2019; Ouazzani et al., 2019) and small initial spins of stellar remnants (Heger et al., 2005; Suijs et al., 2008; Kawaler, 2014; Hermes et al., 2017). This broadly suggests efficient transport of angular momentum in stellar interiors. The transport mechanism remains poorly understood (for a review, see Aerts et al. (2019)). Note that it has to be sustained in a broad range of radii without interruption; blocking it even in a narrow layer at some radius would isolate the core angular momentum, leaving the core with fast rotation. One possibility is turbulent transport,111Alternative processes include internal waves from nearby convection zones (Fuller et al., 2014) or large scale magnetic fields deposited from earlier stages of evolution (Kissin & Thompson, 2018; Takahashi & Langer, 2021). which operates in the presence of instabilities. However, hydrodynamic instabilities are typically inefficient and often inhibited in regions of strong compositional stratification present at the outer edge of evolving stellar cores (Heger et al., 2000). A more efficient mechanism likely invokes magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities. In particular, the Tayler instability (TI) of toroidal magnetic fields (Tayler, 1973; Spruit, 1999) is a promising MHD candidate because it develops in a stably stratified fluid more easily than other MHD instabilities (e.g. magnetic buoyancy (Acheson, 1979; Hughes, 1985; Spruit, 1999) and the magnetorotational instability (Wheeler et al., 2015; Jouve et al., 2020)). Differential rotation may naturally produce magnetic configurations prone to TI as it winds any existing radial magnetic field B_{R} into a much stronger toroidal magnetic field B_{\phi}. The instability is active in the polar regions of the rotating star, and the generated turbulence spreads from the poles toward the equatorial region along spherical shells of the fluid. It is unclear whether the generated turbulence supports a large-scale dynamo (i.e. whether it can amplify the large-scale B_{R}). However, this scenario, known as the Tayler-Spruit dynamo (Spruit, 2002), seems capable of explaining angular momentum transport. Its efficiency depends on the debated saturation level of the TI (Spruit, 2002; Fuller et al., 2019). Despite these uncertainties, angular momentum transport enabled by the TI is widely invoked as a leading explanation of the rotation rates measured in stellar interiors (Heger et al., 2005; Cantiello et al., 2014; Braithwaite & Spruit, 2017; Aerts et al., 2019; Ma & Fuller, 2019; Eggenberger et al., 2022; Schürmann et al., 2022; Rosales et al., 2024) . The linear stability analysis of the TI was recently revisited in our work Skoutnev & Beloborodov (2024) (SB24). We systematically examined each wave branch of the dispersion relation, which led to discovery of new unstable modes and revision of previously known modes. Our analysis also revealed the physical picture of the TI: instability of large-scale toroidal fields in rotating stars is mediated by microphysical diffusivities of the stellar plasma. While strong Coriolis forces hinder the TI, diffusive processes enable instability on length scales where diffusive and Coriolis timescales are comparable, allowing magnetic loops to rearrange and release magnetic energy. The TI can be enabled by the diffusion of the fluid momentum, magnetic field, temperature, and composition. The corresponding diffusivities will be denoted as \nu, \eta, \kappa_{\rm th}, and \kappa_{\mu}, respectively.222The diffusivities are determined by the local composition, temperature, and density. Generally, the thermal diffusivity (mediated by photons) is the largest, followed by the viscosity (mediated by ions and photons), and then by the compositional diffusivity (mediated by ions), so \kappa_{\rm th}>\nu>\kappa_{\mu}. The ratios Pm=\nu/\eta and Cm=\kappa_{\mu}/\eta can be smaller or larger than unity. SB24 extended the TI analysis to fluids with any magnetic Prandtl number Pm=\nu/\eta, including Pm\gg 1. The latter turns out to be the relevant limit for stars significantly more massive than the Sun, as will be shown in the present paper. In this paper, we complete the general analysis of TI in stars. First, we extend the results of SB24 to include both thermal and compositional stratification (only one type of stratification was considered in SB24) and summarize the instability criteria for each wave branch. The criteria are obtained by analytically solving for the growth rates and confirming with numerical solutions. The systematic analysis allows us to overcome some limitations of previous works. In particular, Spruit (1999) focused on stars with mass M\lesssim 1M_{\odot} where the magnetic diffusivity dominates over the viscous and compositional diffusivities. This limit is inapplicable in higher mass stars and in evolved low mass stars, where diffusivities vary by orders of magnitude across the wide range of temperatures and densities (Jermyn et al., 2022). Furthermore, the TI was previously treated with a heuristic approach based on a marginal stability calculation. It did not correctly distinguish the different wave branches of instability and, in some cases, led to incorrect identification of the wavenumbers of the most unstable modes. We also find that previous treatment of thermal+compositional stratification using an effective Brunt-Väisälä frequency (Spruit, 1999, 2002) is deficient. After formulating the new stability criteria (Section 2), we implement them in the MESA stellar evolution code (Paxton et al., 2010, 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019; Jermyn et al., 2023) and examine the onset of TI in stellar interiors (Section 3). The presence or absence of instability is of particular interest for the core-envelope transition in evolved stars. These transitional layers can act as a barrier for angular momentum transport because of strong compositional stratification left behind by nuclear shell burning. We find that TI remains unimpeded throughout stellar evolution only in sufficiently massive stars. In evolved low-mass stars, we find that the TI is inhibited by strong compositional gradients, contrary to previous expectations. This suggests that Tayler-Spruit dynamo may be unable to explain observations of strong core-envelope coupling on its own. Implications of the results are discussed in Section 4."

Discovery of Rapid and Short-Duration Prominence Eruptions,"M-dwarfs show frequent flares and associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may significantly impact close-in habitable planets. M-dwarf flares sometimes show red/blue asymmetries in the H\alpha line profile, suggesting prominence eruptions as an early stage of CMEs. However, their high-time-cadence observations are limited. We conducted spectroscopic monitoring observations of the active M-dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with \sim1 minute time cadence using the Seimei telescope, simultaneously with the optical photometric observations by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We detected 27 H\alpha flares with H\alpha energies ranging from 1.7 \times 1029 to 3.8 \times 1032 erg and durations from 8 to 319 minutes. Among them, we identified 3 blue asymmetry and 5 red asymmetry events based on criteria using the Bayesian Information Criterion. The maximum velocity of the blue- and red-shifted components ranges from 250 to 450 km s-1 and 190 to 400 km s-1, respectively. The duration and time evolution show variety, and in particular, we discovered rapid, short-duration blue/red asymmetry events with the duration of 6–8 minutes. Among the 8 blue/red asymmetry events, two blue and one red asymmetry events are interpreted as prominence eruptions because of their fast velocity and time evolution. Based on this interpretation, the lower limit of occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions can be estimated to be \sim1.1 events per day. Our discovery of short-duration events suggests that previous studies with low time cadence may have missed these events, potentially leading to an underestimation of the occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions/CMEs.","Solar and stellar flares are explosive phenomena that occur suddenly in the corona of the Sun and stars (e.g., Kowalski, 2024). They are observed as an increase in electromagnetic radiation, ranging from X-rays to radio waves. These flares are believed to be caused by the conversion of magnetic energy into kinetic and thermal energy through magnetic reconnection (Shibata & Magara, 2011). Some of the energy released in the corona is transported to the chromosphere and photosphere via heat conduction and high-energy particles. This leads to chromospheric evaporation, chromospheric condensation, and radiation from the corona, transition region, chromosphere, and photosphere (e.g., Fisher et al. 1985; Allred et al. 2006). Part of the magnetic energy is released for plasma ejections known as prominence/filament eruptions. On the Sun, they often develop into coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which can significantly impact Earth’s environment (e.g., Bisi et al. 2010; Gopalswamy 2016). In recent years, M-dwarfs are considered as prime targets for the search for habitable planets (Nutzman & Charbonneau, 2008; Gilbert et al., 2020) and have been observed to show very high flare activity. Superflares with more than ten times the energy of the largest solar flares are observed (Namizaki et al., 2023). If CMEs associated with these superflares can eject from the stellar surface, the impact on surrounding close-in planets would be significant. Large CMEs could cause atmospheric erosion if they collide with a close-in planet (Lammer et al., 2007). Additionally, high-energy particles accelerated by fast shocks produced during CMEs could promote chemical reactions in planetary atmosphere (Airapetian et al., 2016). This could potentially lead to the origin of life-essential molecules such as amino acids (Kobayashi et al., 2023). Since M-dwarfs have habitable zones closer to the star compared to G-dwarfs and K-dwarfs, such impacts on close-in habitable planets can be greater (Lingam et al., 2018). Therefore, understanding the frequency and energy of prominence/filament eruptions, and eventually CMEs, in active M-dwarfs is crucial for evaluation of habitable condition of exoplanets. Over the past several decades, optical spectroscopic observations have revealed that chromospheric line profiles often show blue asymmetries during flares on M-dwarfs, suggesting possible prominence/filament eruptions (e.g., Houdebine et al. 1990; Vida et al. 2016, 2019; Maehara et al. 2021; Notsu et al. 2024; Inoue et al. 2024). Vida et al. (2016) reported a blueshifted component with a maximum radial velocity of 675 km s-1 during an H\alpha flare on the M4 dwarf V374 Peg. Additionally, Vida et al. (2016) observed an H\alpha flare where a red asymmetry followed the blue asymmetry in the H\alpha line, suggesting that some of the ejected low-temperature plasma returns to the stellar surface. Honda et al. (2018) reported a long-duration blue asymmetry lasting about 2 hours at a velocity of approximately 100 km s-1 during an H\alpha flare on the M4.5 dwarf EV Lac. Maehara et al. (2021) reported a blue asymmetry lasting about 1 hour without significant white-light brightening (a possible non-white-light flare) during an H\alpha flare on the M4.5 dwarf YZ CMi. Furthermore, Inoue et al. (2024) reported a blue asymmetry appearing about 1 hour after the peak of an H\alpha flare on the M4.5 dwarf EV Lac. Notsu et al. (2024) reported 7 blue asymmetries among 41 H\alpha flares in the M-dwarfs YZ CMi, EV Lac, and AD Leo, with durations ranging from approximately 20 minutes to 150 minutes and velocities ranging from about 73 km s-1 to 122 km s-1. It has been discussed that they can be interpreted as prominence/filament eruptions based on the velocity and mass. However, the time cadence (>5 min) of the previous observations is not necessarily high enough to capture and trace the rapid velocity changes of prominence eruptions on M-dwarfs with strong surface gravity. Actually, some solar prominence/filament eruptions change their velocities in less than 5 minutes (Otsu et al., 2022). Higher-time-cadence (\sim1 min) is essentially required not to miss even such short-duration/fast phenomena especially for M-dwarfs. Meanwhile, the nature and origin of the H\alpha blue asymmetries during M-dwarf flares are still under debate, and simultaneous observations with multiple wavelength ranges and different methods (e.g., photometry) are useful for this purpose. For example, the blue asymmetries could also be explained by the upward flow of low-temperature plasma associated with chromospheric evaporation, as observed in the early stage of solar flares (Tei et al., 2018; Canfield et al., 1990). However, white-light flares represent the emission only from flare ribbons originated from chromospheric evaporation/condensation during impulsive phase (Watanabe et al., 2013; Namekata et al., 2017), thus it is crucial to compare the emission energy and temporal variation of white-light emission with those of H\alpha blue asymmetries. One-month continuous photometric observations by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS, Ricker et al. 2015) have enabled simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations, providing a good opportunity to investigate statistical relationships between blue asymmetries and white-light flares, rotational phase which reflects starspots distribution (Ikuta et al., 2023). From these statistical investigations, we can explore the typical properties of blue asymmetries on M-dwarfs, including the location of occurrence. Previous studies with such simultaneous observations using white-light photometry and H\alpha line spectroscopy (Maehara et al., 2021; Namizaki et al., 2023; Notsu et al., 2024) reported only three blue asymmetries during the non-white-light flares or a partial white-light flare (occurring not concurrently with the white-light flare, but shortly after its decay) observed by TESS. The number of such observations is still small, and there are no systematic studies using monitoring observations by TESS. In this study, we conducted high-time-resolution (approximately 1 minute) H\alpha line spectroscopic observations of the active M-dwarf YZ CMi using the Seimei telescope (Kurita et al., 2020). Simultaneously, high-precision optical photometric observations were conducted by TESS. We performed this simultaneous campaign observation for 12 nights. This significantly increases the sample size of observations of H\alpha red/blue asymmetries for white-light/non-white-light flares, which is expected to be helpful to identify the origin of blue asymmetries. For this statistical sample, we incorporated a new criteria to identify the asymmetric or symmetric profiles by using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; Section 3.3). The data and observations are described in Section 2. The analysis methods are explained in Section 3. The analysis results are presented in Section 4. A detailed discussion of the H\alpha blue asymmetries is in Section 5. The summary and conclusions are provided in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08457v1,Wave Topology of Stellar Inertial Oscillations,"Inertial waves in convective regions of stars exhibit topological properties linked to a Chern number of 1. The first of these is a unique, unidirectional, prograde oscillation mode within the cavity, which propagates at arbitrarily low frequencies for moderate azimuthal wavenumbers. The second one are phase singularities around which the phase winds in Fourier space, with winding numbers \nu=\pm 1 depending on the hemisphere. Phase winding is a collective effect over waves propagating in all directions that is strongly robust to noise. This suggests a topology-based method for wave detection in noisy observational data.","Helioseismology has shed unparalleled light on the Sun’s interior, and with it stellar interiors in general. While many acoustic modes with mHz frequencies have been identified and used to constrain the rotation and sound speed profiles [1], other waves are expected to bring complementary information to the surface. Solar internal gravity waves with 10^{2}\muHz frequencies would bring constraints on the solar core, but confirmation of their observation is still missing [2]. In recent years, a third kind of waves has attracted a great deal of attention. Inertial waves propagate owing to solar rotation with 10^{2}nHz frequencies, and are sensitive to the entropy gradient in the convective zone, a quantity to which acoustic modes are essentially insensitive [3]. These waves control the differential rotation of the convective zone and cause it to depart from the Taylor-Proudman columnar structure [4]. Rossby waves [5, 6, 7] and inertial waves of higher frequencies [8, 9] have unequivocally been observed at the solar surface. Inertial modes of convective cores of \gamma Doradus stars have also been observed [10], as well as Rossby waves [11, 12, 13]. Inertial waves are thus an important channel of modern stellar seismology, which motivates further characterization of their oscillation modes. In parallel, recent studies showed a connection between topology and geophysical and astrophysical waves, providing new insight on the properties of global modes [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. In this study, we show that stellar inertial waves possess topological properties, characterized by Chern numbers of \pm 1. This result gives a topological origin to a unidirectional inertial wave propagating eastward at arbitrarily low frequencies. It also explains the existence of a phase singularity of the polarization relations of the waves in Fourier space, to which is associated a winding of the phase of \pm 1. This property provides a novel way of identifying waves. We give a procedure to use this singularity as a signature of the wave and help future identification of seismic signals. Figure 1: Physical space and parameter space of solar inertial waves. Left: coordinates of the convective zone (yellow). Right: The Berry curvature of the upper inertial waveband is singular at the origin of the parameter space {k_{x}=k_{y}=f_{\mathrm{t}}=0}. Brightness indicates the norm of F_{+}."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08399v1,"A Search for Asymmetric Kinematic Components in Circumstellar Envelopes 
Using OH Main Line Masers","Circumstellar OH maser lines are useful for studying the dynamics of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) around evolved stars. This study aims to identify CSEs around cold stars bf, which exhibit deviations from the spherical expansion, by comparing the velocity ranges of the OH main lines (1665/1667 MHz) with those of the satellite line (1612 MHz), using a database of circumstellar OH maser sources. We performed this comparison for 377 circumstellar OH maser sources. In addition, using infrared two-color diagrams, we examined the evolutionary stages and infrared properties of objects showing velocity excess (velocity excess means the detection of the main lines outside the velocity range of the satellite line). A periodicity analysis of the WISE light curves was also carried out. As a result of the velocity range comparison, eight circumstellar OH maser sources were found to exhibit velocity excess. The infrared colors of these objects match those of post-AGB stars. Periodic variations were observed in the WISE light curves of five of these eight objects. The results suggest that examining velocity excess of the main lines relative to the satellite line is scientifically significant because mainline masers probe the CSE dynamics over a broader range of evolutionary stages compared to the 22.235 GHz H2O maser line. Additionally, during the post-AGB phase, the emission regions of the mainline and 22.235 GHz H2O masers may overlap in a CSE, whereas they originate from different regions during the AGB phase.","Maser lines are frequently detected in the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of evolved stars undergoing active mass loss, such as Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, post-AGB stars, and red supergiants (RSGs). Specifically, maser lines of OH, \rm H_{2}O, and SiO molecules are commonly found in the oxygen-rich CSEs of these stars, where the number of oxygen atoms exceeds that of carbon atoms. Recently, it has been suggested that these circumstellar masers may also be observed in red nova remnants (RNRs), which result from stellar mergers between two main-sequence stars or between a main-sequence star and an evolved low- or intermediate-mass star (Deguchi et al., 2005a; Ortiz-León et al., 2020). Observations of circumstellar maser lines provide valuable insights into the morphology and kinematics of the circumstellar molecular gas. Despite extensive observations of circumstellar maser sources since the late 1970s, efforts to compile the observed data into a comprehensive database have been relatively limited until recently. Early works, such as those by te Lintel Hekkert et al. (1989) and Benson et al. (1990), have diminished in scientific value over time, partly due to their limited scope and the lack of updates. Recently, Engels & Bunzel (2015) compiled and organized observational data on the three circumstellar OH maser lines (1612 MHz, 1665 MHz, and 1667 MHz) and released an online database111https://hsweb.hs.uni-hamburg.de/projects/maserdb//. This database has been updated from time-to-time since its initial release in 2015 and contains nearly up-to-date information as of 2024. The same group is also compiling a database of circumstellar \rm H_{2}O maser sources, with some of the collected data (excluding non-detections) available as an appendix in Fan et al. (2024). Fan et al. (2024) analyzed the database of circumstellar \rm H_{2}O and OH maser sources to identify water fountain (WF) candidates by comparing the velocity ranges of the 1612 MHz OH and 22.235 GHz \rm H_{2}O maser lines. A WF is a low- to intermediate-mass evolved star with a small-scale, high-velocity, highly collimated molecular jet at the center of the CSE (Imai et al., 2012). Evolved stars with low to intermediate mass undergo a transformation in the morphology of their CSE from spherical to non-spherical as they progress from the AGB to the planetary nebula (PN) phase. However, the physical processes driving this morphological evolution are not yet fully understood. WFs are considered as key objects for studying this evolution, as they represent a phase immediately following the onset of the morphological transition from spherical to non-spherical. WF is classically defined as a circumstellar 22.235 GHz H2O maser source, with a velocity range exceeding 100 km s-1. However, from an astrophysical perspective, WF describes an object where a bipolar molecular outflow has just begun to form near the center of a spherically symmetric, expanding envelope developed during the AGB phase. To identify such objects, Fan et al. (2024) established a selection criterion wherein the velocity range of the 22.235 GHz H2O maser exceeds that of the 1612 MHz OH maser line. In this paper, we refer to cases where the velocity range of a maser line surpasses that of the 1612 MHz OH maser line as a ”velocity excess.” WF candidates selected based on this H2O maser velocity excess may not strictly conform to the classical definition of WF. Rather, as Fan et al. (2024) discussed, these candidates may represent WFs at an earlier evolutionary stage than those traditionally classified as WFs. Fan et al. (2024) identified 11 sources based on the velocity excess of the 22.235 GHz H2O maser line. The selection criteria set by Fan et al. (2024) were designed to detect high-velocity gas components, such as bipolar jets, within the spherically expanding envelope formed during the AGB phase. However, the criteria proposed by Fan et al. (2024) may select not only WFs but also CSEs with kinematic components deviating from spherical expansion, such as the RNRs mentioned earlier. Whether the object is a WF, an RNR, or another type, CSEs with non-spherical kinematic components are considered to contain many astrophysically interesting features. For a subset of the sample, Fan et al. (2024) compared the velocity ranges of the OH satellite line (1612 MHz) with those of the OH main lines (1665 MHz and 1667 MHz). Interestingly, they found that in two sources, the velocity ranges of the OH main lines exceeded those of the OH satellite line (IRAS 18251–1048 and IRAS 22516+0838). In the case of these two sources, the 1665 MHz OH and/or 1667 MHz OH lines were detected outside the double peak of the 1612 MHz OH maser line (i.e., they find the velocity excess of the 1665/1667 MHz OH lines). In a spherically expanding CSE, the 1612 MHz OH maser line typically exhibits a double-peaked profile, where the velocity separation between the peaks is known to be twice the expansion velocity of the spherical CSE. Therefore, this result suggests (1) the presence of velocity components within the CSE that deviate from spherical expansion, and (2) that these irregular kinematic components can be detected in the 1665 MHz OH and/or 1667 MHz OH lines. Since the main objective of Fan et al. (2024) was to compare the velocity ranges of the 1612 MHz OH and 22.235 GHz \rm H_{2}O lines, the comparison between the OH satellite (1612 MHz) and main lines (1665 MHz and 1667 MHz) was limited to a small sample. In the present study, we performed a thorough comparison of the velocity ranges of the OH satellite and main lines using the latest version of the database of circumstellar OH maser sources (Engels & Bunzel, 2015). Our goal is to identify circumstellar OH maser sources where the velocity range of the OH main lines exceeds that of the OH satellite line. Additionally, we utilized catalogs of known AGB and post-AGB stars to establish evolutionary tracks on infrared two-color diagrams. We then investigated the infrared properties of the selected sources exhibiting kinematic irregularities in the OH maser lines by comparing them with known samples of AGB and post-AGB stars. For simplicity, we will refer to the 1612 MHz OH maser line as the satellite line and the 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz OH maser lines as the main lines. We will refer to the 22.235 GHz H2O maser line simply as the H2O maser line. As there are two main lines, the rest frequency is mentioned when it is necessary to distinguish between them."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08310v1,Measurements of the solar coronal magnetic field based on coronal seismology with propagating Alfvénic waves: forward modeling,"Recent observations have demonstrated the capability of mapping the solar coronal magnetic field using the technique of coronal seismology based on the ubiquitous propagating Alfvénic/kink waves through imaging spectroscopy. We established a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of a gravitationally stratified open magnetic flux tube, exciting kink waves propagating upwards along the tube. Forward modeling was performed to synthesize the Fe xiii 1074.7 and 1079.8 nm spectral line profiles, which were then used to determine the wave phase speed, plasma density, and magnetic field with seismology method. A comparison between the seismologically inferred results and the corresponding input values verifies the reliability of the seismology method. In addition, we also identified some factors that could lead to errors during magnetic field measurements. Our results may serve as a valuable reference for current and future coronal magnetic field measurements based on observations of propagating kink waves.","The magnetic field plays a crucial role in various physical processes in the solar and stellar coronae. The dissipation of magnetic energy is believed to drive solar eruptive events (e.g., flares and coronal mass ejections) and cause heating of the corona. While the magnetic field in the lower solar atmosphere can be reliably measured through spectro-polarimetric observations, direct measurements of the coronal magnetic field have remained challenging for decades. Several methods, including the spectro-polarimetry of coronal infrared lines (Lin et al. 2000, 2004; Schad et al. 2024), coronal radio observations (e.g., Fleishman et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2020; Tan 2022), and magnetic-field-induced transitions of extreme ultraviolet emission lines (e.g., Li et al. 2015, 2016; Landi et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2021, 2023), have been proposed and attempts of measurements have been made. However, these approaches all face limitations and none of them could be used for routine measurements of the global coronal magnetic field. Another technique that could be used to measure the coronal magnetic field is coronal seismology. This technique combines the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) wave theory with observed wave parameters (e.g., period, amplitude, propagation speed, damping time) to diagnose various physical properties, particularly the magnetic field. Different wave phenomena in the corona have been used for coronal seismology, including standing kink waves in magnetic loops (e.g. Nakariakov & Ofman 2001; Aschwanden et al. 2002; Van Doorsselaere et al. 2007; Tian et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2022; Gao et al. 2022, 2024a; Zhong et al. 2023; Li & Long 2023, to name but a few), propagating slow magneto-acoustic waves (e.g., Jess et al. 2016), sausage waves (Chen et al. 2015; Guo et al. 2016; see Li et al. 2020 for a review), propagating kink waves in streamers (Chen et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2022), and torsional oscillations in solar surges (Kohutova et al. 2020). However, these studies provided only one-dimensional (1D) distributions or single values of the magnetic field in specific coronal structures, such as oscillating loops or streamers. To create global 2D magnetic field maps, we need to utilize ubiquitous and continuous wave phenomena. The pervasive propagating disturbances in Dopplergrams (Tomczyk et al. 2007; Tomczyk & McIntosh 2009; Liu et al. 2015; Morton et al. 2015, 2019) observed by the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP; Tomczyk et al. 2008) are ideal for this purpose. These propagating disturbances are interpreted as kink or Alfvénic waves (Van Doorsselaere et al. 2008), and their propagation speeds are naturally linked to the local magnetic field. Based on these CoMP observations, Yang et al. (2020b, a) have successfully measured the global distribution of the coronal magnetic field for the first time. Following these successful attempts, a routine (continuous) measurement of the global coronal magnetic field based on similar observations from the Upgraded CoMP (UCoMP; Landi et al. 2016) has been recently achieved, which allows for the construction of coronal synoptic magnetograms (Carrington maps) (Yang et al. 2024). The CoMP and UCoMP instruments can conduct spectroscopic observations of the Fe xiii lines at 1074.7 and 1079.8 nm in the coronal region above the solar limb. From the Dopplergrams of Fe xiii 1074.7 nm, propagating kink waves can be identified throughout the corona. The propagating or phase speed c_{\text{k}} of these waves (also named the kink speed) could be obtained by constructing a time-distance map of Doppler velocity, while the coronal density can be inferred from the observed Fe xiii 1079.8-nm/1074.7-nm intensity ratio. For kink waves, we have c^{2}_{\text{k}}=\frac{B_{\text{i}}^{2}+B_{\text{e}}^{2}}{\mu_{0}(\rho_{\text{% i}}+\rho_{\text{e}})}\,, (1) where \mu_{0} is the magnetic permeability, B and \rho are the magnetic field and mass density, respectively. The subscripts i and e refer to parameters inside and outside the magnetic flux tubes (the waveguides). Since CoMP and UCoMP likely cannot resolve individual flux tubes, we can only work with an average density \langle\rho\rangle. Furthermore, in the low-\beta coronal environment, the internal and external magnetic fields are often assumed to be approximately equal (see e.g., Tomczyk & McIntosh 2009; Morton et al. 2015; Zhong et al. 2023). This leads to the simplified expression for the kink speed: c^{2}_{\text{k}}=\frac{B^{2}}{\mu_{0}\langle\rho\rangle}\,, (2) which is widely used in estimations of coronal magnetic fields (Long et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2020a, b, 2024). Given the potential of these measurements to provide routine coronal magnetograms on a daily basis, which could play a crucial role in future solar physics research, it is essential to thoroughly assess the reliability and robustness of the methodology used in Yang et al. (2020a, b) and Yang et al. (2024). Magyar & Van Doorsselaere (2018) performed 3D MHD simulations of propagating kink waves under various conditions and conducted forward modeling to evaluate the reliability of this method in deriving the magnetic field strength. Their findings indicated that the magnetic field strengths inferred through seismology closely match the input values, typically with an error less than \sim20%. However, there is a limitation in their simulation. They utilized a non-stratified setup that excluded the effects of gravity, resulting in uniform initial density and propagation speed in the vertical direction. The gravitational stratification can play a significant role as it causes the Alfvén speed and kink speed c_{\text{k}} to vary with height. This variation can affect the wave tracking method which typically relies on a linear fit of velocity signals (e.g., see Figure 6 in Tomczyk & McIntosh 2009). Therefore, it is important to assess how the gravitational stratification affects the seismological results and estimate the possible error range. So we conducted 3D MHD simulations of propagating kink waves in stratified coronal open flux tubes. Following Magyar & Van Doorsselaere (2018), we employed forward modeling to compare the seismologically derived results with the actual values of physical parameters from our simulation. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our simulation setup and methodology, Section 3 presents the simulation and forward-modeling results, along with detailed comparisons between seismology results and input values, and Section 4 provides a discussion and summary of our findings."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08242v1,Viscous Heating and Instabilities in the Partially Ionized Solar Atmosphere,"In weak magnetic fields (\lesssim 50\,\mbox{G}), parallel and perpendicular viscosities, mainly from neutrals, may exceed magnetic diffusivities (Ohm, Hall, ambipolar) in the middle and upper chromosphere. Ion-driven gyroviscosity may dominate in the upper chromosphere and transition region. In strong fields (\gtrsim 100\,\mbox{G}), viscosities primarily exceed diffusivities in the upper chromosphere and transition region. Parallel and perpendicular viscosities, being similar in magnitude, dampen waves and potentially compete with ambipolar diffusion in plasma heating, potentially inhibiting Hall and ambipolar instabilities when equal. The perpendicular viscosity tensor has two components, \nu_{1} and \nu_{2}, which differ slightly and show weak dependence on ion magnetization. Their differences, combined with shear, may destabilize waves, though magnetic diffusion introduces a cutoff for this instability. In configurations with a magnetic field \bf{B} having vertical (b_{z}=B_{z}/|\bf{B}|) and azimuthal (b_{y}=B_{y}/|\bf{B}|) components, and a wavevector \bf{k} with radial (\hat{k}_{x}=k_{x}/|\bf{k}|) and vertical (\hat{k}_{z}=k_{z}/|\bf{k}|) components, parallel viscosity and Hall diffusion can generate the viscous-Hall instability. Gyroviscosity further destabilizes waves in the upper regions. These findings indicate that the solar atmosphere may experience various viscous instabilities, revealing complex interactions between viscosity, magnetic fields, and plasma dynamics across different atmospheric regions.","The dynamics of the partially ionized solar atmosphere, which govern the transport of mass, momentum, and energy across its stratified and magnetized layers, are notably complex. This complexity arises due to two primary factors. On one hand, the ionization state of the gas shifts from weakly ionized to partially ionized as we move from the photosphere through the chromosphere to the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona. On the other hand, the magnetic field strength varies dramatically, ranging from near zero to kG levels in both the quiet and active regions of the Sun (Sánchez Almeida & Lites, 2000; Dominguez Cerde\tilde{\mbox{n}}a et al., 2006). For instance, the photosphere, which comprises the visible (380-750\,\mbox{nm}) solar surface, extends vertically about 500 to 550 km. Here, the temperature decreases from around 6000\,K at the base to 4100\,K at the temperature minimum. In this layer, the plasma remains weakly ionized. Above the photosphere lies the chromosphere, named for its pinkish hue from the H\alpha (Balmer-\alpha) emission line at 656.3\,\mbox{nm}. The chromosphere, with a thickness of about 1-2\,\mbox{Mm}, starts from the weakly ionized temperature minimum and transitions to a partially ionized region at its top, where temperatures reach around \sim 2\times 10^{4}\,K. Throughout the chromosphere, temperature, density, ionization degree, and magnetic field strength vary significantly. A narrow transition region, only a few tens of kilometers thick, separates the chromosphere from the corona. In this region, the plasma temperature rises sharply to 10^{6}\,K, while the density drops from approximately 10^{11} to 10^{8-9}\,\mbox{cm}^{-3}. Consequently, the atmosphere transitions from partially ionized to almost fully ionized. With increasing temperature and decreasing density, the solar atmosphere also becomes optically thin in the transition region, though this may not always hold true, particularly during energetic and impulsive events like solar flares (Kerr et al., 2019). Moreover, relatively cool (T\sim 10^{4}\,\mbox{K}), dense (\sim 10^{10}-10^{11}\,\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}), large-scale (5-10^{2} Mm), and partially ionized (0.1-1) structures are also observed as \mbox{H}{\alpha}-emitting plasma embedded within the hotter corona. Our understanding of the solar magnetic field and its role in the transport of mass, energy, and angular momentum is still in its early stages. The magnetic field, generated in the Sun’s interior, is measured with the highest accuracy at the visible surface, the photosphere, and governs many of the physical processes in the solar atmosphere. Convective motions, both small- and large-scale, in the photospheric layers shuffle magnetic field lines, contributing to the buildup of magnetic energy in the corona (Parker 1987). While the small-scale dynamics of the photosphere are primarily driven by granular convection, the chromosphere is dominated by sound waves and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. For recent reviews on these processes, see Ballester et al. (2018); Srivastava at al. (2021); Soler & Ballester (2022); Soler (2024). In the partially ionized solar atmosphere, where the degree of ionization varies, the presence of neutrals leads to collisional momentum exchange with ions. This exchange can dampen waves and locally heat the plasma (Braginskii, 1965; Soler & Ballester, 2022). However, when the neutral-ion collision frequency is high compared to the signal frequency—i.e., when ions and neutrals are strongly coupled—ions acquire neutral inertia, leading to several important consequences (Pandey & Wardle, 2006, 2008; Pandey, 2013; Pandey & Wardle, 2022) (hereafter PW22) : 1. A single-fluid, MHD-like description of the partially ionized plasma becomes valid in this regime. 2. The phase speed of the Alfvén wave is reduced compared to the fully ionized case. 3. The ion-cyclotron frequency is re-scaled due to ion-mass loading and becomes a much lower Hall frequency. 4. The ion-Larmor radius is re-scaled and becomes significantly larger than in a fully ionized plasma. Although partially ionized solar plasma can be treated using an MHD-like, single-fluid framework, the magnetic field is not ”frozen” in the plasma. It slips through due to collisions between electrons, ions, and neutrals, manifesting as Ohm, Hall, and ambipolar diffusion in the induction equation. While Hall diffusion causes a dissipationless transport of the magnetic field, Ohm and ambipolar diffusion lead to energy dissipation. The role of ambipolar diffusion, in particular, has been a focus of recent research as a possible source of non-thermal heating in solar plasma (De Pontieu et al., 2011; Moll et al., 2011; Zaqarashvili et al., 2011a, b; Khomenko & Collados, 2012; Zaqarashvili et al., 2012, 2013; Leake et al., 2014; Gangadhara et al., 2014; Soler at al., 2009, 2015; Cally & Khomenko, 2015; Shelyag et al., 2016; Khomenko, 2017; Martínez–Gómez et al., 2017; Martínez–Sykora et al., 2017; Cally & Khomenko, 2018; Raboonik & Cally, 2019; Muthsam et al., 2021; Khomenko et al., 2021; Raboonik & Cally, 2021; Martínez–Sykora et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024; Masato et al., 2024). Magnetic field mediates vortex motion in the photosphere, chromosphere and lower corona (Tziotziou et al., 2023; Breu et al., 2023). Photospheric vortical motion can generate observable corotating structures in the chromosphere and corona, known as chromospheric swirls and magnetic tornadoes, spanning a wide range of spatial scales and extending from the upper convection zone to the transition region and lower corona (Kato & Wedemeyer, 2017; Kuniyoshi et al., 2023). Vortices and flows of various spatial and temporal scales are observed in both active and quiet phases of the solar atmosphere (Bonet et al., 2008; Wedemeyer-B\ddot{\mbox{o}}hm & Voort, 2009; Balmaceda et al., 2010; Bonet et al., 2010). Bright points associated with vortex motion in the intergranular lanes typically move at speeds of \lesssim 2\,\mbox{km}/\mbox{s} (Wedemeyer-B\ddot{\mbox{o}}hm & Voort, 2009). The formation of small-scale intergranular vortices suggests that vorticity arises from the interaction between photospheric plasma and the ambient magnetic field in intergranular lanes (Moll et al., 2011; Shelyag et al., 2011). Non-ideal MHD simulations indicate that Hall diffusion generates out-of-plane velocity fields with maximum speeds of \sim 0.1\,\mbox{km}/\mbox{s} at interface layers between weakly magnetized light bridges and neighboring strong-field umbral regions (Cheung & Cameron, 2012). In summary, both observational evidence and numerical simulations highlight the presence of shear flows at various spatial scales within the solar photosphere. The presence of large-scale shear flows can readily destabilize waves. For instance, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), which converts shear flow energy into vortex kinetic energy, has been proposed to explain the instability of flux tubes (Soler at al., 2010; Zaqarashvili at al., 2010; Kitiashvili et al., 2012). Additionally, magnetic field diffusion (Pandey & Wardle, 2012, 2013) and viscous momentum transport (PW22) can also drive non-ideal shear instabilities. This work presents a detailed investigation of various viscous instabilities, building upon our previous study (PW22) but with several key differences: (i) Unlike PW22, which assumed a vertical magnetic field and transverse fluctuations (vertical wavevector), the current study considers a more general magnetic field topology and oblique wavevectors. Overall, this study offers a broader and more general framework compared to PW22. It is worth noting that in this work, we describe the partially ionized solar plasma using an MHD-like framework. However, high-frequency, short-wavelength (on the order of a few meters) electrostatic waves can also be modeled using a multifluid approach (Gogoberidze et al., 2014). Given the current observational resolution of approximately 90 km, only MHD waves are directly relevant to observations. Nevertheless, electrostatic fluctuations may still have an indirect effect on the MHD waves propagating through the medium. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the basic set of equations and the dispersion relation. Subsection 2.1 describes the model solar atmosphere, followed by Subsection 2.2, which details the basic equations. In Subsection 2.3, the general dispersion relation is provided, along with an analysis of wave heating effects due to non-ideal MHD processes. Section 3 discusses the necessary conditions for the onset of viscous instabilities in the fluid and the role of magnetic diffusion in these instabilities. Section 4 addresses the application of the results, and Section 5 offers a brief summary of the findings."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08235v1,The salty emission of the intermediate-mass AGB star OH 30.1-0.7,"We analyse continuum and molecular emission, observed with ALMA, from the dust-enshrouded intermediate-mass AGB star OH 30.1\,-0.7. We find a secondary peak in the continuum maps, “feature B”, separated by 4.6″ from the AGB star, which corresponds to a projected separation of 1.8\times 10^{4} au, placing a lower limit on the physical separation. This feature is most likely composed of cold dust and is likely to be ejecta associated with the AGB star, though we cannot rule out that it is a background object. The molecular emission we detect includes lines of CO, SiS, CS, \mathrm{SO}_{2}, NS, NaCl, and KCl. We find that the NS emission is off centre and arranged along an axis perpendicular to the direction of feature B, indicative of a UV-emitting binary companion (e.g. a G-type main sequence star or hotter), perhaps on an eccentric orbit, contributing to its formation. However, the NaCl and KCl emission constrain the nature of that companion to not be hotter than a late B-type main sequence star. We find relatively warm emission arising from the inner wind and detect several vibrationally excited lines of SiS (\varv=1), NaCl (up to \varv=4) and KCl (up to \varv=2), and emission from low energy levels in the mid to outer envelope, as traced by \mathrm{SO}_{2}. The CO emission is abruptly truncated around 3.5\arcsec or 14,000 au from the continuum peak, suggesting that mass loss at a high rate may have commenced as little as 2800 years ago.","The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase is a late evolutionary stage that low- and intermediate-mass stars (with initial masses 0.8~{}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\lesssim M_{i}\lesssim 8~{}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) pass through towards the end of their lives. During this phase, the stars eject a significant amount of material through a stellar wind, with mass-loss rates in the range \sim 10^{-8} to 10^{-4}\;\mathrm{M}_{\odot}~{}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}. Some lower-mass stars, with initial masses \sim 1.5 to 4~{}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}, are expected to end their lives as carbon stars, after dredging up newly-synthesised carbon from their interiors to their surfaces (Herwig, 2005; Karakas & Lattanzio, 2014). Intermediate-mass stars, with initial masses in the range \sim 4 to 8~{}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}, are not expected to end their lives as carbon stars (Herwig, 2005; Karakas & Lattanzio, 2014; Ventura et al., 2018; Marigo et al., 2020) because they are massive enough to initiate hot bottom burning (HBB), a phenomenon where the star’s convective envelope penetrates the hydrogen-burning shell and enables additional (proton-capture) nucleosynthesis processes (Karakas & Lattanzio, 2014). In particular, HBB destroys \ce^12C and \ce^18O. The destruction of \ce^12C prevents the formation of carbon stars and results in low \ce^12C/\ce^13C ratios, and the destruction of \ce^18O results in very large \ce^17O/\ce^18O ratios, allowing us to observationally identify stars in which HBB has taken place (Justtanont et al., 2015). We also note that the precise mass ranges of stars that become carbon stars or which undergo HBB depends on their initial metallicity and on some numerical details of the models (such as the treatment of convection and mass-loss rates, Karakas & Lugaro, 2016). The numbers given here are for solar metallicity. A small sample of stars have been shown to have intermediate initial masses based on the prevalence of \mathrm{H}_{2}17O emission and the absence of \mathrm{H}_{2}18O emission in Herschel observations (Justtanont et al., 2015). Some of these stars have also been found to have low \ce^12C/\ce^13C ratios (e.g. Delfosse et al., 1997), providing further evidence for HBB. These intermediate-mass stars have all previously been found to have high mass-loss rates, though the precise values of the mass-loss rates have been the subject of much debate since different values are found using different methods (see for example Heske et al., 1990; Justtanont et al., 2006). Several explanations have been put forward to explain these discrepant results, including the concept of a “superwind”: a recently-initiated period of enhanced mass-loss (Heske et al., 1990; Delfosse et al., 1997; Justtanont et al., 2013). This scenario could explain the relatively high mass-loss rates obtained from spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and dust modelling, thought to represent the more recent mass loss, while the lower mass-loss rates from CO are thought to be the remnant of an earlier period of lower mass loss. Thus far, no studies of the circumstellar chemistry of confirmed intermediate-mass AGB stars have been presented. In this work we focus on the intermediate-mass AGB star OH 30.1\,-0.7, thought to have a very high mass-loss rate (>10^{-4}\;\mathrm{M}_{\odot}~{}\mathrm{yr}^{-1} based on SED modelling, Justtanont et al., 2013, 2015). This star has featured in several other studies of extremely dusty stars based on various (spatially unresolved) infrared and radio observations (Heske et al., 1990; Delfosse et al., 1997; Justtanont et al., 2006). Although several previous studies have considered OH 30.1\,-0.7 to have a superwind, Decin et al. (2019) argued for a binary scenario rather than a superwind. Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) observations of CO around two intermediate-mass stars (OH 30.1\,-0.7 and OH 26.5\,+0.6) were presented by Decin et al. (2019) who attributed structures in their circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) to interactions with binary companions. Decin et al. (2019) further argue that the apparently high mass-loss rates could be explained by an equatorial density enhancement of gas and dust arising from gravitational shaping by a companion. This would then change the apparent mass-loss rate depending on the orientation of the system and the line of sight through the CSE. Certainly some of the structures observed in the winds of both of these stars are similar to structures seen around other AGB stars that are also attributed to binary interactions (for example Cernicharo et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2017; Decin et al., 2020). For AGB stars more generally, it has recently been shown that binary companions, especially solar-like stars emitting notable UV flux, can have an impact on circumstellar chemistry (Van de Sande & Millar, 2022). Observational studies have found some molecular emission distributions that are best explained through the presence of a solar-type companion (Siebert et al., 2022; Coenegrachts et al., 2023; Danilovich et al., 2024). In particular, Danilovich et al. (2024) showed that asymmetric distributions of SiN, SiC and NS could be attributed to a main sequence companion on a highly eccentric orbit passing through the inner wind of W Aql every \sim 1100 years. Coenegrachts et al. (2023) found asymmetric clumps of NaCl emission forming an approximate spiral in the inner wind of the oxygen-rich AGB star IK Tau, which they attributed to an unseen companion close to the AGB star. We present here a complete molecular inventory of the existing ALMA data of OH 30.1\,-0.7 (also known as V1362 Aql, IRAS 18460 –0254, AFGL 5535), where previously only CO observations were published. In Sect. 2 we describe our re-reduction of the ALMA data, present the continuum, and describe our analysis of the molecular lines. In Sect. 3 we present the detected molecular lines and discuss the implications of these results in Sect. 4, in particular how these observations support the presence of a companion star. We summarise our conclusions in Sect. 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08211v1,Detection asymmetry in solar energetic particle events,"Context. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are detected in interplanetary space in association with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at the Sun. The magnetic connection between the observing spacecraft and the solar active region (AR) source of the event is a key parameter in determining whether SEPs are observed and the properties of the particle event.Aims. We investigate whether an east-west asymmetry in the detection of SEP events is present in observations and discuss its possible link to corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun.Methods. We used a published dataset of 239 CMEs recorded between 2006 and 2017 and having source regions both on the front side and far side of the Sun as seen from Earth. We produced distributions of occurrence of in-situ SEP intensity enhancements associated with the CME events, versus \Delta\phi, the separation in longitude between the source active region and the magnetic footpoint of the observing spacecraft based on the nominal Parker spiral. We focused on protons of energy >10 MeV measured by the STEREO A, STEREO B and GOES spacecraft at 1 au. We also considered the occurrence of 71-112 keV electron events detected by MESSENGER between 0.31 and 0.47 au.Results. We find an east-west asymmetry in the detection of >10 MeV proton events and of 71-112 keV electron events. For protons, observers for which the source AR is on the east side of the spacecraft footpoint and not well connected (-180∘<\Delta\phi<-40∘) are 93% more likely to detect an SEP event compared to observers with +40∘<\Delta\phi<+180∘. The asymmetry may be a signature of corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun, given that for events with \Delta\phi<0 corotation sweeps the particle-filled flux tubes towards the observing spacecraft, while for \Delta\phi>0 it takes them away from it.","Solar energetic particles (SEPs), accelerated as a result of energy release events at the Sun, are detected by spacecraft instruments in interplanetary space in close temporal coincidence with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Time-intensity profiles of electrons, protons and heavy ions have been characterised extensively over several decades of particle observations (e.g. Van Hollebeke et al. 1975; Cane et al. 1988; Richardson et al. 2014; Papaioannou et al. 2016; Cohen et al. 2017; Rodríguez-García et al. 2023b). During so-called gradual SEP events, intensities measured at 1 au often remain elevated above background for several days (e.g. Desai & Giacalone 2016; Klein & Dalla 2017; Cohen et al. 2021). A striking feature of SEP observations is the so-called east-west (E-W) effect in the particle intensity profiles: for a near-Earth spacecraft events with source active region (AR) in the west of the Sun tend to have a fast rise to peak intensity and decay, while those with source AR in the east typically have a slow rise and longer duration (Cane et al., 1988). Van Hollebeke et al. (1975) were the first to analyse the dependence of SEP profile characteristics, such as the rise time and spectral index, on the longitude of the source AR, showing the presence of E-W asymmetries. Asymmetries have been confirmed by a number of more recent studies (e.g. Richardson et al. 2014; Lario et al. 2013). In a study of electron SEP events, Rodríguez-García et al. (2023a) noted an asymmetry to the east in the range of \Delta\phi values for which the highest peak intensities are observed. Here \Delta\phi, sometimes termed connection angle, gives the separation in longitude between the source AR and the observer’s magnetic footpoint at the Sun. Cane et al. (1988) proposed that the qualitative dependence of SEP intensity profiles on the location of the source AR is the result of different geometries of magnetic connection of the observer to the CME-driven shock. In this interpretation particle are accelerated at the shock with a spatially varying acceleration efficiency along its front so that the particle intensity at injection depends on which portion of the shock front is connected to the observer (as discussed also by Tylka et al. 2005). Ding et al. (2022) interpreted the east-west asymmetry in SEP fluence as due to the combined effect of the shock acceleration history and the geometry of the interplanetary magnetic field. In addition to E-W asymmetries in the parameters of SEP intensity profiles, there have been indications in the literature of a longitude asymmetry in the detection of SEP events. In a study using data from the Helios 1 and Helios 2 spacecraft gathered between 1974 and 1985, Kallenrode et al. (1992) noted that for the 77 SEP events they analysed, approximately 2/3 of the events had \Delta\phi<0, though they commented that this was unlikely to result from a real physical mechanism and was likely due to spacecraft orbits. During the time range considered in their study, the Helios spacecraft were magnetically connected to the far side of the Sun for part of the time, while observations of flares were available for the front side only. Dalla (2003) studied a subset of the same events in two proton and one electron channels and plotted the event duration versus \Delta\phi, noting that the results displayed an E-W asymmetry in duration. They also commented that in this dataset, events associated with large negative \Delta\phi were much more likely than those with large positive \Delta\phi and showed that this could not be ascribed to spacecraft trajectories, terming the effect ‘detection asymmetry’. They suggested that corotation may help explaining the observations. Using a list of 78 solar proton events affecting the Earth environment collected by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Centre during 1996 to 2011, He & Wan (2017) noted an excess of events with negative \Delta\phi, for |\Delta\phi|\lesssim40∘. As the solar wind propagates radially outwards and the footpoints of magnetic field lines remain anchored at the photosphere, the Parker spiral structure of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is generated. Magnetic flux tubes in the heliosphere appear to corotate with the Sun, an effect that is evident in movies of simulations of the solar wind structure from models such as ENLIL (Odstrcil & Pizzo, 1999), EUHFORIA (Pomoell & Poedts, 2018) and Huxt (Owens et al., 2020). Corotation is very important in shaping measured properties of the solar wind at 1 au, as demonstrated by the success of empirical solar wind forecast models based on it (Owens et al., 2013). From the point of view of an inertial (non-corotating) frame, once SEPs have been injected into the heliosphere, corotation sweeps particle-filled magnetic flux tubes away from/towards an observer. In many cases the same is true in the spacecraft frame, since the velocity of a 1-au spacecraft is small compared to the corotation and solar wind velocities (exceptions may be spacecraft located very close to the Sun). In early SEP studies corotation was thought to be important to explain SEP events (Burlaga, 1967). For so-called impulsive SEP events, thought to be produced by solar flares, simulations have shown that corotation affects the modelled intensity profiles (Giacalone & Jokipii, 2012; Dröge et al., 2010). However for SEP events resulting from acceleration at CME-driven shocks, 1D focussed transport models which included corotation in an approximate way concluded it has negligible effects (Kallenrode & Wibberenz, 1997; Lario et al., 1998). As a result, the influence of corotation on gradual events is regarded as minimal and generally it is neglected. Corotation is not routinely included in SEP focussed transport models nor forecasting tools (Whitman et al., 2023). Recent models based on 3D test particle simulations reached a very different conclusion: Marsh et al. (2015) described the formation of corotating SEP streams, particle-filled magnetic flux tubes that corotate with the Sun. Modelling SEPs injected instantaneously at the Sun, they noted that in test particle simulations the E-W effect in SEP intensity profiles develops naturally as a result of corotation, as was also pointed out by Dalla et al. (2017). Simulations including time-extended acceleration from a wide shock-like source reached the same conclusion (Hutchinson et al., 2023). Thus, according to test particle simulations, corotation effects are important in shaping SEP intensity profiles for both impulsive and gradual events. Using a simple 1D diffusion model and an impulsive and wide injection at the Sun, Laitinen et al. (2018) demonstrated the qualitative differences in the intensity profiles of 10 MeV protons from a model that included corotation and one that did not, for a scattering mean free path \lambda=0.03 au. It remains to be established whether any signatures of corotation are visible in SEP observations and whether it plays a role in E-W asymmetries. Regarding a possible SEP detection asymmetry, so far it has been difficult to characterise it conclusively. One reason for this is that in most studies in the past both flare and SEP observations were affected by Earth bias: for the majority of events, only source regions on the front side of the Sun were identified routinely via the associated flare and only spacecraft near the Earth measured SEPs. Due to the winding of the IMF, for example assuming a solar wind speed of 450 km s-1, the footpoint of a near-Earth spacecraft is located at longitude \phi_{\mathit{ftpt}}=55∘ with respect to the Earth-Sun line. Thus a source AR at the west limb gives \Delta\phi=35∘ and larger positive \Delta\phi values are not accessible if only front side source regions are used, for a near-Earth spacecraft. Thus analysis of the entire [-180∘,+180∘] range of \Delta\phi values was not possible. The situation changed with the availability of Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) data, which allowed identification of source active regions on the far side of the Sun via the Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) instrument, as well as SEP detection when the spacecraft were magnetically connected to regions on the far side of the Sun. In this paper we address the question of whether indications from previous studies of an E-W asymmetry in SEP event detection can be confirmed, by using a large statistical sample of CMEs with accurate information on their source regions. This is a previously published dataset of 239 front-side and far-side CME events that took place during the STEREO era (Kihara et al., 2020). Within the dataset, the SEP effects, if any, of the events were identified by analysing >10 MeV proton data from STEREO A, STEREO B and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). We derive \Delta\phi distributions of SEP detections from this dataset to show that an E-W detection asymmetry is present. We also present distributions of detections of 71-112 keV electron events at the MErcury Surface Space ENvironment GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft, located at radial distances between 0.31 and 0.47 au, making use of the dataset of 61 events from Rodríguez-García et al. (2023b). We discuss whether corotation may play a role in producing the observed asymmetries in detection. In a companion paper, Hyndman et al. (2024) analyse the decay phase of SEP events and the possible influence of corotation on this phase of SEP intensity profiles. In Section 2 we describe the main features of the CME dataset and derive distributions of SEP proton event detection. In Section 3 we use the same methodology to derive detection distributions from MESSENGER electron data. We discuss our results in Section 4 and conclusions are summarised in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08170v2,Simulation of Solar Wind Charged Particle Energy Deposited and Particle Identification by \DeltaE-E Discrimination in the SNAPPY Cubesat Detector,The Solar Neutrino and Astro-Particle PhYsics (SNAPPY) Cubesat is expected to launch in 2025 and it will carry into a polar orbit a prototype test detector for solar neutrino background studies while over the Earth’s poles for the neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory future project (\nuSOL). During this flight it is possible to do other science measurements. One of these is an improved study of the solar wind particles through better particle identification and high resolution energy measurements. This study aimed to understand how well could the solar wind particles be identified using the planned detector but instead of using the veto array as an anti-coincidence it would be used as a \DeltaE energy sampling of a phoswich particle ID system.,"As a NASA Jump Start undergraduate at Wichita State University, double majoring in Aerospace Engineering and Physics, I am conducting research on the particle discrimination capabilities of the CubeSat detector using the \DeltaE-E method and measuring the energy spectrum. The focus of the \textnuSOL project is the detection and study of neutrinos, primarily from the Sun. The research goals of the \textnuSOL project is to utilize the 1/r^{2} neutrino flux with the Sun, determining the neutrino gravitational focus to the Sun, and observing dark matter candidates [1]. The CubeSat detector design features two different detector materials: Polyvinyltoluene (the Veto) and gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet (called GAGG). Both detector materials are scintillators. The whole detector includes four GAGG crystals that are enclosed within the Veto. The purpose of the GAGG is to measure the neutrino interaction on 71Ga that is characterized by a double pulse [1]. The purpose of the Veto is to act as a filter for the GAGG. Neutrinos likely will not interact with the Veto’s material, and in principle, any particles detected by the Veto should not be neutrinos. Therefore, any double pulse detected in the GAGG that occurs simultaneously with a pulse from the Veto is not considered as a neutrino interaction. The current plan is for the CubSsat detector prototype to go into low altitude Polar Earth orbit, with an orbital period of 90 minutes, attached to a CubeSat nanosatellite. The detector will be turned on in fifteen minute intervals while the CubeSat is oriented over Earth’s north and south poles. Eventually \textnuSOL plans to go into orbit around the Sun, within a distance of seven solar radii at perihelion. The purpose of the solar orbit is to take advantage of the higher flux of neutrinos at closer distances to the Sun. The overall goal of the \textnuSOL project is to present a new and innovative way of studying the Sun’s fusion core and the particle physics of neutrinos. The CubeSat is a test of the detector, but we can use it to study solar wind at Earth and near the Sun in final mission."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08120v1,Molecular Distributions and Abundances in the Binary-Shaped Outflow of V Hya,"Binaries are known to play a key role in the mass loss and dynamical environments of evolved stars. Stellar and sub-stellar companion interactions produce complex wind morphologies including rotating/expanding disks, bipolar outflows, and spiral wind patterns; however, the connection between these many structures and the gas phase chemistry they harbor is not well-constrained. To expand the sample of chemical inventories in interacting systems, we present a detailed spectroscopic case study of the binary C-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star V Hya. Using spatially resolved ALMA observations at Bands 3, 6 and 7, we characterize the rotational emission lines and distributions of molecules in its surrounding disk undergoing dynamical expansion (DUDE). We detect emission from over 15 molecules and isotopologues toward this source, and present resolved maps for the brightest tracers of carbonaceous chemistry (e.g. \ceCCH, \ceC4H, \ceHC5N, \ceHNC, \ceCH3CN). Employing LTE and non-LTE models of emission from the DUDE, we estimate the abundance distributions for optically thin species, and compare them with prototypical carbon-rich AGB envelopes. We find that the average abundances of detected species are within a factor of {\sim}5 from sources with similar mass-loss rates; however, the distribution of daughter species in V Hya is much more compact, with carbon chain species (\ceCCH, \ceC4H, \ceHC3N) appearing with abundances >10-7 even in the innermost sampled regions (200 au) of the disk.","The circumstellar envelopes of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are known for their rich molecular composition and their instrumental role in the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM). It is estimated that these evolved stars contribute {\sim}80% of recycled interstellar gas, {\sim}30% of newly formed dust grains, in addition to a significant fraction of aromatic molecules (Tielens et al., 2005; Zeichner et al., 2023). The type of enrichment is primarily dependent on the surface chemistry of the progenitor star, as circumstellar outflows typically exhibit either oxygen-rich (C/O<1) or carbon-rich (C/O>1) chemistry. In the traditional picture of circumstellar chemistry, gas phase molecules in AGB envelopes are produced in two stages, with parent species forming in the extended stellar atmosphere of the star. Then as they travel outward and the density decreases, kinetics and photochemistry dominate, producing a wide variety of daughter molecules (e.g. Höfner & Olofsson, 2018). For C-rich environments, circumstellar chemistry is primarily understood through observations of the nearby carbon star IRC+10216 and its rich chemistry comprising over 100 uniquely identified molecules (McGuire, 2022); however, the applicability of this example to all other sources is still largely unconstrained. Unnikrishnan et al. (2024) recently studied the chemical inventories of three carbon stars with comparable mass-loss rates to IRC+10216 (II Lup, V358 Lup, and AI Vol), finding molecular abundances consistent across sources, indicating that IRC+10216 is indeed a good prototype for this chemistry. A remaining question; however, is whether this molecular framework changes when moving to more dynamically complex stellar wind structures that we now know to be commonplace. Recently, the prevalence of binary interactions has greatly impacted our understanding of dynamical evolution in AGB and Red Supergiant (RSG) environments. The ATOMIUM111ALMA tracing the origins of molecules forming dust in oxygen-rich M-type stars survey revealed a vast array of AGB wind morphologies likely induced by stellar and substellar companions (Decin et al., 2020). These structures can be broadly categorized into two groups, depending on orbital characteristics of the system. Spirals structures are associated with high mass-loss rates and wide companions, and can be observed in objects such as CIT 6, AFGL 3068, and R Scl (Kim et al., 2015; Guerrero et al., 2020; Maercker et al., 2016). In contrast, equatorial density enhancements and disks are more prominent in short period systems, like \pi^{1} Gru and R Aqr (Chiu et al., 2006; Liimets et al., 2018). In addition to the dynamical shaping, stellar companions are believed to have an impact on the chemistry of their surrounding envelope. This was first found theoretically by Van de Sande & Millar (2022), who showed that embedded binaries can provide sufficient visible and UV flux to drive photochemistry at locations in the envelope where it is usually inefficient. Siebert et al. (2022) later invoked a solar-type binary companion to reproduce observed abundances of \ceHC3N in the inner layers of IRC+10216. Furthermore, Danilovich et al. (2024) recently found evidence of companion-driven chemistry imprinted in the outflow of the highly elliptical system W Aql. The full scope of binary-outflow chemical interactions are still not well-constrained, and given the range of physical structures produced in these environments, unbiased line surveys of objects at different stages of evolution are crucial to building up this picture. V Hya is a C-rich AGB star at a distance of 400 pc (Sahai et al., 2022) with a strongly-interacting, short-period stellar companion (P{\sim}17 yr, a{\sim}11 au Planquart et al., 2024). It displays a far-UV excess which could be associated with this companion or an accompanying accretion disk (Sahai et al., 2008). On much larger scales, V Hya is surrounded by a disk undergoing dynamical expansion (DUDE) comprising several concentric toroidal rings, in addition to episodic bipolar bullet-like ejections (Hirano et al., 2004; Sahai et al., 2009, 2016; Scibelli et al., 2019). The observed total mass-loss rate of these components is quite high (2.45\times 10^{-5} M☉ yr-1; Knapp et al., 1997)222Sum of mass-loss rates derived from three observed velocity components at 15, 45, and 200 km s-1, indicating it is a very evolved source nearing the end of the AGB. The equatorial structure and hints of bipolarity in V Hya suggest the beginnings of the much more dramatic morphologies that are common in proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe) (Olofsson et al., 2019; Sahai et al., 2017). The dense waists of these post-AGB objects have been shown as efficient sites of dust growth during this period of rapid stellar evolution (Sahai et al., 2006), so characterizing molecular processing in their nascent stages is relevant to understanding their overall chemical yields. V Hya is a unique transitory source that is well-poised to reveal new insights into chemistry in this important type of binary-induced geometry. In this paper, we present an interferometric spectral line study of this source using available ALMA data to constrain its gas phase molecular inventory. Using these observations we aim to characterize the dominant chemical processes throughout this unique source, and compare it with previous studies of more spherical C-rich AGB targets. In Section 2, we summarize the observations and data reduction. In Section 3, we present the spectra and detected molecular lines, as well as spatially resolved maps of key species. Finally, in Section 4, we discuss excitation mechanisms, and use multiple methods to derive abundances of chemical species in the disk of V Hya.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08099v1,"Evolution of binaries containing a hot subdwarf and a white dwarf to double white dwarfs, and double detonation supernovae with hypervelocity runaway stars","Compact binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs have the potential to evolve into a variety of explosive transients. These systems could also explain hypervelocity runaway stars such as US 708. We use the detailed binary evolution code MESA to evolve hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars interacting in binaries. We explore their evolution towards double detonation supernovae, helium novae, or double white dwarfs. Our grid of 3120 models maps from initial conditions such as orbital period and masses of hot subdwarf and white dwarf to these outcomes. The minimum amount of helium required to ignite the helium shell that leads to a double detonation supernova in our grid is \approx 0.05\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}, likely too large to produce spectra similar to normal type Ia supernovae, but compatible with inferred helium shell masses from some observed peculiar type I supernovae. We also provide the helium shell masses for our double white dwarf systems, with a maximum He shell mass of \approx 0.18\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}. In our double detonation systems, the orbital velocity of the surviving donor star ranges from \approx 450\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}} to \approx 1000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}. Among the surviving donors, we also estimate the runaway velocities of proto-white dwarfs, which have higher runaway velocities than hot subdwarf stars of the same mass. Our grid will provide a first-order estimate of the potential outcomes for the observation of binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs from future missions like Gaia, LSST, and LISA.","Hot subdwarfs are stripped helium (He) stars that burn He in their core with little to no hydrogen (H) envelope (Heber, 1986, 2016). Studies such as Han et al. (2002, 2003) suggest that binary interactions such as stable or unstable mass transfer plays a major role in the formation of hot subdwarfs. Observations provide evidence that most of the hot subdwarfs are found with binary companions (e.g., Pelisoli et al., 2020). Further, a significant fraction of hot subdwarfs are found in close orbits (P_{\mathrm{orb}}\sim 10\,\text{days}) with white dwarfs (WDs), which are likely post common envelope systems (Han et al., 2002, 2003). Figure 1: A schematic diagram representing possible evolution channels of a hot subdwarf + WD binary to a double white dwarf, a double detonation supernova or a He nova. Double detonation supernovae and He novae result from systems that undergo mass transfer and later experience thermonuclear instability in the He layer on the surface of the WD. The differentiation between double detonation supernova and He nova is based on the He layer’s critical density (see Sec. 2.3). Double white dwarfs result from systems that either evolve in isolation or involve episodes of accretion but do not enter unstable nuclear burning. Compact binaries containing hot subdwarfs and WDs have gained significant interest following the discovery of a super-Chandrasekhar binary by Maxted et al. (2000). This binary is particularly interesting as a potential Type Ia supernova progenitor (but, see also Ergma et al. 2001 for other outcomes). The number of discoveries of binaries containing hot subdwarfs with WD companions has steadily increased (e.g., Napiwotzki et al., 2004; Geier et al., 2013; Vennes et al., 2012). Large spectroscopic studies have been characterizing binaries containing hot subdwarfs (e.g., Schaffenroth et al., 2022). In addition to those detached binaries, Kupfer et al. (2020a, b) identified binaries in which the hot subdwarf is Roche-lobe filling. Furthermore, some of recent the observed binaries such as CD-30°11223 (Vennes et al., 2012; Geier et al., 2013) and HD 265435 (Pelisoli et al., 2021) are verification binaries for LISA (for more details see Kupfer et al. 2024) and suggested progenitors of double donation supernovae (Kupfer et al., 2022). Interacting hot subdwarf + WD binaries could potentially result either in an explosion only in the He shell of the WD (a He nova, Kato et al. 2000; Gianninas et al. 2010; Piersanti et al. 2014) or a thermonuclear explosion of a WD (probably as a supernova type Ia, Whelan & Iben 1973; Iben & Tutukov 1984). The thermonuclear explosion of the WD could result from a Chandrasekhar mass explosion (Yoon & Langer, 2003; Wang et al., 2009; Brooks et al., 2016) or from a sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonation explosion due to He accretion. In the double detonation mechanism, He-accreting WDs undergo the first detonation in the He shell that triggers the second detonation in the C/O core leading to a thermonuclear supernova. The He donor channel as a mechanism to produce a double detonation was already investigated in the early 1980s by Taam (1980a, b), Nomoto (1982a, b). Later studies by Livne (1990), Livne & Glasner (1990), Langer (1991), Livne & Glasner (1991), Fink et al. (2007), and Fink et al. (2010) further explored He-accreting WDs and established that they are promising channels for SNe Ia. However, they also estimated that single degenerate double detonations require thick He shells which likely will lead to spectra representing a peculiar supernova Ia. The light curve of ZTF18aaqeasu (also known as SN 2018byg and ATLAS 18pqq), De et al. (2019), suggests that it is a double detonation supernova with a massive He shell (\sim 0.15\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}). This thick He shell aligns with predictions by Bauer et al. (2017) for a hot subdwarf + WD binary (CD-30°11223). On the contrary, studies by Sim et al. (2010), Kromer et al. (2010), and Woosley & Kasen (2011) also explored channels that would enable the synthetic spectra to resemble a “normal” Type Ia supernova. Furthermore, Wang et al. (2013) and Neunteufel et al. (2016) probe the He star + WD binary channels as a potential single-degenerate double detonation mechanism. In addition, some studies explored the effects of WD rotation (Yoon & Langer, 2004) and magnetic fields (Neunteufel et al., 2017) on He ignition. He donor channels are also interesting as a mechanism to produce hypervelocity runway stars such as US 708. Should there be a full explosion of the WD, the hot subdwarf can be ejected at very high velocities (Justham et al., 2009; Wang & Han, 2009). This mechanism can explain some of the observed population of hypervelocity runaway stars with velocities of \sim 1000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}} (Geier et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2015; Neunteufel, 2020; Neunteufel et al., 2022). Given the increasing number of observed hot subdwarf and white dwarf binaries, interest in understanding the fate of these systems has been growing. Our galaxy contains at least 10^{3}-10^{4} hot subdwarf + WD binaries that are likely to interact within the subdwarf lifetime (Bauer & Kupfer, 2021). Despite detailed modeling studies of individual systems, the literature still lacks a broad study of binary spatial configurations that lead to double detonation supernovae. The purpose of this paper is to map the initial binary configurations of hot subdwarf and WD binaries to their fates: double detonation supernovae, He novae, and double white dwarfs. In this study, we use the 1D stellar evolution code mesa to simulate a dense grid of hot subdwarf + WD binaries. Unlike some of the previous studies, we also model the accreting WD. We simultaneously evolve both the donor and accretor, including binary interactions, aiming to address two main objectives: 1) Identifying the region of initial parameter space that distinguishes the fate of the systems, and determining whether they evolve into double detonation supernovae, He novae, or double white dwarfs, and characterize the properties of any surviving system or object 2) Investigating the velocities of the runaway hot subdwarf in the event of double detonation supernovae, thereby providing constraints to observed runaway stars. The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we explain our methods. Section 3 illustrates examples of three distinct outcomes under consideration: a double detonation supernova, He nova, or a double white dwarf. We present the fate of the binaries across our parameter space in Section 4. In Section 5 we give more details about the final state of the binaries, and in particular, runaway velocities in 5.2. We discuss the results in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08159v1,Two Super-Jupiters around M-dwarfs – Signatures of Instability or Accretion?,"We present the discovery of TOI-6303b and TOI-6330b, two massive transiting super-Jupiters orbiting a M0 and a M2 star respectively, as part of the Searching for GEMS survey. These were detected by TESS and then confirmed via ground-based photometry and radial velocity observations with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF). TOI-6303b has a mass of 7.84 \pm 0.31 MJ, a radius of 1.03 \pm 0.06 RJ, and an orbital period of 9.485 days. TOI-6330b has a mass of 10.00 \pm 0.31 MJ, a radius of 0.97 \pm 0.03 RJ, and an orbital period of 6.850 days. We put these planets in context of super-Jupiters around M-dwarfs discovered from radial-velocity surveys, as well as recent discoveries from astrometry. These planets have masses that can be attributed to two dominant planet formation mechanisms — gravitational instability and core-accretion. Their masses necessitate massive protoplanetary disks that should either be gravitationally unstable, i.e. forming through gravitational instability, or be amongst some of the most massive protoplanetary disks to form objects through core-accretion. We also discuss the eccentricity distribution of these objects, as a potential indicator of their formation and evolutionary mechanisms.","M-dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the Milky Way (Henry et al., 2006; Reylé et al., 2021). Searches for habitable and Earth-like worlds largely focus on these systems due to the close-in nature of their habitable zones (HZs; Kasting et al., 1993; Scalo et al., 2007; Kopparapu et al., 2013; Childs et al., 2022), and relatively higher planetary detection amplitudes through deeper transit dips, larger RV semi-amplitudes, and more advantageous star-planet contrast ratios when compared to FGK stars. Previous efforts have provided occurrence rates of terrestrial planets around these types of stars (Dressing & Charbonneau, 2015; Hardegree-Ullman et al., 2019; Hsu et al., 2020; Ment & Charbonneau, 2023), even though the occurrence rate of habitable-zone planets around M-dwarf stars is still debated (Bergsten et al., 2023). HZ/terrestrial planets can be affected by their giant planet companions (Childs et al., 2019; Schlecker et al., 2021; Bitsch & Izidoro, 2023). Around M-dwarfs, giant and terrestrial planets have yet to be seen in the same system. This is derived from a lack of observed giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars (GEMS). An increase in observed GEMS with precise mass measurements and orbital characteristics would enhance our ability to determine the frequency of giant planets around M-dwarfs and the effects terrestrial and giant planets have on one another. Additionally, we would increase our understanding of giant planet formation around M-dwarfs. Core-accretion is the commonly accepted formation pathway for close-in giant planets (\gtrsim 8 R_{\oplus}) (Fischer & Valenti, 2005; Narang et al., 2018). This formation is a ‘bottom-up’ approach to planetary formation where an \sim 10 M⊕ core is accreted followed by an exponential gas accretion that forms the planet’s gaseous envelope. The alternate mode of formation is the gravitational instability scenario (Boss, 1997, 2006), which occurs in the protostellar phase of massive disks where the disk fragments into gravitationally bound clumps. It is expected that core-accretion should produce fewer GEMS because of lower disk masses and longer orbital timescales, causing it to be more difficult to reach the exponential runaway gas accretion (Laughlin et al., 2004; Ida & Lin, 2005). NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; Ricker et al., 2014) has enabled the discovery of many Jupiter-sized exoplanets (e.g. Cañas et al., 2020; Kanodia et al., 2023; Hobson et al., 2023; Delamer et al., 2024), and brown dwarfs (e.g. Artigau et al., 2021; Cañas et al., 2022) orbiting M-dwarf stars, which have already started to raise interesting questions about the formation and evolution of these planets (Durisen et al., 2007; Chabrier et al., 2014). However, the current sample size (\sim 30) is insufficient to enable a comprehensive understanding of these systems. We have therefore started the volume limited (< 200 pc) Searching for GEMS survey (Kanodia et al., 2024), to increase the sample size of these planets to \sim 40 transiting GEMS. This will enable robust statistical comparisons of these planets with their FGK counterparts, thereby helping shed light on their formation mechanisms. Studies of giant planet dependence on host star metallicity have shown that the region between \sim 4 and 10 MJ is sparsely populated by giant planets for FGK host stars (Santos et al., 2017; Schlaufman, 2018; Narang et al., 2018). It is believed that this marks the transition between the two giant planet formation mechanisms — core accretion and gravitational instability. This is because the objects below 4 MJ are believed to have formed through core-accretion, whereas those above 10 MJ are formed through gravitational instability (Santos et al., 2017; Schlaufman, 2018; Narang et al., 2018). As part of the Searching for GEMS survey, we present the discovery of two super-Jupiters around early M-dwarfs — TOI-6303b at 7.84 \pm 0.31 MJ and TOI-6330b at 10.00 \pm 0.32 MJ. These objects populate the upper limit of the transition zone between core accretion and gravitational instability. In Section 2 we present our observations of both systems. We detail our photometric observations from TESS, RBO, APO/ARCTIC, and Keeble observatory, precision radial velocities from HPF, and high-contrast speckle imaging from ShaneAO and NESSI. In Section 3 we detail the analysis performed to obtain the stellar parameters and the planetary parameters. In Section 4 we discuss the possible formation paths of these objects and place them in context of the giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Lastly, we summarize our discovery in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08094v1,"Stellar Obliquity Excitation via Disk Dispersal-Driven Resonances in
Binaries","The stellar obliquity of a planetary system is often used to help constrain the system’s formation and evolution. One of the mechanisms to reorient the stellar spin involves a secular resonance crossing due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the system also has an inclined, distant (\sim 300\;\mathrm{AU}) binary companion. This mechanism is likely to operate broadly due to the \sim 50\% binary fraction of FGK dwarfs and can play an important role in setting the initial stellar obliquities prior to any dynamical evolution. In this work, we revisit this mechanism analytically for idealized, homologously evolving disk models and show that the resulting stellar obliquities are broadly distributed between 60^{\circ} and 180^{\circ} for most warm and cold planets. We further show that non-homologus disk dissipation, such as the development of a photoevaporatively-opened gap at \sim 2\;\mathrm{AU}, can help maintain orbital alignment of warm planets, in agreement with observations. Our results represent the proper primordial obliquities for planetary systems with distant binary companions. They also represent the obliquities of stars with no present-day binary companions if these companions are dynamically unbound during the birth cluster phase of evolution, a process that occurs on a comparable timescale as the disk-driven obliquity excitation.","In traditional theories of planet formation, the orbits of planets and the spins of their host stars are expected to be closely aligned, because they form out of the same protoplanetary disks (PPDs). This is motivated by the observed small 7^{\circ} misalignment between the solar spin axis and the normal to the ecliptic (Beck & Giles, 2005). Measurement of this misalignment angle in exoplanetary systems, known as the stellar obliquity111Not to be confused with the “planetary obliquity” of a planet, the misalignment angle between a planet’s spin axis and its own orbit normal. has become moderately widespread in the recent years using various techniques such as the Rossiter-Mclaughlin effect (Rossiter, 1924; McLaughlin, 1924). Surprisingly, a substantial (though still minority) fraction of stellar obliquities are large, including tentative evidence for an excess near 90^{\circ} (Albrecht et al., 2021, but see Dong & Foreman-Mackey, 2023; Siegel et al., 2023). The origin of these large misalignments is currently unknown, and a broad range of causes has been proposed (see Albrecht et al., 2022 for a good review). Distinguishing among these scenarios requires careful studies of various trends in the measured population. Among the measured stellar obliquities (we will refer to these as just “obliquities”), a few notable clues help constrain the mechanisms responsible for misalignments. The most well-known trend is the strong dependence of obliquity on stellar temperature among hot Jupiter hosts: stars with surface temperatures below 6100\;\mathrm{K} have low obliquities, while their hotter counterparts have large obliquities (Winn et al., 2010). This is commonly attributed to dissipation of the tide raised on the star by the hot Jupiter, a process that is much more efficient in the deep convective envelopes present in stars cooler than \sim 6100\;\mathrm{K} (Albrecht et al., 2012; Lai, 2012; Zanazzi et al., 2024). However, recent observations of lower-mass Kepler systems suggest preferential spin-orbit alignment below 6100\;\mathrm{K} as well (Louden et al., 2021, 2024); the tides raised by such low-mass planets are unlikely to be capable of realigning the stellar spin in standard tidal scenarios, as the alignment timescale is inversely proportional to the planet mass. This result is consistent with the general lack of correlation between spin-orbit misalignment and planet properties reported by Albrecht et al. (2021). While the evidence is certainly not yet conclusive, it motivates a closer look at mechanisms for producing spin-orbit misalignment that are largely independent of planetary mass. Many mechanisms fit this constraint; a few that we will not discuss include: magnetic torques (Lai et al., 2011; Foucart & Lai, 2011; Spalding & Batygin, 2015, 2016), stochastically-excited internal gravity waves (Rogers et al., 2012, 2013), stellar spin stochasticity at formation (Bate et al., 2010; Spalding et al., 2014; Fielding et al., 2015), and stellar flybys (Batygin et al., 2020; Rodet et al., 2021). The mechanism that is the focus of this paper was first proposed by Batygin (2012) and involves a star, its surrounding PPD, and a distant binary companion. During the subsequent dissipation of the PPD, the secular precession frequency of the stellar spin driven by disk and that of the disk driven by the binary become commensurate, and the resulting secular resonance crossing excites the obliquity to large values (Batygin & Adams, 2013; Lai, 2014; Spalding & Batygin, 2014; Zanazzi & Lai, 2018a, b; Spalding & Millholland, 2020; Gerbig et al., 2024). The result of this mechanism is a nontrivial distribution of the primordial obliquities. The properties of this distribution have ramifications for the predictions of subsequent secular evolution of the system, such as the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai migration of giant planets (e.g. Vick et al., 2023). Thus, a detailed characterization of the primordial obliquities is of great importance. One attractive feature of this mechanism is that \sim 50\% of FGK stars are in binaries (e.g. Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Raghavan et al., 2010; Tokovinin, 2014), with an increase towards more massive stars (Offner et al., 2023). Morever, binarity statistics in young star-forming environments suggest that binaries may be more common at early stellar ages (e.g. in the Taurus star-forming region; Kraus et al., 2011) and may be rarer in dense star clusters (e.g. in the Orion Nebula Cluster; Reipurth et al., 2007; Duchêne et al., 2018). Taken together, these statistics suggest that the present-day FGK binary fraction of 50\% is likely to be an underestimate of their binarity at formation, which may decrease to its present-day value due to dynamical scattering. It is therefore imperative to account for this disk dissipation-driven resonant obliquity excitation mechanism, as it is likely to operate in a substantial fraction of planet-hosting systems. In this paper, we revisit this disk dissipation-driven misalignment scenario. Our objectives are to provide a compact semi-analytical description of the resulting obliquity distribution in the simplest approximation (i.e. a homologously-disspating rigid disk), then to explore some variations of this result under different initial conditions. In particular, we study the effect of non-homologous disk evolution, in which photoevaporation opens a \sim 2\;\mathrm{AU}. We show that this non-homologous evolution changes the predicted obliquities for planets with semimajor axes \lesssim 1\;\mathrm{AU} compared to the models adopted in the literature. In particular, while the standard disk models result in a prediction of general misalignment for all but the closest Earth and Super Earth-mass planets (which is in disagreement with observation, e.g. Winn et al., 2017; Albrecht et al., 2022), our model results in low primordial obliquities for warm planets \lesssim 1\;\mathrm{AU} (weakly dependent on uncertain disk physics) independent of planet mass. In Section 2, we review the essential theoretical results for our analysis. In Section 3, we present a systematic exploration of the obliquity evolution when assuming a standard, homologously-dissipating disk. In Section 4, we study the effect of including photoevaporative gap opening in the disk evolution. We summarize and discuss in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08092v1,Preparing for the Early eVolution Explorer: Characterizing the photochemical inputs and transit detection efficiencies of young planets using multiwavelength flare observations by TESS and Swift,"Ultraviolet flare emission can drive photochemistry in exoplanet atmospheres and even serve as the primary source of uncertainty in atmospheric retrievals. Additionally, flare energy budgets are not well-understood due to a paucity of simultaneous observations. We present new near-UV (NUV) and optical observations of flares from three M dwarfs obtained at 20 s cadence with Swift and TESS, along with a re-analysis of flares from two M dwarfs in order to explore the energy budget and timing of flares at NUV–optical wavelengths. We find a 9000 K blackbody underestimates the NUV flux by \geq2\times for 54\pm14% of flares and 14.8\times for one flare. We report time lags between the bands of 0.5–6.6 min and develop a method to predict the qualitative flare shape and time lag to 36\pm30% accuracy. The scatter present in optical-NUV relations is reduced by a factor of 2.0\pm0.6 when comparing the total NUV energy with the TESS energy during the FWHM duration due to the exclusion of the T_{\mathrm{eff}}\approx5000 K tail. We show the NUV light curve can be used to remove flares from the optical light curve and consistently detect planets with 20% smaller transits than is possible without flare detrending. Finally, we demonstrate a 10\times increase in the literature number of multi-wavelength flares with the Early eVolution Explorer (EVE), an astrophysics Small Explorer concept to observe young clusters with simultaneous NUV and optical bands in order to detect young planets, assess their photochemical radiation environments, and observe accretion.","The evolution of stellar activity from young stars and the formation of planetary systems are inextricably linked. Heightened levels of stellar emission at X-ray to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths during the pre-main sequence drives atmospheric escape (Owen & Wu, 2013; Lopez & Fortney, 2014; Ribas et al., 2016) and disequilibrium chemistry in planetary atmospheres (Loyd et al., 2018; Tilley et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021). Atmospheric escape models find enhanced X-ray and extreme UV (XUV) emission during the first 100 Myr of the stellar lifetime is responsible for the majority of atmospheric loss for small planets with radii near 2R_{\oplus} (e.g. Owen & Wu 2013; Jin et al. 2014; Lopez & Fortney 2014). At the same time, accretion of material from the inner edge of the protoplanetary disk onto the star is thought to drive stellar angular momentum evolution through both spin up (e.g. Armitage & Clarke 1996; Amard & Matt 2023; Zwintz & Steindl 2022) and disk locking (e.g. Koenigl 1991; Venuti et al. 2017; Rebull et al. 2018). Angular momentum evolution is responsible for changes in the strength and organization of the surface magnetic field with age, leading to a general decrease in stellar activity in the form of spots and flares (e.g. West et al. 2008, 2015; Davenport et al. 2019; Magaudda et al. 2020; Ilin et al. 2021). The enhanced rate of stellar flares at young ages provides a significant contribution to the high-energy radiation environments of planets orbiting young stars (Loyd et al., 2018; Johnstone et al., 2021). Although true of all pre-main sequence stars, the impact of this activity is thought to be most significant for planets orbiting M dwarfs. M dwarfs spin down slowly and experience elevated levels of high-energy radiation throughout their long pre-main sequence phase, which can last up to 200–300 Myr for mid M dwarfs and up to a Gyr for late M-dwarfs (Baraffe et al., 2015; Godolt et al., 2019). As a result, understanding the impact of stellar activity on planetary atmospheres is a necessary precursor to identifying habitable conditions for life as described in “Pathways to Habitable Worlds,” one of three priority areas identified in the 2020 Astronomy Decadal Survey (NASEM, 2023). Flares occur when magnetic reconnection events in the corona accelerate charged particles along field lines toward the photosphere, heating the plasma. Particles with different energies brake at different depths in the stellar atmosphere and produce different amounts of flux at each wavelength (Klein & Dalla, 2017). The far-UV (FUV; 90–170 nm) and near-UV (NUV; 170–320 nm) emission that drive photochemistry in planetary atmospheres originate in the upper chromosphere and transition region and are observed immediately following an episode of electron beam heating (Fleming et al., 2022). Optical emission is the most commonly observed component of the flaring process, results from heating in the lower chromosphere, and typically occurs in two phases. Prompt optical emission with an effective temperature of 9,000–16,000 K occurs first, followed by a more gradual period of emission of \sim5000 K (Kowalski et al., 2016; Howard et al., 2023). Here, we define effective temperature (T_{\mathrm{eff}}) or equivalent color temperature as the blackbody temperature that best fits an observed spectral energy distribution or set of broadband observations (Kowalski, 2024). Transmission spectroscopy observations with JWST are illuminating the role of high-energy stellar radiation for photochemistry in planetary atmospheres. Sulfuric photochemistry has been detected through an SO2 feature at 4.05 \mum in the hydrogen-rich irradiated atmosphere of WASP-39b (Alderson et al., 2023; Rustamkulov et al., 2023; Tsai et al., 2023). A plethora of Cycle 3 JWST programs have now been selected to explore the impact of photochemical processes on the transmission spectrum (GO 5177, PI: Hu; GO 5191, PI: Ducrot; 5311, 5959, Co-PIs: Feinstein & Welbanks; GO 5844, PI: Radica; GO 5863, PI: Murray). Although photochemistry is driven by FUV–NUV radiation, the contribution of emission at these wavelengths to the energy budget of flares remains largely unknown. While the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; Ricker et al. 2014) has observed more than 106 flares from 140,000 stars (Günther et al., 2020; Feinstein et al., 2022a; Yang et al., 2023; Feinstein et al., 2024), simultaneous UV observations exist for only a few dozen events (MacGregor et al., 2021; Paudel et al., 2021; Jackman, 2022; Inoue et al., 2024; Jackman et al., 2024; Paudel et al., 2024). Of these, only 17 flares have been observed during the flare peak and at sub-minute cadence in each band (Inoue et al., 2024; Jackman et al., 2024; Paudel et al., 2024). Longer cadences fail to resolve the structure of the flare peak, which evolves on timescales of \sim1–30 s (Kowalski et al., 2019; Aizawa et al., 2022; Howard & MacGregor, 2022). Simultaneous UV and optical observations of fifteen flares from six stars have also been obtained using facilities besides Swift and TESS (Hawley & Pettersen, 1991; Robinson et al., 1993; Osten et al., 2016; Wargelin et al., 2017; Kowalski et al., 2019; Brasseur et al., 2023; Tristan et al., 2023). The current lack of a statistical sample of simultaneous UV observations prevents us from inferring the photochemical radiation environments of planets from optical flares to within a factor of \sim10 (Paudel et al., 2024). As UV emission from the host star serves as the largest source of uncertainty in photochemical models of small, young planetary atmospheres (Teal et al., 2022) and remains a significant source of uncertainty for larger planets (Hu, 2021; Yu et al., 2021), we require a better understanding of the UV output from stellar flares. Flare emission at UV wavelengths is the largest source of uncertainty because different quiescent spectra result in larger changes to the planetary spectrum than do other model inputs, and because the intensity and spectral shape during flares further increases the uncertainty relative to quiescence. In the absence of simultaneous observations, the UV emission of optical flares is usually estimated assuming a blackbody spectrum with an T_{\mathrm{eff}} of \sim9000 K (e.g. Shibayama et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2017; Günther et al. 2020; Ducrot et al. 2020; do Amaral et al. 2022). This approach is motivated by the observation that many optical flare spectra are well-described by a spectrum reminiscent of an A0 star or hot blackbody of 9000–10,000 K (Hawley & Fisher, 1992; Hawley et al., 2003; Kowalski et al., 2013; Osten & Wolk, 2015). As noted by Jackman et al. (2023), applications of the 9000 K blackbody to scaling optical flare energies into the UV involve various degrees of complexity. For example, some UV-optical relations adjust the spectrum of the 9000 K blackbody by including actual UV flare observations (e.g., Segura et al., 2010; Tilley et al., 2019; Feinstein et al., 2022b; Konings et al., 2022; Louca et al., 2023). However, the accuracy of the 9000 K blackbody scaling is increasingly being called into question as flares are observed in new UV and optical datasets (Jackman et al., 2023; Paudel et al., 2024). Although the UV and optical emission of some flares are consistent with the 9000 K blackbody (Hawley & Pettersen, 1991; Paudel et al., 2021; Inoue et al., 2024), other events are not. Simultaneous optical and NUV Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectroscopy of two flares from the M4 dwarf GJ 1243 show the NUV emission is underestimated by 2-3\times when scaling from the optical using a 9000 K blackbody due to the presence of Fe II and Mg II lines and ionized Balmer continuum below 364 nm (Kowalski et al., 2019). Likewise, the FUV emission of a flare from Proxima Cen observed simultaneously by HST and TESS is underestimated by 12.2\times relative to the 9000 K blackbody (MacGregor et al., 2021). At least 8 flares observed simultaneously with Swift and TESS exceed the NUV flux predicted from the 9000 K blackbody by factors of 3–17 (Paudel et al., 2024), corresponding to T_{\mathrm{eff}} values of 12,000–26,000 K. Non-simultaneous UV and optical flare rates also indicate the UV energies of optical flares are underestimated. Jackman et al. (2023) measure the average flare rates of a sample of 1250 M-dwarfs with GALEX and TESS observations obtained 6–17 years apart. The TESS flare rates are scaled into the FUV and NUV using the 9000 K blackbody and then compared with the observed GALEX NUV flare rates. Jackman et al. (2023) split the sample into partially and fully convective stars and compute empirical correction factors (ECF) for each sample and flare template. They find the NUV energies derived from the 9000 K blackbody must be scaled by ECFs of 2.7\pm0.6 and 6.5\pm0.7 to bring the flare rates into alignment with the GALEX observations of the partially and fully convective stars, respectively. Even small underestimates at NUV wavelengths can correspond to much larger underestimates at FUV wavelengths given the assumption that the flare spectrum is described by a blackbody of T_{\mathrm{eff}}. For example, an ECF of 2.7\pm0.6 in the NUV corresponds to an ECF of 6.4\pm2.8 in the FUV while an ECF of 10\pm1 in the NUV corresponds to an ECF in the FUV of 93\pm11. Deriving energy budgets from average flare rates obtained in two different wavelength regimes is only possible under the assumption that the processes driving emission in both bands are closely coupled. As a result, Jackman et al. (2023) state that simultaneous observations are required to confirm any relationship between flare energy and flare T_{\mathrm{eff}}, and to discover under what conditions NUV flares have optical counterparts. Figure 1: Although flare rates and energies are measured in the optical for most stars, the FUV and NUV energies determine the photochemical radiation environment of orbiting planets during these events. Simultaneous observations at UV and optical wavelengths are needed to derive the energy budget as flares with similar emission levels at optical wavelengths can produce NUV fluxes that differ by 2–20\times depending on the T_{\mathrm{eff}} of the flare, correlating with order-of-magnitude discrepancies at FUV wavelengths. Spectra of \epsilon Eri during the two flares are obtained by superimposing the flare blackbody onto the semi-empirical base spectrum from Behr et al. (2023). Flares also serve as an unpredictable source of stellar contamination in the search for young transiting exoplanets (Newton et al., 2019; Martioli et al., 2021; Gilbert et al., 2022), biasing the transit parameters or even resulting in false negative detections for particularly active systems (Luger et al., 2017; Gilbert et al., 2021; Mann et al., 2022). Although flare contamination is worse at shorter wavelengths, flares observed from the young M-dwarf AU Mic during transits of its two warm Neptunes AU Mic b and c in broadband TESS photometry (600–1000 nm) have been observed to alter the ingress and egress shape, reduce the transit depth, and in some cases largely mask the transit itself (Martioli et al., 2021; Gilbert et al., 2021; Mann et al., 2022). While TESS has been used to detect nearly a dozen new young transiting planets (e.g. Benatti et al. 2019; Newton et al. 2019; Plavchan et al. 2020; Mann et al. 2020; Rizzuto et al. 2020; Tofflemire et al. 2021; Zhou et al. 2021, 2022; Mann et al. 2022; Vach et al. 2022), the increased stellar activity levels of young stars has lead to substantial losses in the yield of young planets with radii R<3R⊕ and orbital periods P_{\mathrm{orb}}>10 d (Newton et al., 2019; Rizzuto et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021). Simultaneous monitoring of many young stars at NUV and red optical wavelengths is needed to determine the relative contribution of flares at UV wavelengths and to mitigate flare contamination in searches for young transiting planets. The Early eVolution Explorer (EVE) is a NASA astrophysics Small Explorer concept to investigate the earliest stages in the shared evolutionary pathways of stars and planets. EVE would obtain simultaneous NUV and red optical photometry of the dense core regions of nearby young moving groups and clusters with ages of approximately 5–100 Myr. The mission would observe 12–24 targeted regions for approximately 30 d each and at cadences of 30–60 s. The addition of the simultaneous NUV band compared to missions like Kepler or TESS enables the measurement of the NUV-optical relation for hundreds to thousands of flares over the mission lifetime from 104 stars of different masses and ages, while providing an independent lever arm to identify and remove photometric scatter in transit light curves due to flares. EVE would determine the degree to which the UV radiation environments of young planets are underestimated from optical observations as a function of flare size and shape in order to constrain the impact of photochemistry on sub-Neptune transmission spectra (Konings et al., 2022; Louca et al., 2023) and biosignature false positives for small planets (Harman et al., 2015). New results from GALEX demonstrate that simultaneous NUV and optical observations with EVE would provide strong constraints on the FUV to NUV ratios of optical flares, which determine the photochemical state of planetary atmospheres. The GALEX observations of the FUV to NUV energy ratios of 182 flares from 158 M dwarfs find that the distribution of FUV/NUV energy ratios of their sample is surprisingly narrow, with a mean and 1\sigma uncertainty of 0.46\pm0.23 (Berger et al., 2023). As a result, a successful NUV-TESS scaling relation would unlock the photochemical radiation environment of the extensive TESS flare archive. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of the EVE flare science objective using new multi-wavelength observations of flares from G 41-14, GJ 674, and EV Lac and new analysis of flares from AP Col and YZ CMi, all obtained simultaneously at 20 s cadence with Swift and TESS. In Section 2, we describe the Swift and TESS observations, data reduction, and identification of simultaneous flare detections. In Section 3, we discuss the methods used to characterize the time lag and energy budget of the flares at each wavelength. In Section 4, we present population-level results for the consistency of the flare energy budget with a 9000 K blackbody at NUV to optical wavelengths. In Section 5, we explore improvements to the transit detection efficiency obtained from the addition of the NUV band. In Section 6, we present simulations of the number of flares required to discriminate between flare samples with energy budgets consistent with the 9000 K assumption and NUV-luminous flares relative to the 9000 K assumption. We then present a list of candidate clusters and a trade study to ensure EVE can feasibly detect a sufficient number of multi-wavelength flares. In Section 7 we discuss the implications of our work to exoplanet photochemistry and to EVE."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07913v1,Rising Near-Ultraviolet Spectra in Stellar Megaflares,"Flares from M-dwarf stars can attain energies up to 10^{4} times larger than solar flares but are generally thought to result from similar processes of magnetic energy release and particle acceleration. Larger heating rates in the low atmosphere are needed to reproduce the shape and strength of the observed continua in stellar flares, which are often simplified to a blackbody model from the optical to the far-ultraviolet (FUV). The near-ultraviolet (NUV) has been woefully undersampled in spectral observations despite this being where the blackbody radiation should peak. We present Hubble Space Telescope NUV spectra in the impulsive phase of a flare with E_{\rm{TESS}}\approx 7.5\times 10^{33} erg and a flare with E_{\rm{TESS}}\approx 10^{35} erg and the largest NUV flare luminosity observed to date from an M star. The composite NUV spectra are not well represented by a single blackbody that is commonly assumed in the literature. Rather, continuum flux rises toward shorter wavelengths into the FUV, and we calculate that an optical T=10^{4} K blackbody underestimates the short wavelength NUV flux by a factor of \approx 6. We show that rising NUV continuum spectra can be reproduced by collisionally heating the lower atmosphere with beams of E\gtrsim 10 MeV protons or E\gtrsim 500 keV electrons and flux densities of 10^{13} erg cm-2 s-1. These are much larger than canonical values describing accelerated particles in solar flares.","Stellar flares are the most dramatic examples of variability that a cool star experiences while on the main sequence. Current understanding (Kowalski, 2024) is that stellar flares are produced as a result of magnetic reconnection in the tenuous outer atmosphere of the star, which happens as a result of the jostling and colliding of magnetic fields that are rooted in the lower stellar atmosphere. Flares involve all layers of the stellar atmosphere, with a variety of physical processes, from plasma heating to particle acceleration to mass motions (Benz & Güdel, 2010; Notsu et al., 2024). These three factors result in flare emissions being produced across the electromagnetic spectrum. While flares on the Sun are the best studied due to the Sun’s proximity, flaring itself is a product of magnetic activity and can be seen on a variety of stars with outer convective envelopes, from pre-main sequence to young solar-type to evolved stars (Yang & Liu, 2019; Okamoto et al., 2021). Apart from solar studies, M dwarfs are the most studied for stellar flares, due to a combination of population statistics (M dwarfs are the most common type of star in the nearby solar neighborhood, Bochanski et al., 2010) and flare statistics (M dwarfs tend to have high flaring rates; Candelaresi et al., 2014; Yang & Liu, 2019). Flare events can have prodigious releases of energy of up to 1036 erg, or more than 10,000 times bigger than the largest solar flares (e.g., Osten et al., 2016; Maehara et al., 2012). In particular, the flare radiation in the ultraviolet (UV) can have significant impacts on nearby potentially habitable planets, which may be either helpful (e.g. Rimmer et al., 2018) or harmful (e.g. Segura et al., 2010; Tilley et al., 2019). The UV spectral region is key to understanding the impacts that flares have on exoplanet habitability by examining their effects on the atmosphere under a variety of assumptions about atmosphere composition and characteristics (Segura, 2018). In early studies of M dwarf flares, Hawley & Fisher (1992) established that the blue-optical flare spectral energy distribution (SED) was consistent with a blackbody of temperature around 104 K. This model was based largely on FUV and optical spectra in the impulsive phase of a flare first studied in Hawley & Pettersen (1991), and it has remained lore in the stellar flare community. The original explanation of the broadband increase, of reprocessing of upper atmospheric (coronal) radiation, was demonstrated in subsequent papers (Allred et al., 2006) to be negligible compared to the energy deposited in the lower atmosphere by electron beams. More recent high-cadence, low-resolution flare spectral atlases have shown the predominance in the blue-optical for a continuum component consistent with such a blackbody, as well as hydrogen Balmer jump emission and higher order Hydrogen Balmer lines (Kowalski et al., 2010, 2013). Despite the evidence for multiple components, the functional form of a single-temperature blackbody has persisted in explaining flare continuum emission from the UV to optical wavelengths (e.g. Loyd et al., 2018b; Günther et al., 2020; Howard et al., 2020; Okamoto et al., 2021; Berger et al., 2024; Feinstein et al., 2024, among many others). Spectroscopic (Froning et al., 2019; Howard et al., 2023) and broadband (Brasseur et al., 2023; Paudel et al., 2024) investigations have started to consider multi-component models from the FUV to the NIR, but spectra that span the Balmer jump can be helpful in limiting the parameter space and breaking degeneracies (Kowalski et al., 2019). The optical and ultraviolet portions of the flare radiation trace emission produced in the lower stellar atmosphere. It was perplexing given the generally good agreement between solar and stellar flares in terms of scaling relations for plasma heating (e.g. Shibata & Yokoyama, 1999, 2002) that the large optical continuum enhancements seen in M dwarf flares could not be reproduced using solar flare models (Allred et al., 2006). Current state-of-the-art radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) models of solar and stellar flares (Allred et al., 2005; Kowalski et al., 2017b) have demonstrated an ability to reproduce continuum flare features as well as the strongest line emission, in the NUV through blue-optical (see also Brasseur et al., 2023) through the action of accelerated particles impacting the lower stellar atmosphere. Solar studies generally utilize hard X-ray observations of nonthermal bremsstrahlung emission and radio observations to diagnose the presence and action of accelerated particles (Holman et al., 2011; Kontar et al., 2011; White et al., 2011). The former is not available for stellar studies due to sensitivity issues, and radio observations in the microwave regime have not had the frequency coverage to constrain the properties of the accelerated particles in stellar flares (Osten et al., 2005). Earlier studies (Güdel et al., 1996) have suggested a disconnect in particle acceleration relative to plasma heating for the stellar flares studied versus solar flares. Also, the large gap between solar and stellar optical continuum flares in energy-duration diagrams can be attributed to physical scaling relations that imply larger magnetic fields (and flaring volumes) in active stars (Maehara et al., 2015; Namekata et al., 2017, and see also studies of X-ray superflares, such as Favata et al. 2000 and Osten et al. 2016). Confirmation that the UV spectral region can diagnose the characteristics of magnetic energy and accelerated particles in stellar flares would open new regimes for exploring solar-stellar connections. Stellar flares have been studied at UV wavelengths predominantly in the FUV (e.g., Hawley et al., 2003; France et al., 2016; Loyd et al., 2018b) for many decades, and current generations of planet transit hunting telescopes like TESS and Kepler routinely pick up the optical counterparts of these events (Davenport, 2016; Günther et al., 2020). Despite this seemingly advanced topic, recent discoveries have thrown doubt on how well we understand the stellar flare process. Some of this arises from the relative lack of observations in the NUV wavelength region, despite this being where such a 104 K blackbody would peak. Surprisingly, in a recent multi-wavelength flare study, only 25% of NUV flares on M dwarfs had an optical counterpart (Paudel et al., 2024), and some NUV flares clearly show a much greater response than a T\approx 9000-10^{4} K blackbody would predict from the available optical constraints (Jackman, 2022; Brasseur et al., 2023; Jackman et al., 2023, and see also Kowalski et al. 2019). These results motivate renewed scrutiny of the NUV spectral region in stellar flares and form the basis of an HST Treasury program designed to use the NUV as a “fulcrum” to bridge the more often-studied FUV and the very well-studied optical regions (HST Guest Observer 17464 “From High-Energy Particle Beam Heating in Stars to Ozone Destruction in Planets: NUV Spectra as the Fulcrum for a Comprehensive Understanding of Flaring M Dwarf Systems”). In the following sections, we describe early results from this Treasury program, highlighting two remarkable events and what they can tell us about physical processes at work in stellar flares. Section 2 describes the data, § 3 the light curve and spectral analysis, § 4 application of RHD models to understand the continuum and line emission, § 5 discusses the results, and § 6 concludes. Appendix A describes the data reduction and Appendices B and C present light curves and flare spectra that supplement the figures in the main text."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07903v1,Multi-spacecraft observations of the decay phase of solar energetic particle events,"Context. Parameters of solar energetic particle (SEP) event profiles such as the onset time and peak time have been researched extensively to obtain information on acceleration and transport of SEPs. Corotation of particle-filled magnetic flux tubes with the Sun is generally thought to play a minor role in determining intensity profiles. However recent simulations have suggested that corotation has an effect on SEP decay phases, depending on the location of the observer with respect to the active region (AR) associated with the event.Aims. We aim to determine whether signatures of corotation are present in observations of decay phases of SEP events and study how the parameters of the decay phase depend on the properties of the flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with the events.Methods. We analyse multi-spacecraft observations of SEP intensity profiles from 11 events between 2020 and 2022, using data from SOLO, PSP, STEREO-A, and SOHO. We determine the decay time constant, \tau in 3 energy channels; electrons \sim 1 MeV, protons \sim 25 MeV, and protons \sim 60 MeV. We study the dependence of \tau on the longitudinal separation, \Delta\phi, between source active region (AR) and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint on the Sun.Results. Within individual events there is a tendency for the decay time constant to decrease with increasing \Delta\phi, in agreement with test particle simulations. The intensity of the associated flare and speed of the associated CMEs have a strong effect on the measured \tau values and are likely the cause of the observed large inter-event variability.Conclusions. We conclude that corotation has a significant effect on the decay phase of a solar energetic particle event and should be included in future simulations and interpretations of these events.","Solar energetic particles (SEPs), accelerated by shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and during flares, in gradual and impulsive events respectively, are detected as sporadic increases of particle intensities up to and past 1 au from the Sun (Klein & Dalla, 2017) by spacecraft in interplanetary space. Typical SEP time-intensity profiles have a rise phase, a peak intensity, and a decay phase. Decay phases, from peak to background levels, can last anywhere between a few hours to several days (Van Allen & Krimigis, 1965). Historically, the analysis of SEP profiles has been based on one spacecraft observing many events from different source locations on the Sun. This allows investigation into how source location affects time profiles (Cane et al., 1988), however, this kind of study cannot separate differences caused by observer location from those caused by the fact that events are produced by different solar eruptions, and that solar wind conditions vary from event-to-event. Presently we are in a golden era of SEP research, with multiple spacecraft capable of taking simultaneous SEP measurements in different locations in interplanetary space. This allows us to compare profiles seen in different locations from the same source active region (AR), reducing effects from parameters which change event-to-event. Multiple spacecraft around the Sun also allows for more frequent particle observations as with more spacecraft there is a higher chance that an event will be observed. Decay phases of SEP events were originally thought to be indicative of the turbulence-induced scattering experienced by SEPs in interplanetary space before reaching the observer. It was thought that longer decay phases resulted from stronger scattering conditions, and shorter decay phases resulted from weaker scattering conditions. A value for the scattering mean free path was derived by fitting the intensity profile (Kallenrode et al., 1992) as modelled via 1D focussed transport. The gradual and impulsive scheme for events came about in the 1990’s, linking acceleration of SEPs to CME-driven shocks for gradual events. The duration of the decay phase for gradual events has since been thought to be related to time-extended shock acceleration, especially at low energies, such that a longer acceleration leads to a longer duration of the decay phase (Reames et al., 1996). In addition to turbulence and acceleration duration, solar rotation can also affect the temporal profile of an SEP event. The outward flow of the solar wind from the Sun generates magnetic flux tubes that are wound into the Parker spiral by the Sun’s rotation. As the Sun spins, the magnetic flux tubes also rotate with the Sun from the east to the west. This effect is referred to as corotation (McCracken et al., 1971). From an intuitive point of view, one would expect some effects of corotation on SEP intensity profiles. Neglecting significant cross-field diffusion, once SEPs are injected into space, corotation causes particle-filled magnetic flux tubes to be ‘pulled’ along towards the west over time, relative to an observer. This means that when an observer views an event from an eastern source region the filled flux tubes are rotating towards them, and when an observer views a western event the filled flux tubes are rotating away from them. This would affect the decay phase, with western events in particular being cut short. If corotation has a significant effect on decay phases of SEP events, this east-west difference should be visible in comparisons of decay phase duration against observer location. Some studies have included corotation such as Giacalone & Jokipii (2012) and Laitinen et al. (2018). Giacalone & Jokipii (2012) simulated impulsive events and included corotation through the movement of field lines over time. They stated that rotation of the field line, along with other transport effects, allows these compact events to be seen at wide longitudes. Laitinen et al. (2018) used a simple 1D diffusion model to simulate SEP propagation from a flare-like injection, and compared simulations with and without corotation. They concluded that corotation affects the event profiles, citing decay phase and intensity differences at different longitudes with respect to source ARs. Daibog et al. (2006) used single-spacecraft observations to investigate the effects of observer longitude on proton intensity profiles. They concluded that the trend they observed is due to the rotational effect discussed in McCracken et al. (1971). However, in the study and modelling of gradual SEP events the role of corotation is usually neglected. This is based upon the results of 1D focussed transport models that included corotation in an approximate way (Lario et al., 1998; Kallenrode & Wibberenz, 1997) and concluded it has negligible effects. Reames et al. (1997) also concluded it does not play an important role, by analysing a few SEP events displaying spatially and temporally invariant spectra. Recent 3D test particle modelling of SEPs injected by a wide shock-like source has suggested that corotation has a significant effect on the decay phases of SEP events. Hutchinson et al. (2023a) ran simulations of SEP propagation which modelled particle transport with and without corotation. They found that including corotation had a notable effect on decay phases with the decay time constant \tau displaying a dependence on the longitudinal separation between source active region and observer footpoint (their Figure 3). Lario (2010) used single-spacecraft observations to investigate decay phases of near relativistic electron events. Figure 10 in their paper analysed the dependence of \tau on source AR longitude. They did not find any dependence of \tau on source AR longitude in their dataset. This work aims to investigate SEP decay phases during 11 multi-spacecraft events. We use data from 4 spacecraft: Solar Orbiter (SolO), the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory - Ahead (STEREO-A). We analyse data for protons and electrons and fit the intensity profiles to obtain the value of the decay time constant \tau. We analyse the dependence of \tau on the relative location between observers and the source AR of the event, as well as the parameters of the solar events accelerating the particles. We aim to investigate possible signatures of corotation and compare any results to those of the simulations of Hutchinson et al. (2023a). In Section 2 we discuss the methodology used to find decay time constant values for the measured intensity-time profiles. In Section 3 we present our results, comparing \tau values with the locations of the observing spacecraft relative to the active region and the parameters of each event. In Section 4 we present our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07876v1,Bidirectional propagating brightenings in arch filament systems observed by Solar Orbiter/EUI,"Arch filament systems (AFSs) are chromospheric and coronal manifestations of emerging magnetic flux. Using high spatial resolution observations taken at a high cadence by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board Solar Orbiter, we identified small-scale elongated brightenings within the AFSs. These brightenings appear as bidirectional flows along the threads of AFSs. For our study, we investigated the coordinated observations of the AFSs acquired by the EUI instrument and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) on 2022 March 4 and 17. We analyzed 15 bidirectional propagating brightenings from EUI 174 Å images. These brightenings reached propagating speeds of 100–150 km s-1. The event observed on March 17 exhibits blob-like structures, which may be signatures of plasmoids and due to magnetic reconnection. In this case, we also observed counterparts in the running difference slit-jaw images in the 1400 Å passbands taken by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Most events show co-temporal intensity variations in all AIA EUV passbands. Together, this implies that these brightenings in the AFSs are dominated by emission from cool plasma with temperatures well below 1 MK. The Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) on board Solar Orbiter provides photospheric magnetograms at a similar spatial resolution as EUI and from the same viewing angle. The magnetograms taken by PHI show signatures of flux emergence beneath the brightenings. This suggests that the events in the AFSs are triggered by magnetic reconnection that may occur between the newly emerging magnetic flux and the preexisting magnetic field structures in the middle of the AFSs. This would also give a natural explanation for the bidirectional propagation of the brightenings near the apex of the AFSs. The interaction of the preexisting field and the emerging flux may be important for mass and energy transfer within the AFSs.","Arch filament systems (AFSs) form over magnetic polarity inversion lines (PILs) in active regions and connect magnetic patches of opposite polarity. They are manifestations of emerging magnetic flux (e.g., Zwaan, 1985) and appear as parallel dark fibrils in the chromosphere (e.g., Bruzek, 1967). Simulations of flux emergence can reproduce many properties of AFSs, such as their flow patterns and filamentary structures (e.g., Shibata et al., 1989; Fan, 2001; Isobe et al., 2006). Magnetic reconnection between the newly emerging magnetic flux associated with the AFSs and the preexisting magnetic field structures may produce extreme ultraviolet (EUV) brightenings (e.g., Tarr et al., 2014), coronal loops (e.g., Longcope et al., 2005), and flares (e.g., Zuccarello et al., 2008; Su et al., 2018). Because of the absorption of hydrogen and helium continua, AFSs can be recognized as dark structures in coronal images in EUV wavelengths (e.g., Mein et al., 2001), and transient loop-like brightenings occasionally occur within AFSs (e.g., Deng et al., 2000). Numerical simulations of filaments suggest that turbulent heating at their footpoints can produce elongated threads at coronal temperatures within the filaments through evaporation (Zhou et al., 2020). Based on High-Resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C; Rachmeler et al., 2019) observations at the 172 Å passband with a spatial resolution of \sim500 km, Tiwari et al. (2019) found that the loop-like brightenings within an AFS originate from the footpoints. These brightenings are related to flux cancellation in the photosphere, inferring that the events are triggered by magnetic reconnection near the footpoints of the AFS. In addition, Panesar et al. (2019) reported jet-like events also from Hi-C 2.1 observations and proposed that these events are triggered by flux cancellation and associated mini-filament eruption. In two-dimensional scenarios, magnetic reconnection can produce bidirectional outflows (Priest, 2014). The bidirectional flows have been revealed in spectroscopic observations of flares (e.g., Hara et al., 2011) and explosive events (e.g., Innes et al., 1997), often serving as evidence for magnetic reconnection. In addition, plasmoid instability can segment current sheets with high Lundquist numbers and is important for fast energy release during magnetic reconnection (e.g., Furth et al., 1963; Biskamp, 2000). Blob-like structures in solar observations are often explained as an observable proxy of plasmoids produced during fast magnetic reconnection, and they have been found in various types of events (e.g., Takasao et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2018; Rouppe van der Voort et al., 2023; Cheng et al., 2023; Hou et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2024), but observations of such blob-like structures are still limited due to their small scales. The High Resolution Imager (HRI) of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI; Rochus et al., 2020) on board Solar Orbiter (Müller et al., 2020) at the 174 Å passband (HRIEUV) takes coronal observations with unprecedentedly high spatial and temporal resolution. Recent observations taken by HRIEUV have revealed ubiquitous campfires (Berghmans et al., 2021; Panesar et al., 2021; Zhukov et al., 2021) in the quiet Sun regions and pico-flare jets (Chitta et al., 2023) in the coronal holes. Additionally, HRIEUV has also made it possible to resolve substructures in various types of small-scale events and capture their temporal evolution. For example, bidirectional moving structures in small-scale loops (e.g., Chitta et al., 2021; Li, 2022) and plasmoids in jets (Mandal et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023) have been seen in the images taken by HRIEUV. Emission patterns from the cores of active regions with plasma temperatures in excess of 3 MK (e.g., Tripathi et al., 2011) are thought to be the signature of nanoflares (Viall & Klimchuk, 2011), which are a direct manifestation of magnetic reconnection (Klimchuk, 2015). Thus, active region cores and structures within, including AFSs, are good observational targets to investigate the properties of blobs and further understanding of the spatial and temporal scales of magnetic reconnection operating in the corona. In this paper, we report on bidirectional propagating brightenings in the AFSs in the core of the active regions observed by HRIEUV. The HRIEUV observations, with a cadence as high as 3 s and a pixel size of images of \sim135 km taken during the perihelion of Solar Orbiter, make it possible to resolve the blob-like structures within the brightening and study their dynamics. Furthermore, we examine magnetic field maps in the photosphere to investigate the generation mechanisms of the loop-like brightenings."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07868v1,Temperature and density profiles in the corona of main-sequence stars induced by stochastic heating in the chromosphere,"All but the most massive main-sequence stars are expected to have a rarefied and hot (million-Kelvin) corona like the Sun. How such a hot corona is formed and supported has not been completely understood yet, even in the case of the Sun. Recently, Barbieri et al. (2024a, b) introduced a new model of a confined plasma atmosphere and applied it to the solar case, showing that rapid, intense, intermittent and short-lived heating events in the high chromosphere can drive the coronal plasma into a stationary state with temperature and density profiles similar to those observed in the solar atmosphere. In this paper we apply the model to main-sequence stars, showing that it predicts the presence of a solar-like hot and rarefied corona for all such stars, regardless of their mass. However, the model is not applicable as such to the most massive main-sequence stars, because the latter lack the convective layer generating the magnetic field loop structures supporting a stationary corona, whose existence is assumed by the model. We also discuss the role of stellar mass in determining the shape of the temperature and density profiles.","The density of the Sun steadily decreases from its center to the outermost layer of its atmosphere, the corona, which is extremely rarefied, being more than one million times less dense than the surface (photosphere). On the contrary, the temperature of the Sun decreases only up to the first layers of the atmosphere above the photosphere, and then starts to increase reaching millions of Kelvins in the corona, which is therefore more than two hundred times hotter than the photosphere (Golub & Pasachoff, 2009). This temperature increase while density decreases, often referred to as “temperature inversion”, happens quite abruptly. Most of both the temperature jump and the density drop occur in the so-called “transition region”, a thin (only hundreds of kilometers wide) layer separating the lowest layer of the Sun’s atmosphere, the chromosphere, from the corona. Most of the plasma in the corona is organized in loops, following the magnetic field lines which exit the photosphere and then re-enter it, and emits radiation in the X band (Aschwanden, 2005). An X-ray emission has been detected in many other main-sequence stars, regardless of the spectral type (Pallavicini, 1989; Gudel, 2004; Ness, J.-U. et al., 2004). Since all the main-sequence stars with mass M<1.5\,M_{\odot} have a convective region below the photosphere where a Sun-like magnetic field originates (see e.g. Maoz, 2007), the X-ray emission is thought to be of coronal origin and all the late-type (from late spectral type A onwards) main-sequence stars are thought to have a corona analogous to the solar one, organized in loop structures and with a temperature around 10^{6} K. A strong hint at the presence of a corona made up of Sun-like magnetic structures is that the relation between the X-ray luminosity and the magnetic field strength follows the same power law in both the Sun’s active regions (Fisher et al., 1998) and the atmospheres of less massive main-sequence stars (Pevtsov et al., 2003). The case of the most massive main-sequence stars (i.e., O, B and up to early-A spectral type) is different because these stars lack a convective region below the photosphere and therefore should not have a solar-like magnetic field able to support a stationary corona: the X-ray emission from these stars is not attributed to a coronal activity but rather to strong winds and shocks (Pallavicini, 1989; Gudel, 2004). Despite decades of investigation, the mechanism producing the million-Kelvin corona of the Sun (and of the other stars as well) is largely not yet understood. This open problem is referred to as the coronal heating problem (Klimchuk, 2006; Parnell & De Moortel, 2012). Most efforts have been conducted along the lines of finding suitable mechanisms able to transport energy from the lower layers to coronal heights, or to release energy stored in the magnetic field, and to efficiently dissipate such an energy in the corona (Parker, 1972; Dmitruk & Gomez, 1997; Gudiksen & Nordlund, 2005; Rappazzo et al., 2008; Rappazzo & Parker, 2013; Wilmot-Smith, 2015; Heyvaerts & Priest, 1983; Ionson, 1978; Howson et al., 2020; Pontieu et al., 2011). Scudder (1992a, b) proposed a different approach, observing that collisions in the very dilute coronal plasma are rare and therefore the corona might be out of thermal equilibrium. Thus, if the velocity distribution functions of the particles at the base of the corona, i.e., in the upper chromosphere, are non-Maxwellian, and in particular have suprathermal tails (i.e., the probability of finding fast particles is larger than in a Maxwellian), then faster particles are able to climb higher in the gravitational potential well. As a result, the temperature increases with height while the density decreases. Such a mechanism was dubbed “velocity filtration” or “gravitational filtering”. At variance with the above-mentioned approaches, Scudder’s model does not involve any local deposition of heat in the corona and is able to reproduce coronal temperatures and densities; however, it predicts a smooth change of the latter quantities, without a transition region, and its basic assumption of non-Maxwellian distribution functions for particles in the collisional chromosphere is difficult to justify. In the highly collisional environment of the Sun’s chromosphere, any deviation from thermal distributions is expected to be extremely short-lived. Therefore, particles’ distribution functions in the chromosphere are expected to be thermal. This notwithstanding, the chromosphere is a very dynamic environment and its temperature is expected to fluctuate in space and time (Molnar et al., 2019). Starting from this observation, Barbieri et al. (2024a, b) recently reconsidered Scudder’s pioneering intuition, replacing the (hardly justifiable) assumption of non-thermal distributions in the high chromosphere with the hypothesis of a fluctuating temperature in an otherwise fully collisional and thermal chromosphere. Barbieri et al. (2024a, b) showed that rapid, intense, intermittent and short-lived temperature increments in the high chromosphere are able to drive the above plasma atmosphere towards a stationary configuration with an inverted temperature-density profile, with a transition region and a hot corona very similar to the observed one (Yang, S. H. et al., 2009), but for the fact that the transition region predicted by the model is thicker than the observed one. According to this model, the mechanism producing temperature inversion in the solar atmosphere is velocity filtration as in Scudder’s model, but there is no need to postulate distribution functions with suprathermal tails in the chromosphere: the latter are self-consistently produced by the gravitational filtering itself, and originate in the superposition of different thermal distributions in the chromosphere. Temperature fluctuations are modelled by a stochastic process, and essentially any probability distribution such that more intense fluctuations are less frequent than less intense ones works. Remarkably, no fine-tuning of the parameters is required to produce temperature inversion, the only requirement being that the temperature fluctuations are fast enough to prevent the system from relaxing towards a thermal configuration (for the Sun, this means that fluctuations must occur on a subsecond time scale, which is unresolved in current solar observations). The average intensity of the fluctuations, however, must be sufficiently large as to produce coronal temperatures. Indeed, short-lived, intense, and small-scale brightenings are routinely observed on the Sun (Dere et al., 1989; Teriaca et al., 2004; Peter et al., 2014; Tiwari et al., 2019; Berghmans et al., 2021). The so-called campfires recently observed in extreme UV images have temperatures of the order of 10^{6} K, while explosive events appearing in \mathrm{H}\alpha line widths have smaller temperatures, about 2\times 10^{5} K, but are ten times more frequent (Teriaca et al., 2004). This trend is consistent with the distribution of rapid temperature increments assumed in the model. Moreover, based on recent extreme UV solar observations, Raouafi et al. (2023) have shown that small-scale magnetic reconnection events at the base of the solar corona can produce a flow of matter that propagates up into the corona with the correct energy budget to heat the plasma environments up to million degrees. Since a Sun-like hot corona is expected to be present in low-mass main-sequence stars (i.e., stars with M<1.5\,M_{\odot}), and the velocity filtration mechanism is very general and does not require any Sun-specific feature, in the present paper we apply the model proposed by Barbieri et al. (2024a, b) to main-sequence stars. More specifically, we want to answer the following questions: Does the model predict an inverted temperature-density profile with a transition region and a hot corona for all main-sequence stars? How are these profiles affected by the mass of the star? The paper is structured as follows. In Sec. 2 we briefly review the plasma atmosphere model proposed by Barbieri et al. (2024a, b): more specifically, in Sec. 2.1 we describe the model and define its parameters, and in Sec. 2.2 we discuss the mechanism according to which the model produces a transition region and a hot corona, defining a quantity that discriminates the range of parameters in which a transition region and a corona do actually form from those in which they do not, and which will be useful in the following. In Sec. 3 we apply the theoretical framework to main-sequence stars and we present and discuss the results, focusing on the case of low-mass stars (M<1.5\,M_{\odot}; the case of higher-mass stars is considered in Appendix A). Finally, in Sec. 4 we summarise our findings and hint at some possible follow-ups of the present work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07744v1,Characterising high and low accretion states in VY Scl CVs using ZTF and TESS data,"VY Scl binaries are a sub-class of cataclysmic variable (CV) which show extended low states, but do not show outbursts which are seen in other classes of CV. To better determine how often these systems spend in low states and to resolve the state transitions we have analysed ZTF data on eight systems and TESS data on six systems. Half of the sample spent most of the time in a high state; three show a broad range and one spends roughly half the time transitioning between high and low states. Using the ZTF data we explore the colour variation as a function of brightness. In KR Aur, we identify a series of repeating outburst events whose brightness appears to increase over time. Using TESS data we searched for periods other than the orbital. In LN UMa we find evidence for a peak whose period varies between 3–6 d. We outline the current models which aim to explain the observed properties of VY Scl systems which includes disc irradiation and a white dwarf having a significant magnetic field.","Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are interacting binaries with a white dwarf (WD) accreting material from, usually, a late type (donor) star (see Warner, 2003, for a review). Mass transfer in CVs occurs via Roche-lobe overflow from the donor star through the inner Lagrangian (L1) point of the binary. If the WD is modestly magnetised (B\lesssim 0.1 MG), an accretion disc can be formed, mediating material inflow onto the WD via a boundary layer. CVs often show high and low optical states. Except for Polars, which are discless CVs containing a highly magnetic WD, the two states correspond respectively to a hot, bright disc with high viscosity and a cool, faint disc with a low viscosity (see Cannizzo, 1993). According to the Disc Instability Model (DIM; for a review see Hameury, 2020), the existence of state bimodality and state transitions are associated with CV outbursts, where one or more physical parameters of the accretion disc changes in such a manner as to make the disc unstable, which results in an abrupt increase in the mass accretion onto the WD. The long-term behaviour of mass transfer in CVs and the (in)stability of their accretion discs provides insight into the accretion and mass transfer processes in general and the nature of viscosity that drives the accretion flow (Warner, 2003). VY Scl binaries, also known as “anti-dwarf novae”, are a sub-class of the non-magnetic CVs. They are distinguished from nova-like systems, which have a high mass transfer rate, as their optical brightness can decrease by several magnitudes for up to several hundred days at a time (Warner, 2003). The drop in the brightness reflects the decrease in the accretion flow onto the WD, which is attributed to the decrease in the mass-transfer rate, with possibly even a temporary cessation of mass transfer from the secondary star in some systems. Noticeably, VY Scl binaries have not been observed in outburst, despite the DIM predicting that outbursts should occur in their low state (Leach et al., 1999). However, lower amplitude “stunted"" outbursts have been observed in some VY Scl binaries during their high states (e.g., Honeycutt et al., 2014). Various models have been proposed to explain the occurrence of low states in CVs, with star-spot models amongst them. In semi-detached binaries such as CVs, where the rate of mass transfer is determined by the physical condition of the low-mass donor star at the L1 point, the gas temperature and the atmospheric pressure scale heights are two core parameters (Lubow & Shu, 1975). Low-mass stars are often magnetically active, with some showing coronal flares and also migrating star-spots. The passing of star-spots to regions close to the L1 point would lead to a reduction in gas temperatures and atmospheric pressure scale height, which in turn modifies the mass transfer rate (see Livio & Pringle, 1994). The star-spot models highlight the importance of stellar magnetism in regulating the mass transfer in low-mass semi-detached binaries, and it is an starting point for building more holistic models, such as those invoking a magnetic valve mechanism (e.g. Wu & Kiss, 2008; Duffy et al., 2022; Mason et al., 2024), where the magnetic interactions between the WD and the companion star control mass transfer in the binary. This provides a unified description for high and low states, the state transition and the duty cycles in some CV subclasses, in particular the Polars, covering both systems with low and high WD magnetic fields (B\sim10-200 MG; Mason et al., 2024). While there is evidence that the magnetic valve mechanism can explain high/low states in Polars (Mason et al., 2022), in the same form it is clearly inapplicable to the non-magnetic VY Scl binaries. However, such a scenario in VY Scl binaries would rely solely on the atmospheric magnetic activity of the low-mass companion star. We note that what drives the state transition, sustains the mass transfer during the high state and halts the mass transfer during the low state would also depend additionally on the mechanical and thermal conditions of the low-mass donor star, as well as the orbital dynamics of the binary. With the exception of Polars, CVs possess an accretion disc. During the low state the accretion disc is expected to be cool. It may evolve in such a way that a disc instability develops, triggering outbursts (see e.g. Cannizzo, 1993). The lack of outbursts observed in VY Scl binaries suggests that some mechanism(s) are present which inhibit disc instability. Leach et al. (1999) proposed that the anticipated outbursts are suppressed by a high WD atmospheric temperature (\sim40,000 K), which heats the inner disc and thus prevents the development of the instability needed for outburst. This proposition is consistent with observations of the WDs in some VY Scl binaries which are found to be relatively hot (see e.g. Mizusawa et al., 2010). Whilst it has explained the absence of outbursts in the low state, it is yet to account for the lack of outbursts in the transition between the low and high states, known as the intermediate state, (see e.g. Leach et al., 1999; Zemko et al., 2014), which is observed in some systems. The durations of these intermediate states are longer than the viscous timescale, and as the accretion disc is in an unstable configuration, the DIM would predict outbursts to occur. In order to explain the general absence of outbursts, Hameury & Lasota (2002, 2005) proposed that the magnetic field of the WDs in VY Scl binaries are strong enough to affect the accretion flow. They showed that a relatively weak magnetic field (B\sim 40 kG) is sufficient to prohibit the formation of a low-state accretion disc around a WD of \sim 0.7\ M_{\sun}. For a similar system, a WD magnetic field B\gtrsim 6 MG would be sufficient to disrupt the disc during the majority of the intermediate state so that outbursts would not be possible. Such a WD magnetic field strength would place the binaries into the CV subclass Intermediate Polars, whose WDs generally have a magnetic field of 10\;\!{\rm MG}\gtrsim B\gtrsim 0.1\;\!{\rm MG}. The absence of a full-scale accretion disc, proposed by Hameury & Lasota (2002, 2005), was used to explain the absence of outbursts in the low state of VY Scl binaries. A more extreme proposal is that the accretion disc is entirely absent in the low state due to a complete cessation of mass transfer. Whilst the enhanced magnetic fields associated with star spots migrating to the L1 region can temporarily halt the mass outflow from the donor star, it is hard to sustain for a prolonged time unless an external force e.g. the WD magnetic field in the magnetic valve scenario for Polars described in Duffy et al. (2022) and Mason et al. (2024) is present to prevent the star spots migrating out of the L1 region. However, if the mass transfer process is intrinsically unstable, the binary can enter a prolonged low state where mass transfer ceases and a full-scale accretion disc is naturally absent. The study of Wu et al. (1995) has shown that irradiative heating feedback can trigger such mass-transfer instabilities. Attempts have been made to verify the star-spot and the magnetic disc disruption scenarios, but the situation is complicated by the fact that whilst some observations support one or other of the scenarios, other observations disprove them. The study of MV Lyr by Linnell et al. (2005), for example, suggests that neither the star-spot nor the disc-disruption scenario is is applicable with the WD and/or the inner disc being too cool and also showing no evidence of a WD magnetic field of sufficient strength. On the other hand, the absence of the accretion disc in TT Ari (Gänsicke et al., 1999) would favour the magnetic disc-disruption scenario. Similarly, Medina Rodriguez et al. (2023) found that during low states SDSS J154453.60+255348.8 did not show evidence for an accretion disc, which supports the predictions of Hameury & Lasota. However, when looking at VY Scl, the sub-class archetype, Schmidtobreick et al. (2018) found evidence of an accretion disc during the low state, and they also used this to rule out the disc-disruption scenario. Despite VY Scl binaries generally not outbursting during their low states, “stunted"" outbursts were identified by Honeycutt & Kafka (2004) in FY Per and V794 Aql during their low states. These stunted outbursts have greatly reduced amplitude compared with those which would be expected from an outburst in similar non-VY Scl systems. Schmidtobreick et al. (2018) also found aperiodic variations in the brightness of VY Scl itself, and suggested that they are a similar phenomenon. The nature of stunted outbursts is unclear: they could be associated with certain disc instabilities, or alternatively fluctuations in mass transfer rates, or a combination of both (Honeycutt et al., 1998; Honeycutt, 2001). These outbursts require the accretion disc to act as an agent, and thus they would exclude the possibility of a strongly magnetised WD. Magnetically gated outbursts have also been observed in MV Lyr (Scaringi et al., 2017) from which they inferred a WD magnetic field of similar magnetic to those proposed by Hameury & Lasota (2002, 2005). In this paper we investigate the long-term behaviour of eight VY Scl binaries using the multi-colour photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al., 2019) in order to better understand the long term behaviour of eight VY Scl binaries and therefore the underlying processes that give rise to the observed high and low accretion states, and their duty cycles. We use also extended optical photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; Ricker et al., 2015) to search for periods longer than the orbital period and resolve transitions between high and low states.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07717v1,Modelling the Center-to-Limb systematic in normal-mode-coupling measurements,"Solar meridional circulation, which manifests as poleward flow near the surface, is a relatively weak flow. While meridional circulation has been measured through various local helioseismic techniques, there is a lack of consensus about the nature of the depth profile and location of return flow, owing to its small amplitude and poor signal-to-noise ratio in observations. The measurements are strongly hampered by systematic effects, whose amplitudes are comparable to the signal induced by the flow and modelling them is therefore crucial. The removal of the center-to-limb systematic, which is the largest known feature hampering the inference of meridional flow, has been heuristically performed in helioseismic analyses, but it’s effect on global modes is not fully understood or modelled. Here, we propose both a way to model the center-to-limb systematic and a method for estimation of meridional flow using global helioseismic cross-spectral analysis. We demonstrate that the systematic cannot be ignored while modelling the mode-coupling cross-spectral measurement and thus is critical for the inference of meridional circulation. We also show that inclusion of a model for the center-to-limb systematic improves shallow meridional circulation estimates from cross-spectral analysis.","Meridional circulation (MC) is a relatively weak large-scale flow, with a surface amplitude of \sim 20 ms-1 (Giles et al., 1997; Basu & Antia, 1999; Zhao & Kosovichev, 2004; Hanasoge, 2022) compared to \sim 200 - 300 ms-1 for differential rotation (for e.g., Schou et al., 1998). MC is directed from the equator to the poles in both the hemispheres and the polar accumulation of mass is prevented by the inward plunging of the flow at high latitudes. In the interior, the flow reverse direction heading from the poles to the equator, with radial outflow back to the surface at low latitudes. The sustenance of differential rotation and the 11-year magnetic-activity cycle are among the long-standing puzzles in solar physics and MC is one a critical ingredient in setting these dynamics (Dikpati & Gilman, 2009; Charbonneau, 2010; Choudhuri, 2021; Hanasoge, 2022). Thus, an understanding of the depth profile and latitudinal structure of MC is of great interest to solar physics at large. Surface MC has been observed for several decades using a multitude of techniques (see Hanasoge, 2022, for a detailed review), such as, sunspot tracking (Howard & Gilman, 1986), tracking of photospheric magnetic features (e.g., Komm et al., 1993) and Doppler velocity measurements (e.g., Hathaway, 1993). The study of the depth-profile of meridional flow has been possible through helioseismology. Over the years, the most successful attempts to estimate MC have predominantly used techniques of local helioseismology. Giles et al. (1997) estimated sub-surface flow in the top 4% of the Sun using data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) using time-distance helioseismology and found MC to be constant throughout this range. Subsequently, Giles (2000) found MC to have a magnitude of 3 \mathrm{ms}^{-1} at the base of the convection zone. Near-surface MC has also been constrained to be 20 \mathrm{ms}^{-1} using ring-diagrams (Schou & Bogart, 1998; Basu & Antia, 1999; Zhao & Kosovichev, 2004). Basu & Antia (1999) used helioseismic data from MDI and found no change in the sign of MC up to a depth of 21 Mm. Zhao & Kosovichev (2004) also used MDI data and measured a magnitude of 20 ms-1, up to a depth of 12 Mm, using 6 years of data. Zhao et al. (2013) found the MC to have a two-cell structure in depth. Rajaguru & Antia (2015) used 4 years of HMI observations, imposing a mass-conservation constraint using stream functions and found the return flow of MC to be near the base of the convection zone at r=0.77R_{\odot}. Rajaguru & Antia (2020) found that they could obtain a single- or double-cell MC depth profile depending on the frequencies of modes used for the seismic measurements. The implications of double-cell MC on dynamo models are discussed in Hazra et al. (2014). More recently, Gizon et al. (2020)(G20, hereafter) measured MC over two solar cycles, using data from both HMI and MDI, and showed that time-averaged MC is single-celled in each hemisphere, with a mid-latitude magnitude of 4 \mathrm{ms}^{-1}. The lack of consensus and theoretical considerations motivates us to explore the measurement of MC using global modes. A systematic center-to-limb variation (C2L) in measurements of helioseismic travel times was reported first by Duvall & Hanasoge (2009). Zhao et al. (2012) found the systematic phase difference to be a function of heliocentric radius (a catalog of coordinate systems can be found in Thompson, 2006). Although the physical origin is not completely understood, Baldner & Schou (2012) hypothesized that it could be due to the asymmetry in convective outflows and inflows, resulting in a phase-shift in the wavefield and they found qualitative agreement with the measurements of Zhao et al. (2012). Zhao et al. (2016) concluded that foreshortening could not explain C2L, and that the C2L may due to radiative transfer effects and/or upflow-downflow asymmetry due to convection, with both effects resulting in phase shifts in the observed modes (Zhao et al., 2022). The results of Baldner & Schou (2012), Zhao et al. (2016) and Zhao et al. (2022) motivate our choice to model the C2L as a phase factor that varies with heliocentric radius and mode frequency. Whether this factor leaves a significant imprint on cross-spectral measurements is an important question as there have been no clear answers from literature relating to the modelling or the effect of such a systematic bias. While there have been numerous studies of MC using normal-mode coupling (Woodard et al., 2013; Schad et al., 2012, 2013), they do not account for C2L-bias. Schad et al. (2013) also claim the effect of C2L-bias to be small for their cross-spectrum-based measurement for \ell<100. Here, we quantify the impact of a C2L-bias on cross spectra and demonstrate that it is indeed the most important aspect to consider when imaging MC. We describe the mode-coupling measurement technique in Section 2. Section 3 focuses on the modelling of the C2L-bias in the context of global modes. The measurable impact of MC on mode-coupling measurements is shown in Section 2.2. We describe the parameterization of C2L-bias in Section 4. The recipe for setting up an inversion is discussed in Section 5 through an analysis of how the C2L-bias and meridional circulation affect cross-spectral measurements. Aspects of modelling and challenges in inferring meridional circulation are discussed in Section 7."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07377v1,Chemical Fingerprints of M Dwarfs: High-Resolution Spectroscopy on 31 M Dwarfs with SPIRou,"We extend the methodology introduced by Jahandar et al. (2024) to determine the effective temperature and chemical abundances of 31 slowly-rotating solar neighborhood M dwarfs (M1-M5) using high-resolution spectra from CFHT/SPIRou. This group includes 10 M dwarfs in binary systems with FGK primaries of known metallicity from optical measurements. By testing our T_{\rm eff} method on various synthetic models, we find a consistent inherent synthetic uncertainty of \sim10 K at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 100. Additionally, we find that our results align with interferometric measurements, showing a consistent residual of -29 \pm 31 K. Taking the inherent uncertainties into account, we infer the T_{\rm eff} values of our targets and find an excellent agreement with previous optical and NIR studies. Our high-resolution chemical analysis examines hundreds of absorption lines using \chi^{2} minimization using PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. We present elemental abundances for up to 10 different elements, including refractory elements such as Si, Mg, and Fe, which are important for modelling the interior structure of exoplanets. In binary systems, we find an average [Fe/H] of -0.15 \pm 0.08 for M dwarfs, marginally lower than the reported metallicity of -0.06 \pm 0.18 for the FGK primaries from Mann et al. (2013a). We also observe slightly sub-solar chemistry for various elements in our non-binary M dwarfs, most notably for O, C, and K abundances. In particular, we find an average metallicity of -0.11 \pm 0.16 lower but still consistent with the typical solar metallicity of FGK stars (e.g. [Fe/H] = 0.04 \pm 0.20 from Brewer et al. 2016). This study highlights significant discrepancies in various major M dwarf surveys likely related to differences in the methodologies employed.","M dwarfs, the most populous stellar type in our galaxy, play a pivotal role in astrophysical studies (Henry et al. 1994; Winters et al. 2019; Reylé et al. 2021). Their prevalence and unique properties have made them subjects of intense research in various fields, from galaxy evolution to exoplanet interior modeling. Moreover, M dwarfs are known to host exoplanets (e.g., Bonfils et al. 2013; Dressing & Charbonneau 2015; Mulders et al. 2015; Gaidos et al. 2016; Cloutier & Menou 2020; Hsu et al. 2020), making them vital in the study of different star systems and the search for potentially habitable planets. Accurate measurement of the chemical composition of M dwarfs is necessary to assess the habitability of planets orbiting them. Various studies have found a direct correlation between the metallicity of host stars and their exoplanets (Santos et al. 2004; Fischer & Valenti 2005; Bond et al. 2006; Guillot et al. 2006; Mulders et al. 2015). The importance of metallicity extends to the efficiency of giant planet formation, particularly for FGK dwarfs. FGK stars typically possess higher disk masses than M dwarfs, enabling them to form giant planets even with low metallicities. In contrast, M dwarfs require high metallicity to compensate for their lower disk masses to form giant planets (Neves et al. 2013). Furthermore, the chemical composition of a host star has implications for the composition of its planets (Gilli et al. 2006; Adibekyan et al. 2021). For instance, the relative abundances of refractory elements like Mg, Si, and Fe influence the chemical composition of the protoplanetary disk, more specifically the core-to-mantle mass ratio of rocky exoplanets (Brewer & Fischer 2016). A common method for characterizing M dwarf properties is high-resolution spectroscopy (Souto et al. 2017; Rajpurohit et al. 2018; Passegger et al. 2019; Marfil et al. 2021; Cristofari et al. 2022; Jahandar et al. 2024). However, the spectroscopic analysis of M dwarfs presents several challenges. In contrast to more massive stars like FGK dwarfs, whose spectra are typically dominated by atomic lines, the cooler temperatures of M dwarfs result in dense molecular bands. These bands, such as TiO, VO, and CaH, can overlap and obscure the atomic lines crucial for chemical analysis in the optical regime. In the near-infrared (NIR) regime, additional challenges arise with extensive bands from water vapor, OH bands and hydrides like FeH complicating the identification of atomic lines. The presence of multi-metal molecules like CO and CN adds to this complexity, especially when disentangling each atom’s individual contributions to the overall spectral signature. Nevertheless, as the flux of M dwarfs is predominantly in the NIR band, this wavelength regime has become a common focus for chemical spectroscopy on M dwarfs. M dwarfs in binary systems, particularly when paired with FGK primary stars, present a unique opportunity to better understand their chemical evolution. These binary systems are particularly attractive because they are believed to have formed together from the same molecular cloud, thus sharing similar initial chemical abundances. Due to their higher effective temperature (T_{\rm eff}), FGK stars are significantly easier to characterize than M dwarfs chemically. Therefore, if they share similar chemistry with their M dwarf companions, it provides a unique opportunity to calibrate spectroscopic methods, which are often subjected to various uncertainties and systematic effects (Blanco-Cuaresma 2019; Olander et al. 2021; Jahandar et al. 2024). In our previous work (Jahandar et al., 2024), we tackled the challenge of minimizing the impact of several caveats observed in synthetic NIR high-resolution atmosphere models used for stellar characterization of M dwarfs. Our mitigating strategies include a line selection and identifying flaws in these models, such as continuum mismatch, line shift and unresolved contamination. Recognizing and addressing these factors is crucial, as neglecting them can result in inaccurate estimates of a star’s fundamental characteristics such as its T_{\rm eff} and metallicity. Building upon the methodologies and insights established in Jahandar et al. (2024), this paper presents the chemical spectroscopy of 31 M dwarfs observed by the SPIRou instrument. This includes a high-resolution spectral analysis of hundreds of absorption lines and molecular bands in their spectra and the determination of the T_{\rm eff} and chemical abundances of 10 different elements. The paper is structured as follows. We describe the observations with SPIRou in Section 2. In Section 3, we outline our approach for determining T_{\rm eff} and the chemical abundances of our M dwarfs, presenting a fine-tuned line list of those spectral features commonly observed in different stars. In Section 4, we report the chemical abundances of up to 10 different elements for all our M dwarfs and compare them with previously reported values. Moreover, we discuss discrepancies in the molar ratio of refractory elements between this work and others. This analysis is followed by concluding remarks in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07290v1,The formation of multiples in small- subclusters,"We explore the relative percentages of binary systems and higher-order multiples that are formed by pure stellar dynamics, within a small subcluster of N stars. The subcluster is intended to represent the fragmentation products of a single isolated core, after most of the residual gas of the natal core has dispersed. Initially the stars have random positions, and masses drawn from a log-normal distribution. For low-mass cores spawning multiple systems with Sun-like primaries, the best fit to the observed percentages of singles, binaries, triples and higher-order systems is obtained if a typical core spawns on average between N= 4.3 and 5.2 stars, specifically a distribution of N with mean \mu_{{}_{N}}\sim 4.8 and standard deviation \sigma_{{}_{N}}\sim 2.4. This fit is obtained when \sim 50\% of the subcluster’s internal kinetic energy is invested in ordered rotation and \sim 50\% in isotropic Maxwellian velocities. There is little dependence on other factors, for example mass segregation or the rotation law. Whilst such high values of N are at variance with the lower values often quoted (i.e. N\!=\!1\;{\rm or}\;2), very similar values (N\!=\!4.3\pm 0.4 and N\!=\!4.5\pm 1.9) have been derived previously by completely independent routes, and seem inescapable when the observed distribution of multiplicities is taken into account.","Most field stars more massive than the Sun are not single (Whitworth & Lomax, 2015; Offner et al., 2023). They exist in multiple systems, i.e. gravitationally bound groups in which the individual stars are on more-or-less constant and stable orbits about one another. The most common multiple systems are binaries: two stars orbiting their mutual centre of mass on elliptical orbits. However, there is an increasing recognition that there are also many higher-order multiple systems in the field (and even more in regions of recent star formation , Chen et al. 2013). Stable, long-lived triple systems comprise two stars in a relatively close binary system with a third star on a significantly wider orbit about the binary. Quadruple systems come in two variants: ‘2+2’ quadruples comprise two relatively close binary systems on a wide orbit about one another; and ‘planetary’ quadruples comprise a triple system (as define above) with a fourth star on an even wider orbit about the triple. The highest-order multiples known are septuples. An example of a septuple is 65 UMa (11551+4629), in which a central binary is orbited not only by three companions on planetary orbits, but a distant binary pair as well (see Tokovinin 2021). A young subcluster comprising N stars may evolve into {\cal A}_{{}_{N}} possible end states, where {\cal A}_{{}_{N}} increases rapidly with N. For N\leq 10: \displaystyle\ {\cal A}_{{}_{N}}\!\! \displaystyle\!\!\!=\!\! \displaystyle\!\!\sum_{n=2}^{N}\!\left\{1+\sum_{n^{\prime}=2}^{n}\!\left\{% \vphantom{\sum_{n^{\prime\prime}=2}^{n^{\prime}-1}}\!\left\lfloor\frac{N\!-\!n% }{n^{\prime}}\right\rfloor\,+\,H(N\!-\!(n+n^{\prime}+2))\;\;\right.\right. (1) \displaystyle\!\!\hskip 85.35826pt\left.\left.\sum_{n^{\prime\prime}=2}^{n^{% \prime}-1}\left\lfloor\frac{N-(n+n^{\prime})}{n^{\prime\prime}}\right\rfloor% \right\}\right\}. Here \left\lfloor\;\right\rfloor is the floor operator, and H is the Heaviside function. Thus a subcluster with N=7 members can evolve into {\cal A}_{{}_{7}}=14 different end states, as enumerated in Section 3.1. A derivation and explanation of Equation 1 is given in Appendix A. 1.1 Observational perspective Recent advances in observational technology and capability have lead to the discovery of additional members in known star systems, and thereby greatly increased the inventory of higher-order multiples in the solar neighbourhood. When Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) studied the multiplicity of solar-type stars in a 22-pc sample, they found that only 5% hosted triple or higher order systems. For a 25-pc sample, Raghavan et al. (2010) found this percentage to be 13%, and it increased to 17% when Tokovinin (2021) and Hirsch et al. (2021) studied the sample in 2021. The Tokovinin (2021) statistics for nearby systems with solar-type primaries, in the field (hereafter the T21 sample), are \displaystyle\rm{S:B:T:Q^{+}} \displaystyle= \displaystyle 54:29:12:5\,. (2) Here S is the percentage of single stars, B the percentage of binaries, T the percentage of triples, and Q+ the percentage of quadruples plus higher-order systems (i.e. quintuples, sextuples and septuples). Thus, in this sample, the fraction of stars that are single is \displaystyle f_{{}_{\rm S}} \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{\rm S}{\rm S+2B+3T+4Q^{+}}\;\;\,\simeq\;\;\,32.1\%\,; (3) the fraction of stars that is in binaries is \displaystyle f_{{}_{\rm B}} \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{\rm 2B}{\rm S+2B+3T+4Q^{+}}\;\;\,\simeq\,\;\;34.6\%\,; (4) and the fraction that is in triples or higher order systems is \displaystyle f_{{}_{\rm T^{+}}} \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{\rm 3T+4Q^{+}}{\rm S+2B+3T+4Q^{+}}\;\;\,\simeq\,\;\;33.3\%\,. (5) These percentages should be qualified with two caveats. First, we have assumed that all the systems contributing to Q+ are quadruples. If account were taken of the systems that are quintuples, sextuples and septuples, f_{{}_{\rm T^{+}}} would increase slightly, at the expense of f_{{}_{\rm S}} and f_{{}_{\rm B}}. Second, although these percentages are uncertain, due to selection effects and observational bias, the expectation must be that in the future they will shift towards higher-orders, as additional members of existing systems are discovered. This will reduce f_{{}_{\rm S}}, and probably increase both f_{{}_{\rm B}} and f_{{}_{\rm T^{+}}}. Moreover, we should also note that, by construction, the stars in the T21 sample have masses M\lesssim{\rm M}_{{}_{\odot}}. Samples with higher-mass primaries tend to have even higher multiplicities than the T21 sample. For example, in the survey by Sana (2017) essentially all of the high-mass stars are members of higher-order systems. The systems we are considering here are presumed to be the product of low-mass cores of the sort that define the peak of the core mass function and are observed in nearby low-mass star formation regions. We should also be mindful that the multiplicities of stellar systems depend on their age. Reipurth & Zinnecker (1993) show that young populations tend to have higher multiplicities than their older counterparts. Indeed, multiplicity begins to decline even in the protostellar phase. Chen et al. 2013 show that the average multiplicity decreases as one progresses from Class 0, through Class I, to Class II protostars. 1.2 Theoretical perspective We shall assume that usually an observed multiple system with a solar-mass primary has formed from a single prestellar core. There are then two main mechanisms involved: (i) dynamical core collapse and fragmentation; and (ii) disk fragmentation. These two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, rather they tend to be sequential. 111We note that in the higher-mass cores that form more massive stars a third mechanism needs to be considered. These higher-mass cores are often fed by filamentary accretion streams that are sufficiently massive to form multiple systems by filament fragmentation. These multiples systems then fall into the monolithic cluster that is forming in the central hub, where they interact with other stars and systems. This is not the scenario we are considering here. In the standard paradigm for star formation, molecular clouds are highly turbulent, and in some regions the turbulence produces convergent flows of sufficient strength to produce self-gravitating sheets, filaments and cores. Unless it is rapidly dispersed by tidal forces or shear, a self-gravitating core collapses. And, unless it is very spherically symmetric and non-rotating, it is likely to fragment dynamically to produce a small subcluster of stars (e.g. Cha & Whitworth, 2003; Goodwin et al., 2004a; Fisher, 2004; Hennebelle et al., 2004; Goodwin et al., 2004a, b; Hubber & Whitworth, 2005; Stamatellos et al., 2007; Offner et al., 2010; Walch et al., 2012; Lomax et al., 2014, 2015a, 2015b, 2016; Rohde et al., 2021; Whitworth et al., 2024). This is ‘dynamical core collapse and fragmentation’. The resulting stars are usually attended by accretion discs, comprising material that has too much specific angular momentum to fall directly onto the central star. If such an accretion disc becomes sufficiently massive, extended and cold, it fragments to produce a secondary star or stars, in orbit around the primary (e.g. Adams et al., 1989; Chapman et al., 1992; Bonnell & Bate, 1994; Turner et al., 1995; Whitworth et al., 1995; Bhattal et al., 1998; Boffin et al., 1998; Watkins et al., 1998a, b; Stamatellos et al., 2007; Stamatellos & Whitworth, 2008, 2009a; Walch et al., 2009; Stamatellos & Whitworth, 2009b; Thies et al., 2010; Walch et al., 2010; Kratter et al., 2010; Stamatellos et al., 2011, 2012; Lomax et al., 2015a, b; Whitworth & Lomax, 2016; Di G. Sigalotti et al., 2023). This is ‘disc fragmentation’. Together, these mechanisms have been shown to produce young multiple systems of as many as seven stars (Lomax et al., 2016). 1.3 Previous related theoretical studies McDonald & Clarke (1993) have introduced the concept of dynamical biasing, which is the tendency for the more massive stars in a small-N subcluster to form a binary, and for the less massive ones to be ejected, thereby making the binary more tightly bound. In a second paper, McDonald & Clarke (1995) show that, if the stars in a small-N subcluster are attended by discs, the increased dissipation during close encounters reduces the effectiveness of dynamical biasing – i.e. the lower-mass stars have a better chance of ending up in a binary. It also increases the tendency to produce higher-order multiples. Kuruwita & Haugbølle (2023) have shown that the drag from the gas of the natal cloud can drive the inspiral of forming stars, bringing binaries closer together. This would harden them against dissolution and increase the proportion of higher-order multiples. Sterzik & Durisen (1998) have explored multiplicity in a cold, non-rotating, spherical distribution of N= 3, 4, or 5 stars. The stars have masses drawn from a Miller-Scalo distribution, and are evolved for 1000 crossing times, using an N-body code. At the end the multiplicities are \displaystyle\begin{array}[]{lcll}\rm{S:B:T}&=&47:47:6,&\rm{for}\;\,N=3;\\ \rm{S:B:T:Q}&=&63:29:6:1,&\rm{for}\;\,N=4;\\ \rm{S:B:T:Q^{+}}&=&70:19:9:1,&\rm{for}\;\,N=5.\\ \end{array} (9) Thus, increasing N increases the percentage of singles and reduces the percentage of binaries. Holman et al. (2013) have shown using purely statistical arguments that, if the shape of the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) is inherited from the shape of the prestellar Core Mass Function (CMF), then the observed increase in binary frequency with primary mass (e.g. Offner et al., 2023) requires that a prestellar core must typically spawn a subcluster of 4 to 5 stars. 1.4 Overview and plan In this work we extend the study of Sterzik & Durisen (1998) to larger numbers of stars, and to more general initial conditions. Although circumstellar discs and disc fragmentation are likely to be important, particularly for forming lower mass stars and close orbits, we limit consideration here to subclusters formed purely by dynamical core collapse and fragmentation, and neglect discs. Consequently our numerical experiments start with single discless stars, and all multiple systems are formed subsequently by energy-conserving gravitational interactions between point masses. The role of discs will be explored in a later paper. In Section 2 we describe our model for a small-N subcluster, and the procedures used to follow its evolution and to identify the resulting multiple systems. In Section 3 we analyse the results, and by comparing them with observations derive the best-fit parameters for a subcluster. In Section 4 we summarise the main conclusions. In Appendix A we derive Equation 1, and in Appendix B we show how the results can be re-scaled to represent subclusters of different initial mass and/or linear extent. In Table 1 we list the parameters used in this paper.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07676v1,Non-parametric identification of single-lined binary candidates in young clusters using single-epoch spectroscopy,"Aims. Binarity plays a crucial role in star formation and evolution. Consequently, identifying binary stars is essential to deepen our understanding of these processes. We propose a method to investigate the observed radial velocity distribution of massive stars in young clusters with the goal of identifying binary systems.Methods. We reconstruct the radial velocity distribution using a three-layers hierarchical Bayesian non-parametric approach: non-parametric methods are data-driven models able to infer arbitrary probability densities under minimal mathematical assumptions. When applying our statistical framework, it is possible to identify variable stars and binary systems because these deviate significantly from the expected intrinsic Gaussian distribution for radial velocities.Results. We test our method with the massive star forming region within the giant HII region M17. We are able to confidently identify binaries and variable stars with as little as single-epoch observations. The distinction between variable and binary stars improves significantly when introducing additional epochs.","In the last decades, it has become clear that multiplicity is a fundamental aspect of stellar formation and evolution, especially towards higher masses (see Offner et al. 2023, and references therein). Massive stars are preferentially observed in binary systems, close enough to interact with their companions during their lifetime. The latter is shown by observations of Milky Way clusters (Sana et al. 2012, 2013; Dunstall et al. 2015; Moe & Di Stefano 2015; Barbá et al. 2017; Moe & Di Stefano 2017; Banyard et al. 2022) as well as in the LMC (Almeida et al. 2017; Villaseñor et al. 2021). The presence of close companions affects all stages of the stellar life, from the pre-main sequence phase (Li et al. 2024) to the end-of-life explosions, potentially introducing new physics during the stellar life (e.g. Schneider et al. 2019; Frost et al. 2024) and affecting the properties and orbital evolution of double-compact objects, which may eventually become the progenitors of gravitational wave sources (Blaauw 1991; Zinnecker & Yorke 2007; Langer 2012; de Mink et al. 2013; Tan et al. 2014). Due to the proximity of the stars in close binary systems, these systems are usually not possible to be resolved spatially. Therefore, the best way of identifying them is in velocity space via spectroscopic measurements. Close binaries are detected through periodic Doppler shifts of the photospheric lines in their spectra (e.g., Sana et al. 2013; Dunstall et al. 2015; Kobulnicky et al. 2014). Spectroscopic binaries detected through multi epoch spectroscopy are usually divided in two categories, SB1 and SB2. SB2 refers to double-lined spectroscopic binaries, in which both components are visible in the spectra, whereas SB1 refers to single-line spectroscopic binaries with only one component of the system is visible in the spectrum. The binary nature of the system is determined via radial velocity shifts. Several surveys aimed at identifying massive binary stars have been carried out both in the Milky Way and in lower metallicity environments such as the LMC and SMC (e.g., Sana et al. 2013; Dunstall et al. 2015; Kobulnicky et al. 2014; Almeida et al. 2017; Villaseñor et al. 2021). The minimum number of epochs covered by such surveys is typically three, with the second epoch a few days after the first one and the third a few months after. This allows to efficiently detect binaries with periods up to 10 days as well as those with periods up to 6 months. However, three epochs are usually not sufficient if one wants to get accurate orbital solutions: some surveys extent to tens of epochs per object (e.g. Sana et al. 2013). An indirect method to estimate the amount of close binaries in a cluster was proposed by Sana et al. (2017) and Ramírez-Tannus et al. (2021). In these studies, the authors measured the radial velocity dispersion (\sigma_{\mathrm{1D}}) of single epoch observations, which in low density clusters is strongly dominated by the orbital properties of the binary population. The multiplicity properties of a cluster can be quantified by comparing the measured \sigma_{\mathrm{1D}} value with that resulting from Monte Carlo population synthesis, where each parent population is characterised by different underlying multiplicity properties. This method has the advantage of allowing to get an idea of the underlying multiplicity properties of a cluster with a single epoch observation, reducing considerably the observing time with respect to a multi epoch approach. However, there are several underlying multiplicity properties that have an effect on the \sigma_{\mathrm{1D}} of a cluster and those cannot be individually determined based on the \sigma_{\mathrm{1D}} only. For example, Sana et al. (2017) and Ramírez-Tannus et al. (2021) show that the low \sigma_{\mathrm{1D}} measured for the young cluster M17 can either be explained either by a low f_{\mathrm{bin}} or by a large P_{\mathrm{cutoff}} with respect to other, slightly older Galactic clusters. In order to determine which of the two scenarios causes the low \sigma_{\mathrm{1D}} observed it is necessary to determine the actual f_{\mathrm{bin}} of the cluster. In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on a Bayesian non-parametric method to efficiently identify binary candidates through single epoch spectroscopy. Non-parametric methods are powerful tools to infer probability distributions without being committal to any specific functional form and, in a certain sense, let the data speak for themselves. The name ‘non-parametric methods’ might be misleading: in fact, these models have an infinite number of parameters that can be used to accommodate arbitrary probability densities without the need for any fine-tuning. Such flexibility comes with the cost that it is not possible to give a direct physical interpretation of the inferred parameters, thus any interpretation of the reconstructed features of the distribution must be done a posteriori. The framework presented in this work, being applicable to single-epoch observations, can reduce considerably the observing time required in comparison to the multi epoch approach, the flexibility of non-parametric methods will allow us to account both for outliers (such as stars in binary systems with limited epochs) and deviations from the expected Gaussian shape of the underlying distribution. Most importantly, this flexible characterisation of the radial velocity distribution allows us to identify the systems that are worth following up with multi-epoch spectroscopy, opening for a further optimisation of the available observing time usage. The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we present the statistical framework that allows us to detect binary stars based on single epoch spectroscopy. Section 3 presents the application of this framework to a set of simulated observations to assess its applicability, whereas in Section 4 we apply it to a set of observations within the massive star forming region M17 and compare our binary identification to that of Ramírez-Tannus et al. (2024), who identified binary stars based on multi-epoch spectroscopy. In Section 5 we discuss and conclude this work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07542v1,Radio Follow-up Observations of SN 2023ixf by Japanese and Korean VLBIs,"We report on radio follow-up observations of the nearby Type II supernova, SN 2023ixf, spanning from 1.7 to 269.9 days after the explosion, conducted using three very long baseline interferometers (VLBIs), which are the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN), the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA), and the Korean VLBI Network (KVN). In three observation epochs (152.3, 206.1, and 269.9 days), we detected emission at the 6.9 and 8.4 GHz bands, with a flux density of \sim 5 mJy. The flux density reached a peak at around 206.1 days, which is longer than the timescale to reach the peak observed in typical Type II supernovae. Based on the analytical model of radio emission, our late-time detections were inferred to be due to the decreasing optical depth. In this case, the mass-loss rate of the progenitor is estimated to have increased from \sim 10^{-6}-10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} to \sim 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} between 28 and 6 years before the explosion. Our radio constraints are also consistent with the mass-loss rate to produce a confined circumstellar medium proposed by previous studies, which suggest that the mass-loss rate increased from \sim 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} to \gtrsim 10^{-2}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} in the last few years before the explosion.","A core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is an explosion of a massive star (\gtrsim 8M_{\odot}) at its final stage of evolution. Recent advances in all-sky surveys have made it possible to conduct follow-up observations of supernovae (SNe) immediately after the explosions (Rau et al., 2009; Law et al., 2009; Bellm et al., 2019; Graham et al., 2019). Optical spectroscopy conducted at such a very early time has revealed the presence of narrow high-ionization emission line features (known as “flash” features), which originate from a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) in the vicinity of the supernova progenitor (e.g., Khazov et al., 2016; Yaron et al., 2017). Currently, a large fraction of Type II SNe is considered to have such a confined dense CSM within \lesssim 10^{15}\,{\rm cm} (e.g., Förster et al., 2018; Bruch et al., 2021, 2023). This implies that their progenitor stars, which are known to be red supergiants (RSGs) for Type II SNe, underwent an enhanced mass-loss activity just decades before the explosion, with a corresponding mass-loss rate of \gtrsim 10^{-3}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}. This mass-loss rate is a few orders of magnitude higher than that of the typical RSG, which is \sim 10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} (e.g., Goldman et al., 2017). The radio emission of CCSNe is interpreted to be the synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons that are accelerated by the SN-CSM interaction (Chevalier et al., 2006; Chevalier & Fransson, 2006). This makes it a unique tool for probing the CSM density structure and mass-loss history of the progenitor star. However, whereas thousands of SNe have been detected in the optical band, only a few hundred have been observed in radio wavelengths, even when undetected events are taken into account (Bietenholz et al., 2021). Only a small fraction of radio SNe have been observed with high cadence and/or in multiple radio frequency bands. It is known from the light curves of extensively observed samples that many of them exhibit complex fluctuations that cannot be explained by simple models that predict monotonic increase and decrease in the expected luminosity evolution (e.g., SN 1979C, Weiler et al. 1992; SN 2001em, Chandra et al. 2020; SN 2001ig, Ryder et al. 2004; SN 2003bg, Soderberg et al. 2006, SN 2004dk Balasubramanian et al. 2021, SN 2014C Anderson et al. 2017, and SN 2018ivc, Maeda et al. 2023). Some cases may be associated with the complexity of the CSM density structure. SN 2023ixf was discovered on 2023 May 19.727 UT, {\rm MJD}=60083.727 (Itagaki, 2023), in the nearby galaxy M101, at a distance of 6.85\pm 0.15 Mpc (Riess et al., 2022), and classified as a Type II SN (Perley et al., 2023). The time of the SN first light is estimated to be {\rm MJD}=60082.743\pm 0.083 (Hiramatsu et al., 2023). Because it is the closest CCSN in a decade, extensive electromagnetic follow-up observations of SN 2023ixf were conducted across a wide range of wavelengths. The early excess in the optical light curve (Jacobson-Galán et al., 2023; Hosseinzadeh et al., 2023; Sgro et al., 2023), the flash features in the optical spectra (Yamanaka et al., 2023; Jacobson-Galán et al., 2023; Smith et al., 2023; Bostroem et al., 2023; Teja et al., 2023), and early X-ray detections (Grefenstette et al., 2023; Chandra et al., 2024) suggest the presence of a dense CSM and the interaction of SN ejecta with it, but there is an apparent inconsistency between the mass-loss rates estimated by optical (\sim 10^{-2}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}, Jacobson-Galán et al., 2023) and X-ray (\sim 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}, Grefenstette et al., 2023) observations. The dense and asymmetric CSM, suggested by a change in its position angle observed by early-time spectropolarimetry (Vasylyev et al., 2023), is considered to be the cause of this discrepancy. The progenitor candidate of SN 2023ixf has been identified in the archival images of the Spitzer Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope (Szalai & Dyk, 2023; Pledger & Shara, 2023). By intensive archival data analyses, the progenitor candidate is identified as a luminous (\sim 10^{5}\,L_{\odot}), dust-obscured RSG, exhibiting a possible periodic variability with a period of \sim 1000 days (Jencson et al., 2023; Kilpatrick et al., 2023; Soraisam et al., 2023; Van Dyk et al., 2024; Niu et al., 2023; Neustadt et al., 2024). The initial mass of the progenitor is, however, controversial, with different values obtained through different methods (e.g., based on luminosity, variability, and stellar populations in the vicinity of SN 2023ixf). The observed progenitor candidate activity disfavors the presence of any outburst events in the last \sim 20 years (Jencson et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023; Neustadt et al., 2024). Although the observational results on SN 2023ixf suggest the presence of a confined dense CSM, the radial density profile of the CSM, including the extended tenuous region, has not been tightly constrained. Radio observations provide information on the SN-CSM interaction and make it possible to estimate the mass-loss rate of the progenitor star independently from the other wavelength observations. Regarding the radio observations of SN 2023ixf, Berger et al. (2023) reported non-detection at 230 GHz during the early time (\lesssim 18 days after the explosion). Observations at other radio wavelengths and with longer time spans will be beneficial to elucidate more details on the progenitor evolution. In this paper, we present the results of radio follow-up observations of SN 2023ixf in the frequency range from 6 GHz to 129 GHz by three Japanese and Korean very long baseline interferometers (VLBIs): the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN), the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA), and the Korean VLBI Network (KVN). VLBI observation for SNe is usually conducted to resolve the spatial structure of nearby objects, but SN 2023ixf is expected to be unresolved at this stage so we used them only to measure the flux densities. The VLBI arrays of our observations consist of fewer antennas than those in recent large-scale VLBIs but are superior in their capability for rapid and flexible scheduling and their use of optimized characteristics for each array. We describe radio observations of SN 2023ixf in Section 2, report measured flux densities in Section 3, discuss the mass-loss history of the progenitor star in Section 4, and summarize our findings in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07531v1,Nuclear burning in an accretion flow around a stellar-mass black hole embedded within an AGN disk,"A stellar-mass black hole, embedded within the accretion disk of an active galactic nuclei (AGN), has the potential to accrete gas at a rate that can reach approximately \sim 10^{9} times the Eddington limit. This study explores the potential for nuclear burning in the rapidly accreting flow towards this black hole and studies how nucleosynthesis affects metal production. Using numerical methods, we have obtained the disk structure while considering nuclear burning and assessed the stability of the disk. In contrast to gas accretion onto the surface of a neutron star or white dwarf, the disk remains stable against the thermal and secular instabilities because advection cooling offsets the nuclear heating effects. The absence of a solid surface for a black hole prevents excessive mass accumulation in the inner disk region. Notably, nuclear fusion predominantly takes place in the inner disk region, resulting in substantial burning of \rm{}^{12}C and \rm{}^{3}He, particularly for black holes around M=10\,M_{\odot} with accretion rates exceeding approximately \sim 10^{7} times the Eddington rate. The ejection of carbon-depleted gas through outflows can lead to an increase in the mass ratio of oxygen or nitrogen to carbon, which may be reflected in observed line ratios such as \rm N\,V/C\,IV and \rm O\,IV/C\,IV. Consequently, these elevated spectral line ratios could be interpreted as indications of super-solar metallicity in the broad line region.","An accretion disk surrounding a compact object can release gravitational energy and is believed to be responsible for various cosmic phenomena, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) or X-ray sources (Ho, 2008; Abramowicz & Fragile, 2013; Yuan & Narayan, 2014; Netzer, 2015; Padovani et al., 2017). Many researchers have developed theoretical models of these accretion disks that operate at different accretion rates (Shakura & Sunyaev, 1973; Abramowicz et al., 1988; Narayan & Yi, 1994). The radiative cooling emitted from the surface of the accretion disk can reduce the disk thickness until viscous heating balances the radiative loss. When this balance is not achieved, especially in the outer regions of the disk, the self-gravity of the disk becomes significant, potentially leading to local instability (Paczynski, 1978; Abramowicz et al., 1984; Lodato, 2007; Wang et al., 2011). As instability develops, it can result in fragmentation through gravitational instability (Shlosman & Begelman, 1987; Goodman, 2003; Goodman & Tan, 2004; Lodato, 2007; Collin & Zahn, 2008; Wang et al., 2011; Mapelli et al., 2012). The fragments may collapse further, eventually forming stars (Shlosman & Begelman, 1989; Goodman & Tan, 2004; Cantiello et al., 2021). Alternatively, stars within nuclear star clusters may be captured by the accretion disk (Artymowicz et al., 1993; Wang et al., 2024). Observations of stellar clusters around the galactic center and the notably top-heavy initial mass function (e.g., Nayakshin & Sunyaev, 2005; Paumard et al., 2006; Bartko et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2018; Nayakshin & Zubovas, 2018; Neumayer et al., 2020; Schödel et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2023) suggest star formation may have occurred in the Galactic center several million years ago. Subsequently, stars and compact objects within these clusters might have slowly drifted towards the SMBHs due to dynamical friction with surrounding gas and stars (Gerhard, 2001). The rate of this drift is affected by the distribution of orbit eccentricity of these stars (Collin & Zahn, 2008; Kennedy et al., 2016). Furthermore, the possible connection between the spatial locations of quasar SDSS J1249+3449 and the gravitational wave event GW190521 (Graham et al., 2020) hints at the possibility of forming massive black hole binaries in AGN disks, where the dense environments promote binary mergers (Samsing et al., 2022). It appears likely that stars or compact objects could reside within the AGN disk. Whether formed due to disk instability or captured from the cluster, these stars or compact objects can continue growing through gas accretion (Dittmann & Miller, 2020; Wang et al., 2021a; Ali-Dib & Lin, 2023; Wang et al., 2024). Unlike field stars in their host galaxies, stars located in self-gravitating AGN disks can accrete gas at rates significantly exceeding the Eddington limit, primarily because of the dense environment of the AGN disk (Wang et al., 2021a). An estimation of the accretion rate towards the central object suggests that the Eddington ratio could reach values around \sim 10^{9} (Wang et al., 2021a). For simplicity, we refer to these rapidly accreting stars as accretion-modified stars (AMSs) (Wang et al., 2021a, b). It is important to note that the central star could be a normal star or a compact object. Certainly, by examining a star age and the AGN lifetime (Schawinski et al., 2015; King & Nixon, 2015), it is still plausible that the compact object could originated from surrounding star clusters and was subsequently captured by the AGN disk. For an AMS, assuming a central black hole (BH), with an accretion rate as high as \sim 10^{9}\dot{M}_{\rm edd}, where \dot{M}_{\rm edd} is the BH Eddington rate, is there a potential for initiating nuclear burning within the accretion disk of this AMS? The sensitivity of nuclear reaction rates to temperature introduces the concept of ignition or threshold temperature (Prialnik, 2009). When this threshold is surpassed, the reaction rates increase significantly. For hydrogen burning, the threshold temperature for the proton-proton chain is around 4\times 10^{6} K, and for the CNO bi-cycle process, it is approximately 1.5\times 10^{7} K. In the numerical simulations (Kitaki et al., 2018), it is implied that for supercritical accretion disks, the temperature within the disk mid-plane can be approximated by a formula T=3.85\times 10^{7}{\rm K}\ (M/{M_{\odot}})^{-0.24}\,(\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm edd% })^{0.24}\,(r/2r_{\rm g})^{-0.54}, where M, \dot{M}, and c are the BH mass, accretion rate, and the speed of light, respectively. The gravitational radius r_{\rm g} is defined as r_{\rm g}\equiv GM/c^{2}. Consequently, the temperature in the accretion disk, by assuming supercritical accretion, could potentially reach the threshold for nuclear burning. The timescale of a nuclear reaction is inversely proportional to the reaction rate (Iben, 2012). For an estimate of this timescale, we consider a density of \rho\sim 1\ \rm g\,cm^{-3} and a temperature of T\sim 1.6\times 10^{7}\ \rm K. Refer to Figure 1, the densities at various accretion rates have already increased to approximately an order of magnitude greater than \sim 1\ \rm g\,cm^{-3} near the inner disk area. Using these parameters, we determine that the lifetime of the isotope \rm{}^{16}O, which has the longest lifetime among the nuclei in the CNO bi-cycle, to be approximately \sim 10^{-4}\ \rm s (see table 6.10.2 in Iben, 2012). This timescale is already shorter than the disk viscous timescale. As the disk accretion rate increases, the density and temperature near the disk center could also increase, and thus the timescale, which also depends on the disk radius, might become even shorter. Therefore, based on the above estimation of the disk temperature and the nuclear timescale, it is expected that the accreting material in the AMS disk may experience phenomena like hydrogen burning or alpha captures. Observational phenomena, such as novae (e.g., Shen & Bildsten, 2007; Hachisu & Kato, 2019) or type I X-ray bursts (e.g., Narayan & Heyl, 2003; Zamfir et al., 2014; Galloway et al., 2017; Galloway & Keek, 2021), are thought to be linked to nuclear reactions that occur in an unstable fashion. It is hypothesized that hydrogen shell burning or thermonuclear explosions may occur on the surface of white dwarfs or neutron stars (for a review, see Lewin et al., 1993; Galloway et al., 2017). Are thermonuclear explosions possible in a super-critical accretion disk? Can nuclear burning affect disk stability or cause variations in the accretion rate? Or could we expect any type of observational flare, caused by these instabilities, in the light curves ? A pertinent question is whether nucleosynthesis can significantly modify the abundance of heavy elements in the disk. Observations suggest that the metallicity of the broad line region (BLR) in high-redshift quasars exceeds solar levels, inferred from specific emission line ratios (Nagao et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2023). This super-solar metallicity might result from star formation in the nuclear region of the AGN host galaxy, where these stars subsequently enhance the metal content of quasars (see the review paper of Hamann & Ferland (1999)). Furthermore, if the energy generated by nuclear reactions within the accretion disk of AMS is considerable, we might also expect some metal contributions from the outflow within the accretion disk. Research on nuclear reactions and nucleosynthesis in accretion flows around black holes has been previously examined by various scholars (Taam & Fryxell, 1985; Chakrabarti et al., 1987; Arai & Hashimoto, 1992; Mukhopadhyay & Chakrabarti, 2000, 2001; Hu & Peng, 2008). However, studies on accretion rates as high as \sim 10^{9}\dot{M}_{\rm edd} have not yet been performed. Furthermore, earlier studies had to assume very inefficient angular momentum transport, with \alpha viscosity levels as low as \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-6} (Arai & Hashimoto, 1992), or ignore the effect of advection cooling, which could be important for the supercritial accretion disk (Taam & Fryxell, 1985). In this paper, we revisit the examination of nucleosynthesis within the fast accretion flow towards an AMS, with a focus on the possibility of nuclear burning. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the equations used to model the disk structure surrounding a black hole. Section 3 delves into the thermodynamic conditions within the disk, presents the findings on the disk structure incorporating nuclear burning, and assesses the stability of the disk. Section 4 explores nucleosynthesis in the disk and considers the potential implications for metal enrichment within the AGN disk. The paper concludes with final remarks in the last section."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07394v1,The Mega-MUSCLES Treasury Survey: X-ray to infrared Spectral Energy Distributions of a representative sample of M dwarfs,"We present 5–1\times 10^{7} Å spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for twelve M dwarf stars covering spectral types M0–M8. Our SEDs are provided for community use as a sequel to the Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES) survey. The twelve stars include eight known exoplanet hosts and four stars chosen to fill out key parameter space in spectral type and rotation period. The SEDs are constructed from Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopy and XMM Newton, Chandra and/or Swift X-ray observations and completed with various model data, including \mathrm{Lyman}\,\alpha reconstructions, PHOENIX optical models, APEC coronal models and Differential Emission Measure models in the currently-unobservable Extreme Ultraviolet. We provide a complete overview of the Mega-MUSCLES program, including a description of the observations, models, and SED construction. The SEDs are available as MAST High-Level Science Products and we describe the various data products here. We also present ensemble measurements from our sample that are of particular relevance to exoplanet science, including the high-energy fluxes in the habitable zone and the FUV/NUV ratio. Combined with MUSCLES, Mega-MUSCLES provides SEDs covering a wide range of M dwarf spectral types and ages such that suitable proxies for any M dwarf planet host of interest may be found in our sample. However, we find that ultraviolet and X-ray fluxes can vary even between stars with similar parameters, such that observations of each exoplanet host star will remain the gold standard for interpreting exoplanet atmosphere observations.","M dwarf stars, with masses \approx 0.1-0.5 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}, have emerged as the premier targets for exoplanet discovery and characterization over the past two decades (Tarter et al., 2007), particularly for rocky planets with masses and radii comparable to that of Earth in orbits within the habitable zone around the host star. The focus on M dwarfs is partly due to their great abundance, representing over 70 % of stars (Henry et al., 2006), but mostly for observational considerations. The sensitivity of both of the dominant techniques for exoplanet discovery, the transit and radial velocity methods, scale dramatically and favourably with decreased stellar mass, such that planets with similar mass and radius to the Earth are much easier to find around M dwarfs than around larger stars. Additionally, the habitable zones of M dwarfs are much closer in compared to the habitable zones around larger stars due to their lower luminosity, so the orbital periods of planets there are of order days to weeks rather than years, requiring less time-on-target to detect and confirm. Short orbital periods, and a relatively small planet-to-star size ratio, also makes M dwarf planets favourable targets for atmospheric characterisation via transit spectroscopy. The importance of M dwarfs to exoplanet science has been highlighted by some of the most remarkable discoveries, such as the habitable zone planet orbiting Proxima Centauri (Anglada-Escudé et al., 2016) and the seven Earth-sized planets around TRAPPIST-1 (Gillon et al., 2016, 2017). The launch of JWST has enabled an increasing number of atmospheric observations of planets orbiting M dwarfs, ruling out thick atmospheres around several of the most accessible targets (Greene et al., 2023; Zieba et al., 2023; Lincowski et al., 2023; Moran et al., 2023). With the advent of the Rocky Worlds program (Redfield et al., 2024), continued JWST observations of planets around M dwarfs are guaranteed for years to come. When attempting to assess the characteristics and potential habitability of such planets, we must be cautious when comparing them with the Solar system (Rugheimer et al., 2015a; Rugheimer & Kaltenegger, 2018). The differences between M dwarfs and Sun-like stars are many. Their lower temperature means that the spectrum is shifted into the red, and the average M dwarf is much more active than more massive stars, both in terms of flare frequency and maximum flare strength relative to its luminosity (Loyd et al., 2018b; Froning et al., 2019), with the potential effects on their planets exacerbated by the close-in habitable zones (Buccino et al., 2007; Vida et al., 2017). Perhaps the starkest difference between M dwarfs and Sun-like stars are their high energy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Multiple observations have demonstrated that the X-ray fluxes of M dwarfs relative to their bolometric luminosities can be thousands of times higher than for Sun-like stars (Wheatley et al., 2017; Wright et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2023). Conversely, the red-ward shift of the photospheric spectrum results in relative near-ultraviolet flux ratios being lower than Sun-like stars by a similar factor. The X-ray and ultraviolet fluxes are key drivers of exoplanet atmospheric structure and chemistry. Photochemistry in the upper atmospheres of exoplanets (i.e., the layers that we can most readily observe) is governed by the incident ultraviolet spectrum, and in particular the strength of the \mathrm{Lyman}\,\alpha line and the ratio of FUV to NUV fluxes (Segura et al., 2005; Moses et al., 2013; Miguel et al., 2015; JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Team et al., 2023). X-ray and EUV radiation drives atmospheric escape, such that planets in extreme XUV environments may not retain atmospheres at all (Watson et al., 1981; Poppenhaeger et al., 2024; Van Looveren et al., 2024). A number of surveys have been pursued over the last several years to use HST and other facilities to obtain energetic spectra of M dwarf stars. Programs like Living with a Red Dwarf, HAZMAT, MUSCLES, and FUMES, plus observations focused on individual targets of interest, have greatly expanded the sample of M stars with observed ultraviolet spectra (Guinan et al., 2016; Loyd et al., 2021, 2018a; France et al., 2016; Youngblood et al., 2016; Loyd et al., 2016, 2018b; Bourrier et al., 2017; MacGregor et al., 2021; Waalkes et al., 2019; Diamond-Lowe et al., 2022; Pineda et al., 2021a; Feinstein et al., 2022; Rockcliffe et al., 2021). Ideally, a full X-ray through optical SED should be obtained for any M dwarf of interest, but such observations are often impractical for multiple reasons. Whilst the high energy emission from M dwarfs is a higher fraction of the bolometic flux relative to a larger star, it is still intrinsically faint, requiring large investments of limited space telescope observing time for even the closest M dwarfs. Accordingly, the MUSCLES Treasury Survey was conceived to provide complete SEDs for a representative sample of low mass stars, while also providing scaling relations for other surveys with more targets but less wavelength coverage (Youngblood et al., 2017). MUSCLES used HST in combination with X-ray facilities and optical photospheric model atmospheres to obtain 5 Å – 5.5 \mum spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for seven M dwarf and four K dwarf stars. High-level data products were delivered to MAST as a resource for the exoplanet modeling community as well as stellar astrophysicists to provide a uniform ultraviolet survey for the study of M dwarfs that includes reliable measurements of Ly\alpha and resolved stellar emission lines. The MUSCLES SEDs High Level Science Product archive111https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/muscles/ has been used in a number of theoretical studies to model the atmospheric properties of exoplanet atmospheres (Spake et al., 2018; Wunderlich et al., 2020; Kawashima et al., 2019), predict observable atmospheric signatures that can be detected with the JWST (Morley et al., 2017), and investigate the effects of stellar flares on planetary atmospheres and potential life (Miguel et al., 2015; Louca et al., 2023) . The original MUSCLES survey focused on stars with known exoplanets. Given the known nearby systems at the time, largely found by optical radial velocity searches, this resulted in a sample that was biased toward the higher mass end of the M dwarf sequence. Only threee MUSCLES targets, GJ 1214, GJ 1061 and Proxima Centauri, had masses below <0.3 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}. With the launch of JWST, the search for “Earth-like” planets is moving toward the low mass end of the stellar Main Sequence. Surveys including MEarth, TRAPPIST/SPECULOOS, and TESS are finding Earth-sized planets around stars with masses of \sim0.3 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} or below (Berta-Thompson et al., 2015; Dittmann et al., 2017; Winters et al., 2019; Pidhorodetska et al., 2021). It is targets like these, around low mass stars, that will be the subject of atmospheric characterization of rocky planets in the next decade or more (Kempton et al., 2018; Fortenbach & Dressing, 2020; Redfield et al., 2024). It was with this in mind that the Mega-MUSCLES Treasury Survey was conceived as the successor to MUSCLES. Mega-MUSCLES observed thirteen M dwarfs across a range of mass, age, and activity levels (Figure 1), with a particular focus on low mass M stars that are the likely first targets for atmospheric characterization of Earth-like planets. The sample list included observations for six more of the closest low-mass exoplanet host stars; for slow-rotating stars to 0.14 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} (to serve as proxies for future habitable planet hosts); for stars like GJ 1132 but with faster rotation periods (to track XUV evolution with age); for the 2nd (GJ 699 = Barnard’s Star) and 7th (GJ 729) closest star systems; and for the multiple rocky planet system, TRAPPIST-1. The target list included stars with no known exoplanets that filled out the phase space of M dwarf mass and rotation/activity. When combined with the existing observations, the complete Mega-MUSCLES library spans a range of stellar masses (0.14–0.8 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}), high to low X-ray luminosity fraction (an indicator of activity level), and planetary systems ranging from Jupiters to super-Neptunes to super-Earths. In this paper, we present an overview of the Mega-MUSCLES Treasury Survey. Several papers have already been published focusing on individual targets of interest (Froning et al., 2019; France et al., 2020; Wilson et al., 2021), describing the X-ray observations for both MUSCLES and Mega-MUSCLES in detail (Brown et al., 2023), using the observations to probe proxies of stellar coronal and chromospheric behavior (Linsky et al., 2020), and developing optical proxies for high energy emission (Melbourne et al., 2020). This paper will focus on summarizing the survey observing methods, SED generation, and analysis of the data as a population.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07393v1,Monitoring of DDO68 ’Northern Ring’ SF regions during years 2016–2023,"DDO68 is a star-forming (SF) dwarf galaxy residing in a nearby void. Its gas metallicity is among the lowest known in the local Universe, with parameter 12+log(O/H) in the range of 6.96–7.3 dex. Six of its SF regions are located in or near the so-called ’Northern Ring’, in which the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images reveal many luminous young stars. We present for these SF regions (Knots) the results of optical monitoring in 35 epochs during the years 2016–2023. The data was acquired with the 6m (BTA) and the 1m telescopes of the Special Astrophysical Observatory and the 2.5m telescope of the MSU Caucasian Mountain Observatory. We complement the above results with the archive data from 10 other telescopes for 11 epochs during the years 1988–2013 and with 3 our BTA observations between 2005 and 2015. Our goal is to search for variability of these Knots and to relate it to the probable light variations of their brightest stars. One of them, DDO68-V1 (in Knot 3), was identified in 2008 with a luminous blue variable (LBV) star, born in the lowest metallicity environments. For Knot 3, variations of its integrated light in the previous epochs reached \sim0.8 mag. In the period since 2016, the amplitude of variations of Knot 3 reached \sim0.3 mag. For the rest Knots, due to the lower amplitudes, the manifestation of variability is less pronounced. We examine the presence of variability via the criterion \chi^{2} and the Robust Median Statistics and discuss the robustness of the detected variations. The variability is detected according to the both criteria in the lightcurves of all Knots with the \chi^{2} confidence level of \alpha = 0.0005. The peak-to-peak amplitudes of variations are \sim0.09, \sim0.13, \sim0.11, \sim0.08 and \sim0.16 mag for Knots 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The amplitudes of the related variations of the brightest supergiants in these regions can reach of \sim3.0 mag.","1 INTRODUCTION Massive stars (conditionally, of 8 to 100 and more M⊙) are very important element of several interrelated directions in astrophysics, from star formation and its feedback, galaxy formation and evolution to cosmological issues related to reionisation of the intergalactic medium. Due to their short life timescale, the massive stars in the Galaxy have metallicities close to the current gas metallicity, that is close to Z\simZ⊙. There are several tasks related to the study of massive stars in the context of the diverse metallicity. In particular, the understanding of properties of massive stars with very low Z of \lesssimZ⊙/30 is crucial for studying and modelling of galaxy formation and evolution at the epoch of dawn of the Universe. The need to check the modern models of massive very low-Z stars on the real objects assumes the search for and study such objects in the outer galaxies. The gas metallicity in the nearby Universe was found to vary in the range of (\sim0.02–3) Z⊙. Due to the well-known relation between mass (or luminosity) and gas metallicity in late-type galaxies, the lowest metallicity massive stars are expected to form currently in dwarf galaxies. According to the statistical relation between the gas metallicity and galaxy luminosity for late-type galaxies within the Local Volume (LV) (Berg et al., 2012), dwarf galaxies with the gas metallicity (and hence, that of young massive stars) of Z \lesssim Z⊙/30 (eXtremely Metal-Poor, hereafter, XMP) should be rather faint, with M{}_{\rm B}\gtrsim –9 mag. Such faint dwarfs and their massive stars are accessible only at the distances of the LV and its environs. The nearest dwarf with that low metallicity, Leo P (Skillman et al., 2013), possesses the only Hii region, excited by one O7-8 V star. It was recently studied by Telford et al. (2023). To substantially advance in the studying of massive stars at such extremely low Z (including the massive stars in the evolved stages), one needs XMP galaxies with many massive stars within the LV (Garcia et al., 2021). According to our spectral study of void galaxies (Pustilnik et al., 2016, 2020, 2021, 2024), the XMP dwarfs favour the void environment. Moreover, for a given luminosity, they show substantially reduced gas metallicities. And visa versa, for their extremely low metallicities, they appear substantially more luminous than one would expect from the reference relation of Berg et al. (2012), derived for galaxies in the denser environment. Therefore, statistically, the probability to find multiple massive stars in void XMP dwarfs is higher than for the similar dwarfs outside voids. Luminous blue variable (LBV) stars are thought to represent a relatively short transient and rather unstable stage of massive star evolution from the main sequence hydrogen burning O-stars to the core-helium burning Wolf-Raye (WR) stars (Humphreys & Davidson, 1994). During this stage, massive stars lose the substantial mass via the powerful wind and in a series of ’normal’ eruptions with the typical timescales of a few years per event. Besides, some evidence appeared that LBVs can also be the direct precoursors of supernova Type II explosions (e.g., Petrov, Vink, Gräfener, 2006, and references therein). The nature of variable massive star winds is better understood for the solar and subsolar metallicities, for which the wind power scales with metallicity Z, indicating the dominant role of radiation pressure to ions of metals (e.g. Vink, 2022). Extrapolation of such wind mechanism to very low metallicities assumes no WR stars in the most metal poor starburst. However, the detection of WR population in the most metal-poor BCGs (e.g. Guseva et al., 2000)) evidence that other mechanisms may operate for massive star winds at the very low metallicities. Moreover, for the most dramatic events known as LBV ’giant eruptions’, the radiation pressure mechanism may be not suitable (e.g. Smith & Owocki, 2006). Hence, the study of individual very low-Z massive stars can be crucial for the choice of their most reliable models. The understanding of processes in very metal-poor LBVs is especially suitable since due to their highly non-stationary mass loss, their properties should be more sensitive to the model assumptions. The recent studies of massive stars with metallicities as low as Z = Z⊙/10 in Sextans A (Lorenzo et al., 2022; Schootemeijer et al., 2022), and Z = Z⊙/20 in Leo A (Gull et al., 2022), represent the important steps in understanding the properties of the low-metallicity massive stars. However, the search for opportunities to study massive stars at even lower Z, say at Z⊙/50 – Z⊙/40, still remains highly challenging. The number of individual very massive stars in galaxies with the extremely low metallicity (Z \lesssim Z⊙/30, corresponding to the host SF regions with the gas oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) \lesssim 7.2 dex) is very limited in the local Universe. Even more so it relates to such low-Z massive stars at the advanced evolutionary stages. They, first of all, include a number of WR stars and red supergiants (RSGs) in the prototype XMP dwarf IZw18 (e.g Izotov et al., 1997; Legrand et al., 1997; Hirschauer et al., 2024) at D \sim16 Mpc. Another important object is the dwarf XMP galaxy DDO68 at D = 12.75 Mpc (\mu = 30.53 mag) (Makarov et al., 2017; Cannon et al., 2014), as derived via the TRGB method. In this galaxy, the lowest metallicity LBV star was discovered (also known as DDO68-V1) (Pustilnik et al., 2008; Izotov & Thuan, 2009) along with many identified individual supergiants (Pustilnik et al., 2017). The Lynx-Cancer void galaxy DDO68 (UGC5340, VV542) is known as a peculiar morphology, the almost record-low metallicity (average 12+log(O/H)=7.14) dIrr with several prominent young star-forming (SF) regions. Most of these SF regions are found at the periphery, mainly in the ’Northern ring’ and the ’Southern tail’ (Pustilnik et al., 2005; Izotov & Thuan, 2007). These SF regions, named Knots in Pustilnik et al. (2005), look in fact as young OB associations hosting tens massive stars, with the typical linear sizes of several tens pc. The only exception is the compact Knot 5, which shows properties of a young globular cluster with the age of about 20 Myr. See the HST image of Knots 1–6 in Fig. 1. Annibali et al. (2019) found the range of metallicities in DDO68, from 12+log(O/H) \sim7.3 dex near the center of the main body, down to \sim7.0 dex in the southernmost SF region. The importance of this XMP dwarf in the context of the future study of the lowest metallicity massive stars was first emphasised about 20 years ago by Kniazev, Pustilnik (2006). Thanks to good luck, the unique Luminous Blue Variable star (LBV) was discovered in the repeat observations of DDO68, in one of the most metal-poor SF regions in the local Universe (Pustilnik et al., 2008; Izotov & Thuan, 2009). The issue of the extremely metal-poor massive star evolution and death remains one of the clues for understanding of galaxy formation and evolution for the time of \lesssim1 Gyr since the Big Bang (e.g., Barkana & Loeb, 2001; Eldridge, Stanway, 2022). This is especially actual in the epoch of active observational exploration of galaxies for the time of 0.5 – 1 Gyr since the Big Bang with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The great majority of these remote objects are star-forming galaxies. They display a wide range of metallicities, including the lowest values, found in the local Universe (e.g. Maseda et al., 2023). While the state-of-art stellar evolution models, including those with the fast rotation, have substantially advanced during the last decade (e.g. Szecsi et al, 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Sanyal et al., 2017; Martins, Palacios, 2021, and references therein) the direct comparison of the model predictions with properties of real extremely metal-poor massive stars is still absent. The main reason is the lack of such stars in the local Universe which would be accessible for sufficiently detailed studies. One needs to wait for the qualitative progress, expected for the upcoming extremely large next generation optical telescopes. As a preliminary step for these future studies, the search for such rare massive stars and examination of their available properties, such as variability, appears valuable and necessary. As explained above, the main goal of the monitoring of the DDO68 ’Northern Ring’ region is an attempt to examine the possible peculiarities in the light curve of the extremely metal-poor LBV DDO68-V1. However, the images used for this task, cover the five other SF regions (Knots), in which the HST data allow us to separate many other massive stars. In particular, the list of the 50 brightest stars (supergiants with MV \leq –6.0 mag) in these Knots was presented in Pustilnik et al. (2017). Their sufficiently large-amplitude variability can, in principle, be detected via variations of the integral light of their host SF regions. The mentioned above SF regions, excluding Knot 5, are rather young, as follows from their large values of the equivalent widths of the emission H\beta (Pustilnik et al., 2005). With the range of EW(H\beta) = 47 – 250 Å, the respective ages of the instantaneous star-bursts correspond to the range of 3–7 Myr (Leitherer et al., 1999). So that one can expect the population of massive OB stars at various evolutionary stages still alive. Their non-stationary stellar wind activity can manifest as a substantial light variability. In this paper we present the most updated lightcurve for Knot 3, containing the most metal-poor LBV star DDO68-V1. The data will be used in the forthcoming paper, examining the LBV light variations after its so-called ’giant eruption’ in 2010–2013 years. More emphasis in the paper is given to the ’by-product’ – monitoring the light variations in the rest Knots. We present at the first time the magnitudes and lightcurves of Knots 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 and examine them for the possible signs of variability using the well-known \chi2 criterion and the so-called RoMS (Robust Median Statistics, Rose, Hintz (2007); Burdanov et al. (2014)). The lay-out of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we present all the used observational data and briefly describe their reduction. In Sect. 3 the main results of data processing and analysis are presented. Sect. 4 describes arrays of photometric serieses for all Knots and their check for possible variability. Sect. 5 is devoted to discussion of new results, their comparison with the previous data and understanding them in a wider context. In Sect. 6 we summarise the new results and draw the main conclusions. The adopted linear scale is 62 pc in 1 arcsec.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07350v2,Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds II. Properties of Critical Cores,"A fraction of the dense cores within a turbulent molecular cloud will eventually collapse, leading to star formation. Identifying the physical criteria for cores to become unstable, and analyzing critical core properties, thus constitutes a necessary step toward the complete theory of star formation. Here we quantify the characteristics of an ensemble of “critical cores” on the verge of collapse. This critical epoch was identified in a companion paper, which followed the dynamical evolution of prestellar cores in numerical simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating clouds. We find that radial profiles of density and turbulent velocity dispersion in individual critical cores are consistent with our new model for turbulent equilibrium spheres (TESs). While a global linewidth–size relation exists for a cloud with given size and Mach number, the turbulent scaling relations around each core exhibit significant variations, locally regulating the critical density for a core to become unstable. As a result, there is no single density threshold for collapse; instead, cores collapse at a range of densities determined by the local sonic scale and gravitational potential environment, with a distribution expected for TESs with a limited range of turbulent velocity dispersion. The critical cores in our simulations are mostly transonic; we do not find either purely thermal or highly turbulent cores. We find that the core mass function (CMF) of critical cores peaks around the characteristic mass scale associated with the large-scale cloud properties. We highlight the importance of constructing the CMF at the critical time instead of sink particle mass functions, and derive the resolution requirements to unambiguously identify the peak of the CMF.","Dense cores are transient structures within turbulent giant molecular clouds, with their properties continuously changing in space and time (see Bergin & Tafalla, 2007; di Francesco et al., 2007; McKee & Ostriker, 2007; André et al., 2014; Offner et al., 2014; Padoan et al., 2014, for related reviews). While the physical properties of prestellar cores — which ultimately collapse, leading to star formation — are of great interest, it has not been clear exactly what the criterion is for a given core to become unstable and therefore unambiguously “prestellar.” In observational surveys, the simplest working definition for prestellar candidates is cores that appear gravitationally bound, based on estimates of their internal energy, although more detailed criteria have also been applied (e.g. Andre et al., 2000; Könyves et al., 2015). However, simulations that trace the evolution of dense structures show that many stochastically cycle through different phases (due to their turbulent environment), rather than following a single evolutionary sequence, and in particular cores with “prestellar” characteristics sometimes subsequently disperse (Offner et al., 2022). Notwithstanding the ambiguities in recognizing prestellar cores, their very nature — objects that will collapse to form a star or stellar system in the near future — provides at least two physically meaningful common reference points in time shared across all cores: (1) The time when they initiate gravitational runaway (hereafter “critical time”) and (2) the instant they complete it by forming a nascent protostar at the center (“collapse time”). While these milestones would be essentially impossible to pinpoint in observations, they can be identified on an individual core basis within numerical simulations of gravo-turbulent fragmentation. The second of the two above events is easier to pick out in simulations, since this is when runaway collapse leads to a \rho\propto r^{-2} singular density profile (Larson, 1969; Penston, 1969).111Strictly speaking, it is only at the center of this power-law profile that a protostar-disk system begins to grow. In particular, in numerical simulations where collapsing centers are replaced with sink particles, the collapse time of each core can be identified as the moment when a sink particle is created. For example, Gong & Ostriker (2015), Padoan et al. (2020), and Pelkonen et al. (2021) used the closest snapshot to the creation time of each sink particle to define their “progenitor core” as a gravitationally bound region around the site where the sink is created. By measuring the core mass at each core’s collapse time, Gong & Ostriker (2015) demonstrated that the core mass function (CMF) has a well-defined peak which converges with increasing numerical resolution. Pelkonen et al. (2021), taking a slightly different approach, varied the resolution for the clumpfind algorithm rather than the underlying simulation resolution, and also found convergence in the CMF at the time of collapse. In the majority of numerical studies of gravo-turbulent fragmentation, however, it is not the CMF at a characteristic epoch for each core or sink’s evolution that is measured, but instead the sink particle mass function (SMF) at an arbitrarily selected time common to all particles (e.g., Haugbølle et al., 2018; Lee & Hennebelle, 2018; Guszejnov et al., 2020). The resulting SMF has not shown numerically converging behavior, unlike the CMF based on individual collapse times (see, however, Haugbølle et al., 2018; Pelkonen et al., 2021). As we shall discuss, the reason for the difference between CMF convergence and SMF non-convergence likely relates to fragmentation in late stages of evolution. But in any case, in order to test theories of turbulent fragmentation that are the basis for models of the initial mass function (e.g., Padoan & Nordlund, 2002; Hennebelle & Chabrier, 2008; Hopkins, 2012), it is necessary to construct the CMF itself at characteristic epochs of evolution. While the collapse time provides a convenient reference point and can be easily identified in numerical simulations, it is the critical time that is most relevant for the point of comparison to theories. Collins et al. (2024), by analyzing the collapse histories of simulated cores via tracer particles, found that there exists a characteristic epoch after which mass is rapidly delivered to the core center, raising the core density in a runaway fashion. Based on this observation they defined a proxy for the critical time (termed “singularity time” in their work) by choosing a threshold on the density time derivative. They found that, as each core approaches its critical time, the radial density profiles of cores develop a characteristic core–envelope structure while the mean radial and tangential velocities exhibit a common behavior of increasing in magnitude with increasing radius. The identification of this characteristic epoch reveals a common physical process occurring in an ensemble of cores that is otherwise blurred by evolution. However, the question of what determines this critical time still remains to be answered. Related to the critical time is a common narrative for the evolution of prestellar cores, where certain critical conditions trigger gravitational runaway (McKee & Ostriker 2007; André et al. 2014; Offner et al. 2014; Padoan et al. 2014). Among others, the Bonnor-Ebert (BE) sphere and its stability property (Ebert, 1955; Bonnor, 1956; Ebert, 1957) have often been used as a theoretical tool for determining critical conditions (e.g., Krumholz & McKee, 2005; Padoan & Nordlund, 2011). However, the applicability of the BE model to cores within turbulent molecular clouds is limited, because (1) real cores exist as a part of a turbulent continuum unlike an isolated BE sphere truncated by “external pressure,” and (2) the model does not account for internal turbulent velocities expected for cores forming within a turbulent cloud. In a series of papers, we have begun a comprehensive analysis of prestellar core evolution to address the limitations pertaining to the BE model and to answer the question of exactly what triggers the onset of collapse. In Moon & Ostriker (2024a, hereafter Paper I), we developed a new theoretical model for equilibrium spherically-symmetric cores supported by both thermal and turbulent pressure, with the solutions obtained by directly solving the time-steady, angle-averaged equations of hydrodynamics. A distinguishing feature of the resulting family of solutions, which we term the turbulent equilibrium sphere (TES), is that the turbulent pressure naturally arises from a power-law velocity structure function rather than from a phenomenological equation of state. The TES model also enjoys a useful behavior of reducing to the BE model in the limit of vanishing turbulent velocities. Paper I found that, similar to the case for BE spheres, solutions can be classified as stable or unstable to radial perturbations. For a given set of turbulence parameters and central density, cores exceeding a certain critical size are unstable. The radius, mass, and center-to-edge density contrast of critical TESs all increase with increasing turbulent velocity dispersion (or equivalently, decreasing sonic scale). This implies that a nascent core forming in a highly turbulent region would initially be in the stable, subcritical regime. Based on the stability properties of TESs and from a general consideration of tidal gravitational fields in core-forming regions, Paper I proposed an evolutionary scenario for “successful” prestellar cores formed by converging turbulent flows. In this scenario, nascent cores evolve in the direction of increasing density (as mass is added) and decreasing turbulence (as dissipation progresses). When converging flows are strong enough or turbulence sufficiently dissipates, the critical radius r_{\mathrm{crit}} moves inside the “tidal radius” r_{\mathrm{tidal}} set by the landscape of the gravitational potential, and a core becomes unstable and collapses. Otherwise, it remains stable and is eventually dispersed by turbulence (see Figure 11 of Paper I for a schematic illustration for this scenario). To test this scenario and identify the critical conditions for collapse, in Moon & Ostriker (2024b) (hereafter Paper II) we conducted and carefully analyzed a suite of numerical simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating clouds. Paper II presents results from a comprehensive analysis of each core’s dynamical evolution from its formation, through the onset of collapse, to the point when the central density blows up, signaling the beginning of the protostellar phase. By measuring radial forces acting within the cores over time, Paper II directly identified the critical time when the net radial force becomes negative, instigating runaway collapse. We found good agreement between the empirically identified critical time and the epoch when a core is predicted to be unstable according to the TES model, thus providing an answer as to what determines the critical time. In this paper, we analyze the simulation results of Paper II at the critical time of each core to investigate the physical properties of prestellar cores at the onset of collapse. We shall show that the cores defined at their respective critical time (referred to as “critical cores” throughout this work) are mostly transonic in terms of their internal turbulence (turbulent Mach number \sim 0.5\text{--}1.5), with their structure overall consistent with the TES model. We shall also show that the local turbulent scaling relations within each core exhibit significant variations above and below the average linewidth–size relation for the entire cloud, with higher density in more turbulent critical cores. As a result, there is a wide range of critical densities for collapse, rather than a single threshold density. We shall also present statistical distributions of core masses, sizes, densities, durations of different evolutionary stages, and accretion rates. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define key physical quantities related to our TES model and numerical simulations. In Section 3, we first (Section 3.1) present the radial density and velocity dispersion profiles of critical cores and compare them with the TES models. We then (Section 3.2) show that the locally constructed linewidth–size relations exhibit significant variations around the mean relation, causing cores to become unstable at a wide range of densities (Section 3.3). We also present probability distributions of various physical quantities measured for critical cores, including the CMF (Section 3.4). Section 4 presents the evolution of the mass inflow rates and, by using them, characterizes evolutionary timescales at each stage. We discuss implications of our results in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07349v2,Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds I. Numerical Modeling and Evolution to Collapse,"A fundamental issue in star formation is understanding the precise mechanisms leading to the formation of prestellar cores, and their subsequent gravitationally unstable evolution. To address this question, we carefully construct a suite of turbulent, self-gravitating numerical simulations, and analyze the development and collapse of individual prestellar cores. We show that the numerical requirements for resolving the sonic scale and internal structure of anticipated cores are essentially the same in self-gravitating clouds, calling for the number of cells per dimension to increase quadratically with the cloud’s Mach number. In our simulations, we follow evolution of individual cores by tracking the region around each gravitational potential minimum over time. Evolution in nascent cores is towards increasing density and decreasing turbulence, and there is a wide range of critical density for initiating collapse. At given spatial scale the turbulence level also varies widely, and tends to be correlated with density. By directly measuring the radial forces acting within cores, we identify a distinct transition to a state of gravitational runaway. We use our new theory for turbulent equilibrium spheres to predict the onset of each core’s collapse. Instability is expected when the critical radius becomes smaller than the tidal radius; we find good agreement with the simulations. Interestingly, the imbalance between gravity and opposing forces is only \sim 20\% during core collapse, meaning that this is a quasi-equilibrium rather than a free-fall process. For most of their evolution, cores exhibit both subsonic contraction and transonic turbulence inherited from core-building flows; supersonic radial velocities accelerated by gravity only appear near the end of the collapse.","Stars form in the coldest and densest regions of giant molecular clouds, systems that are pervaded by supersonic turbulence (e.g. André et al., 2014; Heyer & Dame, 2015). The turbulent velocity field in GMCs creates structures at a range of scales (from negative divergences), while also dispersing structures (from positive divergences and shear) and contributing to support against gravity (e.g. McKee & Ostriker, 2007; Hennebelle & Falgarone, 2012). The perturbations in density are organized by the velocity field into spatially correlated, hierarchical structures, which are sometimes characterized by the density power spectrum (Kim & Ryu, 2005; Kritsuk et al., 2007; Konstandin et al., 2016). If the density power spectrum approximately follows a power law, the structures in configuration space are expected to display some degree of self-similarity, often motivating fractal descriptions of density structures (Stutzki et al., 1998; Thiesset & Federrath, 2023). When the gas density is so high that the self-gravity starts to affect the dynamics, however, self-similarity is no longer expected. Observations of nearby molecular clouds indicate that in the dense regions where self-gravity is clearly important and stars form, the gas is organized into roughly spherical, compact (\lesssim 0.1\,\mathrm{pc}), centrally-concentrated objects called dense (starless) cores (see Bergin & Tafalla, 2007; di Francesco et al., 2007, for dedicated reviews on dense cores). Cores’ radial density profiles are characterized by a flat central plateau and outer envelope approximately following \rho\propto r^{-2}, suggestive of gravitational stratification where self-gravity is roughly balanced by pressure gradients. The widths of observed molecular emission lines are somewhat (but not much) broader than the thermal value, indicating that motions within dense cores exhibit subsonic or transonic turbulence (e.g., Goodman et al., 1998; Choudhury et al., 2021). The turbulence within cores presumably is a legacy of their turbulent formation environments. Observed statistics suggest that dense cores are likely transient objects that live no more than a few free-fall times (see below), and their mass distributions have a similar shape to the initial mass function (IMF) but shifted toward higher masses by a factor 2\text{--}3 (see André et al., 2014, and references therein). It is generally understood that dense cores form in regions where turbulent flows happen to locally converge, and under certain conditions undergo runaway gravitational collapse to form a single star or a multiple system (McKee & Ostriker, 2007; André et al., 2014; Offner et al., 2014; Padoan et al., 2014). To investigate this process in a highly idealized setup, Gong & Ostriker (2009) performed spherically symmetric simulations for supersonic converging flows at a range of Mach number, to study how cores form and evolve in dense post-shock regions. As mass is added, cores in those simulations initially evolve in a quasi-equilibrium fashion with increasing density stratification, until the onset of outside-in collapse dramatically (and rapidly) increases the central density. In less idealized three-dimensional simulations focused on post-shock regions in converging, turbulent flows, a similar transition from core building to rapid internal collapse was identified (Gong & Ostriker, 2015). Recently, Collins et al. (2024, see also ) utilized tracer particles to analyze evolution of individual cores self-consistently formed in three-dimensional simulations of self-gravitating isothermal turbulence. They found that cores are formed by converging flows that sweep up low-density gas and then undergo gravitational collapse once the density becomes moderately high and internal turbulent motions decay to transonic or slightly supersonic level. Although the details differ, a common theme in characterizing evolution of simulated cores is that there exists a critical stage at which a core transitions to a state of runaway gravitational collapse (e.g., from the core building to the core collapse stage in Gong & Ostriker (2009); from the hardening to the singularity stage as described in Collins et al. (2024); the first step of the inertial-inflow scenario of Padoan et al. (2020)). A flip side of this is the possible existence of failed cores that do not satisfy the physical conditions associated with the critical stage and disperse back into the interstellar medium (ISM) (e.g., Vázquez-Semadeni et al., 2005; Smullen et al., 2020; Offner et al., 2022). While the transition from core building to collapse stages has been identified in simulations, it has not been explained physically exactly what triggers the onset of collapse. Traditionally, the Bonnor-Ebert (BE) sphere (Bonnor, 1956; Ebert, 1955, 1957) has been regarded as the most relevant theoretical model for distinguishing critical conditions: spherical isothermal equilibria exist for all radii, but beyond a certain radius the equilibrium is unstable and collapse would be expected. However, the BE solution assumes a completely isolated spherical equilibrium supported entirely by thermal pressure, while in contrast real cores (1) are affected by internal velocity structure as they form from the supersonically turbulent ISM, and (2) do not exist in isolation but are surrounded and gravitationally affected by neighboring structures. To address the first of the above limitations, in Moon & Ostriker (2024a) (hereafter Paper I) we developed a new theoretical model of quasi-equilibrium isothermal spheres supported by both thermal and turbulent pressure, with solutions obtained by directly solving the time-steady, angle-averaged equations of hydrodynamics. A salient feature of this model, termed the turbulent equilibrium sphere (TES), is that the turbulent pressure naturally arises from a power-law velocity structure function (see Section 2) rather than from a phenomenological equation of state. The BE solutions are recovered in the limit of vanishing turbulent velocity dispersion. Paper I found that, for a radially stratified TES solution, there exists a critical radius r_{\mathrm{crit}} at which the equilibrium becomes unstable to radial perturbations111Alternatively, for a given confining pressure at the edge, there exists a maximum mass above which no equilibrium solution exists., and that r_{\mathrm{crit}} increases with the strength of the turbulence for a given density. One of the main conclusions of Paper I is that a quasi-equilibrium core will collapse when its maximum radius exceeds r_{\mathrm{crit}}. However, it is not obvious what determines the “maximum radius” of a real core in a real cloud, or if an outer radius exists at all. In an approximately isothermal medium such as a GMC, a core does not possess a well-defined boundary, but instead continuously blends into the surrounding gas. This might seem to imply that no core can remain stable because every core extends indefinitely beyond r_{\mathrm{crit}}. In reality, however, a core is generally surrounded by neighboring structures, such that there is an effective maximum radius beyond which the core cannot be considered an isolated object from the point of view of the gravitational potential. In order to identify the critical conditions for collapse that fully take into account the hierarchical structure in which cores live, and include the effects of the velocity field, careful analyses of numerical simulations are needed. In this paper, we present results from investigations of dynamical evolution of individual cores forming in a suite of three-dimensional numerical simulations of self-gravitating isothermal turbulence. Thus, the present work takes on the second of the limitations of the traditional BE stability analysis mentioned above, armed with the TES solutions of Paper I. In a companion paper (Moon & Ostriker 2024b; hereafter Paper II), we will present detailed properties of the critical cores (defined at the onset of collapse) and compare their structure with the TES model. Another important observational and theoretical issue concerns the dynamical status of prestellar cores as they evolve to reach a high degree of central concentration. At one extreme, prestellar cores are viewed as quasi-static objects slowly evolving under magnetic support to reach the singular isothermal profile, which then undergoes near-pressureless collapse with a rarefaction wave propagating outward from the innermost region (Shu, 1977). The other extreme is to treat the pressureless free-fall stage as beginning from a state with a flat density profile near the center, rather than a power law (Whitworth & Ward-Thompson, 2001; Myers, 2005). The pressure-modified “outside-in” dynamical collapse models (Larson, 1969; Penston, 1969; Hunter, 1977; Foster & Chevalier, 1993) lie somewhere in between these two extremes, often viewed as being qualitatively more similar to the latter. The measured infall speeds of starless cores based on the “blue asymmetry” in the molecular line profiles are too fast and spatially extended to be explained by quasi-static contraction driven by ambipolar diffusion (Lee et al., 1999, 2001). Observed inflows are sometimes considered too slow for dynamical collapse (Campbell et al., 2016), although in fact supersonic speeds only appear toward the end of the collapse (e.g., Foster & Chevalier, 1993; Myers, 2005). Alternatively, observed infall motions may simply reflect the initial momentum of converging, core-building flows (e.g., Lee et al. 2001; Gong & Ostriker 2009; Padoan et al. 2020; Collins et al. 2024) rather than representing gravitational collapse (see also Chen et al., 2020, for discussion of filament-forming flows). Direct number counting of prestellar cores relative to young stellar objects indicates that the core collapse typically takes 2\text{--}5 times the free-fall time (Ward-Thompson et al., 2007; Könyves et al., 2015), consistent with neither free-fall nor quasi-static contraction. Directly measuring the forces acting on simulated cores as a function of time is helpful to quantitatively characterize the dynamics of the collapse process. Measurements of this kind are part of the analysis we present in this paper, leading to the new physical concept of “quasi-equilibrium collapse.” The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly summarize selected content from Paper I that will be referenced throughout this work. In Section 3, we outline the hydrodynamic equations we solve and describe numerical methods and resolution requirements. We also describe our algorithm for tracking cores through successive snapshots in our simulations. Section 4 presents our main results; we describe the overall time evolution of our models, analyze dynamical evolution of individual cores, and identify the critical conditions for collapse. We discuss implications of our results in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07301v1,The impact of the cosmological constant on past and future star formation,"We present an extended analytic model for cosmic star formation, with the aim of investigating the impact of cosmological parameters on the star formation history within the \LambdaCDM paradigm. Constructing an ensemble of flat \LambdaCDM models where the cosmological constant varies between \Lambda=0 and 10^{5} times the observed value, \Lambda_{\rm obs}, we find that the fraction of cosmic baryons that are converted into stars over the entire history of the universe peaks at \sim 27% for 0.01\lesssim\Lambda/\Lambda_{\rm obs}\lesssim 1. We explain, from first principles, that the decline of this asymptotic star-formation efficiency for lower and higher values of \Lambda is driven respectively by the astrophysics of star formation, and by the suppression of cosmic structure formation. However, the asymptotic efficiency declines slowly as \Lambda increases, falling below 5% only for \Lambda>100\,\Lambda_{\rm obs}. Making the minimal assumption that the probability of generating observers is proportional to this efficiency, and following Weinberg in adopting a flat prior on \Lambda, the median posterior value of \Lambda is 539\,\Lambda_{\rm obs}. Furthermore, the probability of observing \Lambda\leq\Lambda_{\rm obs} is only 0.5\%. Although this work has not considered recollapsing models with \Lambda<0, the indication is thus that \Lambda_{\rm obs} appears to be unreasonably small compared to the predictions of the simplest multiverse ensemble. This poses a challenge for anthropic reasoning as a viable explanation for cosmic coincidences and the apparent fine-tuning of the universe: either the approach is invalid, or more parameters than \Lambda alone must vary within the ensemble.","Galaxies are the most obvious tracers of large-scale structure in the universe, and understanding how they emerge and evolve throughout cosmic history has been a longstanding goal of cosmology and astrophysics. The \LambdaCDM paradigm approaches this via the gravitational collapse of dark matter haloes from an initial quasi-homogeneous universe. This process is well understood, thanks to early analytical models of halo assembly (Lacey & Cole, 1993), which were subsequently validated numerically with full N-body simulations (Springel et al., 2005; Klypin et al., 2011; Angulo et al., 2012; Fosalba et al., 2015). However, many of the detailed baryonic processes that govern the build up of galaxies, such as gas accretion, star formation and outflows, are not yet fully understood. A successful theory of galaxy formation needs to account for these processes in order to predict the main observed properties of galaxies. In particular, reproducing the observed efficiency of star formation, both locally within individual galaxies and globally over a cosmologically representative volume, constitutes a crucial test for any model of galaxy formation (see the review by Madau & Dickinson, 2014). In this paper, we consider predictions for this efficiency, and how it depends on cosmological parameters, specifically the cosmological constant. Early fully analytic models of star formation were based on simple prescriptions for the cooling time for the gas within galaxies and the typical time scale for converting it into stars (e.g. Hernquist & Springel, 2003), while following the growth of structures with well established analytical forms for the halo mass function (Press & Schechter, 1974; Sheth & Tormen, 1999, 2002). However, these insightful models neglected more sophisticated mechanisms such as feedback processes driven by stars or active galactic nuclei (AGN). With a slightly different approach, White & Frenk (1991) implemented the effect of sub-galactic physics through a series of approximate formulae, while keeping the treatment of structure formation nearly analytical. This seminal work set the stage for a sequence of refinements of the modelling (e.g. Kauffmann et al., 1993; Cole et al., 1994; Guiderdoni et al., 1998; Kauffmann et al., 1999; Cole et al., 2000). Further extensions included the assembly of the central black hole, which enabled a description of the co-evolution of galaxies and quasars (e.g. Kauffmann & Haehnelt, 2000; Somerville et al., 2008; Henriques et al., 2015; Lacey et al., 2016). Other semi-analytical techniques followed the formation of dark matter haloes in full N-body simulations, coupled with analytical recipes for the baryonic physics (e.g. Croton et al., 2006; Henriques et al., 2020). Full hydrodynamical simulations incorporate several physical processes into the modelling and follow the evolution of baryons and dark matter from first principles. Several cosmological simulations (e.g. Schaye et al., 2010; Dubois et al., 2014; Hopkins et al., 2014; Vogelsberger et al., 2014; Lukić et al., 2015; Schaye et al., 2015; Davé et al., 2016; McCarthy et al., 2017; Pillepich et al., 2018; Davé et al., 2019), often based on different numerical approaches (Springel et al., 2005, 2001a; Almgren et al., 2013; Bryan et al., 2014; Hopkins, 2015; Springel et al., 2021), generally managed to reproduce a plethora of observations to a satisfactory level of accuracy. However, feedback processes are implemented via various different numerical ‘subgrid’ prescriptions, whose parameters are tuned to reproduce certain observations. It is therefore important to ask if the predictions of these calculations are robust, or whether they are fine-tuned to our universe and have a high sensitivity to model parameters. While a substantial body of literature has focused on the effect on star formation history of varying the subgrid parameters (see the review by Somerville & Davé, 2015), the impact of changing the cosmological parameters has historically received less attention. This may partially reflect the tremendous progress in constraining the parameters of the \LambdaCDM paradigm (e.g. Planck Collaboration et al. 2020; but see also Verde et al. 2019 for a discussion on recent tensions). But studying the predictions of hydrodynamical simulations regarding the star formation history in counter-factual cosmological models would constitute an interesting ‘stress-test’ of our understanding of galaxy formation. There is also a more fundamental reason to explore this question. Although the \LambdaCDM model is highly successful in many ways, it has theoretical issues that are hard to ignore (see e.g. the review by Bull et al., 2016). While the cosmological constant \Lambda is required to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe, there is no consensus on its physical meaning. If \Lambda is a manifestation of the energy of the quantum vacuum, then one can estimate its value by integrating over the zero-point energy of all possible modes. Adopting a cutoff energy E_{\rm v} yields a vacuum density of E_{\rm v}^{4} in natural units; but the observed \Lambda requires a cutoff at rather low energies, E_{\rm v}\sim 1\,{\rm meV}, in gross conflict with the scale of new physics at perhaps 10 TeV or above (Martin, 2012). This common calculation is in fact deeply flawed, as it is non-relativistic and yields the wrong vacuum equation of state (Koksma & Prokopec, 2011): a more sophisticated calculation yields a vacuum density of order M^{4}, in terms of the particle mass. But since particles exist with M near to the TeV scale (0.17 TeV for the top quark), the discrepancy in the estimated \Lambda is much the same as in the naive approach. For a more detailed discussion of this ‘cosmological constant problem’ see e.g.Weinberg (2000a) or Abel et al. (2002). Many attempts have been made to move beyond the idea of \Lambda representing a simple vacuum density, and to hypothesise some more general ‘dark energy’ contributing to an effective \Lambda that may vary with time. Ratra & Peebles (1988) proposed that a dynamical scalar field could cause the accelerating expansion of the universe. While the scalar field proposed by Ratra & Peebles (1988) was not motivated by fundamental physics, later models tried to connect it to extensions of the standard model of particle physics. In practice, the kinetic or potential terms of the Lagrangian of the scalar field depend on some fundamental mass scale (e.g. Zlatev et al., 1999; Armendariz-Picon et al., 2001). An alternative view is that the cosmic acceleration in fact shows the need for some modified theory of gravity (see e.g. Joyce et al., 2016). Other approaches include mechanisms that prevent vacuum energy from gravitating (Kaloper & Padilla, 2014). However, all these models effectively move the problem of the value of the \Lambda to the fine-tuning of some other parameter of the theory, such as the mass scale associated with the scalar field (see e.g. Amendola & Tsujikawa, 2010). There is also a more radical position asserting that the debate on the physical nature of the cosmological constant is moot, and that \Lambda is simply a fundamental constant emerging within the theory of General Relativity (Bianchi & Rovelli, 2010). Regardless of the physical interpretation of the cosmological constant, the oddly small non-null value of \Lambda gives rise to a number of coincidences that cry out for an explanation. Perhaps the most well-known of these is that the universe became \Lambda-dominated at z\approx 0.39, near to the formation time of the Sun. We therefore appear to live near the unique era when \Lambda transitions from being negligible to dominating the universe: this is the ‘why-now problem’ (Velten et al., 2014). A further time coincidence is that recombination occurred at the same time of baryon-radiation equality. In addition, Lombriser & Smer-Barreto (2017) pointed out that the equality between \Lambda and radiation occurs around the midpoint of cosmic reionisation. All these timescale puzzles are in principle distinct from the cosmological constant problem described earlier (but see also the discussion in Lombriser, 2023). A possible explanation for the ‘why now’ problem was suggested by Weinberg (1987). He noted that if the cosmological constant had been much larger than observed, the accelerating expansion of the universe would have set in at earlier times, freezing out the growth of structure before galaxy-scale haloes had been able to form. Thus the star formation in galaxies that is necessary for the creation of observers would not occur if \Lambda was substantially larger than the observed value. Such an argument is an example of anthropic reasoning (Carter, 1974), which effectively considers the existence of observers (such as ourselves) as a ‘data point’ and explores the implications for the cosmological parameters conditional on this information. To make this Bayesian argument (probability of \Lambda given that it is observed), we need there to be some physical mechanism that allows \Lambda to vary. It is also common to invoke a multiverse: an ensemble of different universes. The probability calculus is the same whether or not the members of the ensemble actually exist, or merely have the potential to do so. But the idea of a concrete multiverse underlying Weinberg’s argument was given stronger motivation by the theory of inflation. Here, a multiverse of causally disconnected ‘bubble universes’ arises in models of stochastic inflation where inflation proceeds eternally (Vilenkin, 1983; Linde, 1986; Guth, 2007; Freivogel, 2011). All causally disconnected bubbles evolve as independent universes, each characterised by a different set of constants, including \Lambda. The advantage of this picture is that for a sufficiently large ensemble there are guaranteed to exist universes suitable for the formation of structure. Thus, that would explain the existence of our universe, no matter how atypical it is within the ensemble. Anthropic arguments often encounter significant resistance, with many physicists arguing that efforts should be focused on finding solutions to cosmological puzzles from first principles (e.g. Kane et al., 2002). And of course such efforts should always be pursued. But we can note that anthropic approaches pervade other fields of astronomy, without generating controversy. A prime example is the concept of circumstellar ‘habitable zone’, which is defined based on the conditions that can sustain life on a planet (see e.g. Kasting et al., 1993). Of course, unlike with exoplanets, there is only one universe that can actually be observed (although see Aguirre & Kozaczuk, 2013; Wainwright et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2016). As such, anthropic arguments cannot be tested in the Galilean sense ingrained in the scientific method. But they can still be tested, since we can in principle predict the probability distribution of observed values of cosmological parameters over the ensemble. This prediction can be compared with the single ‘data point’ of our universe, and a sufficiently large deviation from the average serves to rule out the model on which the prediction was based. After the initial formulation given by Weinberg (1987), investigations of the anthropic approach became progressively more refined. Weinberg (1989) extended his argument by noting that observer selection does not require \Lambda to be exactly zero, and thus a small non-zero (in principle even negative) value of \Lambda would be anthropically predicted. A critical element of this argument is the idea that the prior distribution of \Lambda should be flat because \Lambda=0 is not a special point, and therefore any continuous prior must be treatable as a constant in a narrow range near zero. Efstathiou (1995) revisited the argument by making more detailed estimates of the abundance of galaxies in universes with \Lambda\geq 0, subject to the constraint that the observed temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is equal to 2.73\,\rm K. He concluded that anthropic arguments may explain a value of \Lambda close to the one that is observed. Later works allowed for more than one cosmological parameter to vary. Garriga et al. (1999) considered simultaneous variations of \Lambda and the density contrast at the time of recombination. Peacock (2007) explored anthropic arguments treating both the CMB temperature and \Lambda as free parameters, and further allowing \Lambda to assume negative values. Bousso & Leichenauer (2010) also considered the variation of multiple cosmological parameters, as well as negative values of \Lambda. In their work, the generation of observers is tied to the global efficiency of star formation in the different members of the multiverse ensemble. The star formation history is predicted with a semi-analytic model, under the assumption that the astrophysics of star formation does not vary throughout the multiverse (Bousso & Leichenauer, 2009). Other semi-analytic work by Sudoh et al. (2017) showed that incorporating the astrophysics of galaxy formation in anthropic reasoning can affect the range of the anthropically favoured values of \Lambda by almost an order of magnitude. More recently, progress in numerical power has enabled the testing of anthropic reasoning with full hydrodynamical simulations, exploring the simulated past and future star formation history for a wide range of \Lambda (Barnes et al. 2018; Salcido et al. 2018; Oh et al. 2022). While such simulations include several astrophysical processes (albeit in an approximate parameterised form), it is hard to probe a wide parameter space, or to explore the far future of the universe (beyond \sim 100 Gyr cosmic time), without a massive commitment of computational resources. Analytic models of star formation therefore represent an attractive complementary approach, as they are not subject to the same limitations as hydrodynamical simulations. While inevitably simplified in terms of astrophysics, they are an efficient technique that can offer a more intuitive picture of the evolution of star formation (e.g. Rasera & Teyssier, 2006; Davé et al., 2012; Sharma & Theuns, 2019; Salcido et al., 2020; Fukugita & Kawasaki, 2022). Recently, Sorini & Peacock (2021) generalised the Hernquist & Springel (2003) model of cosmic star formation such that it can be applied to arbitrarily large times. In this work, we further adapt the Sorini & Peacock (2021) formalism to explore the impact of different values of \Lambda on past and future star formation. The main result of our study will be that values of \Lambda in the range 0.01\lesssim\Lambda/\Lambda_{\rm obs}\lesssim\Lambda_{\rm obs} maximise the global efficiency of star formation. However, the interesting question is how effectively star formation is truncated by large values of \Lambda. If this suppression is not effective until \Lambda is vastly beyond the observed value, then Weinberg’s flat prior will mean that the observed universe risks being an implausibly rare outlier. The main aim of this paper is to quantify just how unusual our universe is in this respect. This manuscript is organised as follows. In § 2 we give an overview of the formalism in Sorini & Peacock (2021), and improve it by introducing extra features. In § 3 we explain how we adapt it to \LambdaCDM models with arbitrary non-negative values of \Lambda and discuss the impact of changing the cosmological constant on the halo mass function and on the efficiency of star formation within haloes. In § 4 we present our predictions for the long-term efficiency of star formation for different values of \Lambda. In § 5 we discuss the implications of our results for anthropic reasoning. We mainly focus on the cosmological constant problem, but also marginally consider the why-now problem. We also compare our results with previous literature on the subject and discuss the limitations of our model. Finally, in § 6 we summarise the main conclusions of our work and discuss the future developments of our line of research. Throughout this work, unless otherwise indicated, units of distance are understood to be proper units. Co-moving units are designated with a ‘c’ prefix (e.g. ckpc, cMpc)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07287v1,"Type IIn Supernovae. I. 
Uniform Light Curve Characterization and a Bimodality in the Radiated Energy Distribution","We present the largest uniform study to date of Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn), focusing in this first paper on the multi-band optical light curves of 487 SNe IIn. The sample, constructed from multiple surveys, extends to z\approx 0.8, with the majority of events at z\lesssim 0.3. We construct uniform multi-band and bolometric light curves using Gaussian process regression, and determine key observed properties in the rest-frame (e.g., peak luminosity, timescales, radiated energy). We find that SNe IIn span broad ranges in peak luminosity (\sim 10^{42}-10^{44} erg s-1) and timescales (\sim 20-300 days above 50% of peak luminosity), but the sample divides into two clear groups in the luminosity-timescale phase-space around the median peak luminosity (\approx 10^{43} erg s-1): faint–fast and luminous–slow groups. This leads to a strong bimodality in the radiated energy distribution, with peaks at \sim 10^{49} and \sim 2\times 10^{50} erg, with the latter events having a characteristic timescale of \sim 100 days, and the former appearing to bifurcate into two branches with timescales of \sim 40 and \sim 70 days. Therefore, SNe IIn exhibit at least two dominant groupings, and perhaps three, which are likely reflective of different progenitor and/or circumstellar medium formation pathways. We do not find any obvious transition in SN IIn properties at the arbitrary cut-off of \approx-20 mag used for the designation “Type II Superluminous Supernovae”, and we argue that this classification should be abandoned. The absence of SNe IIn with timescales of \lesssim 14 days defines the region occupied by fast transients with evidence for interaction with hydrogen-poor circumstellar medium.","Among the hydrogen-rich, Type II, supernovae (SNe II), Type IIn SNe (SNe IIn) are classified based on the presence of “narrow” Balmer-series emission lines in their spectra (Schlegel, 1990; Filippenko, 1997). The main power source of SNe IIn is thought to be the shock interaction between the SN ejecta and pre-existing circumstellar medium (CSM; see Smith 2017a for a review), resulting in the most heterogeneous SN class in terms of observed properties (see Kiewe et al. 2012; Taddia et al. 2013; Nyholm et al. 2020 for small sample studies). The observed heterogeneity likely reflects the diversity in pre-explosion mass loss responsible for the CSM formation. However, the nature of the underlying SNe and their progenitors remains elusive, as their observational signatures are mostly hidden below the photosphere formed at the CSM interaction layer. It is therefore possible that a diversity of progenitor channels and explosion properties also contribute to the observed diversity. The direct progenitor identification of SN IIn 2005gl in a pre-explosion image pointed to a massive (>50\,M_{\odot}) luminous blue variable as a potential progenitor for that event (Gal-Yam et al., 2007; Gal-Yam & Leonard, 2009). Given the observed heterogeneous properties of SNe IIn, however, various other progenitor channels are also possible, including for example, super-asymptotic giant branch stars (\sim 8-10\,M_{\odot}; e.g., Kankare et al. 2012; Mauerhan et al. 2013; Smith 2013; Moriya et al. 2014; Hiramatsu et al. 2021), extreme red supergiants (\sim 17-25\,M_{\odot}; e.g., Fullerton et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2009; Moriya et al. 2011; Mauerhan & Smith 2012), interacting massive binaries (>20\,M_{\odot}; e.g., Chevalier 2012; Soker & Kashi 2013; Kashi et al. 2013; Schrøder et al. 2020; Metzger 2022; Hiramatsu et al. 2024), and even pulsational pair-instability SNe (\sim 110-140\,M_{\odot}; e.g., Woosley et al. 2007; Blinnikov 2010; Moriya et al. 2013a; Woosley 2017). In an effort to explore and map the diversity of progenitors, CSM, and explosion properties, here we present the first large-scale study of nearly 500 SNe IIn with well sampled light curves and confirmed spectroscopic classification. In this first paper, we focus on a uniform analysis of the optical light curve properties to extract observed features (e.g., peak luminosity, timescales, radiated energy) and study their distributions and correlations. Subsequent papers will present a similar population-level analysis in relation to numerical simulations; detailed analytical modeling of each SN to determine the explosion and CSM properties; a spectroscopic study of the CSM and CSM-SN shock interaction regions; and studies of the host galaxies and SN IIn locations within their hosts. This paper (Paper I) is structured as follows. In §2 we present our methods to construct an unprecedentedly large sample of SNe IIn. In §3 we present the data sources for light curve construction. In §4 we present a uniform Gaussian process regression method to create uniform rest-frame and time-sampled light curves, and describe the measurements extracted from these Gaussian-Process light curves. In §5 we analyze the light curve properties and explore various correlation between measured and/or calculated properties. We summarize our key findings and discuss their implications in §6 and conclude in §7."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07227v1,The emergence of the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation in the MHD wind scenario,"Context. There is still much uncertainty around the mechanism that rules the accretion of proto-planetary disks. In the last years, Magnetohydrondynamic (MHD) wind-driven accretion has been proposed as a valid alternative to the more conventional viscous accretion. In particular, winds have been shown to reproduce the observed correlation between the mass of the disk M_{D} and the mass accretion rate onto the central star \dot{M}_{*}, but this has been done only for specific conditions. It is not clear whether this implies fine tuning or if it is a general result.Aims. We investigate under which conditions the observed correlation between the mass of the disk M_{D} and the mass accretion rate onto the central star \dot{M}_{*} can be obtained.Methods. We present mainly analytical calculations, supported by Monte-Carlo simulations. We also perform a comparison with the observed data to test our predictions.Results. We find that, in the absence of a correlation between the initial mass M_{0} and the initial accretion timescale t_{\mathrm{acc,0}}, the slope of the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation depends on the value of the spread of the initial conditions of masses and lifetimes of disks. Then, we clarify the conditions under which a disk population can be fitted with a single power-law. Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for the spread of \log\bigl{(}M_{D}/\dot{M}_{*}\bigr{)} valid when the spread of t_{\mathrm{acc}} is taken to be constant. In the presence of a correlation between M_{0} and t_{\mathrm{acc,0}}, we derive an analytical expression for the slope of the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation in the initial conditions of disks and at late times. In this new scenario, we clarify under which conditions the disk population can be fitted by a single power-law, and we provide empirical constraints on the parameters ruling the evolution of disks in our models.Conclusions. We conclude that MHD winds can predict the observed values of the slope and the spread of the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation under a broad range of initial conditions. This is a fundamental expansion of previous works on the MHD paradigm, exploring the establishment of this fundamental correlation beyond specific initial conditions.","Proto-planetary disks are the birth environment of planets. In the last decades, significant progress has been made in the field of sub-mm radio-astronomy, in particular thanks to the development of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observatory. Thanks to a transformational improvement in the capabilities of the new generation of telescopes, we now know that disks are sub-structured, showing gaps, spirals, kinks, and many more features (e.g., Andrews 2020). In addition to high resolution observations, the study of disk demographics also advanced significantly. In the last years, it was possible to collect global disk properties such as sub-mm fluxes (e.g., Mann et al. 2014, Ansdell et al. 2016, Barenfeld et al. 2016, Pascucci et al. 2016, Ansdell et al. 2017, Cox et al. 2017, Eisner et al. 2018, Cazzoletti et al. 2019, Cieza et al. 2019, Ansdell 2020), disk radii (e.g., Barenfeld et al. 2017, Ansdell et al. 2018, Sanchis et al. 2021), and mass accretion rates onto the central stars (e.g., Manara et al. 2015, Manara et al. 2017, Alcalá et al. 2017, Manara et al. 2020). This astonishing amount of new data allowed to start investigating the statistical distributions of disk properties, which make it possible to constrain evolutionary models (e.g., Manara et al. 2023 for a review). However, despite all the progress that has been made, we are still far from a paradigm that can completely describe the formation and evolution of disks (e.g., Morbidelli & Raymond 2016). Understanding how proto-planetary disks accrete material onto the central star and evolve is of cardinal importance for getting a standard model of planet formation and evolution. Two main physical scenarios have been proposed to explain accretion onto the central star: ”viscous” accretion (e.g., Shakura & Sunyaev 1973, Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974), which redistributes the angular momentum within the disk (e.g., Pringle 1981, Frank et al. 2002), and ”Magnetohydrodynamic wind-driven” (MHD wind-driven) accretion, where a vertical magnetic field launches a wind that extracts angular momentum from the disk (e.g., Blandford & Payne 1982, Ferreira 1997, Lesur 2021). Despite all the work put in developing these paradigms, there is still significant uncertainty on which is the best candidate in describing the evolution of proto-planetary disks, as their key predictions (e.g., the different time evolution of disk radii) are difficult to observe on a statistically-significant sample of observations. In this context, observations have found a correlation between the mass of the proto-planetary disk and the mass accretion rate onto the central star (e.g., Manara et al. 2016; from now on, the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation). In the viscous paradigm, the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation naturally arises with a slope close to unity, in agreement with observations (e.g., Lodato et al. 2017, Rosotti et al. 2017); on the other hand, it is still not clear which conditions can produce it in the MHD scenario. In particular, it is uncertain whether it would be a general feature of wind-driven populations, or specific initial conditions would be needed. Recently, 1D disk evolution models have been proposed to describe the effect of MHD disk-winds on the long term evolution of disks (Suzuki et al. 2016, Bai 2016, Tabone et al. 2022a). In particular, Tabone et al. (2022a) developed analytical solutions of global disk quantities (i.e., the surface density, the characteristic disk radius, the mass of the disk, and the mass accretion rate) for the MHD wind-driven scenario, and offered some insights about retrieving the correlation. In Tabone et al. (2022b), they showed that for a particular set of initial parameters, the MHD model can reproduce the observed correlation in the Lupus region, the spread around this trend, and the decline of the disk fraction. In particular, they qualitatively show that a linear relationship can be obtained assuming no correlation between disk mass and accretion timescale t_{\mathrm{acc},0}. Starting from the solutions of Tabone et al. (2022a), in this work we conduct an extensive analysis to discuss the universality of this result and whether it implies fine tuning. The scope of the present work is to go beyond the work of Tabone et al. (2022a) to quantify under which initial conditions it is possible to reproduce the observed M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation. In Sect. 2, we show the condition under which it is possible to observe the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation under the assumption that the initial accretion timescale t_{\mathrm{acc},0}111From Tabone et al. (2022a): the initial accretion time-scale is a generalization of the viscous time scale and corresponds to the time that would be required to accrete a fluid particle located initially at r_{c}(t=0)/2 to the inner region of the disk with an accretion velocity equal to its initial value. is not correlated with M_{0}. After that, we analytically derive the slope of the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation and its spread as function of the spread of the disk age t and t_{\mathrm{acc},0}. In Sect. 3, we relax the assumption of no correlation between M_{0} and t_{\mathrm{acc},0}: we introduce a correlation in the form M_{0}\propto t_{\mathrm{acc},0}^{\phi}, and we analytically derive the slope of the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation in the initial lifetime conditions of the disks and at late times. Then, by adding a spread in M_{0}, we show that we can retrieve the observed value of the slope under a broad range of conditions. In Sect. 4, we show that the spread derived in Sect. 2 agrees with the observed spread of \log\bigl{(}M_{D}/\dot{M}_{*}\bigr{)}. Finally, we present and investigate the \phi-\sigma_{M_{0}} degeneracy. In Sect. 5 we summarize our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07145v1,Transient Upstream Mesoscale Structures: Drivers of Solar-Quiet Space Weather,"In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that space weather disturbances can be triggered by transient upstream mesoscale structures (TUMS), independently of the occurrence of large-scale solar wind (SW) structures, such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Different types of magnetospheric pulsations, transient perturbations of the geomagnetic field and auroral structures are often observed during times when SW monitors indicate quiet conditions, and have been found to be associated to TUMS. In this mini-review we describe the space weather phenomena that have been associated with four of the largest-scale and the most energetic TUMS, namely hot flow anomalies, foreshock bubbles, travelling foreshocks and foreshock compressional boundaries. The space weather phenomena associated with TUMS tend to be more localized and less intense compared to geomagnetic storms. However, the quiet time space weather may occur more often since, especially during solar minima, quiet SW periods prevail over the perturbed times.","For decades, space weather phenomena have been thought to be strictly related to solar activity. This is mainly due to the fact that the strongest magnetospheric and ionospheric disturbances, geomagnetic storms and substorms [e.g., 2], occur during the passage of large-scale structures (of the order of \gtrsim1 a.u.) in the solar wind (SW), such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections, stream interaction regions and interplanetary shocks [e.g., 28]. During such events, most extreme conditions conducive for space weather, such as large southward IMF, high speed solar wind, and large dynamic pressure (Pdyn) fluctuations, may be met. This in turn drives strong magnetopause motion and reconnectiom. Geomagnetic storms and substorms have been a subject of extensive research for a long time because they can interfere with our technologies by disrupting the proper functioning of, for example, electric grids, GPS signals, and artificial satellites [e.g., 15]. However, in recent years it has become clear that some space weather phenomena, such as bursts of large-amplitude magnetospheric ultra-low-frequency (ULF) pulsations, transient (nonperiodic) geomagnetic disturbances, auroras, etc. may occur in the absence of known space weather drivers [71]. Since their origin is not related to solar disturbances, we here refer to them as solar-quiet space weather. Such phenomena may be caused by transient upstream mesoscale structures (TUMS). These form in the region upstream of the bow-shock of Earth. The term mesoscale refers to their typical scale sizes ranging form \sim2000 km to more than 10 Earth radii (1 R_{\mathrm{E}}\sim 6400\,km) [71]. The sizes of the largest TUMS are thus comparable to but smaller than the transverse diameter of the dayside magnetosphere [\sim30 RE 63]. TUMS owe their existence to the collisionless bow-shock that stands in front of our planet. The bow-shock dissipates some of the SW kinetic energy by deflecting and energizing a small portion of the incident particles (electrons, ions). At its Qpar section, where the angle between the upstream IMF and the local shock normal is less than 45∘, reflected particles may escape back upstream to large distances where they coexist with the incoming SW. Such non-Maxwellian particle distributions lead to different instabilities, forming a highly perturbed foreshock region [16]. The formation mechanisms for TUMS fall into three categories: (1) the interaction of IMF directional discontinuities in the SW [6] with the bow-shock or (2) with the reflected foreshock ions and (3) due to internal foreshock processes. The main reason why TUMS have such an impact on the near-Earth environment is the variation in magnetic field orientation and strength and the SW Pdyn inside them which lead to modifications of the total (dynamic, thermal and magnetic) pressure impinging upon the magnetopause [e.g., 4]. As has been shown in the past, upstream negative and positive pressure pulses excite toroidal and poloidal mode waves in the Pc5 frequency range [69, 72]. Even modest positive pressure pulses may also lead to an increase in temperature anisotropy of energetic protons which in turn results in ion-cyclotron instability and consequently in Pc1 magnetospheric waves [42, 1]. Pdyn variations have also been found to generate field aligned currents [FACs, 3, 39] and intensify whistler mode waves [33, 55]. FACs can lead to electron precipitation and discrete auroras, while the intensified whistler mode waves can scatter electrons into loss cones and induce diffuse auroras. Finally, it should be mentioned that various types of TUMS have been observed at other planets, [e.g., 43, 36, 47, 64, 11, 9, 8, 10, 65, 53, 40, 37], although their impact on the corresponding downstream regions has not been studied due to the lack of multi-spacecraft observations. It is the purpose of this mini review to summarize the impact of the largest-scale TUMS on the near-Earth environment. In the following sections we describe such effects caused by hot flow anomalies (HFA, section 2), foreshock bubbles (FB, 3), foreshock compressional boundaries (FCB, 4), and travelling foreshocks (TF, 5). The HFAs and TFs fall into the first category in terms of their formation mechanisms, FBs fall into the second category, while the FCBs occur due to internal foreshock processes. In section 6 we summarize these effects while in section 7 we list some of the future tasks needed to be done in order to deepen our knowledge about the subject."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07073v1,"The impact of
disk-locking on convective turnover times of low-mass pre-main sequence
and main sequence stars","Aims. The impact of disk-locking on the stellar properties related to magnetic activity from the theoretical point of view is investigated.Methods. We use the ATON stellar evolution code to calculate theoretical values of convective turnover times (\tau_{\rm c}) and Rossby numbers (Ro, the ratio between rotation periods and \tau_{\rm c}) for pre-main sequence (pre-MS) and main sequence (MS) stars. We investigate how \tau_{\rm c} varies with the initial rotation period and with the disk lifetime, using angular momentum conserving models and models simulating the disk-locking mechanism. In the latter case, the angular velocity is kept constant, during a given locking time, to mimic the magnetic locking effects of a circumstellar disk.Results. The local convective turnover times generated with disk-locking models are shorter than those obtained with angular momentum conserving models. The differences are smaller in the early pre-MS, increase with stellar age and become more accentuated for stars with M \geq1\,{\rm M}_{\odot} and ages greater than 100 Myr. Our new values of \tau_{\rm c} were used to estimate Ro for a sample of stars selected from the literature in order to investigate the rotation-activity relationship. We fit the data with a two-part power-law function and find the best fitting parameters of this relation.Conclusions. The differences we found between both sets of models suggest that the star’s disk-locking phase properties affect its Rossby number and its position in the rotation-activity diagram. Our results indicate that the dynamo efficiency is lower for stars that had undergone longer disk-locking phases.","The convective turnover time is a typical timescale for convective motions of the stars’ conductive plasma, responsible for transportation of a fraction of the energy in some types of stars, like the low-mass ones. When different parts of a magnetic star rotate differentially, the interaction between convective motions and differential rotation produces the dynamo effect (as proposed by Parker,, 1955) that keeps and regenerates stellar magnetic fields. In solar type stars, such fields are thought to be created and amplified at the tachocline, a thin shear layer between the radiative core and the convective envelope, first defined by Spiegel & Zahn, (1992). This mechanism is supposed to drive stellar magnetic activity, expressed as a variety of observable phenomena like coronal heating, star spots, activity cycles, flares and chromospheric and coronal emissions. For solar-like stars, it is believed that stellar magnetism and rotation are regulated by a dynamo process called the \alpha-{\mathrm{\Omega}} dynamo (Mohanty & Basri,, 2003), in which the poloidal and toroidal field components sustain themselves through a cyclic feedback process (Nelson,, 2008). Nowadays, the connection between magnetic activity and rotation is well established, and Skumanich, (1972) was the first to suggest that the rotation-activity relation is a consequence of the dynamo action and showed that the stellar angular velocity, \mathrm{\Omega}, decreases with age as t^{-1/2}. The rotation-magnetic activity relation has been widely used to investigate stellar magnetism. It is expressed by the relation between the stellar rotation rate (the projected rotational velocity in the line of sight or the rotation period) and some indicator of magnetic activity, such as the unsigned average large-scale surface fields (\langle|B_{\rm V}|\rangle) or the fractional X-ray and H\alpha luminosities, also known as coronal (L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}) and chromospheric (L_{{\rm H}\alpha}/L_{\rm bol}) activity indicators, respectively. As shown by Noyes et al. , (1984), this relationship is better understood in terms of the Rossby number, Ro (the ratio between rotation period, P_{\rm rot}, and the local convective turnover time, \tau_{\rm c}), than in terms of P_{\rm rot}. Pizzolato et al. , (2003) showed for the first time that the rotation-magnetic activity relation was characterised by the existence of two distinct regions: the saturated region (formed by fast rotators - P_{\rm rot}\leq2 days) and the unsaturated region (composed by slow rotators - P_{\rm rot}>2 days). L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol} (or another magnetic activity indicator) increases as Ro decreases down to a saturation threshold value, Ro_{\rm sat}\sim0.1, and remains constant at a saturation level, (L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol})_{\rm sat}\sim10^{-3}, for Ro<Ro_{\rm sat} (Wright et al. ,, 2011, 2018). The causes of saturation are still unclear. This relation became a powerful tool to study stellar magnetism and is based on a general power-law function of the form L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}\propto Ro^{\beta}, where \beta is a parameter to be adjusted with observations. Values of \beta usually found in the literature are \beta\!=\!-2 (Pizzolato et al. ,, 2003), \beta\!=\!-2.7\!\pm\!0.13 (Wright et al. ,, 2011), \beta\!=\!-1.38\!\pm\!0.14 (Vidotto et al. ,, 2014), \beta\!=\!-2.3^{+0.4}_{-0.6} (Wright et al. ,, 2018), \beta\!=\!-1.40\!\pm\!0.10 (See et al. ,, 2019) and \beta\!=\!-2.4\!\pm\!0.1 (Landin et al. ,, 2023). Describing the rotation-magnetic activity relation in terms of the Rossby number makes clear its connection with the stellar dynamo theory, as the dynamo number (N_{\rm D}, the efficiency of the dynamo in the mean-field dynamo theory) is proportional to the inverse square of the Rossby number (N_{\rm D}\propto Ro^{-2}). Consequently, the dynamo efficiency increases as Ro decreases. As Ro plays an important role in the stellar magnetic activity studies, determinations of \tau_{\rm c} are of fundamental interest, since they cannot be directly measured. They can be obtained either semi-empirically (Noyes et al. , 1984, Pizzolato et al. , 2003) or theoretically by stellar evolution models (Kim & Demarque, 1996, Landin et al. , 2010). For a given stellar mass and age, the convective turnover time varies significantly with the radial location. The location mostly used in the literature to determine local convective turnover times is one half a mixing length above the base of the convective zone (Noyes et al. ,, 1984). This standard location coincides with the tachocline for partially convective stars, but it is not suitable for fully convective stars, in which there is no tachocline. In the Mixing Length Theory, the adjustable mixing length parameter, \ell, is scaled with the pressure scale height H_{\rm p} as \ell=\alpha H_{\rm p} (\alpha is the convection efficiency) and, during the fully convective phase, the modelled value of H_{\rm p} at the base of the convective zone is very high, and so is the mixing length. Consequently, the standard location where \tau_{\rm c} should be calculated becomes larger than the stellar radius for fully convective configurations (M\leq0.3 M⊙ at any evolutionary stage and M>0.3\,{\rm M}_{\odot} before developing the radiative core), making \tau_{\rm c} calculations unfeasible through this standard prescription. In order to overcome this problem, Landin et al. , (2023) developed a method to obtain the location (r) where to calculate \tau_{\rm c} in terms of H_{\rm P}, allowing the theoretical determination of \tau_{\rm c} of fully convective stars in a self consistent way with the traditional location prescribed by Noyes et al. , (1984). For 10 selected ages in the range of 6.0\leq\log(t/{\rm yr})\leq10.14, Landin et al. , (2023) analysed how the standard location r/H_{\rm P} varied with stellar mass for partially convective stars, linearly fitted r/H_{\rm P} as a function of the stellar mass and extrapolated it for fully convective stars. These linear fits of r/H_{\rm p} as a function of mass were introduced in the ATON stellar evolution code as alternative locations to the standard \tau_{\rm c} calculation whenever r is larger than the stellar radius. Otherwise, the standard location is adopted. Most, if not all, low-mass pre-main sequence (pre-MS) stars exhibit some manifestation of magnetic fields (Donati & Landstreet,, 2009). As they miss a tachocline in the beginning of their pre-MS phase, the \alpha-{\mathrm{\Omega}} dynamo, which is an interface dynamo, is not supposed to be operating in this very early evolutionary phase. So, the observed magnetic activity in these stars should be produced by another kind of dynamo process, like a distributed dynamo, as suggested by Durney et al. , (1993). The characteristic shape of the rotation-activity relation exhibited by main sequence (MS) stars is not observed for pre-MS stars (Flaccomio et al. ,, 2003). The latter are seen only in the saturated region and show a considerable dispersion in magnetic activity levels (Preibisch et al. ,, 2005). The fact that fully convective (pre-MS and MS) stars are preferably found in the saturated region, while solar-like (partially convective) stars are found in both regions, reinforces the idea that the dynamo operating in partially and fully convective stars are different. However, observations by Wright & Drake, (2016) and Wright et al. , (2018) indicate that partially and fully convective stars follow the same rotation-activity relation, implying that they should operate very similar rotation-dependent dynamos in which the tachocline would not be a crucial ingredient. Landin et al. , (2023) present a theoretical and observational review of stellar magnetic activity in pre-MS and MS stars. Low-mass stars in young clusters (ages\leq100 Myr) are known to be very active and to exhibit strong magnetic fields (specially those fast rotating), even though they do not follow the Skumanich law ({\mathrm{\Omega}}\propto t^{-2}, Alphenaar & van Leeuwen,, 1981). For a few million years, their magnetic field lines are supposed to be anchored in a circumstellar disk, formed during the star formation process, within a few stellar radii. The interaction between the stellar magnetic field and the disk regulates the star’s angular velocity, counteracting the tendency to spin up due to accretion of disk material of high specific angular momentum and to readjustments in the moment of inertia as the star contracts towards the MS. The magnetic torques acting on the central star during the disk lifetime transfer large amounts of its angular momentum to the disk and impose the star to rotate with a virtually constant surface angular velocity. The observed rotation rates of stars in clusters of different ages suggest that the fast rotation phenomenon depends on mass. According to several works, such as those of Stauffer et al. , (1997), Prosser et al. , (1995) and Stauffer & Hartmann, (1987), rapid rotation decreases slower for lower mass stars (the spin-down time scales expected for stars with M<0.5 {\rm M_{\odot}} are longer than those for stars with M>1.0 {\rm M_{\odot}}). Attridge & Herbst, (1992) and Choi & Herbst, (1996) showed that T Tauri stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster have a very characteristic rotation period distribution: Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS), which still accrete from a disk, have a narrow period distribution with a peak at about 8-10 days, while Weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTS), that no longer accrete from a disk, have a broader distribution showing only a tail of slow rotators. In addition, WTTS appear to rotate faster, on average, than CTTS (Henderson & Stassun,, 2012). Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC, 1 Myr), NGC 2264 (3.5 Myr), IC 348 (2.5 Myr) and NGC 2362 (3.3 Myr) are some of the most studied young stellar clusters and all of them exhibit bimodal and dichotomic rotation period distributions. The bimodality is related to the presence of two peaks in the period distribution and the dichotomy is associated to the mass dependence of the distribution. Detailed studies of the rotation history of these clusters can be found in the literature, for example: ONC was analysed by Herbst et al. , (2002), NGC 2264 was investigated by Lamm et al. , (2005), Cieza & Baliber, (2006) studied IC 348, Irwin et al. , (2008) examined NGC 2362, the rotational properties of ONC and NGC 2264 was reviewed by Landin et al. , (2016) and Landin et al. , (2021) inspected such properties of IC 348 and NGC 2362. As the distribution of rotation periods in the pre-MS must evolve towards that of the MS, we have to be able to describe the process that leads from the wide distribution seen in the pre-MS to the even wider one seen in the MS. However, there is not a single model that manages to do this. In order to reproduce the evolution of stars that reach the MS with the highest rotation rates (near their breakup velocities), one should consider an evolution conserving angular momentum during all the pre-MS phase. On the other hand, to yield the rotation of stars spinning with a small fraction of their breakup velocities, one should consider that these stars were locked to their disks for a given time, keeping their angular velocities constant, and only after the locking phase they were released to spin up conserving angular momentum. Landin et al. , (2016) present a theoretical and observational review of angular momentum evolution of pre-main sequence stars. In this work, we use the ATON stellar evolution code to investigate the influence of the disk-locking mechanism on local convective turnover times and, consequently, on the Rossby numbers, and in the rotation-magnetic activity relation itself. Observational data of rotation periods, fractional X-ray luminosities and unsigned average large-scale surface magnetic fields from Vidotto et al. , (2014) are used to constrain our models. In Section 2, we briefly describe the ATON code and the input parameters used in this work. Section 3 presents and discusses our results on convective turnover times and convective velocities obtained with disk-locking and angular momentum conserving models. Our new theoretical local convective turnover times are compared to those existing in the literature and observational data are used to test our theoretical results in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 presents our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06949v1,The Role of Thermal Instability in Accretion Outbursts in High-Mass Stars,"Context. High-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs) can exhibit episodic bursts of accretion, accompanied by intense outflows and luminosity variations. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving these phenomena is crucial for elucidating the early evolution of massive stars and their feedback on star formation processes.Aims. Thermal Instability (TI) due to Hydrogen ionisation is among the most promising mechanisms of episodic accretion in low mass (M_{*}\lesssim 1{\rm M_{\odot}}) protostars. Its role in HMYSOs has not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigate the properties of TI outbursts in young, massive (M_{*}\gtrsim 5 {\rm M_{\odot}}) stars, and compare them to those observed so far.Methods. We employ a 1D numerical model to simulate TI outbursts in HMYSO accretion disks. We vary key model parameters, such as stellar mass, mass accretion rate onto the disc, and disc viscosity, to assess TI outburst properties.Results. Our simulations show that modelled TI bursts can replicate the durations and peak accretion rates of long (a few years to decades) outbursts observed in HMYSOs with similar mass characteristics. However, they struggle with short-duration (less than a year) bursts with short (a few weeks or months) rise times, suggesting the need for alternative mechanisms. Moreover, while our models match the durations of longer bursts, they fail to reproduce the multiple outbursts seen in some HMYSOs, regardless of model parameters. We also emphasise the significance of not just evaluating model accretion rates and durations, but also performing photometric analysis to thoroughly evaluate the consistency between model predictions and observational data.Conclusions. Our findings suggest that some other plausible mechanisms, such as gravitational instabilities and disc fragmentation can be responsible for generating the observed outburst phenomena in HMYSOs and underscore the need for further investigation into alternative mechanisms driving short outbursts. However, the physics of TI is crucial in sculpting the inner disc physics in the early bright epoch of massive star formation, and comprehensive parameter space exploration and the use of 2D modeling are essential for obtaining a more detailed understanding of the underlying physical processes. By bridging theoretical predictions with observational constraints, this study contributes to advancing our knowledge of HMYSO accretion physics and the early evolution of massive stars.","Understanding the formation and evolution of high-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs), and their various accretion outbursts, requires a comprehensive study that includes observations, analytical models, and numerical simulations. HMYSOs hold crucial information on the formation process of massive stars, which play a key role in shaping the cosmic environment. While FU Orionis-type accretion outbursts are typically associated with low-mass young stellar objects (Hartmann & Kenyon, 1996), recent observations have suggested that HMYSOs may also experience similar episodic accretion events (Caratti o Garatti et al., 2017; Stecklum et al., 2021; Fischer et al., 2022). However, the mechanisms driving these outbursts in HMYSOs are likely different, given the distinct physical conditions in high-mass star formation. FU Orionis type accretion outbursts are a puzzling and fascinating phenomenon in astrophysics, primarily observed in low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs). These outbursts, lasting for several years or decades, involve an intense increase in the accretion rate onto a young star, leading to a brightening of several magnitudes. The prototype of this class of outbursts is FU Orionis itself, a low-mass star discovered more than 85 years ago (Herbig, 1977). Since then, many other examples of FUors have been identified, in different regions of our galaxy (Audard et al., 2014), providing evidence that these phenomena might be ubiquitous in low-mass star-forming environments. Later on, with the discovery of EXor bursts (Herbig, 1989), it was realized that episodic accretion is a much broader and varied phenomenon, that occurs at all stages of star formation. The outburst of V1647 Ori in 2004 showed that some objects do not fit into the traditional EXor and FUor categories, despite the broad range of properties these groups cover. Properties of several recently discovered outbursting objects are even more unusual, thus creating a zoo of outbursting objects with various properties (see Fischer et al., 2022, for the review). Despite several attempts to explain the physical processes driving these outbursts, the exact mechanism behind them remains unclear. Nevertheless, numerous theoretical scenarios have been proposed, ranging from gravitational instability (GI) in the disc around the young star (Vorobyov & Basu, 2010; Machida et al., 2011; Hosokawa et al., 2016; Meyer et al., 2017; Vorobyov & Elbakyan, 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Kuffmeier et al., 2018; Oliva & Kuiper, 2020), thermal instability (TI) (Bell & Lin, 1994; Kley & Lin, 1996), stellar flyby (Borchert et al., 2022; Cuello et al., 2023), interaction of a massive planet with the disc (Lodato & Clarke, 2004) or the presence of a ”dead zone” in the inner 0.1\leq r\leq a few AU disc with eventual development of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in that zone (Armitage et al., 2001; Zhu et al., 2009, 2010; Kadam et al., 2020; Vorobyov et al., 2020). One of the possible mechanisms responsible for the episodic accretion outbursts is the well-established phenomenon of disc thermal instability caused by the sudden increase in opacity when hydrogen ionizes at a temperature of \sim10^{4} K. The inner, thermally unstable region of the disc periodically switches between two (cold and hot) stable branches of the so-called S-curve (see Sect. 6 in Armitage, 2015), thus developing a strong accretion variability onto the star (e.g., Lodato & Clarke, 2004; Elbakyan et al., 2021). This phenomenon was originally studied as part of a model for dwarf novae (Hōshi, 1979; Meyer & Meyer-Hofmeister, 1981; Lin et al., 1985). This model, while proving to be a good fit to observations, requires not only a substantial change in opacity and distinct values of the \alpha-parameter for the cold and hot branches of the S-curve, but also that the disc midplane temperatures exceed \sim10^{4} K. Initial studies of accretion outbursts were focused mainly on a FU Orionis objects (FUors), which are low-mass stars exhibiting outbursts every few decades (Hartmann & Kenyon, 1996). However, with the advent of observational techniques and new instruments (such as ALMA, VLTI, VISTA), several groups have discovered multiple HMYSOs showing accretion outbursts (Caratti o Garatti et al., 2017; Hunter et al., 2018; Stecklum et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Wolf et al., 2024), which introduce some discrepancies among their observational properties compared to the FUors. These discrepancies could potentially help to fill in critical details of the underlying physical mechanisms at work, as well as refining theoretical predictions. While in low-mass YSOs we distinguish the two large categories as magnetospheric-accretion driven (EXors) and boundary layer accretion driven (FUors), in HMYSOs the situation is more complex, as in principle, magnetospheric accretion should not work (Beltrán & de Wit, 2016; Mendigutía, 2020). The outbursts so far observed in HMYSOs are rapid and short-lived events, that are manifested by a sudden increase in luminosity that may last for months to a few decades before returning to quiescence. Unfortunately, due to the low statistics for the outbursts in HMYSOs (less than 10 objects), it’s hard to determine their recurrent rate like it is done for FUors (\sim 1.75 kyr; Contreras Peña et al. (2024)). It is worth to note that bursts similar to the one in FU Orionis system have not yet been detected in HMYSOs (all bursts observed so far have relatively short durations and low amplitudes compared to FU Ori bursts). However, the lack of detections is likely due to an observational bias (and the relative low number of such events), and we should keep an open mind and ask ourselves if FUor events are possible in HMYSOs. While the observed sample is still too small to judge whether these short bursts represent a common and unique feature or are just caused by an observational bias, we can still draw some conclusions. The short durations of the bursts correspond to the dynamical and viscous timescales at the (sub-)AU radial distances, meaning that only the region of the disc close to the star is involved in the burst triggering. However, the multidimensional numerical simulation of (sub-)AU radial distances in a disc is usually too computationally costly and a so-called “sink cell” approach is used to simulate the inner region of the disc (Meyer et al., 2017; Oliva & Kuiper, 2020) or these small-scale structures are hidden within a Gaussian accretion kernel around sink particles (Krumholz et al., 2004; Mignon-Risse et al., 2020; Commerçon et al., 2022). This approach does not allow simulating properly the hydrodynamical evolution of the inner disc, which is crucial for the understanding of accretion outbursts. The most practical way to overcome this ”computational barrier” is the usage of one dimensional (1D) numerical models of circumstellar discs. In our current study, we aim to advance our understanding of accretion outbursts in HMYSOs by investigating the main characteristics of the phenomenon and its fundamental effects on forming massive stars and their surrounding discs. This is done by studying the evolution of circumstellar discs around HMYSOs, which are prone to TI in the inner disc. In Sec. 2, we detail the numerical methodology employed in this study. We discuss the implementation of classic thermal instability (TI) bursts in Sec. 3, where we explore the fundamental characteristics of these bursts under varying model parameters. In Sec. 4, we extend our analysis to investigate TI bursts for different sets of model parameters, systematically examining their impact on the observed burst behaviour of HMYSOs. Following this, in Sec. 5, we compare our simulation results with observational data. In Sec. 6, we delve into the phenomenon of thermal instability bursts with higher frequency. The discussion section (Sec. 7) covers comparisons with observational data, possible burst mechanisms, and the importance of parameter space exploration. We conclude with our main findings and suggestions for future research in Sec. 8."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06884v1,X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity,"Context. Mass loss through a stellar wind is an important physical process that steers the evolution of massive stars and controls the properties of their end-of-life products, such as the supernova type and the mass of compact remnants. To probe its role in stellar evolution over cosmic time, mass loss needs to be studied as function of metallicity. For mass loss to be accurately quantified, the wind structure needs to be established jointly with the characteristics of small-scale inhomogeneities in the outflow, which are known as wind clumping. Aims. We aim to improve empirical estimates of mass loss and wind clumping for hot main-sequence massive stars, study the dependence of both properties on the metal content, and compare the theoretical predictions of mass loss as a function of metallicity to our findings.Methods. Using the model atmosphere code Fastwind and the genetic algorithm fitting method Kiwi-GA, we analyzed the optical and ultraviolet spectra of 13 O-type giant to supergiant stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy, which has a metallicity of approximately one-fifth of that of the Sun. We quantified the stellar global outflow properties, such as the mass-loss rate and terminal wind velocity, and the wind clumping properties. To probe the role of metallicity, our findings were compared to studies of Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud samples that were analyzed with similar methods, including the description of clumping.Results. We find significant variations in the wind clumping properties of the target stars, with clumping starting at flow velocities 0.01-0.23 of the terminal wind velocity and reaching clumping factors f_{\rm cl}=2-30. In the luminosity (\log L/L_{\odot}=5.0-6.0) and metallicity (Z/Z_{\odot}=0.2-1) range we considered, we find that the scaling of the mass loss \dot{M} with metallicity Z varies with luminosity. At \log L/L_{\odot}=5.75, we find \dot{M}\propto Z^{m} with m=1.02\pm 0.30, in agreement with pioneering work in the field within the uncertainties. For lower luminosities, however, we obtain a significantly steeper scaling of m>2.Conclusions. The monotonically decreasing m(L) behavior adds a complexity to the functional description of the mass-loss rate of hot massive stars. Although the trend is present in the predictions, it is much weaker than we found here. However, the luminosity range for which m is significantly larger than previously assumed (at \log L/L_{\odot}\lesssim 5.4) is still poorly explored, and more studies are needed to thoroughly map the empirical behavior, in particular, at Galactic metallicity.","Feedback from massive stars plays an important role in the thermal and dynamical evolution of the interstellar medium and galaxy halos (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2011, 2018; Andersson et al. 2020). It is provided through jets, (ionizing) radiation, powerful stellar outflows, and, when their cores ultimately collapse, through supernovae (e.g., Kuiper & Hosokawa 2018; Dale & Bonnell 2011; Luisi et al. 2016; Geen et al. 2020; Efstathiou 2000; McLeod et al. 2019). The mass and angular momentum that are lost through their stellar outflows (processes that persist throughout their lives) strongly influence the evolution of massive stars (e.g., Puls et al. 2008; Langer 2012; Renzo et al. 2017; Vink 2022). At Galactic metallicities, mass loss causes the mass at the end of carbon burning to be 25 to 40% of the initial mass for stars that started their lives with 20 M_{\odot} or more (Ekström et al. 2012). The cumulative mass loss experienced by a massive star throughout its evolution is found to be a function of the initial stellar metal content (see below). Metal-poor hot luminous stars have weaker winds, as has been shown empirically for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, e.g., Brands et al. 2022), the Small Magellanic Clould (SMC, e.g., Ramachandran et al. 2019), and for sub-SMC (e.g., Garcia et al. 2014; Bouret et al. 2015). One consequence of this is that properties of core-collapse supernovae are expected and are found to differ for galaxies with low and high metal content. Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (e.g., Modjaz et al. 2008; Heger et al. 2003; Savaglio et al. 2009), superluminous supernovae (e.g., Chen et al. 2017), and pair-instability supernovae (e.g., Young et al. 2010), for instance, favor lower-metallicity environments. It also implies that the first stars to form in the Universe (e.g., Hirano et al. 2015; Hosokawa et al. 2016) must have lost relatively little mass (e.g., Kudritzki 2002), with important consequences for their end-of-life products (e.g., Marigo et al. 2003). An accurate understanding of the mass loss from massive stars is therefore very important, including its dependence on the metal content. On the theory side, the hot-phase driving mechanism has been identified to be radiation pressure on the metal lines of mostly CNO and iron-group elements that are clustered in the ultraviolet, where the stars emit the bulk of their radiation (e.g., Lucy & Solomon 1970; Castor et al. 1975; Abbott & Lucy 1985; Pauldrach et al. 1986; Puls et al. 1996). Combined stellar atmosphere and hydrodynamical methods that take into account several 10^{5} of these lines have been developed to make quantitative predictions (de Koter et al. 1997; Vink et al. 2001; Sander et al. 2017; Krtička & Kubát 2018; Björklund et al. 2021; Gormaz-Matamala et al. 2022a). The behavior of mass loss versus metallicity was probed by studies of the solar metallicity and of the LMC (Z=0.5\,Z_{\odot}), and SMC (Z=0.2\,Z_{\odot}) metallicities. When they were based on relatively high-luminosity sources (\log L/L_{\odot}\gtrsim 5.4), where wind signatures in H\alpha and He ii 4686 are clearly visible, the studies inferred a luminosity-independent behavior \dot{M}\propto Z^{0.5-0.8} (Mokiem et al. 2007; Marcolino et al. 2022). To constrain the mass-loss properties for lower-luminosity stars, the spectral analysis relies strongly on the ultraviolet spectral range, where UV resonance lines such as C iv 1548,1550 Å provide more sensitive probes of the wind strength. Marcolino et al. (2022) used a compilation of UV and optical studies to first address this parameter space and tentatively found a weaker or even vanishing dependence on Z: \dot{M}\propto Z^{0.1} at \log L/L_{\odot}=4.5. They stressed that their findings should be tested with larger samples that include more accurate determinations of the terminal wind velocity. The combination of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) (Roman-Duval et al. 2020) and Very Large Telescope (VLT) X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) (Vink et al. 2023) programs provides high-quality spectra of OB stars in the Magellanic Clouds with an extensive wavelength coverage from the UV to the optical. We analyze a sample of O4 to O9.5 dwarfs, giants, bright giants, and supergiants in the SMC from these programs. The spectra allow us to constrain the photospheric conditions and a range of wind properties, including inhomogeneities in the outflow and the terminal velocity. To gain insight into the metallicity dependence of our findings, we compare them with similar studies of Galactic (Hawcroft et al. 2021) and LMC stars (Hawcroft et al. 2024a, Brands et al. in prep.). A major challenge in the empirical determination of mass-loss rates is the inhomogeneity in the wind, which is also referred to as clumping. These clumps are overdense regions that are surrounded by lower density material. Clumps affect the strength of spectral lines both directly and indirectly. They affect the lines directly in the case of recombination lines, such as H\alpha and He ii 4686, the strength of which depends on the mean of the square of the density of the medium; and they affect them indirectly in the case of lines that trace ionic species whose ionization balance shifted significantly because the different density. Scattering lines of abundant ionic species, such as C iv 1550 Å, may be unaffected by clumping depending on the stellar temperature, however. Because of these different effects, clumping has been suggested and used as solution for the discrepancies between inferred mass-loss rate from different diagnostic lines (e.g. Bouret et al. 2003; Fullerton et al. 2006). Whether wind clumping itself is a function of metallicity and/or luminosity has been little explored so far. If this is the case, it may affect the derived mass-loss properties and should thus be accounted for when the empirical \dot{M}(Z) or \dot{M}(L,Z) relations are derived. This challenging problem is a goal of this study as well. So far, Driessen et al. (2022) reported a weak relation between the metallicity and the clumping factor in 2D line-deshadowing instability simulations. Parsons et al. (2024) reported a similar trend for structures that appeared in single-epoch observations of wind lines in the UV spectra of B supergiants. This paper is organized as follows. We describe the data and the sample in Section 2, along with the data preparation and normalization process. The model and fitting routine are presented in Section 3. Section 4 shows and describes the best-fit line profiles and the corresponding stellar and wind parameters. In Section 5, we briefly discuss the evolutionary stage of the sample stars and present the implications for \dot{M}(L,Z), and the wind structure parameters. Finally, Section 6 lists the main conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06831v1,Post-common-envelope planetary nebulae,"Close-binary central stars of planetary nebulae offer a unique tool with which to study the critical and yet poorly understood common-envelope phase of binary stellar evolution. Furthermore, as the nebula itself is thought to comprise the ionised remnant of the ejected common envelope, such planetary nebulae can be used to directly probe the mass, morphology and dynamics of the ejecta. In this review, I summarise our current understanding of the importance of binarity in the formation of planetary nebulae as well as what they may be able to tell us about the common-envelope phase – including the possible relationships with other post-common-envelope phenomena like stellar mergers, novae and type Ia supernovae.","It is now almost half a century since Paczynski (1976) first proposed the common-envelope (CE) scenario as the most viable pathway towards the formation of close binaries with an evolved component. Since then, the evidence for the importance of the CE has only grown, however key aspects of the processes at work remain enigmatic (Ivanova et al., 2013). At the time, Paczynski (1976) already recognised the importance of planetary nebulae (PNe) in understanding the CE phase, stating “Observational discovery of a short period binary being a nucleus of a planetary nebula would provide very important support for the evolutionary scenario”, and the first example was discovered that same year by Bond (1976). Subsequent studies of post-CE planetary nebulae (PNe) have already taught us much about the CE and they continue to represent a key tool with which to shed light on this critical phase of binary evolution (Jones, 2020). From the perspective of the PN community, the principal interest in CE evolution is the ease with which it can explain the wide range of aspherical morphologies observed in PNe (Balick & Frank, 2002; García-Segura et al., 2018; De Marco et al., 2022). However, until recently, there was a reluctance to accept that binarity was the primary shaping mechanism in PNe due to the lack of known binary central stars. In the early 2000s, only 16 post-CE PNe were known (a couple of which have since been shown to be wide binaries, false associations or non-PNe) leading to the estimate that roughly 10% of PNe hosted close binary stars (Bond, 2000). Exploitation of wide-field surveys, like OGLE, Kepler and TESS, has since led to an explosion of new discoveries (Miszalski et al., 2009; Jacoby et al., 2021; Aller et al., 2024), taking the total now to over 100 known post-CE central stars111A regularly updated list is maintained by the author at http://drdjones.net/bCSPN.. These studies have placed a hard lower limit on the binary fraction of 20%, while other probes (such as radial velocities, composite spectra and infrared excesses) have provided much higher estimates (perhaps as high as 80%; De Marco et al., 2004; Douchin et al., 2015). The minimum 20% post-CE fraction already has one critical implication for our understanding of PNe – it is likely that some stars which our textbooks would say should produce an observable PN, in fact, do not. Simply put, based on the main sequence binary fraction and period distribution, one would not expect as many as 20% of all low- and intermediate-mass stars to experience a CE phase, let alone survive one without merging. Clearly, with such a large uncertainty on the true post-CE binary fraction in PNe (20–80%), it is similarly uncertain just how large the discrepancy between the main sequence and PN phase really is. However, there are indications that it may indeed be significant. Population synthesis studies have found that perhaps around one fifth of expected PN progenitors due not lead to observable PNe (potentially consistent with only binaries leading to PNe; Moe & De Marco, 2006), while as many as 50% of central stars exhibit properties that are inconsistent with single-star evolutionary tracks (Weidmann et al., 2020). As a result of conservation of angular momentum during the ejection, the CE is always expected to be preferentially deposited in the orbital plane of the binary thus leading to nebular symmetry axes which lay perpendicular to this plane. While only nine PNe have been the subject of sufficiently detailed study to constrain both their nebular inclinations and central binary orbital inclinations, the correlation is striking and entirely consistent with the CE shaping each and every one. Indeed, the probability of finding such an alignment in these PNe by chance has been shown to be less than one in a million (Munday et al., 2020). Nonetheless, there is significant morphological diversity, even among this sample, meaning that, while the CE has clearly played a role in their shaping, the exact processes at work may vary appreciably between (Hillwig et al., 2016). Thus, it now seems beyond doubt that CE evolution is a critical aspect of PN formation and evolution, even though the precise details of this are still the subject of active research (Jones & Boffin, 2017; Boffin & Jones, 2019). But, perhaps of greater interest for the wider astronomical community, we are now in a position to use post-CE PNe to try and understand the CE phase itself. The nebular material in these PNe is thought to comprise the ejected CE, offering a unique opportunity to study the ejecta directly (CE ejecta can also be observed in luminous red novae, but these represent “failed” CE events, where the stars merged before fully ejecting the donor’s envelope). Furthermore, the short-lived nature of PNe (\tau\sim30 kyr) means that post-CE central stars of PNe have not yet had time to adjust following the CE ejection. As such, post-CE PNe are an invaluable tool with which to study the CE phase leading to potentially interesting conclusions for a wide-range of other post-CE phenomena."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06803v1,CZ Aqr: an oscillating eclipsing Algol-type system composed of a \delta Sct primary star and a subgiant star in a quadruple system,"Eclipsing Algol-type systems containing a \delta Scuti (hereafter \delta Sct) star enable precise determination of physical parameters and the investigation of stellar internal structure and evolution. We present the absolute parameters of CZ Aquarius (hereafter CZ Aqr) based on TESS data. CZ Aqr has an orbital period of 0.86275209 d, a mass ratio of 0.489 (6), and the secondary component nearly fills its Roche lobe. O-C analysis reveals a downward parabolic trend and a cyclical variation with a period of 88.2 yr. The downward parabola suggests a long-term decrease in the orbital period with \dot{P} = -3.09\times10^{-8} d \textrm{yr}^{-1}. The mass loss rate is estimated to be 4.54\times10^{-9} M⊙ \textrm{yr}^{-1}, which possibly due to magnetic stellar wind or hot spot. The cyclical variation might be caused by the light travel time effect via the presence of a third body with a minimum mass of M_{3min} = 0.312 (21) M⊙. Additionally, there are two possible celestial bodies in a 2:7 resonance orbit around CZ Aqr. The asymmetric light curve is explained by adding a hot spot on the surface of the primary star. After removing the binary model, 26 frequencies were extracted from TESS data. Two radial modes were newly identified among three possible independent frequencies. Our results show that the eclipsing Algol-type system is composed of a \delta Sct primary star and a subgiant star in a quadruple system.","Eclipsing binary stars are particularly reliable for the determination of stellar physical parameters. The presence of pulsating stars within these systems offers a valuable opportunity to employ binary analysis techniques in the study of variable stars. Approximately 70\% of stars in the universe are members of binary or multiple star systems (Mason et al., 2009; Sana & Evans, 2011). Eclipsing Algol-type systems with a \delta Sct component have been characterized as oscillating eclipsing Algol-type (oEA) systems (Mkrtichian et al., 2004). The primary component of the oEA system is typically an A-F type main sequence (MS) star, while the secondary component is a giant or subgiant star that is filling, or nearly filling, its Roche lobe. The Algol-type system can undergo rapid mass transfer from a more massive star to another, resulting in a reversal of the mass ratio and the previously more massive component becoming the less massive component (Pustylnik, 1998; Kahraman Aliçavuş et al., 2017). In the mass-transferring binary system, the pulsating primary star can serve as compelling evidence of binary interaction, facilitating further exploration into the structure and evolution of stars (Chen et al., 2020). When a pulsating variable star is part of an eclipsing binary system, critical parameters (e.g., mass, radius, luminosity) of the pulsating component can be derived from the system’s eclipsing characteristics. The \delta Sct-type star lies at the intersection of the instability strip (IS) of classical Cepheids and the MS band in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram. They are either in the central hydrogen-burning phase of the MS or have just left the MS, with spectral types A-F, a mass range of 1.5 to 2.5 M⊙, a pulsating period range of 0.02-0.3 d, and a surface effective temperature range of 6900 to 8900 K (Bowman, 2017). Typically, they can exhibit radial and non-radial p-mode oscillations in the stellar envelope due to pressure variations, and g-mode oscillations in the stellar interior due to gravity variations (Aerts et al., 2010; Bowman & Kurtz, 2018). The interaction of g and p mode characteristics occurs via a succession of avoided crossings, which facilitate the interaction between the modes (Osaki, 1975). Mixed modes are commonly detected in stars that have evolved off the main sequence and are undergoing hydrogen shell burning, primarily due to the substantial density gradient exterior to the core, which couples the g-mode and p-mode pulsation cavities (Aerts et al., 2010). Chen et al. (2022) discovered 123 new \delta Sct-type stars in eclipsing binaries based on Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data. With the release of TESS’s massive data, more and more candidates are expected to be identified for further study. The majority of the binary members-\delta Sct stars commonly lie within the MS band and approach the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) boundary, suggesting that their inherent instabilities emerge at earlier stages of their evolution compared to solitary stars (Liakos et al., 2012). The intricate pulsational characteristics and evolutionary progression of \delta Sct-type stars make them a powerful tool for investigating stellar evolution. The light travel time effect (LTTE) is a common phenomenon when a close-in third body orbits a central eclipsing binary, causing the binary to orbit around the barycenter of the triple system. The arrival times of the eclipses should change cyclically as the binary periodically approaches or moves away from the observer (Zhu et al., 2013). These additional objects may promote the formation of binaries by acquiring or absorbing angular momentum (Liao et al., 2022). Therefore, it is important to investigate these physical phenomena. In recent years, the launches of the TESS and the Kepler Space Telescope have provided a wealth of continuous and high-precision data to investigate whether LTTE is also commonly present in oEA systems. CZ Aquarius (CZ Aqr) was identified as a short-period Algol-type eclipsing binary in the southern sky with an A5-type primary star, which exhibit a long-term increase in the orbital period as revealed by O-C analysis (Bruton, 1986). Liakos et al. (2012) identified a potential third body through O-C analysis and demonstrated that it was an oscillating eclipsing Algol-type binary with a principal pulsation frequency of 35.5 \textrm{d}^{-1}. He also determined its absolute parameters through photometric analysis. In an eclipsing Algol-type system, when the secondary component fills or overflows its Roche lobe, mass is transferred to the primary component, and the orbital period typically either increases or remains constant (Kopal, 1955). In this paper, we combined TESS light curves with eclipsing times from the literature to analyze the orbital period variation and the pulsational properties of CZ Aqr. Additionally, the absolute parameters of the binary were calculated."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06683v1,Pulsations in binary stars – a short review,"Asteroseismology has become an indispensable method for measuring stellar ages and radii, while binary systems remain the most prevalent tool for determining stellar masses. The synergy of the two, namely pulsating stars in binary systems, offer even more than the sum of their parts. The sometimes-overwhelming number of pulsation models to be examined for asteroseismic modelling can be tightly constrained when dynamical masses for both components are available. Binaries offer twice the opportunity to measure an asteroseismic age, which is then applicable to both components of a system, often providing ages for stars that are otherwise very difficult to determine. Some stellar physics, such as the strength of internal mixing or of core overshoot, is so difficult to infer that only in binary systems do sufficient constraints exist to advance our asteroseismic models. The pulsations themselves can also be used to infer dynamical masses through pulsation timing, while eclipsing binaries provide opportunities to test asteroseismic scaling relations. In these proceedings of an invited talk I selectively review the synergies afforded by pulsations in binaries, consisting of a variety of main-sequence primary spectral types, to inferences made from the oscillations of red giants, even when their companions are undetectable. I also describe how the field is changing as we become more data rich through each generation of large photometric survey.","Most stellar properties exhibit great variation across spectral types. Temperature and mass are obvious examples, but rotation rates and binary fraction are important yet often under-appreciated additions. Along the main sequence alone, rotation periods range from under 1 d for some B and A stars, to over 30 d for late-type dwarfs (Reinhold & Hekker, 2020). Meanwhile, the binary fraction drops by a factor of 10–15 from B primaries to M primaries (Moe & Di Stefano, 2017; Offner et al., 2023)111Strongly dependent on orbital period.. The implications of these two effects are substantial when one considers that the majority of new binary stars were being found spectroscopically until recently (Halbwachs et al., 2023; Holl et al., 2023). The rotational broadening of spectral lines makes identification of binaries much harder for many reasons. When lines are very broad, it can become challenging to distinguish all but the strongest lines from the continuum. It is therefore almost impossible to tell when you are dealing with lines from two stars (a double-lined spectroscopic binary, or ‘SB2’), rather than from one. Further, if those spectral lines can be detected for even one of the stars, measuring their centres is also challenging (cf. Rucinski 1999), so it is not trivial to detect any variations in radial velocity (as a single-lined spectroscopic binary, or ‘SB1’). To further complicate matters, stars of B and A spectral types often pulsate (Kurtz, 2022; Hey & Aerts, 2024; Murphy et al., 2024), with typical pulsation velocities exceeding 1 km s-1 (Kjeldsen & Bedding, 1995). Those pulsations can induce radial velocity shifts and also spectral line profile variations (e.g. Rieutord et al. 2023; Pollard et al. 2024), further obfuscating any spectroscopic signature of a binary companion. Clearly, a complete survey of binarity amongst these stars will require non-spectroscopic techniques. The present era has seen a photometric revolution with the launch of space-based missions such as CoRoT, Kepler and TESS, as well as ground-based surveys such as ASAS and KELT. Although motivated by the search for transiting planets, these missions have detected eclipsing binaries (EBs) with ease and in large numbers. The observing strategy is also perfect for asteroseismology – the study of stellar pulsations (see Bowman & Bugnet 2024 for an introductory review). It is no surprise, then, that the all-sky observing strategy of TESS has picked up countless pulsating stars in EBs (Southworth & Bowman, 2022; Kahraman Aliçavuş et al., 2022, 2023; Eze & Handler, 2024). These will be discussed later in this review. The long and almost uninterrupted time-series from Kepler and to some extent from TESS have also facilitated the detection of many pulsation timing binaries (Murphy et al., 2018; Dholakia et al., 2024), which will also be covered in this review. The prospects for discovering more pulsators in binaries look good for both methods, with the continued operation of TESS and with the upcoming Roman Space Telescope (Huber et al., 2023), PLATO mission (Aerts & Tkachenko, 2024), and Earth 2.0 (ET) telescope (Ge et al., 2022). A similar short review on pulsating stars in binary systems was written as a conference proceedings in 2018 (Murphy, 2018). The intention is for the present review to be synergistic with the earlier one and to provide updates in the field since then. For instance, the 2018 review covered compact pulsators in detail, and while TESS observations of compact pulsators have been published (e.g. Bognár et al. 2020; Baran et al. 2023), rather few reports have appeared of binaries amongst them (cf. Lee et al. 2022). Compact objects therefore do not feature in this review (they were not part of the talk upon which this review is based, either). Early-type pulsators in EBs, on the other hand, have had a TESS renaissance, and so receive substantial coverage here. A particularly significant development since 2018 has been the discovery of tidally trapped pulsations (Handler et al., 2020; Fuller et al., 2020), which are also extensively reviewed. Nonetheless, there is naturally some overlap with the earlier review, particularly pertaining to pulsation timing but also to solar-like oscillators in binaries, which were cornerstones of the review talks then and now. This review is laid out as follows. A few exemplary asteroseismic analyses of main-sequence solar-like oscillators in binaries are presented in Sec. 2, and their post-main-sequence counterparts are reviewed in Sec. 3. A comprehensive update on pulsation timing over the past six years is provided in Sec. 4 along with a look at future prospects of this technique. Sec. 5 explores the newly described class of tidally trapped pulsations, where the effect of tides on the pulsations can be so great that the tidal axis becomes the pulsation axis. Finally, Sec. 6 describes the surge of discoveries of early-type pulsators in eclipsing binaries, and lessons that can be learned from such studies."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06647v2,Multiplicity of Galactic Cepheids from long-baseline interferometry V. High-accuracy orbital parallax and mass of SU Cygni,"Aims. We aim at accurately measuring the dynamical mass and distance of Cepheids by combining radial velocity measurements with interferometric observations. Cepheid mass measurements are particularly necessary to help solving the Cepheid mass discrepancy, while independent distance determinations provide crucial test of the period-luminosity relation and Gaia parallaxes.Methods. We used the multi-telescope interferometric combiners Michigan InfraRed Combiner (MIRC) of the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array to detect and measure the astrometric positions of the high-contrast companion orbiting the Galactic Cepheid SU Cygni. We also present new radial velocity measurements from ultraviolet spectra taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. The combination of interferometric astrometry with optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy provided the full orbital elements of the system, in addition to component masses and the distance to the Cepheid system.Results. We measured the mass of the Cepheid, M_{A}=4.859\pm 0.058\,M_{\odot}, and its two companions, M_{Ba}=3.595\pm 0.033\,M_{\odot} and M_{Bb}=1.546\pm 0.009\,M_{\odot}. This is the most accurate existing measurement of the mass of a Galactic Cepheid (1.2 %). Comparing with stellar evolution models, we show that the mass predicted by the tracks is higher than the measured mass of the Cepheid, similar to conclusions of our previous work. We also measured the distance to the system to be 926.3\pm 5.0 pc, i.e. an unprecedented parallax precision of 6\,\muas (0.5 %), being the most precise and accurate distance for a Cepheid. Such precision is similar to what is expected by Gaia for the last data release (DR5 in \sim 2030) for single stars fainter than G=13, but is not guaranteed for stars as bright as SU Cyg.Conclusions. We demonstrated that evolutionary models remain inadequate in accurately reproducing the measured mass, often predicting higher masses for the expected metallicity, even when factors such as rotation or convective core overshooting are taken into account. Our precise distance measurement allowed us to compare prediction from some period-luminosity relations. We found a disagreement of 0.2-0.5 mag with relations calibrated from photometry, while relations calibrated from direct distance measurement are in better agreement","One of the most discussed topics in astrophysics today is the tension between the Hubble constant H_{0} determined for the present universe based on Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae and that from the early universe based on Planck satellite Cosmic Microwave Background observations (see e.g. Freedman 2021). Extensive efforts are being made to reduce uncertainties involved, since the discrepancy hints at possible new physics. For Cepheids (the foundation of the local determination), the Leavitt (Period-Luminosity) Law needs to be calibrated to the highest accuracy and we need to understand the physics of Cepheid pulsation and evolution as thoroughly as possible. A crucial test of our understanding is the luminosity at the Cepheid stage for a given stellar mass. Evolutionary tracks are beginning to incorporate new insights about rotation in stellar interiors from astroseismology in phases leading up to the Cepheid stage. Thus Cepheid masses of the highest accuracy coupled with very accurate luminosities (partly through Gaia among other approaches) are a stringent test of forefront stellar modelling, and an important underpinning of objects used in deriving H_{0}. It has been known since the first hydrodynamic modelling of Cepheid pulsation in the 1960’s that masses inferred from pulsation and evolutionary calculations differed. This difference has now been reduced to \leq 20 %. The most cited scenarios to explain this discrepancy are a mass-loss mechanism during the Cepheid’s evolution, convective core overshooting, and rotation during the main-sequence stage (Anderson et al. 2014; Neilson et al. 2011; Keller 2008; Bono et al. 2006), but none agrees with the measured dynamical mass (Evans et al. 2024b, 2018a). This discrepancy points to an uncomfortable lack in our understanding of objects important in the H_{0} tension. While calibration of Cepheid luminosities will be significantly improved in the final Gaia release, masses can only be directly measured in binary systems, and hence only a limited number are available. We currently have two capabilities available which have made it possible to directly measure masses for several non-eclipsing Cepheids. High resolution spectra in the ultraviolet (UV) allow the orbital velocity amplitude of hot companions of Cepheids to be measured. Combining this with the orbital amplitude of the Cepheid from the ground-based orbit provides the mass ratio. In addition, interferometry has resolved a number of systems, providing the semi-major axis (a_{1}+a_{2}) and the inclination. V1334~Cyg is a system for which complete observational data are available: an interferometric orbit and a mass ratio from the orbital velocity amplitudes for the Cepheid and the companion (Gallenne et al. 2018). For this combination both the masses of the stars and a distance can be determined, resulting in the most accurate mass and distance to a Galactic Cepheid (M_{A}=4.29\pm 0.13\,M_{\odot},d=720.4\pm 7.8 pc). This paper is part of a series discussing binary or multiple systems containing Cepheids, and what can be inferred about Cepheid masses from them. SU~Cyg = HD 186688 = HR 7518 is a V=6.44 mag Cepheid star with a period of 3.85 d. It has a asymmetric light curve and a large pulsation amplitude, consistent with pulsation in the fundamental mode. Orbital motion in the system containing the Cepheid SU Cyg was found by Hellerich (1919). An orbit was first determined by Evans (1988). Ground-based velocities of the Cepheid were then combined with velocities of the companion from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) satellite by Evans & Bolton (1990). The companion was found to be itself a short-period binary. This produced a dynamical lower limit to the mass of the Cepheid of 5.9\pm 0.4\,M_{\odot}. The stars in the system are thus A (the Cepheid), Ba (the hottest star) and Bb. Inspection of a low resolution International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectrum showed that the star B has a strong Ga II feature at 1400Å, indicative of a chemically peculiar HgMn star (Evans 1995). This is consistent with a rotation rate slowed to synchronize with the orbital period of 4.67 d. This was further discussed by Wahlgren & Evans (1998). In this paper we revisit the SU Cyg system using new UV spectra from the Hubble space telescope and new interferometric observations with the goal of measuring accurate dynamical masses and distance. We present the observations and the data reduction process in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 we detailed the data analysis to extract radial velocities and astrometric motion, which we then used for a global orbital fit in Sect. 4. We then discussed our results in Sect. 5 and conclude in Sect. 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06330v1,"Simulating Solar Neighborhood Brown Dwarfs I:
The Luminosity Function Above and Below the Galactic Plane","Brown dwarfs form the key, yet poorly understood, link between stellar and planetary astrophysics. These objects offer unique tests of Galactic structure, but observational limitations have inhibited the large-scale analysis of these objects to date. Major upcoming sky surveys will reveal unprecedented numbers of brown dwarfs, among even greater numbers of stellar objects, enabling the statistical study of brown dwarfs. To extract the comparatively rare brown dwarfs from these massive datasets, we must understand how they will look in upcoming surveys. In this work, we construct a synthetic population of brown dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood to explore their evolutionary properties using Gaia-derived star formation histories alongside observational mass, metallicity, and age relationships. We apply the cloudless Sonora Bobcat, hybrid SM08, and gravity-dependent hybrid Sonora Diamondback evolutionary models to the sample. We present the simulated luminosity function and its evolution with distance from the Galactic Plane. Our simulation shows that brown dwarf population statistics are a function of height above/below the Galactic Plane and sample different age distributions. Interpreting the local sample requires combining evolutionary models, the initial mass function, the star formation history, and kinematic heating. Our models are a guide to how well height-dependent samples can test these scenarios. Sub-populations of brown dwarfs farther from the Plane are older and occupy a different region of brown dwarf parameter space than younger sub-populations closer to the Galactic Plane. Therefore, fully exploring population statistics both near and far from the Plane is critical to prepare for upcoming surveys.","The study of brown dwarfs, sub-stellar objects that lack the ability to fuse hydrogen, has been driven by large-scale digital sky surveys for the past 30 years. Originally theorized in 1962 (Kumar, 1962), brown dwarfs have been discovered through dedicated surveys with large facilities such as 2MASS (Kirkpatrick et al., 1999; Gizis et al., 2000), PAN-STARRS1 (Deacon et al., 2014; Best et al., 2018), WISE (Cushing et al., 2011; Kirkpatrick et al., 2011), DENIS (Delfosse et al., 1997), SDSS (Leggett et al., 2000), and UKIRT West et al. (2004), but also as foreground contaminants in extragalactic surveys (Hainline et al., 2024; Tee et al., 2023). We are entering an exciting time for brown dwarf science as the next generation of observation facilities become a reality and start to come online. Observatories such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Euclid, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope promise to drastically increase the discovery rate for brown dwarfs and propel the field forward. Brown dwarfs are cold, sub-stellar objects that extend beyond the main sequence through spectral types L (Martín et al., 1999; Kirkpatrick et al., 1999), T (Burgasser et al., 2002; Geballe et al., 2002), and Y (Delorme et al., 2008; Cushing et al., 2011). These objects have effective temperatures below \sim2400, 1300, and 600 K, respectively. As such, these objects are faint in wavelengths shorter than 1 \mum and present a challenge to observe. Furthermore, since brown dwarfs are not massive enough to fuse hydrogen in their cores, they perpetually cool and grow dimmer, only increasing the difficulty of their observation. Brown dwarfs are excellent probes for tracing Galactic evolution and structure (Burgasser, 2009). Their kinematics have been used to study their population distributions as well as mapping out the structure of the Milky Way’s thin disk (Faherty et al., 2009; Kirkpatrick et al., 2024). Furthermore, distant M-, L-, and T-type dwarfs can help measure thin disk structure and constrain the thick disk and halo scale heights (Aganze et al., 2022). Therefore, the ability to detect more distant brown dwarfs and understand their formation mechanisms with current and future surveys will play a key role in mapping the Milky Way and advancing such science cases. Accurately modeling the atmospheres of brown dwarfs is a complicated affair. While their interiors are well known to be fully convective, their atmospheres are complex, filled with molecular features and weather that depend on temperature and pressure evolution (Burrows et al., 2006). The warmer L-dwarfs are covered by cloudy atmospheres, but the observation of these clouds is inclination-dependent (Suárez et al., 2023). As brown dwarfs cool through the L-sequence and into the T-sequence, the clouds sediment and “rain out” minerals and metals leading to clear, cloudless atmospheres (Burrows et al., 2006). These T-dwarfs are further characterized by strong molecular features and the emergence of methane bands in their spectra. Finally, the coolest Y-dwarfs spectral energy peaks at \sim5 \mum and show large spectral absorption features from molecules like water, methane, ammonia, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide (Cushing et al., 2011). It appears increasingly likely that late-T and Y dwarf spectra can be described by a second parameter other than temperature, such as metallicity or surface gravity (Beiler et al., 2023). These diverse spectral types are not distinct classifications without overlap, but rather form an evolutionary sequence brown dwarfs undergo as they age and cool. The cooling mechanisms of brown dwarfs are an area of active research for future surveys. In order to prepare for next-generation surveys that will reveal these dim populations of brown dwarfs and enable the statistical analysis of their characteristics, we must understand their underlying distribution within the Galaxy. We turn to simulating the Solar Neighborhood population of brown dwarfs to predict the characteristics of brown dwarfs that future surveys will see. Previously, the creation of synthetic populations required assuming a birth-rate, star formation rate, and an underlying exponential distribution with height above the Galactic Plane (Ryan et al., 2022). We present a novel approach using recent Gaia results in conjunction with recent observational relations to build synthetic populations of brown dwarfs. This paper presents our simulation of Solar Neighborhood brown dwarfs. In Section 2 we build the synthetic population of brown dwarfs. We present the results of the simulation as parameter functions in Section 3. The implications of the results are discussed and compared to recent studies in Section 4. Our conclusions and future work are summarized in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06283v1,Magnetic interaction of stellar coronal mass ejections with close-in exoplanets: implication on planetary mass loss and Ly-\alpha transits,"Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) erupting from the host star are expected to have effects on the atmospheric erosion processes of the orbiting planets. For planets with a magnetosphere, the embedded magnetic field in the CMEs is thought to be the most important parameter to affect planetary mass loss. In this work, we investigate the effect of different magnetic field structures of stellar CMEs on the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter with a dipolar magnetosphere. We use a time-dependent 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) atmospheric escape model that self-consistently models the outflow from hot Jupiters magnetosphere and its interaction with stellar CMEs. For our study, we consider three configurations of magnetic field embedded in stellar CMEs – (a) northward B_{z} component, (b) southward B_{z} component, and (c) radial component. We find that both the CMEs with northward B_{z} component and southward B_{z} component increase the planetary mass-loss rate when the CME arrives from the stellar side, with the mass-loss rate remaining higher for the CME with northward B_{z} component until it arrives at the opposite side. The largest magnetopause is found for the CME with a southward B_{z} component when the dipole and the CME magnetic field have the same direction. We also find that during the passage of a CME, the planetary magnetosphere goes through three distinct changes - (1) compressed magnetosphere, (2) enlarged magnetosphere, and (3) relaxed magnetosphere for all three considered CME configurations. We compute synthetic Ly-\alpha transits at different times during the passage of the CMEs. The synthetic Ly-\alpha transit absorption generally increases when the CME is in interaction with the planet for all three magnetic configurations. The maximum Ly-\alpha absorption is found for the radial CME case when the magnetosphere is the most compressed.","Atmospheric escape from exoplanets is well observed in several discovered exoplanets, especially in the close-in exoplanets such as hot Jupiters and warm Neptunes (e.g., Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Lecavelier Des Etangs et al., 2010; Ehrenreich et al., 2015; Lavie et al., 2017). The upper atmosphere of these planets gets photoionized due to the intense radiation from their host stars leading to an escaping planetary outflow (e.g., Tian et al., 2005; Murray-Clay et al., 2009; Allan & Vidotto, 2019; Hazra et al., 2020). Continuous depletion of atmospheric material due to atmospheric escape over a long time is crucial for the sustainability and evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres (e.g., Kubyshkina et al., 2020). Also, atmospheric losses are important to understand the plausible cause of the existence of the Neptunian desert (e.g., Mazeh et al., 2016) and the radius valley (e.g., Fulton et al., 2017) in the present exoplanet demographic. A strong atmospheric mass-loss rate could even lead to the total loss of atmosphere(e.g., Lammer et al., 2007; Khodachenko et al., 2007). Therefore, for understanding the long-term evolution of the atmosphere, a more precise understanding of atmospheric escape and the corresponding mass-loss rate is necessary. Stellar radiation plays the key role in driving the planetary outflow from close-in exoplanets and once this radiation-driven planetary outflow starts to expand, it interacts with the stellar environment i.e., with the stellar wind, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and stellar magnetic field. Presently there are some numerical efforts to understand mass loss due to the interaction of planetary outflow with stellar outflow using 3D hydrodynamic simulations (Bisikalo et al., 2013; Villarreal D’Angelo et al., 2014, 2021; Tripathi et al., 2015; Carroll-Nellenback et al., 2017; McCann et al., 2019; Carolan et al., 2020; Hazra et al., 2022; MacLeod & Oklopčić, 2022). However, limited studies are using 3D MHD simulations to understand these aspects. The stellar and planetary magnetic fields play a key role (Khodachenko et al., 2015; Matsakos et al., 2015; Erkaev et al., 2017; Arakcheev et al., 2017; Daley-Yates & Stevens, 2018, 2019; Zhilkin et al., 2020) in the interaction between the outflowing planetary material with stellar outflow. On one hand, the planetary magnetic field can suppress the atmospheric escape and change the morphology of planetary outflow depending on the structure of the planetary magnetosphere and its strength (Trammell et al., 2014; Villarreal D’Angelo et al., 2018; Carolan et al., 2021b; Khodachenko et al., 2021; Ben-Jaffel et al., 2022). On the other hand, the stellar magnetic field reconnects with the planetary magnetic field and enhances the chance of planetary materials to leave the influence of planetary magnetosphere (Lanza, 2013; Owen & Adams, 2014; Egan et al., 2019; Ramstad & Barabash, 2021). The interplay between the stellar magnetic field and planetary magnetic field needs to be taken into account for a better understanding of the atmospheric escape from exoplanets (e.g., Carolan et al., 2021b). Stellar transient activities (e.g., flares, CMEs) are also very important in affecting exoplanetary atmospheres. There are several studies on the effect of solar flares and CMEs on the atmospheres of solar system planets (e.g., Ma et al., 2004; Manchester et al., 2004; Möstl et al., 2015; Falayi et al., 2018). A few theoretical studies also investigated the effect of flares and CMEs on the exoplanetary atmosphere, reporting that these stellar transients affect exoplanetary atmospheres greatly by changing the mass-loss rate (Kay et al., 2016; Chadney et al., 2017; Bisikalo et al., 2018; Cherenkov et al., 2017; Hazra et al., 2020; Hazra et al., 2022). A stellar flare enhances total X-ray and ultraviolet radiation received by the planet, potentially changing the atmospheric chemistry and ionization in the atmospheres of planets, which leads to more atmospheric escape (Hazra et al., 2020; Louca et al., 2022) than when the star is in its quiescent phase. Stellar CMEs enhance the stellar wind conditions, increasing the particle density and velocity of stellar wind as well as its embedded magnetic field, and hence, when a CME interacts with the planetary atmosphere, the planetary atmosphere gets disturbed significantly (Cherenkov et al., 2017; Hazra et al., 2022). Recently, Hazra et al. (2022) studied the effect of CMEs on the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HD189733b and found that CMEs are very effective in stripping the planetary atmospheric material, increasing mass-loss rate and enhancing the transit signature in the Ly-\alpha line. Similar observational enhancement of transit depth from visit to visit in Ly-\alpha and helium lines is also reported due to the interaction of CME (strong stellar wind case) with the planetary atmosphere (Rumenskikh et al., 2022). However, Odert et al. (2020) modeled the interaction of CME with the planetary atmosphere for the same system (HD189733b) without any significant difference in the Ly-\alpha transit. Cherenkov et al. (2017) also studied the effect of CMEs on hot Jupiters using a time-dependent simulation and reported an enhancement in the atmospheric mass-loss rate. Most of the previous studies used hydrodynamical (HD) simulation to capture the effect of CMEs on the exoplanetary atmospheres. However, close-in gas giants (e.g., hot Jupiter and warm Neptunes) possibly have magnetic fields (Cauley et al., 2019) and, because CMEs are highly magnetized plasma ejections from host stars, it is very important to consider the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) interaction between a CME and planetary magnetosphere. In this paper, we investigate the effects of different magnetic field configurations embedded in CMEs and on the atmospheric escape from a hot Jupiter. We assume a dipolar planetary magnetosphere and vary the orientation of the embedded magnetic field in CMEs to understand how different CME magnetic structures will affect the planetary magnetosphere and corresponding mass-loss rate. We also predict the transit absorption in the Ly-\alpha line during the passage of the different CMEs over the planetary atmosphere. The structure of the paper is as follows. In the next Section, we discuss our 3D radiative MHD model and present the result of the quiescent case scenario where only the stellar wind is interacting with the planetary magnetosphere. In Section 3, we explain different orientations of the magnetic field in CMEs and discuss their interaction with the planetary magnetosphere. The mass-loss rate for each considered case is also computed in this section. The synthetic Ly-\alpha transit calculations and plausible observation of these predicted transit spectra are presented in Section 4. Finally, we conclude our findings in Section 5"
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06705v1,Detection and Characterisation of Giant Planets with  Astrometry,"Astrometric observations with Gaia are expected to play a valuable role in future exoplanet surveys. With current data from Gaia’s third data release (DR3), we are sensitive to periods from less than 1 year to more than 4 years but, unlike radial velocity are not as restricted by the orbital inclination of a potential planet. The presence and potential properties of a companion affect the primary’s renormalised unit weight error (RUWE) making this a valuable quantity in the search for exoplanets. Using this value and the fitted astrometric tracks from Gaia, we use Bayesian inference to constrain the mass and orbital parameters of companions in known systems. Combining this with radial velocity measurements, we show it is possible to independently measure mass and inclination and suggest HD 66141 b is a possible brown dwarf with maximum mass 23.9{}^{+7.2}_{-6.4} MJ. We show how this method may be applied to directly imaged planets in the future, using \beta-Pictoris c as an example but note that the host star is bright and active, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions. We show how the next Gaia data release, which will include epoch astrometry, will allow us to accurately constrain orbital parameters from astrometric data alone, revolutionising future searches for exoplanets. Combining predicted observational limits on planet mass with theoretical distributions, we estimate the probability that a star with a given RUWE will host a detectable planet, which will be highly valuable in planning future surveys.","The majority of exoplanets have been discovered by indirect methods such as transit and radial velocity (Charbonneau et al., 1999; Mayor & Queloz, 1995). Recent advances in high-contrast imaging have allowed direct detection of young giant planets (Marois et al., 2008). Each method comes with its own challenges and limitations: while transit is limited to short periods, direct imaging is confined to outer planets on long periods. Radial velocity can detect planets on periods longer than the transit method but is only able to provide a lower limit on a planet’s mass, and is unable to determine orbital inclination (Latham et al., 1989). Astrometry is a technique for measuring precise stellar positions and can also be applied to searches for exoplanets. With enough precision, it is possible to observe the change in the on-sky position of a star due to the gravitational pull of an unseen companion. Launched in 1989, the Hipparcos spacecraft was the first mission dedicated to precision astrometry to produce a 3-D model of the local stellar neighbourhood (Perryman, 2010). Combined with radial velocity measurements, its astrometric observations were also able to constrain parameters of known exoplanets discovered through radial velocity (Zucker & Mazeh, 2001). Gaia, the successor to Hipparcos, released its third release (DR3) in 2022 (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2023) containing 34 months of astrometric observations with precision of the order 0.1 mas. Gaia’s prospects for the detection of exoplanets were recognised in the early stages of development (Bernstein & Bastian, 1995) and later expanded upon in Perryman et al. (2014). Most of the exoplanets detectable by astrometry have similar separations and periods as those detected through radial velocity. Gaia’s capabilities are limited for planets on wider orbits due to the long observation times required. However, recent studies have combined Gaia data with Hipparcos data from over 20 years earlier to look for discrepancies with the fitted astrometric tracks. These differing results can indicate the presence of a long period planet at different points along its orbit. There has been some success using this method to detect and characterise long-period planets (e.g. Carleo et al., 2024; Sozzetti et al., 2023) and has provided dynamical masses of planets previously detected through direct imaging (Snellen & Brown, 2018; Brandt et al., 2021). Astrometry has an advantage over radial velocity in that it is not as constrained by orbital inclination. Radial velocity is more sensitive to edge-on systems and is unable to detect face-on systems whereas astrometry is capable of detecting a system of any inclination. Additionally, unlike radial velocity, the astrometric signal increases with the semi-major axis of a planet which means, given enough of an observation window, astrometry is capable of detecting planets over a wider range of periods. This study uses data from Gaia’s DR3 to constrain masses and orbital parameters of planet candidates detected through other methods by simulating the expected astrometric signal and applying Bayesian inference. Since DR3 doesn’t contain individual epoch observations, this study relies on the renormalised unit weight error (RUWE) which is a measure of how poorly Gaia has fit the parallax and proper motion of the star. This error could be indicative of an unseen and unresolved companion (Belokurov et al., 2020). Previous studies have investigated Gaia’s sensitivity to a planet of given mass and period for a particular RUWE (e.g. Blanco-Pozo et al., 2023) and found DR3 astrometry alone is not sensitive enough to detect planets around sources with RUWE<1. This study focuses on sources with higher RUWE (>1.1) which are more likely to host detectable companions. The next sections show how the RUWE is calculated and presents the details of our analysis. Studies of systems detected by radial velocity and direct imaging are presented, placing better constraints on planet candidates. Finally, a study is presented showing how epoch data in DR4 (expected after 2025) will allow further detection and characterization of nearby exoplanets."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06351v1,A shock crashing into confined dense circumstellar matter brightens the nascent SN 2023ixf,"Red supergiants may experience a short-lived period of episodic mass loss rather than steady winds before their core collapses, leading to dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Interaction of SN ejecta with such nearby CSM can generate additional radiation, appending to the cooling radiation from the shock breakout of the progenitor envelope, to brighten the nascent SN explosion. This phenomenon is conspicuous for SN 2023ixf as its V-band brightness showed a rapid increase of about three magnitudes from the first to the third day after the explosion, which is distinctive among type II SNe with flash ionized signatures. In this paper, we employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate the radiative diffusion process in the unshocked CSM. Considering a wide range of mass-loss rates from 10^{-5} to 10^{-2} M⊙ yr-1, we found that the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf can be fitted by the interaction of the SN ejecta with a CSM having a mass-loss rate of about 10^{-2} M⊙ yr-1 located within 10^{15} cm to the progenitor.","When massive stars deplete their nuclear fuel, the collapse of the core creates an explosive event known as core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Several pre-explosion detections support the scenario that red supergiants (RSGs) are the progenitor of type II SNe with plateau-shaped light curves (e.g., Smartt 2009). Thanks to the wide-field optical survey programs and the fast-responding spectroscopically follow-up observations, a relatively large fraction of type II SNe were found to display short-lived narrow emission lines in their early-phase spectra (Gal-Yam et al., 2014; Khazov et al., 2016; Yaron et al., 2017; Hosseinzadeh et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020; Bruch et al., 2021; Tartaglia et al., 2021). These emission lines arise from the recombination of the highly ionized gas in the compact circumstellar matter (CSM) due to the emerging shock breakout (Kochanek, 2019). Apart from the cooling radiation of the shock breakout, the subsequent interaction between the ejecta and the nearby CSM could also generate additional radiation, resulting in an early-phase fast-rising light curve relating to a scenario of an RSG embedded in the dense confined CSM. SN 2023ixf, a type II SN exploded in Messier 101 (M101) (Itagaki, 2023) and was serendipitously captured by amateur astronomers; this provides a crucial chance for constraining the SN progenitor systems. The intra-night observations of SN 2023ixf over the first few days since the discovery delineate the early-phase evolution of its ionized flash signatures. The narrow emission lines from the recombination of the ionized gas rapidly decrease and mostly disappear a week later, suggesting the existence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to the progenitor star (Bostroem et al., 2023; Hiramatsu et al., 2023; Jacobson-Galán et al., 2023; Smith et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). Pre-explosion archival images from the HST and the Spitzer Space Telescope indicate that the progenitor of SN 2023ixf is an RSG with a dusty environment and it experienced eruptive or episodic mass loss shortly before the explosion (Dong et al., 2023; Jencson et al., 2023; Kilpatrick et al., 2023; Soraisam et al., 2023; Neustadt et al., 2024; Xiang et al., 2024). Therefore, SN 2023ixf is an excellent example to investigate the mass-loss history of massive stars before core collapse. M101 is an attractive target to amateur astronomers who monitor it frequently, leading to the first detection of SN 2023ixf about one day earlier than the discovery (Mao et al., 2023). These rare chromatic images recorded the radiation from the shock breakout of the RSG envelope and exhibited a color redder than the typical model predictions. Li et al. (2024) suggest that there is time-variant extinction due to the sublimation of circumstellar dust during the spherical phase of the shock breakout. On the other hand, shock cooling and the ejecta-CSM interaction contribute to the radiation a few days after the explosion, resulting in the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf (Li et al., 2024; Zimmerman et al., 2024). In this paper, we focus on the ejecta-CSM interaction process to fit the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf. Section 2 describes our Monte Carlo method to simulate the radiative diffusion process in the unshocked CSM, and Section 3 displays the results. The discussions and conclusions are given in Section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06157v1,The COBREX archival survey: improved constraints on the occurrence rate of wide-orbit substellar companions,"Context. Direct imaging (DI) campaigns are uniquely suited to probing the outer regions around young stars and looking for giant exoplanet and brown dwarf companions, hence providing key complementary information to radial velocity (RV) and transit searches for the purpose of demographic studies. However, the critical 5-20 au region, where most giant planets are thought to form, remains poorly explored, lying in-between RV and DI capabilities.Aims. Significant gains in detection performances can be attained at no instrumental cost by means of advanced post-processing techniques. In the context of the COBREX project, we have assembled the largest collection of archival DI observations to date in order to undertake a large and uniform re-analysis. In particular, this paper details the re-analysis of 400 stars from the GPIES survey operated at GPI@Gemini South.Methods. Following the pre-reduction of raw frames, GPI data cubes were processed by means of the PACO algorithm. Candidates were identified and vetted based on multi-epoch proper motion analysis – whenever possible – and by means of a suitable color-magnitude diagram. The conversion of detection limits into detectability maps allowed for an estimate of unbiased occurrence frequencies of giant planets and brown dwarfs.Results. Deeper detection limits were derived compared to the literature, with up to a twofold gain in minimum detectable mass compared to previous GPI-based publications. Although no new substellar companion was confirmed, we identified two interesting planet candidates awaiting follow-up observations. We derive an occurrence rate of 1.7_{-0.7}^{+0.9}\% for 5 M_{\textrm{Jup}} <m<13 M_{\textrm{Jup}} planets in 10\leavevmode\nobreak\ \text{au}<a<100\leavevmode\nobreak\ \text{au}, that raises to 2.2_{-0.8}^{+1.0}\% when including substellar objects up to 80 M_{\textrm{Jup}}. Our results are in line with the literature, but come with lower uncertainties thanks to the enhanced detection sensitivity. We confirm the finding, hinted at by previous studies, of a larger occurrence of giant planets around BA hosts compared to FGK stars; moreover, we tentatively observe a smaller occurrence of brown dwarf companions around BA stars, although larger samples are needed to shed light on this point.Conclusions. While waiting for the wealth of data expected from future instrument and facilities, valuable information can still be extracted from existing data. In this regard, a complete re-analysis of SPHERE and GPI data is expected to provide the most precise demographic constraints ever provided by imaging.","Bolstered by more than 5000 confirmed detections to date, the exoplanet field has become mature enough to accompany the still thriving detection-oriented endeavor with follow-up studies aimed at shedding light on key questions related to the origin, the prevalence, and the architecture of planetary systems. By unveiling statistical trends in the measured physical, orbital and star-related properties of the exoplanet population, exoplanet demographics seeks to connect theory and observation, in order to fully understanding the physical processes underlying planet formation (Biazzo et al. 2022). The census of known exoplanets currently spans about four magnitudes in mass and in semi-major axis111Empirically estimated based on the Extrasolar Planet Encyclopaedia: http://www.exoplanet.eu/.. No single detection method is adequate to probe such a large extent of the parameter space: it is through the combination of the different methods, each optimized for detection inside a specific niche, that the large-scale picture can be unveiled and reconstructed (see, e.g., Gratton et al. 2023, 2024). However, obtaining a complete and unbiased blend from heterogeneous ingredients is hindered by factors such as inconsistent detection criteria, completeness and false positive assessment, uncertainty quantification, neglect of underlying selection or observational biases (Gaudi et al. 2021). Whenever two different methods can be simultaneously employed, their complementarity allows better characterizing individual objects (see, e.g., Gandolfi et al. 2017; Bonnefoy et al. 2018; Bourrier et al. 2018; Lacedelli et al. 2021; Kuzuhara et al. 2022; Philipot et al. 2023, Lagrange et al. under review) and strengthening the statistical trends emerging in each of the methods (Rogers 2015; Santerne et al. 2016). In the cases where different techniques probe instead different separations within the same system, the joint analysis opens up exquisite dynamical and formation studies (see, e.g., Covino et al. 2013; Bryan et al. 2016; Zhu & Wu 2018). Radial velocity (RV) surveys have provided invaluable constraints on the physical and orbital properties of giant planets up to \sim 5 au (Wolthoff et al. 2022; Rosenthal et al. 2024). Yet, the reliability of RV trends for larger separations has been questioned (Lagrange et al. 2023), and the predicted yields for direct imaging (DI) surveys based on extrapolations of RV results have been shown to be too optimistic (see, e.g., Cumming et al. 2008; Dulz et al. 2020). On the other hand, direct imaging (DI) is mostly sensitive to young giant planets in wide (a\gtrsim 20 au) orbits, providing access to the scarcely studied outskirts of planetary systems. Starting from 2004 (Chauvin et al. 2004), direct imaging has discovered \sim 30 planets (M<13M_{\textrm{Jup}}) (Zurlo 2024), including iconic systems like the disk-enshrouded PDS 70 (Keppler et al. 2018), the \sim 20-Myr-old \beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2009), 51 Eridani (Macintosh et al. 2015), AF Leporis (Mesa et al. 2023; De Rosa et al. 2023; Franson et al. 2023), and the four-planet HR 8799 (Marois et al. 2008). These detections are the main outcome of large blind surveys targeting tens (e.g. MASSIVE, Lannier et al. 2016; SEEDS, Uyama et al. 2017; LEECH, Stone et al. 2018) or hundreds of stars (e.g. NICI-PCF, Liu et al. 2010; IDPS, Galicher et al. 2016; ISPY-NACO, Launhardt et al. 2020). The forefront of DI surveys, enabled by the exquisite performances of imagers and integral field spectrographs, coupled with extreme AO systems mounted on 8-m-class telescopes, is currently represented by the 400-star SHINE (Chauvin et al. 2017) and the 600-star GPIES (Nielsen et al. 2019) surveys. By constraining the overall frequency and the properties of wide-separation giant planets, DI studies are expected to enable a thorough comparison with concurrent formation models (see, e.g., Bowler 2016; Vigan et al. 2021); orbital properties, for instance, shed light upon their formation and dynamical evolution (Bowler et al. 2020); the dependence of frequency on stellar mass provides clues about the initial state of the disk and the formation mechanisms at play (Nielsen et al. 2019; Janson et al. 2021). However, despite years of extensive searches, it is still not clear whether the main formation channel for the observed wide-orbit population be core accretion (CA; Pollack et al. 1996; Mordasini et al. 2009), the bottom-up process responsible for the formation of planets in the Solar System, or rather a top-down star-like scenario like gravitational instability (GI; Boss 1997; Vorobyov 2013). While an interplay between the two scenarios is deemed to be favored by empirical parametric models (Reggiani et al. 2016; Vigan et al. 2021) and direct comparison with synthetic planet populations (Vigan et al. 2021) alike, understanding in an unambiguous way how each known companion was formed is still beyond reach. The large uncertainties still existing in the interpretation of the observed picture can be attributed, at least partially, to the fact that the critical 5-20 au region, where most giant planets are thought to form, remains poorly explored being exactly in-between current RV and DI capabilities. Under given observing conditions, the final performances attainable by a high-contrast imaging observation are dictated both by instrumental (e.g., the telescope, the science instrument, the performance of adaptive optics and coronagraphs) and post-processing components (the algorithms applied to science images to decrease the level of systematic and random noise) (Galicher & Mazoyer 2024). Depending on observing conditions, stellar brightness and angular separation, state-of-the-art instruments such as the Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research (SPHERE; Beuzit et al. 2019) and the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI; Macintosh et al. 2014) typically achieve raw planet-to-star contrasts as low as 10^{-3}-10^{-5} (Poyneer et al. 2016; Courtney-Barrer et al. 2023). On the instrumental side, 30-m-class telescopes and space-borne coronagraphic instruments are expected to bring about a major leap forward for the field in the next decade (see, e.g., Kasdin et al. 2020; Kasper et al. 2021), whereas upgrades of existing instruments such as SPHERE+ (Boccaletti et al. 2022) and GPI 2.0 (Chilcote et al. 2018) are going to represent the forefront in the medium term; on the reduction side, advanced post-processing algorithms have been already shown to increase the contrast by as much as two orders of magnitudes compared to pre-reduced data. Therefore, the developments of more powerful reduction techniques can greatly increase detection capabilities working on observations that already exist (see, e.g., Currie et al. 2023). In the framework of the COupling data and techniques for BReakthroughs in EXoplanetary systems exploration (COBREX) project, we collected more than a thousand archival SPHERE and GPI observations, assembling the largest exoplanetary direct imaging survey to date, with the aim of re-reducing them in a uniform and self-consistent way. The results of the full re-reduction of the SHINE survey are illustrated in Chomez et al. (2024). In this work, we present the re-reduction of 400 stars coming from GPIES. Despite being the largest DI observational campaign to date, just two new substellar objects were discovered during the survey: one planet (51 Eri b, Macintosh et al. 2015) and one brown dwarf (HR 2562 B, Konopacky et al. 2016). A statistical analysis of the first 300 stars was performed by Nielsen et al. (2019, hereafter N19). By combining the two surveys, it will be possible to obtain the tightest constraints to date on the occurrence of wide-orbit giant planets, hence providing an ideal test-bed to scrutinize planet formation models. This paper is organized as follows: after laying out the selection criteria for the sample and the corresponding observations (Section 2.2), and uniformly deriving the stellar parameters of interest (Section 2.3), we describe in detail the process of data reduction (Section 2.4). Section 3 presents the results of the analysis, namely companion candidates and completeness maps. The derived occurrence rates are presented and discussed in Section 3.4. A thorough comparison with the literature is the subject of Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize the results of this work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05917v1,"VLTI/GRAVITY Observations of AF Lep b: 
Preference for Circular Orbits, Cloudy Atmospheres, and a Moderately Enhanced Metallicity","Direct imaging observations are biased towards wide-separation, massive companions that have degenerate formation histories. Although the majority of exoplanets are expected to form via core accretion, most directly imaged exoplanets have not been convincingly demonstrated to follow this formation pathway. We obtained new interferometric observations of the directly imaged giant planet AF Lep b with the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument. We present three epochs of \sim 50\,\mu\mathrm{as} relative astrometry and the K-band spectrum of the planet for the first time at a resolution of R=500. Using only these measurements, spanning less than two months, and the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations, we are able to significantly constrain the planet’s orbit; this bodes well for interferometric observations of planets discovered by Gaia DR4. Including all available measurements of the planet, we infer an effectively circular orbit (e<0.02,0.07,0.13 at 1,2,3\,\sigma) in spin-orbit alignment with the host, and a measure a dynamical mass of M_{\mathrm{p}}=3.75\pm 0.5\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}. Models of the spectrum of the planet show that it is metal rich ([M/H]=0.75\pm 0.25), with a C/O ratio encompassing the solar value. This ensemble of results show that the planet is consistent with core accretion formation.","1.1 Tracing the formation of gas giants with direct observations Gas giants play a central role in shaping the formation and evolution of planetary systems in general, and our own Solar System in particular (e.g. Levison & Agnor, 2003; Raymond et al., 2014; Childs et al., 2019; Horner et al., 2020b). Once they have formed, giant planets dominate the subsequent production and dynamical evolution of dust, planetesimals, and inner terrestrial planets, likely dictating the volatile content of terrestrial planets (e.g. Raymond, 2008; Raymond et al., 2012; Raymond & Izidoro, 2017; Sotiriadis et al., 2018; Bitsch et al., 2020; Horner et al., 2020a). It has even been suggested recently that the presence of outer giant planets is correlated with inner terrestrial planets (Rosenthal et al., 2022). As such, it is important to understand the formation and evolution of gas giants in order to better understand the occurrence of Earth-like planets and the emergence of life in the universe. Gas giants themselves are rich laboratories: they host complex moon systems (Morrison, 1982), bear dramatic storm systems and weather patterns (Marcus, 1993), are obscured by clouds of varying species (Helling, 2019), and have interiors with poorly constrained structure and composition whose investigation drives advancement in physics modeling and experimentation (Hubbard et al., 2002; Guillot, 2005). High-contrast imaging observations enabled by adaptive optics and coronagraphic instruments have resulted in the discovery of a growing number of directly imaged planets (M<13\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}) in wide orbits (a>10\,\mathrm{au}) around young ({<}100\,\mathrm{Myr}) pre-main sequence stars (for a review, see Currie et al., 2023). These objects appear much rarer than shorter separation gas giants (e.g. Nielsen et al., 2019; Vigan et al., 2021, and references therein) and their formation histories are often debated. Demographic studies from the larger sample of older radial velocity (RVs) gas giants have shown that, 1) the fraction of giant planets orbiting a star increases with stellar metallicity, tracing core accretion, as more solids are found in the planet forming disks of higher metallicity stars (Gonzalez, 1997; Santos et al., 2004; Fischer & Valenti, 2005; Mordasini et al., 2012) and 2) planets with masses below about 4\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}} are found orbiting metal rich host stars, whereas objects with masses above 4\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}} exhibit a much broader range of host-star metallicity (Santos et al., 2017; Schlaufman, 2018). The bulk of gas giants appear to orbit near their host star’s ice lines, \sim3–10 au around solar type stars (Fernandes et al., 2019; Wittenmyer et al., 2020; Fulton et al., 2021; Lagrange et al., 2023), albeit with a large scatter ranging from ultra hot Jupiters to planets with periods \gtrsim1000 years. Bulk density measurements from transiting planets with RV masses have elucidated a planetary mass vs planetary metallicity trend (Guillot et al., 2006; Miller & Fortney, 2011; Thorngren et al., 2016) that is explainable by core accretion (e.g. Hasegawa et al., 2018). At higher masses, planets are generally less metal rich because they have accreted a larger fraction of H/He gas (Thorngren & Fortney, 2019), though these samples are based on short period planets that are much closer to their stars than directly detected objects. Despite remaining open questions, core accretion formation is the predominant theory of planet formation for the sample of indirectly detected planets (e.g. Raymond & Morbidelli, 2022). Many objects in the current sample of directly imaged exoplanets are broadly consistent with formation in 1) the low probability, high mass tail of core accretion model distributions, and subsequent dynamical scattering outwards (e.g. Mordasini et al., 2009; Marleau et al., 2019; Emsenhuber et al., 2021a, b), 2) the low probability, low mass tail of molecular core fragmentation and early dynamical capture distributions (e.g. Chabrier, 2003; Padoan & Nordlund, 2004; Boyd & Whitworth, 2005; Bate, 2009, 2012), or perhaps 3) as instances of disk instability and fragmentation (e.g. Boss, 1997; Kratter et al., 2010; Forgan et al., 2018). There is growing consensus from dynamical studies tracing the eccentricity and obliquity distributions of these systems that directly imaged planets interior to \sim 50-100\,\mathrm{au} formed within a disk (e.g. Bowler et al., 2020, 2023; Sepulveda et al., 2024), but it is still unclear whether these objects formed via core accretion or disk fragmentation. The challenge for direct imaging is twofold, to push to observe planets that are representative of the bulk of the exoplanet population, and to disentangle the formation histories of known imaged planets. Direct observations, combined with model independent mass measurements, can then seek to expand on the observational trends to inform planet formation models with greater fidelity. 1.2 Accessing solar system scales with interferometry In addition to classical direct imaging using coronagraphic imaging, or molecular mapping via high-resolution cross correlation, optical interferometry has begun to provide direct observations of gas giant planets with the advent of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) GRAVITY instrument (GRAVITY Collaboration et al., 2017) and the ExoGRAVITY survey (Lacour et al., 2020). GRAVITY is a fiber fed instrument with dedicated fringe tracking. Informed by radial velocity observations and proper motion anomalies (Grandjean et al., 2019; Lagrange et al., 2020), GRAVITY has helped validate and reveal two newly directly detected planets within 10\,\mathrm{au}, \beta Pictoris c (2.7\,\mathrm{au}; Nowak et al., 2020) and HD 206893 c (3.5\,\mathrm{au}; Hinkley et al., 2023). With absolute astrometry from Gaia, GRAVITY has detected a handful of brown dwarf companions at very close separations (60-200\mathrm{mas}; Pourré et al., 2024; Winterhalder et al., 2024). It has also exquisitely characterized many known directly imaged giant planets and brown dwarf companions (GRAVITY Collaboration et al., 2019, 2020; Kammerer et al., 2021; Lacour et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a; Balmer et al., 2023; Blunt et al., 2023; Balmer et al., 2024; Nasedkin et al., 2024b). GRAVITY provides the most precise relative astrometry of directly detected planets yet measured, as well as K-band spectroscopy (in three modes, with R=50, 500, and 5000). The K-band emission of substellar objects is shaped by absorption from H2O, CO, and CH4. The capability to conduct spectroscopy at close separations has enabled the precise estimation of the atmospheric abundances of a number of directly imaged planets (Mollière et al., 2020). GRAVITY’s main limitation is its very small field of view (\sim 60\,\mathrm{mas}), which necessitates precise fiber pointing (and therefore some prior knowledge of the planet’s position) to ensure the planet’s emission is coupled into the science fiber (see Pourré et al., 2024, for the characterization of the contrast performance of the techniques used in this paper and previous work). The release of Gaia DR4 is expected to contain a list of astrometrically detected exoplanets111https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/release, which would provide prior knowledge of the positions of a large sample of planets that could be amenable to imaging with GRAVITY. Previous estimates of Gaia’s exoplanet detection capabilities have indicated that as many as 21,000 long period, giant exoplanets could be found over the mission’s lifetime (Perryman et al., 2014). GRAVITY is expected to uniquely detect and characterize a subset of these astrometric planet candidates in young moving groups (Winterhalder et al., 2024; Pourré et al., 2024). This would open a unique window into atmospheric characterization of giant planets near their snow lines. The question then becomes, ‘to what degree do we expect to understand the orbits, atmospheric composition, and fundamental properties of planets that can only be detected (in the near term) with Gaia and GRAVITY?’ 1.3 AF Leporis b Proper motion anomalies between Hipparcos and Gaia (Brandt, 2018; Kervella et al., 2019; Brandt, 2021; Kervella et al., 2022) have been leveraged to directly image new companions with a higher detection rate than blind surveys (e.g., Currie et al., 2020; Chilcote et al., 2021; Bonavita et al., 2022; Franson et al., 2023b; Currie et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). Most notably, after uninformative surveys the decades prior had returned non-detections (Biller et al., 2013; Stone et al., 2018; Nielsen et al., 2019; Launhardt et al., 2020), proper motion anomaly informed searches have uncovered a giant planet orbiting the young star AF Lep (HD 35850, HIP 25486, Gaia DR3 3009908378049913216) that has the lowest dynamically measured mass of any directly imaged exoplanet (De Rosa et al., 2023; Franson et al., 2023a; Mesa et al., 2023). The mass estimates for the planet at the time of discovery varied by about a Jupiter mass between datasets (4.3^{+2.9}_{-1.2}\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}, De Rosa et al., 2023), (3.2^{+0.7}_{-0.6}\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}, Franson et al., 2023a), (5.237^{+0.085}_{-0.10}\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}, Mesa et al., 2023), depending on the orbital coverage of the initial observations. The ensemble of discovery data was subsequently analyzed together, providing another estimate of the planet’s dynamical mass (2.8^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}, Zhang et al., 2023). The planet was recovered in archival observations dating back to 2011 using explainable machine learning assisted starlight subtraction, which significantly extended the baseline of the planet’s measured orbital motion, and constrained the orbit to low eccentricities (Bonse et al., 2024). Initial estimates for the temperature and spectral type of the planet varied anywhere between 700-1200\,\mathrm{K}, placing the planet along the low-surface gravity L-T transition, where spectral modeling is particularly challenging (Marley & Robinson, 2015). Nevertheless, by combining the suite of discovery spectrophotometry, two studies have indicated that the planet appears to have a temperature between 700-900\,\mathrm{K} and an atmosphere that is enriched in metals compared to the solar value (Zhang et al., 2023; Palma-Bifani et al., 2024). The planet was directly imaged at 4.4 µm using JWST/NIRCam coronagraphy, and the suppression of its flux at these wavelengths provided strong evidence that its atmosphere is in chemical disequilibrium (Franson et al., 2024). It has been suggested that the luminosity and dynamical mass of the planet are consistent with a delayed formation (Franson et al., 2023a; Zhang et al., 2023; Zhang, 2024, that is, formation a few Myr after the host star formation). The sensitivity of the planet’s dynamical mass estimate to the viewing geometry, as well as the relatively unconstrained methane abundance given the wavelength coverage of existing observations motivated our follow-up of this system with VLTI/GRAVITY. Here we present the results of our new interferometric observations of AF Lep b with VLTI/GRAVITY. Relative astrometry at \sim 50\,\mu\mathrm{as} precision near periastron constrains the low eccentricity of the planet’s orbit with a time baseline of only 2 months, and coupled with the archival recovery of the planet near apoastron, places a strong upper limit on the eccentricity. The system provides an example of the excellent orbital precision that could be expected for planets detected astrometrically by Gaia and directly confirmed by GRAVITY. The K-band spectrum of the planet shows prominent methane absorption features that constrain the temperature, composition, and chemical disequilibrium of the atmosphere. We discuss future improvements necessary to better characterize the planet’s atmosphere and bulk properties. We argue that the current ensemble of results are consistent with expectations from core accretion formation models. We conclude by looking forward to anticipated observations of Gaia discovered planets with VLTI/GRAVITY."
