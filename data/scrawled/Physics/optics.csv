https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10435v1,The Spatial Complexity of Optical Computing and How to Reduce It,"Similar to algorithms, which consume time and memory to run, hardware requires resources to function. For devices processing physical waves, implementing operations needs sufficient “space,” as dictated by wave physics. How much space is needed to perform a certain function is a fundamental question in optics, with recent research addressing it for given mathematical operations, but not for more general computing tasks, e.g., classification. Inspired by computational complexity theory, we study the “spatial complexity” of optical computing systems in terms of scaling laws—specifically, how their physical dimensions must scale as the dimension of the mathematical operation increases—and propose a new paradigm for designing optical computing systems: space-efficient neuromorphic optics, based on structural sparsity constraints and neural pruning methods motivated by wave physics (notably, the concept of “overlapping nonlocality”). On two mainstream platforms, free-space optics and on-chip integrated photonics, our methods demonstrate substantial size reductions (to 1\%-10\% the size of conventional designs) with minimal compromise on performance. Our theoretical and computational results reveal a trend of diminishing returns on accuracy as structure dimensions increase, providing a new perspective for interpreting and approaching the ultimate limits of optical computing—a balanced trade-off between device size and accuracy.","I Results Figure 2: Standard optical nonlocality and overlapping nonlocality. (a) Schematic of a 1D free-space optical system. The communication cone of an output port, defined as the set of all couplings to it, is characterized by two parameters, the horizontal shift d_{\text{shift}} and the spanning range w_{\text{cone}}. An ideally local optical device would have both d_{\text{shift}} and w_{\text{cone}} equal to zero. (b) The overlapping nonlocality (ONL) C associated with a transverse aperture (or “cut”) is the number of communication cones intersecting it. For example, C=5 for the green cut and C=6 for the purple cut. (c) Demonstration of calculating C for an arbitrary cut for a 2D free-space optical system. For a given cut, an output contributes a one to C only if its communication cone intersects the cut. (d) Definition of the in-plane distance d_{\parallel} traversed by an optical coupling. For a pair of coupled ports (i,j), d_{\parallel} is the distance between them, projected onto the output (or input) plane. This distance measures the nonlocality of each individual coupling. Figure 3: Scaling laws of three types of optical device kernels. Scaling laws of the maximum ONL, \max(C), with respect to the mathematical operation dimension, N, for the three considered types of device kernels: (a) trivial sparse, (b) row sparse, and (c) local sparse kernels. In (a), lines and shaded regions (inset) represent the average and one standard deviation of numerical simulation results. The standard deviation is negligibly small. In (b,c), darker lines represent theoretical values derived from Eq. 2, and lighter lines represent numerical simulation results (see Methods and Supplementary Note 1). I.1 The Spatial Complexity of Free-Space Optics To implement a nontrivial mathematical operation, an optical device has to be “nonlocal” — its output at any position should depend on the input across a range of positions, which ultimately implies the need for sufficient thickness to incorporate enough “channels” to communicate sideways within the device [17, 27]. The relation between the concept of nonlocality and thickness (and, more broadly, spatial complexity) is, however, a subtle one. Consider the configuration shown in Fig. 2a: In a 1D optical structure, each output port (a sampling point for the output field) is coupled to a set of input ports (sampling points for the input field), spanning a range over the input plane. These couplings between pairs of points (input j and output i) encode the function of the optical system, namely, they are the elements D_{ij} of its kernel operator (in matrix form) \mathbf{D}. Two parameters can be used to describe how spatially extended, or “nonlocal”, the range of these couplings is: d_{\text{shift}}, the horizontal shift of the center of this range relative to the output, and w_{\text{cone}}, the width of the range. We then refer to the cone-shaped region (highlighted in orange in Fig. 2a) that encloses all the couplings for an arbitrary output i as the communication cone of i. The parameters d_{\text{shift}} and w_{\text{cone}} represent different aspects of the conventional notion of nonlocality in optics and wave physics. Importantly, however, very large values for these parameters do not imply that the optical system require multiple “sideways channels” and, thus, a large thickness. As argued in [17], a single-mode optical fiber with multiple taps, for example, can have arbitrarily large nonlocality, as quantified here by d_{\text{shift}} and w_{\text{cone}}, but would only require a finite (small) thickness to accommodate that single mode. It is a different aspect of “nonlocality” that is directly related to the size requirements of optics, the so-called overlapping nonlocality (ONL), which arises if the input position range for one output point overlaps with that for another output point, requiring multiple sideways channels to implement the desired function [17]. From a geometrical perspective (Fig. 2b), the ONL associated with a transverse aperture S is the number C of communication cones that must cross from one side of S to the other to implement the desired kernel. We refer to the transverse aperture as a “cut,” as it divides the output (and input) plane into two parts. For a device operating at an effective wavelength of \lambda_{0}/n (where n is the maximum refractive index in the device), the cut must be large enough to support C sideways channels to realize those crossing communication cones—one sideways channel for each cone. Using diffraction arguments (assuming the system only contains transparent, non-absorbing materials), one can then determine the lower bound on the device thickness t from the maximum value of C throughout the device [17]: t\geq\begin{cases}\max(C)\frac{\lambda_{0}}{2(1-\cos\theta)n}&\text{for 1D},\\ \max(C)\frac{1}{l_{\text{cut}}}\left[\frac{\lambda_{0}}{2(1-\cos\theta)n}% \right]^{2}&\text{for 2D},\end{cases} (1) where the parameter \theta represents the maximum allowed ray angle inside the device. Eq. 1, also distinguishes between 1D and 2D cases, since in 1D, the size of the aperture is the thickness t, whereas in 2D, t\equiv A/l_{\text{cut}}, where A is the area of the cut and l_{\text{cut}} is the length of its projection to the output (or input) plane (Fig. 2c). These theoretical results imply that the thickness required to perform an exact mathematical operation, described by a kernel \mathbf{D}, can only be reduced by decreasing the wavelength or increasing the refractive index, neither of which may be desirable or possible [28]. This is valid for any free-space optical (or wave-based) analog computing system, as the ONL C is purely determined by the mathematical form of the desired functionality and not by the details of the optical implementation. Here, instead, we approach the problem of minimizing the thickness, and therefore the size, of the system from a different perspective—by modifying the form of the mathematical operation so that the thickness scales slowly as the operation dimension increases, while maintaining high accuracy for a given task. To achieve this, we first analyze the scaling laws of the ONL, C, for operations under various constraints, and clarify the relationship between the ONL, sparsity, and standard optical locality. Consider a device kernel \mathbf{D} of dimension N\times N, with input and output ports arranged in grids on two parallel planes (see Supplementary Note 1). For the same \mathbf{D}, the number of required sideways channels, C, may vary across different choices of cuts. The most important quantity is therefore \max(C), which is associated with the cut that is crossed by the largest number of sideways channels, and the entire device must be sufficiently thick to accommodate all the associated channels (see Supplementary Note 1 for the definitions of valid and invalid cuts). To analyze how the form of \mathbf{D} affects \max(C), we first study the worst-case scenario, where every output is coupled to all input points, resulting in a completely filled matrix \mathbf{D}. In this case, C=N, since the communication cone of every output intersects every cut. Next, we examine whether increasing sparsity in \mathbf{D} (by introducing zeros, i.e., removing couplings) reduces \max(C). Our analysis and numerical experiments (see Supplementary Note 1 for the proof and simulation) show that trivial sparsity does not help, except when \mathbf{D} becomes “extremely sparse,” as shown in Fig. 3a. However, an overly sparse kernel cannot encode enough free parameters, largely limiting its ability to realize useful optical functions. Therefore, trivially increasing sparsity is not a feasible way to reduce \max(C). One seemingly promising approach is to impose more drastic structural sparsity by removing a fraction of output ports, as this completely prevents those outputs from contributing to C. In matrix terms, removing outputs corresponds to setting rows of \mathbf{D} to zero. With a fraction \rho_{\text{row}} of rows remaining activated, \max(C) scales as \rho_{\text{row}}N, still depending linearly on N (Fig. 3b). Aiming for a better scaling law, we then encourage locality when imposing sparsity by constructing matrices whose entries D_{ij} are nonzero only when the in-plane distance d_{\parallel}(i,j) (Fig. 2d) is below a predefined threshold \max(d_{\parallel}). This, in turn, constrains all outputs’ communication cones, d_{\text{shift}}+w_{\text{cone}}/2\leq\max(d_{\parallel}). Matrices constructed in this way display a distinct feature: When viewed in a graph layout, all couplings deviate only slightly from vertical (Fig. 1c). We refer to these matrices as local sparse matrices. While reducing the in-plane distance crossed by individual couplings does not directly reduce the ONL, if this distance is, on average, small for all couplings, then the number of independent communication cones crossing any transverse aperture should be reduced, hence reducing the ONL. Our further analysis and simulation indeed reveal that, with local sparse matrices, \max(C) scales sublinearly as \mathcal{O}(N^{1/2}) (Fig. 3c). Eq. 2 summarizes the scaling laws for the expected values of the maximum ONL for the three considered types of matrices, corresponding to different forms of device kernel (see Supplementary Note 1 for details and proofs), \mathbb{E}[\max(C)]=\begin{cases}N&=\mathcal{O}\left(N\right)\text{ for % trivial sparse matrices},\\ \rho_{\text{row}}N&=\mathcal{O}\left(N\right)\text{ for row sparse matrices},% \\ 2\max(d_{\parallel})\cdot\left[\sqrt{2N}-\max(d_{\parallel})\right]&=\mathcal{% O}\left(N^{1/2}\right)\text{ for local sparse matrices with small $\max(d_{% \parallel})$}.\end{cases} (2) Figure 4: Space-efficient computing with free-space optics. Schematic of (a) conventional, (b) row sparse, and (c) local sparse ONNs performing a classification task on the fashion-MNIST dataset. (d-f) Thicknesses of the three interlayer regions in conventional (top row), row sparse (middle row), and local sparse (bottom row) ONNs. To demonstrate the trade-off between model thickness and accuracy, each model type is pruned using five different pruning thresholds (see Methods). Error bars represent one standard deviation of thickness (along y-axis) and accuracy (along x-axis) across eight different random seeds. A local sparse ONN with a pruning threshold of \tau=0.01, compared to a conventional ONN with \tau=0.05, drastically reduces the thickness while only compromising accuracy by 3.6\% on the fashion-MNIST dataset (vertical orange arrows; see Supplementary Note 6). Our findings imply that, while enforcing sparsity alone is not helpful, reducing the degree of standard optical nonlocality, quantified by d_{\text{shift}} and w_{\text{cone}} and bounded by \max(d_{\parallel}), also reduces the scaling of the maximum ONL, \max(C), with the operation dimension. Therefore, reducing the spatial complexity of a free-space optical computing structure requires a pruning method motivated by wave physics and fundamentally rooted in the concept of optical nonlocality. These results promise compact, scalable optical realizations of large-scale computations, provided that the target task can still be accomplished with high accuracy, as discussed next. I.2 Space-Efficient Computing with Free-Space Optics: Local Sparse ONNs Unlike artificial neural networks stored and manipulated in computer memory, optical (or, any wave-based) neural networks exist in the physical world. Many properties of these networks, including their optical locality, stem from the Euclidean distance defined in the position space, thus demanding physics-motivated pruning techniques. To translate the structural sparsity constraints identified above into an optics-specific pruning method, we leverage the recently proposed brain inspired modular training (BIMT) [29], which offers a perfect routine for pruning physical neural networks targeting for local sparse patterns. BIMT focuses on spatial networks [30], where each neuron in the network is assigned a position, enabling the definition of physical distances. To enhance locality, BIMT penalizes nonlocal channels using an additional loss term, \mathcal{L}_{\text{nonlocal}} (see Methods), and strategically swaps neurons and the associated weights across layers (except for the input). These features make BIMT an ideal method for designing local sparse optical neural networks (LSONNs), suitable for ultrathin free-space optical devices. To quantitatively examine the trade-off between the optical device’s minimum thickness and the model’s inference accuracy, we train LSONNs and their conventional counterparts on three datasets, MNIST [31], fashion-MNIST [32], and Kuzushiji-MNIST [33]. Then, we apply weight pruning to the resulting networks by removing weights with absolute values below a threshold \tau. (Here, weight pruning is also applied to conventional networks because, otherwise, the network would be fully connected, corresponding to an extremely thick device.) Each network has 4 bias-free layers with \left[784,100,100,10\right] neurons. The neurons in the input and hidden layers are arranged in square grids in position space. The 10 neurons in the output layer are arranged in a ring. Each layer, except the last one, is followed by a SiLU (Swish) activation function [34]. Once the network is trained, we calculate the minimum possible device thickness (i.e., the minimum distance between each two successive layers) for a free-space optical implementation, by calculating the maximum ONL and applying Eq. 1. Fig. 4 summarizes the thickness-accuracy trade-offs of conventional, row sparse, and local sparse ONNs. Remarkably, across all three datasets, LSONNs achieve a thickness reduction of more than one order of magnitude in t_{1,2} and reduce t_{3} by approximately a factor of 3 compared to their conventional and row sparse counterparts, with a slight or negligible drop in accuracy (e.g., only 3.6\% on the fashion-MNIST dataset). This thickness-accuracy trade-off can be interpreted as diminishing returns on accuracy: beyond a certain level of optical complexity and accuracy, additional spatial resources lead to only marginal improvements in accuracy. Additionally, we attribute this substantial reduction in thickness to a strategic allocation of the ONL across all transverse apertures: In LSONNs, large values of C always pass through apertures with large in-plane length l_{\text{cut}}, while in conventional and row sparse ONNs, large values of C often need to pass through narrow apertures (with small l_{\text{cut}}), causing “information bottlenecks” that require greater thickness to accommodate the necessary C (see Supplementary Note 2). In summary, we have demonstrated training LSONNs as an example of the proposed space-efficient paradigm for designing free-space optical computing structures that use an available volume optimally to perform an intended computation task: First, we have analyzed the scaling laws for the ONL, the key physical quantity associated with the spatial complexity of optical systems, and discovered that mathematical operations in the local sparse form can result in thin free-space optical structures. Then, by applying a physics-motivated pruning method that targets the required local sparse form, we have trained specialized ONNs that meet the desired criteria. This procedure is directly applicable to the designs of diffractive-surface- and metalens-based ONNs [35, 36], potentially enabling a new generation of scalable ultrathin free-space optical devices. I.3 Space-Efficient Computing on Photonic Chips: Analysis and Design Figure 5: Space-efficient computing on photonic chips. (a) Trade-off between model accuracy and the degree of block-diagonalization for different block-diagonal models. Shaded regions represent one standard deviation of accuracy across eight different random seeds. (b-e) Weights of block-diagonal and unpruned models. For each model, the number of free parameters, the involved unitary transformations (including both left and right unitary matrices, U and V^{T}, from the singular value decomposition of all weight matrices), and the total number of required MZIs are listed on the right. Optical networks on integrated photonic chips are typically based on arrays of photonic waveguides and modulators and meshes of Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) performing arbitrary linear operations on the waveguide inputs [37, 38]. Optimizing spatial resources in this context, therefore, demands reducing the number of required MZIs, n_{\text{MZI}}. When realizing a device kernel matrix \mathbf{D} of dimension M\times N, an MZI-based architecture requires n_{\text{MZI}}=\left[M(M-1)+N(N-1)\right]/2 components to implement two unitary transformations, U(M) and U(N) [37]. However, if the kernel matrix could be reduced to a “block-diagonal” form, the scaling of n_{\text{MZI}} with both M and N would be reduced from quadratic to quasi-linear, as a block-diagonal matrix only comprises a linear number of small blocks with each block only requiring a few MZIs. This simplification of the photonic chip architecture becomes more apparent from a graph perspective: Block-diagonalization disassembles the huge bipartite connectivity graph into small, decoupled (disconnected) components, resulting in a significant loss of parameters and, more importantly, inevitably sacrificing inter-block connectivity (coupling), as shown in the connectivity graphs in Fig. 1d-f. Similar to free-space optics, the question is then whether a given operation can still be performed using a space-efficient architecture of this type, and what level of performance degradation can be expected. While this block-diagonalization approach is not expected to be applicable to all computational tasks, we find that relevant tasks solvable by neural networks are amenable to block-diagonalization, leading to a substantial reduction in spatial complexity. To optimize the trade-off between n_{\text{MZI}} and the ONNs’ performance, we propose a two-step pruning method. First, we include in the loss function an extra term, \mathcal{L}_{\text{off-bloc-diag}}, that penalizes all off-block-diagonal entries. No parameter is removed at this stage. Once the weights are trained, they are loaded into specially designed block-diagonal-structured (BDS) linear layers, where only entries in the diagonal blocks are registered as learnable parameters, while all other entries remain zero and are not updatable. The model with BDS linear layers is further trained on the same dataset to fully adapt to the block diagonal structure (see Methods). To evaluate the trade-off between n_{\text{MZI}} and the model’s inference accuracy, we train networks with several degrees of block-diagonalization on the three MNIST-like datasets used in the previous section [31, 32, 33]. Each network has 5 bias-free layers with \left[784,100,100,10,10\right] neurons. Each layer, except the last one, is followed by a SiLU activation function [34]. We consider six different block-diagonalized architectures, named from “b-d1” to “b-d6”, where n_{\text{MZI}} varies from approximately 3,200 to approximately 22,600. Fig. 5 summarizes the trade-off between n_{\text{MZI}} and accuracy. These six models share one important feature, the weight (size 10\times 10) connecting the last two layers remains unpruned, which we find is crucial for maintaining satisfactory accuracy. (Results on models with a pruned last weight are included in Supplementary Note 6.) Remarkably, model “b-d4”, with its largest block being only 10\times 10 in size, achieves accuracies of 93.24\pm 0.40\%, 84.51\pm 0.16\%, and 66.76\pm 0.25\% on the MNIST, fashion-MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST datasets, respectively. Implementing “b-d4” using the MZI-grid architecture already requires fewer than 4,200 MZIs, compared to the unpruned implementation’s approximately 0.3 million MZIs—a reduction of about 98.7\%. We also expect that emergent photonic components, for example, inverse-designed, programmable multiport couplers [39, 40, 41], could enable an even more compact and flexibly tunable on-chip implementation of similar models based on small, decoupled blocks. Finally, we extend this block-diagonalization approach to 1. develop block-circulant ONNs, whose weight matrices consist of rows of cyclically shifting blocks, leveraging light diffraction for space-efficient computing (e.g.,[42]); and 2. prune models optimized for edge AI applications, e.g., MobileNetV2 [43] for CIFAR-10 [44] classification. We block-diagonalize the fully connected (FC) layer of MobileNetV2 and, with a largest block size of 10\times 10, reduce n_{\text{MZI}} by \sim 99\% (considering the photonic implementation of FC layers only), while the accuracy decreases only slightly from 92.97\pm 0.24\% to 92.41\pm 0.25\%. (See Supplementary Note 4 for both models’ configurations and performance.) With these extensions, we envision that a hybrid architecture—employing digital implementations for convolution layers, nonlinear activations, shortcut connections, etc., and photonic analog components for the classifier based on block-diagonal (or block-circulant) FC layers—could facilitate FLOP-, memory-, and space-efficient computation acceleration in real-world edge applications."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10361v1,Indium tin oxide combined with anti-reflective coatings with high transmittance for wavelengths < 400 nm,"The transparent and conductive properties of indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films, make them an attractive coating for optically integrated ion traps. However, the relatively low transmittance for wavelengths < 400 nm, high scattering and high production temperature limits the usability in trapped-ion-based quantum technologies. Here we present ITO coatings and a combined ITO + anti-reflective (AR) coating system optimized for an ion trap applied using ion beam sputtering (IBS). The coatings feature a high transmittance for wavelengths < 400 nm and additional wavelengths up to 1000 nm, low scattering and low production temperature < 150 \degreeC. The transmission, reflection and absorption spectra are simulated and the resistance, transmittance and scattering at 370 nm are measured for different ITO coating thicknesses and the ITO + AR coating system. For the ITO + AR coating system a resistance of 115 \pm 5 \Omega/\Box, transmittance of 80\% and scattering of 0.012 \pm 0.002\% at 370 nm is achieved.","Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is a transparent, conducting material that can be applied as a thin film coating. It is produced by doping indium oxide, a ceramic material that is transparent in the visible spectrum with the metal tin, creating a conductive coating with a high transmittance in the visible spectrum. The combination of electrical and optical properties of the coating makes it an attractive intermediator between electrical and optical interfaces [1]. As a result, ITO coatings are used in a wide variety of devices for example solar cells and LCDs [2, 3, 4]. With the rise of Quantum Technologies (QTs), the interest in ITO has increased since QTs often rely on both electrical and optical properties of materials [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. A promising platform in QTs is ion traps, where the coatings have been used for grounding of optics [7, 8] and as a transparent electrode material [9, 10]. However, ITO typically has low transmittance < 60\% for wavelengths < 400 nm [11, 12, 13, 14], high surface roughness > 1 nm [15, 16, 17, 18] and high production temperatures [19, 20, 21, 22, 23] > 150 \degreeC which limits the applications of ITO in ion trap experiments. In ion traps, the ion species determines the wavelengths necessary to control the system and wavelengths < 400 nm are common. Therefore, ITO coatings with high transmittance for these wavelengths are needed. High surface roughness can lead to increased scattering that could impair the state readout of the ions [24]. Ion trap experiments rely on the detection of the fluorescence light of single ions and scattered light increases the detection noise. Furthermore, ultraviolet (UV) light can charge up materials leading to a displacement of the ions [25]. A further issue when using ITO for ion traps is the high process or annealing temperatures. As an example, magnetron sputtering often requires a substrate temperature of about 200-300 \degreeC during the coating process or an annealing temperature of 350 \degreeC after the coating process [21, 17, 13], which can degrade or damage other materials. This creates a demand for ITO coatings with high transmittance and low scattering especially for wavelengths < 400 nm and low production temperatures. Here we present an ITO coating with high transmittance for wavelengths < 400 nm and additionally high transmittance at other technically required wavelengths up to 1000 nm. The coating is applied using IBS, a technique which uses temperatures that can stay below 100 \degreeC during the production process. IBS is known to create coating layers with lower optical scattering for oxide materials like Ta2O5 and SiO2 compared to for example e-beam deposition [26, 27]. Here we investigate, if using IBS for the production of ITO layers also achieves low optical scattering. The transmittance of the ITO layers is increased by an antireflection (AR) coating at application requested wavelengths. Here we report the design of the ITO+AR coating and the measurement of the transmittance and optical scattering of the coatings at 370 nm. The achieved properties make these ITO layers particularly suitable for the use in ion traps with ytterbium (Yb+), calcium (Ca+) or strontium (Sr+) ions. In this work, we characterize the ITO coatings for the transition wavelengths of Yb+ ions. In particular the coatings are used within the BMBF-project IDEAL [28]. The IDEAL project develops an ion trap with integrated gradient index (GRIN) lenses for addressing Yb+ ions. The integrated GRIN-lenses are used to focus laser light onto the ions in the trap and to collect the light from the fluorescing ions. In this project, ITO coatings are used for the grounding of GRIN-lenses integrated in the ion trap."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10039v1,The Magnetic Dislocation in Photonics,"The dislocation created in the topological material lays the foundation of many significant findings to control light but requires delicate fabrication of the material. To extend its flexibility and reconfigurability, we propose the magnetic dislocation concept and unveil its properties in a representative model, which effectively combines the topological defect and edge mode at the magnetic domain wall. The results include distinct localization modes and robust light trapping phenomena with the rainbow feature where the eigen-energy of each light-trapping state can be linearly tuned by the magnetic dislocation. The conversion from the trapping state to edge modes can be harnessed by further adiabatically pumping light across an amount of the magnitude of the magnetic dislocation. Our work solves a fundamental problem by introducing magnetic dislocation with new light-manipulation flexibility, which may be implemented in a variety of platforms in photonic, acoustics, and optomechanics with dynamic modulations and synthetic dimensions.","Dislocation, as the topological defect, describes the distortion of the hosting lattice, usually characterized as the real-space topology that cannot be eliminated by local continuous modifications [1, 2, 3, 4]. Recently, it has been realized that the interplay between dislocations and band topology in topological materials brings novel ways in light manipulations against disorders [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], including the light-trapping [13], bulk probes of higher-order topological insulators [18], simulating three-dimensional topology [20, 22, 23, 24], controlling the topology of material [21], and probing the topology of the system [25, 26]. Previous studies have focused on the dislocation configurations from spatially designed topological defect [4, 5, 13, 21, 27, 28, 29, 30], which has limited reconfigurability, particularly in the optical regime [31]. The effective magnetic field for photonics provides a powerful approach to control the motion of light in a flexible way [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], with which the photonic analogy of quantum Hall effect can be realized in photonics platforms [33, 34, 35, 36]. As for dislocation in the hosting lattice, it has been indicated that the effective gauge potential generated from the geometrical dislocation is the main reason affecting the property of the topological defect mode [4]. It is, therefore, of fundamental interest to explore the direct dislocation in an effective magnetic field, namely magnetic dislocation, in photonics, which not only deepens the fundamental understanding of the dislocation mechanism but also shows new potential in reconfigurable light manipulation. In this work, we theoretically study the fundamental problem of the magnetic dislocation in a spatially uniform tight-binding (TB) lattice. The magnetic dislocation is introduced by designing non-continuously distributed hopping phases to construct a magnetic singularity in the underlying lattice without spatial defect, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The introduction of such artificial magnetic dislocation is in-principle different from previous models with dislocation well-defined in spatial structures [4, 39], but is universal to be possibly constructed for waves using recent experimental technologies in photonics [40, 41, 42], acoustics [43, 44], and optomechanics [45, 46, 47]. We unveil such concept of magnetic dislocation as the composition of two effective mechanisms, namely the topological defect and edge mode at the magnetic domain wall simultaneously. Therefore, by tuning the discontinuous hopping phase, light can be trapped at the singularity of the magnetic flux with the rainbow feature [48, 49], i.e., the eigen-energy of each light-trapping state varies with the tuning of the magnetic dislocation monotonically. Such light trapping state can be converted to edge modes by adiatically pumping the light. Our proposal can be generalized to all electromagnetic waves [50], which may trigger further research interest in topological defects with magnetic singularities and novel wave manipulations [51, 52, 53]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09876v1,Visualization of atomistic optical waves in crystals,"The refractive index of a matter is foundational to quantify the light-matter interaction of the medium. However, the classical description of refractive index is based on macroscopic homogenization and is limited to describing the local optical response of materials. A complete quantum description of light-matter interaction should consider nonlocality and multiple-scattering of optical responses at the atomistic lattice level. Recently, the deep microscopic optical band structure was introduced as a quantum generalization of refractive index of a medium. This quantum description unveils multiple optical eigenmodes in crystalline solids and hidden microscopic optical waves at the lattice level. In this work, we unravel the microscopic optical waves in silicon carbide. We predict and visualize hidden microscopic optical eigenwaves, which can be nonplanar and inhomogeneous even near the optical limit. Also, the nonlocal macroscopic dielectric constant of the crystal is analyzed using the microscopic optical waves as the basis. Our work establishes a general framework for picoscale electrodynamics applicable to other materials including two-dimensional materials.","Refractive index has long been used to characterize the optical properties of materials [1] (Fig. 1a). In other words, the quest of finding a novel optical material is equivalent to tuning the refractive index [2, 3]. For instance, metamaterials with artificial optical properties, such as negative index [4], artificial-chiral [5], hyperbolic [6], epsilon-near-zero [7], have been realized by engineering subwavelength structural compositions. This classical concept of refractive index has been successful in not only classical optics and nanophotonics, but also in quantum optics, where the spontaneous emission rates of quantum emitters have been predicted using refractive index of various electromagnetic environment [8, 9]. However, recent advances on photonic crystals, resonant and nonlocal meta-optics, and nanoscale optics have reached regimes with strong nonlocality or spatial dispersion where the classical homogenization and conventional effective medium theories fail [10]; inevitably, the concept of refractive index needs to be generalized beyond the local, continuum, and homogeneous limit [11, 12, 13]. The effect of nonlocality is especially pronounced in plasmonics, which has become one of the most active research areas in nano-optics. For its extreme light localization and electric field amplification, plasmonics with nano-gaps can strongly enhance light-matter interactions at the nanoscale [9]. However, the length scale of plasmonic modes become highly subwavelength in such pico- or nano-structured plasmonic systems, so the classical macroscopic homogenization does not hold [14]. As a quantum correction of dielectric constant by considering the electron spill-out at the metal surfaces, the nonlocal hydrodynamic model has been proposed [15, 16]. This model considers mostly surface effects and is limited to macroscopic continuum limit. Classical description of macroscopic polarization has been related to the density of dipole moment, but this description fails to explain the polarization in periodic crystals without considering surfaces, because the dipole moment in the periodic lattice is arbitrary depending on the choice of the origin in the lattice. This discrepancy was remedied by the so-called modern theory of polarization [17, 18], which defines macroscopic polarization through topological argument. Still, this theory does not apply to the dynamic optical refractive index of crystals. Refractive index relates to macroscopic fields by macroscopic Maxwell’s equations. This description does not consider microscopic fields that are rapidly varying at the atomic scales, where atoms or molecules in the media experience microscopic fields, or the local fields. The connection between macroscopic and microscopic quantities has been explained by the Claussius-Mossotti (Lorentz-Lorenz) equation that relates the bulk refractive index to the molecular (microscopic) polarizability [19], but this description is classical and only applies to isotropic or simple cubic lattices.

(e) The deep microscopic optical band structure \pi_{\lambda}(\mathbf{q},\omega) of SiC. The band structure consists of the dominant band (\lambda=0, red solid line) and higher-order bands (\lambda>0, blue solid lines). The real-space distributions of some selected bands are visualized in Fig. 3. The yellow shaded region indicates the classical optical regime with small momentum |\mathbf{q}|. The frequency is \omega = 10 THz. The phonon band structure result was taken from Ref. [20] The optical properties of real crystals have also been calculated via full quantum theories, such as density functional theory, considering nonlocality, atomistic inhomogeneity or local field effect, and finite photon frequency [21, 22, 23]. These calculations have allowed the numerical investigation of optical properties of crystals including optical measurements and electron energy loss spectra, but mostly limited to macroscopic properties and at the optical limit. Recent investigations on the atomistic electrodynamics inside crystals incorporate microscopic [24] and multiple-scattering optical responses [25]. Along these lines, the concept of deep microscopic optical waves in crystals at finite photon momentum and the relevant software Purdue-PicoMax is under development [26]. In this work, we investigate the optical responses and hidden polarization waves of SiC in the atomistic nonlocal regime, where the nonlocal, inhomogeneous, and multiple-scattering optical responses are considered (Fig. 1b). We introduce the deep microscopic optical band structure of SiC as a quantum generalization of refractive index of the medium. Contrary to the classical refractive index with single-modal nature, multiple-scattering due to atomic inhomogeneities allow multi-modal optical responses [25]. Also, the effective optical response, or the effective screening strength, experienced by an arbitrary field inside the crystal is introduced. This effective screening is obtained by decomposing the field into a set of deep microscopic optical eigenwaves with distinct screening strengths. Our framework provides the fundamental understanding of the refractive index and the light-matter interaction inside crystalline solids. Also, the existence of hidden or dark eigenwaves is predicted, which may exhibit topologically nontrivial properties. As a practical example, we investigate this atomistic photonic eigenwaves in a zincblende semiconductor SiC, which has been widely studied for multiple applications, such as CMOS compatible single-photon quantum sources [27, 28, 29]. Our study of the microscopic optical responses inside semiconductors is crucial for light-emitting applications at the nanoscale and emerging light-based quantum technologies."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10428v1,BICEP/ XIX: Extremely Thin Composite Polymer Vacuum Windows for BICEP and Other High Throughput Millimeter Wave Telescopes,"Millimeter-wave refracting telescopes targeting the degree-scale structure of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have recently grown to diffraction-limited apertures of over 0.5 meters. These instruments are entirely housed in vacuum cryostats to support their sub-kelvin bolometric detectors and to minimize radiative loading from thermal emission due to absorption loss in their transmissive optical elements. The large vacuum window is the only optical element in the system at ambient temperature, and therefore minimizing loss in the window is crucial for maximizing detector sensitivity. This motivates the use of low-loss polymer materials and a window as thin as practicable. However, the window must simultaneously meet the requirement to keep sufficient vacuum, and therefore must limit gas permeation and remain mechanically robust against catastrophic failure under pressure. We report on the development of extremely thin composite polyethylene window technology that meets these goals. Two windows have been deployed for two full observing seasons on the BICEP3 and BA150 CMB telescopes at the South Pole. On BICEP3, the window has demonstrated a 6% improvement in detector sensitivity.","The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is the afterglow from the Big Bang, and as such, is an excellent tool to explore cosmological models (Penzias & Wilson, 1965; Planck Collaboration et al., 2020a). CMB photons—emitted as the opaque primordial plasma cooled into transparent neutral gas—carry information about the conditions of the early universe. The CMB has a near-perfect black body spectrum, ruling out a steady state expanding universe, and the temperature deviations on that spectrum provide strong evidence for the standard model of cosmology, \LambdaCDM (Wright et al., 1994; Spergel et al., 2003; Planck Collaboration et al., 2020a). There remain unresolved questions about the early universe (such as the horizon and flatness problems) that paradigms like Inflation attempt to explain. Currently, several experiments are aiming to constrain the parameters of Inflation by mapping the CMB. A very small excess of primordial “B modes” (curl in the polarization field of the CMB) at degree scales is an expected prediction from Inflation in the early universe (Kamionkowski & Kovetz, 2016). As constraints on cosmological parameters advance, there is a need to improve sensitivity of the telescopes making these measurements. There are broadly two ways to accomplish this: increase detector counts while keeping the per-detector sensitivity the same or decrease the optical loading thus increasing the per-detector sensitivity. These two goals lead to conflicting physical designs. Increasing the detector count requires a larger aperture size, which leads to thicker optical components. Since the optical emission from a component increases with its thickness, larger apertures tend to degrade the per-detector sensitivity. The BICEP/Keck series of experiments are small-aperture on-axis refracting telescopes, designed to optimize high optical throughput at degree scales. This strategy has been successful in placing leading constraints on the millimeter polarized signal at degree scales for the past twenty years (BICEP/Keck Collaboration et al., 2021). Each generation of BICEP/Keck receivers has increased the number of detectors by roughly an order of magnitude: BICEP1 had a 250 mm aperture for 49 detector pairs at 95, 150, and 220 GHz (Takahashi et al., 2010); BICEP2 (150 GHz) and the Keck Array of five receivers (150 GHz, later adding 95, 220 and 270 GHz) had 256 detector pairs each for their 264 mm apertures (BICEP2 Collaboration et al., 2015; Kernasovskiy et al., 2012; Staniszewski et al., 2012); the currently operating BICEP3 (95 GHz) has 1200 detector pairs in a 520 mm aperture (BICEP/Keck Collaboration et al., 2022). A single BICEP Array receiver—the set of receivers currently being deployed which range in frequency from 30 to 300 GHz—has between 100 and 4000 detector pairs (depending on the designed frequency) for a 560 mm aperture (Moncelsi et al., 2020; Schillaci et al., 2023; The BICEP/Keck Collaboration et al., 2024). To accommodate the order of magnitude increase in detector count between the recent stages of BICEP receivers the aperture size of the receivers has doubled from 264 mm to between 520–560 mm (BICEP2 and Keck Array Collaborations et al., 2015; Moncelsi et al., 2020). The readout electronics and transition edge detectors are carefully designed so that the receivers are photon-noise limited. Therefore reducing in-band optical load can have a profound impact on a given BICEP receiver’s per-detector sensitivity. Figure 1: [Left] Modeled optical loading from a window with thicknesses of 1.4 mm, 25.4 mm, and 31.8 mm, at band centers from 30 to 270 GHz (fractional bandwidth of 0.25) through a BICEP-style instrument. Black points are measured optical loading on BICEP3 from a 31.8 mm (1.25”) UHMWPE spare window and the 1.4 mm laminate window deployed on BICEP3 for the 2023 season. Shaded bands are uncertainty on the loss properties of the window, with \tan\delta between 0.6\times 10^{-4} to 2.4\times 10^{-4}. [Right] Modeled relative noise equivalent temperature per detector (NET{}_{\text{det}}) and relative survey time increase compared to an instrument without a window, for each of the BICEP Array observing band center frequencies. The in-band radiative load emitted by the optical elements is the product of their absorptive loss and physical temperature. The absorption loss of a material is directly related to the complex permittivity (\varepsilon=\varepsilon^{\prime}-i\varepsilon^{\prime\prime}) of a material. Absorption is discussed numerically throughout this paper as a material’s loss tangent, which is the ratio of the real part over the complex part of the permittivity, denoted as \tan\delta. The permittivity of a material varies with temperature, and the \tan\delta at millimeter wavelengths of many polymers decreases with cryogenic cooling, reducing the absorption and emission of a polymer optic in-band (Frank et al., 1977; Schnabel, 2014). However, the reduction in optical emission at lower temperature is driven primarily by the lower physical temperature rather than the lower loss (Lamb, 1996). The entire instrument is placed within a vacuum cryostat to cool both the optics and the sub-kelvin detectors. However, the cryostat obviously requires a transmissive window to observe external signals, which must remain in contact with the ambient environment. Vacuum windows must have low transmission loss in band and be strong enough to withstand the force of atmospheric pressure. Previously, millimeter-wave vacuum windows have been made of ceramics [such as fused-silica (Datta et al., 2021)], plastic foams [including various formulations of Zotefoam (BICEP2 and Keck Array Collaborations et al., 2015)], or bulk plastic materials [primarily high density polyethylene (HDPE) or ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) (BICEP/Keck Collaboration et al., 2022; D’Alessandro et al., 2018)]. A more detailed history of the development of millimeter vacuum windows can be found in Barkats et al. (2018). The larger aperture sizes of modern CMB receivers, however, limit the materials available for use. BICEP3 and BICEP Array have nominal clear apertures at the window of 730 mm, while the full outer diameter of the window is 900 mm. Current plans for the CMB-Stage 4 Small Aperture Telescopes (SATs) and Large Aperture Telescope (LATs) include similarly sized windows (Abazajian et al., 2019). Ceramics become prohibitively expensive at those scales. Plastic foams would become impracticably thick and lossy: the primary advantage of the foam windows are their low index of refraction and low transmission loss, but they have the disadvantage of being very weak. A suitably thick foam window would include many laminated layers, which would make their loss properties significantly worse. For example, the 150 GHz Keck receiver windows were 120 mm thick and estimated to cause \lesssim2% transmission loss (BICEP2 and Keck Array Collaborations et al., 2015); the doubled aperture size for new BICEP receivers would require a foam window four times thicker. A window with such high transmission loss (\lesssim8%) would add approximately 3 pW optical load to a 150 GHz detector, swamping out all other sources of optical power at that frequency. Bulk plastics, being relatively weak though still stronger than plastic foams, must also become significantly thicker to maintain a suitable safety factor for a vacuum vessel (discussed further in Section 2.2). For BICEP3, a 95 GHz receiver, we previously estimated that over half of the instrument loading originated from the 31.8 mm thick HDPE slab window (BICEP/Keck Collaboration et al., 2022). That window has since been replaced by the thin window presented in this paper. In Figure 1 we model the optical loading on a large aperture BICEP-style receiver for six observed bands and different window thicknesses. We also show the relative change in per-detector white noise and survey time for different window thicknesses. For the lowest frequency band, at 30–40 GHz, decreasing the window thickness only yields marginal improvements in white noise and mapping speed. For bands above 40 GHz, however, a substantial reduction in window thickness from the nominal could potentially decrease noise by tens of percent. At the high frequencies in the 270 GHz band, such a window thickness reduction could potentially decrease the survey time by as much as 50%. The window is the only element in the optical chain where improvement would produce such a significant return, primarily due to the window’s relatively high temperature. We have achieved an order of magnitude reduction in window thickness using a special form of polyethylene we call high modulus polyethylene (HMPE, commercial name Dyneema (Dyneema, 2008) or Spectra) laminated with low density polyethylene (LDPE) to generated a polyethylene composite material. The high strength of the HMPE allows for thicknesses of around a millimeter, in the same range as the wavelength of light we are observing, which will become relevant for the optical properties of the window. The LDPE melts at lower temperature than the HMPE, allowing for the laminating material to fully surround the HMPE fibers without compromising the strength carrier’s integrity (Vasile, 2005; Eiben et al., 2022). Because the composite is entirely polyethylene, we expect the window to appear homogeneous to millimeter light, and therefore have similar optical properties—such as index of refraction, loss and scattering—as standard bulk polyethylene. As of 2024, we have deployed two thin laminate windows on BICEP/Keck receivers; one as a retrofit on the 95 GHz BICEP3 and one on the new 150 GHz BICEP Array receiver (hereafter BA150). Section 2 of this paper discusses the design considerations and mechanical tests for these windows. Section 3 explores in-lab validation of optical properties such as polarization and anti-reflection. Section 4 reviews optical characterizations performed on the deployed window before and after installation on BICEP3. We then conclude with final thoughts and next steps."

Unlike the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) theory, our approach does not rely on the isotropy hypothesis, which assumes uniform field intensity across scattering channels. As a result, it accurately predicts the transmission eigenvalue distribution both in the diffusive and quasiballistic regime. In addition, it proves to be more versatile than the DMPK theory, allowing for the incorporation of physical effects such as absorption or partial channel control with minimal adjustments to the formalism. Although these effects are commonly encountered in experiments on complex media, until now there has been no ab initio theory addressing them. Our predictions are numerically validated against transmission eigenvalue distributions computed from the microscopic wave equation.","References Mosk et al. [2012] A. P. Mosk, A. Lagendijk, G.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10355v1,Transmission eigenvalue distribution in disordered media from anisotropic field theory,"A field theory for the distribution of transmission eigenvalues through a disordered medium is developed in details. The central equation of this theory is a self-consistent transport equation for a \displaystyle 2\times 2 matrix radiance. This equation determines the transmission eigenvalue distribution not only in the diffusive regime but also in the quasiballistic regime, where the radiance is expected to be significantly anisotropic in the material bulk. We show that the matrix transport equation can be solved analytically in this regime. We also show that, in addition to the finite-width waveguide, our equation is able to predict the transmission eigenvalue distribution through an infinite slab.","The theoretical study of wave propagation in disordered media is crucial in fields ranging from optical and acoustical imaging to electron transport in mesoscopic conductors [1, 2, 3]. Among the analysis tools, the transmission matrix \displaystyle\mathsf{t}, which links input and output channels, provides detailed insights into coherent wave propagation through disordered materials. In particular, the eigendecomposition of \displaystyle\mathsf{t}^{\dagger}\mathsf{t} can be used to optimize the transmitted power by shaping the input wavefront. Indeed, the eigenvalues of \displaystyle\mathsf{t}^{\dagger}\mathsf{t}, which range from \displaystyle 0 to \displaystyle 1, represent the transmission probabilities of corresponding eigenmodes. Remarkably, in the diffusive regime, the distribution of these eigenvalues follows the bimodal law, \displaystyle\rho(T)=\bar{T}/(2T\sqrt{1-T}), \displaystyle\bar{T} being the mean transmission [4, 5, 6, 7]. The existence of quasitransparent channels (with \displaystyle T\simeq 1) as predicted by the bimodal law offers promising prospects for optimizing transmitted power, even in media much thicker than the scattering mean free path [8, 9]. The first theoretical approach addressing the distribution of transmission eigenvalues through a disordered medium is due to Dorokhov [10] later followed by Mello, Pereyra, and Kumar [11]. This approach is based on a perturbative treatment of an infinitesimal slice of disordered medium, and leads to a Fokker-Planck-type equation, known as the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) equation, for the joint distribution of transmission eigenvalues [7]. The DMPK theory has achieved great success due to the elegance of its formalism and the accuracy of its predictions in both the diffusive and the localized regime. However, this theory has a key limitation: it does not rely on a microscopic disorder model but instead relies on simplifying assumptions for the infinitesimal slice. In particular, it assumes that the transmission matrix of each slice is uniformly distributed in the ensemble of complex matrices, with the transmittance drop determined by the ratio of slice thickness to the mean free path. This assumption, often referred to as the isotropy hypothesis [11, 7], distributes flux uniformly across all outgoing channels. This assumption reduces the applicability of the DMPK theory in the quasiballistic regime, yet of great experimental interest. A promising approach to get rid of the isotropy hypothesis and thus regain control over the disorder model is to resort to field theory. Historically, this field-theoretical approach emerged in the late 1970s with the works of Wegner and Schäfer [12, 13] who were inspired by popular ideas at the time to address coherent electron transport in disordered conductors [14, 15, 16, 17]. This approach was later given a supersymmetric sector by Larkin and Efetov [18, 19, 20, 21] to include Anderson localization effects. The same authors pointed out [22] an interesting analogy between the field theory of disordered media and a similar approach used in nonequilibrium superconductivity. This approach goes back to the beginning of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory [23] when Gorkov [24, *Gorkov1959a, *Gorkov1959b], Eilenberger [27, 28], Usadel [29], Eliashberg [30], Larkin and Ovchinnikov [31, *Larkin1973, *Larkin1975, *Larkin1977] developed kinetic equations to describe type-II superconductors. In these latter, the disorder caused by impurities greatly affects superconductivity via the reduction of the superconducting coherence length. In the 1990s, Nazarov showed [35] that this analogy with superconductivity can be successfully exploited to determine the transmission eigenvalue distribution through a disordered conductor. His derivation of the bimodal law via field theory is an important result in the literature on complex systems and served as the basis for the formulation of his circuit theory [36, 37, 7, 38]. In modern terminology, his theory falls into the class of nonlinear sigma models [39, 40], and is therefore limited to the diffusive regime where the isotropy hypothesis holds. In this paper, we develop a field theory inspired by Nazarov’s technique but free from the isotropy hypothesis and thus valid in the quasiballistic regime. Our main result is a matrix transport equation very similar to the Eilenberger equation of superconductivity [28, 31, *Larkin1973, *Larkin1975, *Larkin1977, 29, 30, 41, 42, 38]. Using this theory, we obtain an analytical solution in the quasiballistic regime revealing the significant influence of the transverse boundary conditions on the transmission eigenvalue distribution. We also show that this theory unlocks the limit of infinitely wide waveguide which is not numerically tractable by other means. This theory is further extended in the Letter [43] to include other physical effects such as absorption [44] and partial channel control [45, 9]. This paper is organized as follows. The field theory for the transmission eigenvalue distribution is derived step by step in Sec. II. The relationship between this theory and the nonlinear sigma model is discussed in Appendix A. In Sec. III.1 and Appendix B, it is shown that the matrix field, the main variable of the theory, slowly varies at the wavelength scale, thereby making the semiclassical approximation of Sec. III.2 relevant. The result of this approximation is an Eilenberger-type matrix transport equation derived in Sec. III.2. The boundary conditions of this equation are obtained in Sec. III.3. The analytical solution in the quasiballistic regime is derived in Sec. III.4. Numerical results are presented in Sec. IV. The matrix transport equation is solved numerically in two geometries, the waveguide in Sec. IV.2 and the infinite slab in Sec. IV.3, using the integration method of Appendix C.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10211v1,Mixing High Harmonic Generation and X-ray Second Harmonic Generation,"We theoretically demonstrate the mixing of laser-driven high harmonic generation (HHG) and x-ray second harmonic generation (SHG) in gas-phase atoms, highlighting its potential as a powerful spectroscopic tool for studying atomic and molecular systems. Our simulations confirm the generation of HHG with x-ray SHG (HHG-XSHG) from atomic core electrons through the rescattering of electrons from x-ray two-photon excitation and subsequent tunneling ionization in an optical laser field. The resulting HHG-XSHG spectrum features a broadband multi-peak structure and a distinct spectral cutoff in the x-ray regime. These findings indicate that HHG-XSHG is a valuable technique for probing core-electron dynamics, generating attosecond x-ray pulses, and exploring nonlinear interactions, effectively merging laser-driven attosecond technology with nonlinear x-ray methodologies provided by x-ray free-electron lasers.","Attosecond technology based on laser-driven high harmonic generation (HHG) has emerged as a powerful tool due to its attosecond temporal resolution [1]. Over the past decades, it has demonstrated numerous applications in gas-phase atomic, molecular physics, and condensed matter studies [2, 3]. However, one limitation of laser-driven HHG sources is the restricted photon energy due to low conversion efficiency in the x-ray regime. This limitation has urged the development of methods to extend the capabilities of HHG in the x-ray regime, where higher photon energies can offer deeper insights into core-electron dynamics and other fundamental processes. Simultaneously, the advent of x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) has revolutionized nonlinear spectroscopy, including second harmonic generation (SHG), by extending these techniques into the x-ray regime. XFELs offer unprecedented opportunities for material characterization with atomic precision, enabling the probing of core-level electronic transitions and providing element-specific information with atomic-scale spatial resolution [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 6, 9, 10]. This breakthrough has paved the way for studying complex systems, including nanostructures, multilayered materials, and materials with strong electron correlations and magnetic properties. The intense pulses from XFELs further facilitate the investigation of nonlinear interactions and higher-order effects, positioning x-ray SHG as a transformative approach for advancing research in material science, condensed matter physics, and nanotechnology. Since the invention of the laser, second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy and microscopy have evolved into highly sensitive nonlinear optical techniques extensively used for material studies [11]. By converting incident light into a new frequency that is double the original, SHG offers a sensitive means of probing surfaces, interfaces, and non-centrosymmetric systems inherently lacking inversion symmetry. SHG has found broad application across diverse fields, including surface science, biological imaging, and the characterization of nonlinear materials [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Moreover, time-resolved SHG techniques with ultrafast temporal resolution provide vital insights into rapid dynamical processes, making them indispensable for studying ultrafast structural changes and dynamics [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. However, achieving x-ray SHG in randomly oriented gas-phase atoms and molecules poses significant challenges due to the lack of global inversion symmetry. As a second-order nonlinear process, SHG is forbidden in centrosymmetric environments [11], and there have been no experimental reports of x-ray SHG in such systems. To address these limitations in HHG and x-ray SHG, we propose a method that combines laser-driven HHG with x-ray SHG (HHG-XSHG). This HHG-XSHG method uses an intense optical laser field along with an x-ray pulse to interact with core electrons in an atom, as illustrated in Fig. 1. This combined external field enables nonlinear interactions, facilitating the generation of HHG-XSHG. The optical laser perturbs the electron cloud populated through x-ray two-photon excitation, creating transient dipoles that allow the recombination of the electron with the core hole, thereby enabling HHG-XSHG. This approach extends the potential of HHG and nonlinear x-ray spectroscopy, enabling x-ray SHG in gas-phase systems where it was previously unfeasible. Figure 1: Schematic of the HHG-XSHG process. The 1s core electron of an atom is excited to an unoccupied ns state through the absorption of two x-ray photons. The electron in the ns state is driven by a near-infrared laser field, which enables recombination back to the 1s state, resulting in the emission of a photon with energy approximately twice that of the incoming x-ray photons. In this work, we simulate the HHG-XSHG process using the single active core electron approximation by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. To enhance the HHG-XSHG signal, we leverage a two-photon excitation resonance, where two x-ray photons excite the system from a core-level state to a valence state. By tuning the x-ray photon energy to match a core-to-valence transition, we significantly enhance the nonlinear interaction, leading to a substantial increase the generation efficiency of HHG in the x-ray regime. This resonant enhancement not only boosts the HHG-XSHG signal but also provides valuable insights into core-electron dynamics and ultrafast processes in gas-phase atoms and molecules."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10021v1,Measurement and feedforward correction of the fast phase noise of lasers,"Lasers are the workhorse of quantum engineering in the atomic-molecular-optic community. However, phase noise of the laser, which can be especially large in popular semiconductor-based lasers, can limit gate fidelity. Here, we present a fully-fiberized instrument detecting and correcting the fast, sub-microsecond, phase fluctuations of lasers. We demonstrate a measurement noise floor of less than 0.1 Hz2/Hz, and a noise suppression of more than 20 dB for Fourier frequencies in the 1 to 10 MHz region (reaching up to 30 dB at 3 MHz), where noise is critical for Rydberg-based quantum gates. Finally, we observe the improvement offered by this fast phase noise eater on a Raman transition driven by two such stabilized lasers. These measurement and correction techniques are important tools for high-fidelity manipulation of the excited electronic states of atoms and molecules.","Over recent decades, quantum simulation and computation have advanced considerably across platforms, including trapped ions [1, 2], superconducting qubits [3], photonic qubits [4], and cold atoms [5]. To ensure accurate outcomes of the machine, high-fidelity coherent control is crucial for each platform [6, 7, 8, 9]. While external factors often introduce decoherence, the control mechanisms themselves can also inadvertently contribute. Specifically, in neutral-atom or trapped-ion systems, where laser-driven dynamics of a valence electron play a central role, employing highly stable lasers is crucial. Focusing on the problem of driving transition of neutral atoms to Rydberg states, the dominant decoherence sources [10, 8, 11] include the Doppler effect, spontaneous emissions via the intermediate state used for the two-photon excitation, and laser intensity and phase noise [12, 13]—the latter being the focal point of this article. Intuitively, the laser phase needs to be stable on a timescale of 0.1 to 1 microsecond during which the electron is manipulated (literally, shaken) by the laser field. A naive, but illustrative, requirement to suppress the error of a laser-driven quantum gate at the 10^{-3} level (0.1 %) would be to ask for less than \phi_{\rm rms}=(2\pi)\times 10^{-3}=6 mrad of phase fluctuation in 1 microsecond. Assuming white frequency noise, this translates to a power spectral density (PSD) of phase noise S_{\phi}(f)=\phi_{\rm rms}^{2}/f=4\times 10^{-11} rad2/Hz at Fourier frequency f=1 MHz, or equivalently a white frequency noise of S_{\nu}(f)=f^{2}S_{\phi}(f)=40 Hz2/Hz. In fact, driven systems are more robust than this simple estimate, and recent analysis indicate that, at such level of PSD, error of manipulation are already suppress at the 0.01 % level [14, 11]. While sources of electromagnetic radiation in the microwave domain can easily pass such phase noise requirements, this can be harder to achieve with lasers, often for fundamental reasons (the Schawlow-Townes limit). The best performers are bulk-cavity solid-state lasers (TiSapph, Nd:YAG, …), with well below 1 Hz2/Hz at MHz Fourier frequencies, thanks to their narrow-linewidth cavity design, thus offering highly-stable drives already appreciated by the Rydberg-atom community [15, 16]. But they pose other challenges in terms of wavelength coverage, as well as size and cost (SWaP-C). A popular alternative are semiconductor-based lasers, displaying a much wider coverage and high-level of integration. However, these lasers have a large quantum-limited frequency noise floor (10^{6} Hz2/Hz, for a basic Fabry-Perot design). While this can be mitigated by more advanced architecture, such as with extended-cavity diode lasers (ECDLs), their noise level (10^{2}-10^{4} Hz2/Hz) are still too large. Promisingly, novel designs that recently reached commercialization — based on vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting laser (VECSEL) [17, 18], or self-injection-locked (SIL) laser diodes [19, 20] —, could pass the requirement. Easily measuring the frequency noise of such lasers is a first motivation of this work. Alternatively, the phase noise of a laser can be suppressed externally. A first solution is to pass the laser through a passive filter realized with a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity[21, 22], which demonstrated great improvements [13]. A drawback of this approach is the limited output power and tunability. Another approach is to actively correct the laser’s phase. There, feedback correction on the laser diode current or cavity length is commonly employed, and is hugely successful for suppressing slower technical noise from acoustic fluctuations or thermal drifts. However, this fails at suppressing the fast, sub-microsecond, phase fluctuation of interest here. The finite travel time of information around the feedback loop sets a maximum correction bandwidth of a few MHz [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. This limitation can be evaded if the correction is not fed back to the laser, but rather fed forward to a phase actuator [29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. Correcting the fast phase noise with a feedforward approach is the second aspect of this work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09965v1,A reconfigurable non-linear active metasurface for coherent wave down-conversion,"Metasurfaces can manipulate the amplitude and phase of electromagnetic waves, offering applications ranging from antenna design and cloaking to imaging and communication. Additionally, temporal, and non-linear metasurfaces have the potential to adjust the frequency of impinging waves, driving advancements in frequency conversion, sensing, and quantum systems. Here, we report the demonstration of a non-linear active electronic-photonic metasurface that transfers information from an impinging optical wave to a millimeter-wave (mm-wave) beam. The proof-of-concept metasurface is designed to radiate a steerable 28GHz beam when illuminated with an optical wave at 193THz and consists of optically synchronized electronic-photonic chips tiled on a printed circuit board containing a microstrip patch antenna array. Input light, modulated with a data-encoded mm-wave carrier, is coupled into electronic-photonic chips using microlenses. Within each chip, the mm-wave signal is detected, phase-adjusted, amplified, and routed to an off-chip antenna. Beam-steering over a range of 60∘ in elevation and azimuth and data transmission at 2Gb/s over a fiber-wireless link is demonstrated. Free-space optical synchronization can significantly reduce the complexity of large-scale metasurfaces composed of non-uniform or randomly placed elements, is compatible with scalable architectures, and facilitates data transfer and mm-wave beam shaping, allowing for large-scale high-bandwidth and energy-efficient links with reduced complexity for the next generation communication, computation, sensing and quantum systems.","Metasurfaces are two-dimensional planar structures with subwavelength constituent components that have been arranged periodically, quasi-periodically, or even randomly[1]. These engineered structures have often been used to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves in compelling ways, consequently facilitating innovations in optics[2, 3, 4, 5], communication[6, 7, 8], computation[9, 10, 11], and various other diverse fields[12, 13, 14]. Compared to their bulk counterparts, metasurfaces are much thinner, easier to fabricate, and highly scalable, enabling compact integration for photonic and electronic systems. The main utility of metasurfaces stems from their ability to control various properties of impinging EM waves including amplitude, phase, polarization, and momentum[1, 15]. Moreover, these structures can be designed to exhibit strong nonlinearity either through field enhancement and localization effects, predominantly observed in the optical domain[16], or by embedding a non-linear element such as a varactor[17, 18] which is commonly used in the microwave regime. This versatility makes metasurfaces appealing for diverse applications, spanning from frequency conversion and harmonic generation[19] to non-linear imaging, holography[2, 20], non-linear sensing[21], and quantum systems[22, 23]. In programmable and reconfigurable metasurfaces[24, 25], the surface properties can be actively tuned allowing for real-time adjustments of the incident EM wave properties and control over the radiation pattern of the scattered wave. This capability has sparked new paradigms in sensing[26, 27], computation[9], computational imaging[28, 29], and adaptive optics[30]. RF wireless communication is another promising avenue for such structures[31]. To date, numerous technologies with functionalities such as multi-beam communication[7] and beam scanning[32], which are frequently discussed for next-generation wireless systems, have been devised and demonstrated all while benefitting from simplified architectures, lower hardware costs, and reduced complexities. Like metasurfaces, phased array antenna systems can be used to shape the wavefront of electromagnetic waves and wirelessly transmit data. While the radiated beam in metasurfaces is formed through manipulation of an input impinging electromagnetic waves, phased array antennas require the distribution of a reference signal to time/phase synchronize the array elements in order to form a coherent beam. For such systems, element synchronization becomes more difficult due to the challenges of routing high-frequency electrical interconnects at the package and board level. Crosstalk, EM interference, ohmic and substrate losses, and increased power consumption (due to the required buffering) are some of the issues that can contribute to performance deterioration. With the ever-increasing data rate and speed requirements of advanced and emerging communication systems, it is thus more pertinent to design and develop scalable metasurfaces that can operate at high frequencies while also offering reduced complexities and enhanced power efficiencies. On the front of pioneering solutions and concepts for the ubiquitous realization of efficient high-data-rate communication systems, and more recently computation systems as well, the adoption and confluence of both optical and electrical technologies has consistently been regarded as integral[33, 34, 35]. Coupled with the versatility of electronics, photonics may be employed to assist in the generation, distribution, and processing of signals[36, 37, 38]. The large instantaneous bandwidth available around an optical carrier, the immunity to EM interference, and the availability of low-loss optical transmission mediums can all be leveraged to aid system implementation and or attain performance metrics that are inconceivable with traditional all-electronic circuitry. To date, numerous designs with all-optical delay and phase control based on switched fiber delay lines[39], optical dispersion in fiber[40] and fiber gratings[41], and photonic microwave phase shifters[42] have been reported demonstrating photonic beamforming with wide operational bandwidths and enabling capabilities such as remotely-fed fiber-distributed phased array antennas. Though despite their excellent performance, the adoption of these technologies has often been limited given their reliance on discrete, power-hungry, and bulky components. More recently, integrated designs based on switched waveguides[43, 44], ring resonators[45] and Mach–Zehnder delay interferometers[46] aimed at realizing true-time delay lines (TTDL) for photonic beamformation have been devised. Such systems have great potential for scalability and high-yields and moreover can mitigate the issue of beam squint, particularly desirable for broadband phased arrays, but often result in increased complexities and chip area given the use of TTDL elements. Advantageously, for large-span array, long haul applications and or radio-over fiber (RoF) systems[47], the previously described optically enabled schemes may directly interface with existing optical fiber infrastructure. This allows for the distribution of high frequency signals from a central station to a remote antenna unit for remote synchronization[48], beamformation[40] and wireless radiation, essential to support cost-effective, high-capacity links and provide high-speed interconnectivity. In light of these advantages, advancements in hybrid optoelectronic metasurfaces, aimed at realizing hybrid transmitters for wireless communication, have also recently emerged[49, 50]. While these advancements demonstrate significant progress and utility for low-cost and low-complexity solutions, they still fall short in achieving the targeted performance required by multi-Gb/s links compared to, for instance, all-electronic millimeter-wave (mm-wave) phased arrays[51]. In this article, we report the demonstration of a reconfigurable non-linear active metasurface that can radiate a data-carrying, steerable mm-wave beam when illuminated with an optical wave that has been modulated with the data encoded mm-wave signal. More specifically, the metasurface is designed to radiate a mm-wave beam at 28GHz when incident with a modulated optical wave operating around 193THz and is comprised of optically synchronized electronic-photonic chips and a printed circuit board antenna array. To our knowledge, this is the first highly scalable, reconfigurable, low-energy, hybrid non-linear metasurface with demonstrated applications in wavefront front shaping and multi-Gb/s fiber-wireless communication. Free-space optical synchronization of the surface elements eliminates the electrical interconnect network, often utilized in all-electrical phased array antennas, leading to reduction in the overall complexity of the system, size, power consumption and undesired EM coupling and interference. Moreover, it enables the practical implementation of large scale metasurfaces with sparsely or non-uniformly placed elements. Compared to metasurfaces and arrays where the comprising elements are synchronized using fiber interconnects, free-space offers greater flexibility in cases where physical routing may be impractical or undesirable. For such systems with many elements, packaging challenges may also arise when the fiber must be uniformly split and separate cores with equal lengths must be aligned with the various constituent elements. Additionally, fibers aligned and or glued are more fragile and sensitive to tights bends, leading to radiation losses, especially in compact form factors[52]. The implemented proof-of-concept metasurface consists of four electronic-photonic integrated circuit (EPIC) chips, each incorporating a photonic receiver and mm-wave transmitter, fabricated using GlobalFoundries 90nm CMOS silicon photonic process, and a low-cost FR4 printed circuit board with a microstrip patch antenna array. The challenge with free-space synchronization often stems from the fraction of optical power that is converted by the comprising elements. To address this, microlenses are used to focus the impinging light on the grating couplers of the EPICs and enhance the optical coupling into the chips. Photodetectors, integrated on the chips, convert the modulated optical wave - carrying both a millimeter-wave carrier and data - into an electrical current through their second-order (square-law) non-linear operation on the optical electric fields. The recovered data-carrying millimeter-wave signals are subsequently amplified and phase-adjusted by the RF transmitter chains of the EPICs (operating in the linear regime) before being radiated by the antennas. Following this process, by controlling the relative phase of adjacent EPIC elements, millimeter-wave beams that can be actively steered in both elevation and azimuth can be formed in the far-field of the antenna array. Using the implemented metasurface, we demonstrate beam steering with a scanning range of around 60∘ in elevation and azimuth and a fiber to wireless communication link where high-order modulation signal (32-QAM) is transmitted over fiber and wirelessly radiated at 28GHz in various directions achieving data rates as high as 2Gb/s. The presented non-linear reconfigurable active metasurface, which is comprised of optically synchronized electronic-photonic elements, facilitates data transfer and mm-wave beam shaping while being compatible with highly scalable architectures and has the potential to realize energy-efficient, compact links with reduced complexity for the next generation communication, computation, sensing and quantum systems. Fig. 1: General concept of the reconfigurable non-linear active metasurface. The metasurface is comprised of electronic-photonic chips and antenna elements. When illuminated with an optical wave that has been encoded with mm-wave carrier and data signals, the metasurface radiates a data-carrying mm-wave beam which can be scanned in space (GC: grating coupler; PD: photodetector; TIA: trans-impedance amplifier)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09624v1,Photonic frequency multiplexed next-generation reservoir computer,"In this work, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a photonic frequency-multiplexed next generation reservoir computer (FM-NGRC) capable of performing real-time inference at GHz speed. NGRCs apply a feed-forward architecture to produce a feature vector directly from the input data over a fixed number of time steps. This feature vector, analogous to the reservoir state in a conventional RC, is used to perform inference by applying a decision layer trained by linear regression. Photonic NGRC provides a flexible platform for real-time inference by forgoing the need for explicit feedback loops inherent to a physical reservoir. The FM-NGRC introduced here defines the memory structure using an optical frequency comb and dispersive fiber while the sinusoidal response of electro-optic Mach-Zehnder interferometers controls the nonlinear transform applied to elements of the feature vector. A programmable waveshaper modulates each comb tooth independently to apply the trained decision layer weights in the analog domain. We apply the FM-NGRC to solve the benchmark nonlinear channel equalization task; after theoretically determining feature vectors that enable high-accuracy distortion compensation, we construct an FM-NGRC that generates these vectors to experimentally demonstrate real-time channel equalization at 5 GS/s with a symbol error rate of \sim 2\times 10^{-3}.","Recent years have seen dramatic growth in the use of artificial neural networks for research and commercial purposes. Much of this progress has been achieved by improving the industry-standard technology of deep neural networks implemented on graphical processing units (GPUs) [1, 2]. While massive parallelization combined with techniques such as batch processing have driven remarkable growth in the capability of deep neural networks, the inference rate and latency in GPU-based systems remain constrained by digital clock rates. This clock rate limitation makes it challenging to apply conventional GPU-based neural networks in applications requiring continuous, real-time operation on data at >GHz rates, such as high-bandwidth optical communications and RF signal processing. Photonic neural networks, which exploit the large bandwidth and rapid modulation capacity of optical signals, have the potential to overcome this limitation and enable real-time inference at GHz data rates [3]. Photonic reservoir computers (RCs), which specialize in processing time-dependent data, are particularly well-suited for these types of applications [4, 5]. RCs operate by feeding data into a fixed randomly-connected nonlinear feedback loop and training a single readout layer to map the optical signal within the reservoir (the reservoir state) to a desired output via linear regression. The use of a fixed, un-trained feedback loop as the reservoir has enabled a wide variety of photonic implementations, including systems utilizing temporal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34], spatial [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41], and frequency multiplexing [42, 43, 44] to encode reservoir nodes. Achieving ultra-low latency is particularly challenging for time-multiplexed architectures, for which the decision layer for an RC with N nodes requires modulating the virtual nodes N times faster than the desired inference rate [45, 46]. While spatial and frequency-multiplexed RCs avoid this constraint, their speeds are still limited by the round-trip time of the photonic reservoir. Most RCs capable of high-speed operation reduce this round-trip time using passive photonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based cavities. While these PIC-based designs have enabled impressive performance, including 20 GHz inference rates [40], their limited control over the memory structure and nonlinear transform make it challenging to optimize them for different problem types. A newer class of RC forgoes the reservoir feedback in favor of a completely feed-forward design. This design is referred to as either feed-forward RC or next-generation RC (NGRC), following the work of Gauthier et al. [47] which demonstrated comparable performance to standard RC. NGRC operation relies on forming a feature vector by applying a series of linear and nonlinear transformations to the input data at a fixed set of consecutive delays. This feature vector replaces the ""reservoir state"" of a conventional RC and a single trained readout layer is used to map the feature vector to the desired output. To date, photonic NGRCs have been implemented with temporal multiplexing and coherent node mixing via Rayleigh backscattering [48] and spatial multiplexing with coherent node mixing by scattering in a disordered medium [49] or on-chip multimode waveguides [50]. However, none of these designs have performed inference in real-time, relying instead on digitizing the feature vector and applying the decision layer in software. In addition, these initial photonic NGRCs formed feature vectors by a random nonlinear projection of the input data over a fixed number of time steps. While this scheme works well for a variety of data analysis tasks, it is unlikely to be the most efficient design because many nodes provide redundant information and the nonlinear transformation cannot be optimized for the task at hand. This random-mixing approach does not take advantage of a major strength of NGRC, which is the ability to tailor the feature vector for a given problem in a readily-interpretable manner [47]. In this work, we introduce a photonic frequency multiplexed NGRC (FM-NGRC) capable of real-time inference at GHz data rates using an analog decision layer. We also demonstrate how the FM-NGRC feature vector can be tailored to match the requirements of a given task. The FM-NGRC operates by encoding input data onto lines of an optical frequency comb and passively generating consecutive time delays using optical dispersion. Data in the RF electronic domain is encoded onto optical carriers using Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulators (EOMs), exploiting the inherent sinusoidal modulator response function to generate polynomial-like nonlinear transformations of the input data. By varying the EOM bias points, we can adjust the nature of the nonlinear transform to match the needs of a specific task. The memory is controlled by adjusting the number of frequency comb teeth and the amount of optical dispersion. Crucially, the decision layer can be implemented in the analog photonic domain using a programmable waveshaper (WS) to apply separate weights to each comb tooth. As an initial demonstration, we apply the FM-NGRC to the benchmark channel equalization task [4, 51, 7, 12, 46, 13, 52, 53, 19, 20, 54, 42, 55, 43, 56, 34]. This task requires the FM-NGRC to undo the effects of a channel with intersymbol interference, nonlinear distortion and additive Gaussian noise. The symbol error rate (SER) of the equalized data serves as the performance metric. We first provide a theoretical basis for the system operation, deriving the form of a feature vector suitable for the channel equalization problem. We then experimentally construct an FM-NGRC following this design, demonstrating real-time channel equalization at 5 GS/s with a symbol error rate of \sim 2\times 10^{-3}."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09165v1,Solving the Inverse Band-Structure Problem for Photonic Crystals,"We present a symmetry-agnostic topology optimization framework for photonic-crystal structures based on computation of the photonic density of states in a manner analogous to \Gamma-point integration. We provide a generalization of the approach that allows for computations at different scales with the additional scales being analogous to integration over the full Brillouin zone and to regimes between the two limiting cases of full Brillouin-zone integration and \Gamma-point integration, though these other scales do not preserve the symmetry-agnostic nature of the \Gamma-point framework. We also demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to the problem of inverting photonic or phononic bandstructures. Finally, we show that at the symmetry-agnostic scale analogous to \Gamma-point integration, we can recover a known two-dimensional photonic crystal for the TM polarization. A key insight of our work is the determination of the minimum supercell size and the minimum precision to which the frequencies within the photonic bandgap must be sampled in order to observe photonic-crystal structures.","Results Photonic-crystal convergence as a function of system size We now present results for two-dimensional structures supporting photonic bandgaps for the transverse magnetic (TM) polarization that were obtained by suppressing the photonic density of states of the structures over a frequency window \Delta\omega with a central frequency \omega_{0}, where the photonic density of states is computed in a manner analogous to \Gamma-point integration. For all TM calculations, we assigned the values \omega_{0}=0.4\cdot 2\pi c/a, \Delta\omega=\omega_{0}/10, \mu(\mathbf{r})=\mu_{0} for the permeability, and allowed the permittivity \epsilon(\mathbf{r}) to vary between \epsilon_{0} and 8.9\epsilon_{0} for comparison with the structures found in Ref. Joannopoulos et al. (2011). The quantities c, \mu_{0}, and \epsilon_{0} are the speed of light, the permeability, and the permittivity for free space, respectively, and we set a=1 since we can treat lengths without dimensions given the scale invariance of Maxwell’s equations Joannopoulos et al. (2011). Convergence of the photonic crystal as a function of the system size and the grid-point resolution (gpr), which is the number of grid points used to resolve a length a=1, is shown for the TM polarization in Fig. 1. By performing a Fourier transform of the structure that was optimized over 5000 iterations for a 10\times 10 design region, a gpr of 100, and N=10, where N is the number of frequencies sampled within the bandgap, we can extract the location of the four highest maxima of the absolute value of the transform that occur at non-trivial positions. We find that these maxima are located at \mathbf{k}_{1}=-8\cdot 2\pi/(10a)\hat{e}_{x}, \mathbf{k}_{2}=8\cdot 2\pi/(10a)\hat{e}_{x}, \mathbf{k}_{3}=8\cdot 2\pi/(10a)\hat{e}_{y}, and \mathbf{k}_{4}=-8\cdot 2\pi/(10a)\hat{e}_{y}. Observing that the real-space structure of the photonic crystal with N=10 and a 10\times 10 design region at 5000 iterations corresponds to dielectric columns/rods, we can extract the radius of these rods by summing the absolute value of the Fourier transform at the locations \mathbf{k}=\mathbf{k}_{1}, \mathbf{k}_{2}, \mathbf{k}_{3}, and \mathbf{k}_{4}, dividing by 8\cdot 8=64 (which is the number of effective unit cells given the location of the maxima of the absolute value of the Fourier transform), dividing by \pi, and then taking the square root. We obtain r=0.24a^{\prime}, where a^{\prime}=\frac{10}{8}a, compared with the value in Ref. Joannopoulos et al. (2011) which was r=0.2\tilde{a} for some lattice constant \tilde{a}. Figure 1: Designs optimized for 5000 iterations and N=10 with TM polarization as a function of the size of the design region and the number of grid points (gpr) used to resolve a length a=1. The color bar indicates the permittivity \epsilon in the various parts of the design region. The convergence as a function of system size can be understood by observing that the Bragg length, which dictates the characteristic length for attenuation of light illuminating a photonic crystal, varies as Hasan et al. (2018); Neve-Oz et al. (2004) L_{B}\approx\frac{d}{\ln\left(\frac{1+\sin\left(\frac{\pi\Delta\omega}{4\omega% _{0}}\right)}{1-\sin\left(\frac{\pi\Delta\omega}{4\omega_{0}}\right)}\right)}% \approx\frac{2d}{\pi}\frac{\omega_{0}}{\Delta\omega}, (1) where \omega_{0} is the central frequency, \Delta\omega is the bandgap or frequency window, as above, and d is the smallest distance for a set of crystal planes. Thus, given d=a^{\prime}=\frac{10}{8}a=\frac{10}{8}\cdot 1=\frac{10}{8} and \frac{\omega_{0}}{\Delta\omega}=\frac{1}{0.1}, we expect a minimum crystal linear dimension of L\gtrsim L_{B}\approx 8 for convergence of the results, in good agreement with the convergence behavior in Fig. 1. Convergence as a function of the number of frequencies, N, sampled within the bandgap We next examine the photonic-crystal convergence behavior as a function of N for TM polarization. As shown in Fig. 2, we find that photonic-crystal behavior is not captured for all N. The location of the crossover point to the final TM photonic-crystal structure can be understood by observing that each sampled frequency \omega_{n}, within the bandgap, is in correspondence with a wavenumber k_{n}=\frac{\omega_{n}}{v}, where v is the speed of light through the given medium. These wavenumbers k_{n} must be able to capture the length scales of all structures in the photonic crystal. In particular, they must be able to capture the length scale corresponding to the periodicity of the photonic crystal. We treat time-harmonic fields so that we can use the rules for addition of sinusoidal functions to deduce that the smallest difference between these k_{n} must be equal to the smallest wavenumber at which a peak is observed in the Fourier transform of the optimized structure. This argument follows from the fact that the function resulting from the sum of sinusoidal functions is a product of an envelope function with frequency equal to the smaller of the difference between or the sum of the frequencies of the original sinusoidal functions and a modulated sinusoidal function with frequency equal to the larger of the difference between or the sum of the frequencies of the original sinusoidal functions. Given a smallest wavenumber k_{\text{min}}=8\cdot 2\pi/(10a), we find a minimum N given by N_{\text{min}}\approx\text{gpr}\cdot\frac{\Delta\omega}{vk_{\text{min}}}\approx 5 for a gpr of 100, \omega_{0}=0.4\cdot 2\pi c/a, \Delta\omega=\omega_{0}/10, and using v\sim c, in good agreement with the results shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2: Designs optimized for 5000 iterations, a gpr of 100, and a 10\times 10 design region as a function of the number of frequencies sampled within the bandgap, N. TM polarization was used. Material permittivity values are as in Fig. 1. Extracting photonic bandstructures As a function of the number of iterations, we also investigate the convergence of the radius r that was computed above at 5000 iterations for the photonic-crystal structure resulting from minimization of the photonic density of states over the frequency window \Delta\omega with central frequency \omega_{0} for a 10\times 10 design region, N=10, and a gpr of 100. The location of the four highest maxima of the absolute value of the Fourier transform occurring at non-trivial positions for the photonic-crystal structures does not change between 1000 and 10000 iterations, We find that between 9000 and 10000 iterations, the relative change in the radius r is less than 0.03%. For the radius obtained at 10000 iterations, which we also found to be r=0.24a^{\prime}, we compute the corresponding bandstructure using the MPB code Johnson and Joannopoulos (2001). Given that the lattice constant in the computation is increased by a factor of \frac{10}{8}, based on the periodicity of the structure that we found compared to a=1, we need to rescale the frequencies we obtain by the factor \frac{10}{8} if we are to use the lattice constant a=1. The bandstructure is shown in Fig. 3. After this rescaling, we find \omega_{0}=0.43\cdot 2\pi c/a and \Delta\omega=0.30\cdot\omega_{0}. The value of \omega_{0} is in good agreement with our input value of \omega_{0}=0.4\cdot 2\pi c/a, which indicates that our optimization procedure is able to target a desired bandgap regime. The value of \Delta\omega obtained is also consistent with our input that requested that the bandgap be at least as large as \omega_{0}/10. Figure 3: The bandstructure obtained from a structure of dielectric rods with radius r=0.24a^{\prime} and permittivity \epsilon=8.9\epsilon_{0} is presented in (a). In (b), we show the convergence of the radius r as a function of the number of iterations for optimization with N=10, a gpr of 100, and a 10\times 10 design region. The photonic-crystal structure obtained at 10000 iterations is shown as the inset in (b). See Fig. 1 for material permittivity values."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09133v1,Computational metaoptics for imaging,"Metasurfaces—ultrathin structures composed of subwavelength optical elements—have revolutionized light manipulation by enabling precise control over electromagnetic waves’ amplitude, phase, polarization, and spectral properties. Concurrently, computational imaging leverages algorithms to reconstruct images from optically processed signals, overcoming limitations of traditional imaging systems. This review explores the synergistic integration of metaoptics and computational imaging, “computational metaoptics,” which combines the physical wavefront shaping ability of metasurfaces with advanced computational algorithms to enhance imaging performance beyond conventional limits. We discuss how computational metaoptics addresses the inherent limitations of single-layer metasurfaces in achieving multifunctionality without compromising efficiency. By treating metasurfaces as physical preconditioners and co-designing them with reconstruction algorithms through end-to-end (inverse) design, it is possible to jointly optimize the optical hardware and computational software. This holistic approach allows for the automatic discovery of optimal metasurface designs and reconstruction methods that significantly improve imaging capabilities. Advanced applications enabled by computational metaoptics are highlighted, including phase imaging and quantum state measurement, which benefit from the metasurfaces’ ability to manipulate complex light fields and the computational algorithms’ capacity to reconstruct high-dimensional information. We also examine performance evaluation challenges, emphasizing the need for new metrics that account for the combined optical and computational nature of these systems. Finally, we identify new frontiers in computational metaoptics which point toward a future where computational metaoptics may play a central role in advancing imaging science and technology.","All imaging systems rely on a combination of optical hardware – that routes photons from a scene onto a detector – and software – that processes the measured signal to generate an image. Both components have been the topic of constant innovation over the past few decades. On the hardware side, metasurfaces – subwavelength arrays of nanostructured optical elements – have revolutionized the field of nanophotonics in the past decade kuznetsov2024roadmap ; yu2014flat ; khorasaninejad2016metalenses ; yu2011light ; genevet2017recent ; khorasaninejad2017metalenses ; arbabi2015dielectric . Metasurfaces allow the control of virtually all properties of an incident electromagnetic wave at the nanoscale, such as its polarization, spectral, and angular distribution (Fig. 1b). The development of integrated nonlinear material platforms has also enabled frequency conversion and quantum optical state generation with metasurfaces li2017nonlinear ; Wang2022metasurfaces ; solntsev2021metasurfaces . On the software side, computational imaging is an interdisciplinary field that combines elements of computer science, optics, signal processing, and imaging technologies to enhance the quality and capabilities of imaging systems. By using algorithms to process and interpret data captured by sensors, computational imaging extends beyond the limitations of optics-only approaches, enabling applications such as high-resolution imaging, volumetric, depth imaging, and advanced object recognition. A foundational aspect of computational imaging is the use of computational methods to reconstruct images from data that may be incomplete, noisy, or otherwise imperfect (some examples shown in Fig. 1c). This approach can involve numerical methods in machine learning, inverse problems, and optimization bertero2021introduction ; donoho2006compressed ; barbastathis2019use . Recent works have explored the fruitful intersection between metaoptics and computational imaging lin2021end ; lin2022end ; huang2022fullcolor ; saragadam2024foveated ; whitehead2022fast ; colburn2018metasurface ; li2024singleshot . This Perspective aims at highlighting this novel and exciting direction for metasurface research which also represents a paradigm shifting opportunity for imaging and sensing technologies. But why is there a natural “marriage” between metaoptics and computational imaging? We focus on four key arguments to answer this question below: (1) the performance of multifunctional metasurfaces will inevitably reach a ceiling. While single-layer metasurfaces are now able to process multiple spectral, polarization, and momentum degrees of freedom, integrating multiple functionalities in a single device is usually done at the price of key performance metrics (e.g., focusing efficiency, Strehl ratio, etc.). An alternative solution is to stack multiple layers of metasurfaces to lift the limitations of single layers while conserving a compact form factor. For instance, realizing the same amount of functionality as a conventional plan achromatic objective requires a dozen such layers lin2021computational . Proof-of-concept experiments with few layers have been realized at telecom wavelengths zhou2018multilayer ; roques2022toward , and with volumetric designs at longer wavelengths camayd2020multifunctional ; roberts20233d ; ballew2023multi , but realizing nanoscale volumetric patterning at optical frequencies remains an incredible technical challenge; (2) many iterative algorithms already used in computational imaging rely on numerical preconditioners that transform the input to facilitate the task of a reconstruction problem saad2003iterative . Metasurfaces are physical preconditioners that can implement simple computational imaging tasks in the optical domain long2021isotropic ; abdollahramezani2020meta ; pors2015analog ; cordaro2023solving ; koenderink2015nanophotonics ; kwon2018nonlocal . In other words, metasurfaces preprocess the light field from a scene incident on a detector, whose signal is input to a numerical image-reconstruction task. Optimization of metasurface designs even allows the automatic discovery of optimal preconditioners that do not require human specification. Moreover, we argue that synergetic endeavors between metaoptics and computational imaging are natural and effortless: (3) any practical imaging application relies on a digital detector whose signal is processed by a computing unit. The use of software for denoising, signal processing, and segmentation is already pervasive, and significant effort has been invested in making application-specific computing units (such as graphics processing units, field programmable gate arrays, and image signal processors owens2007survey ; bailey2023design ; nakamura2017image ) to match the bandwidth and energy requirements of image processing tasks; (4) while optimization is already prevalent in image processing, automatic discovery of optimal metasurface designs (with methods such as inverse design, topology optimization, and surrogate models jensen2011topology ; molesky2018inverse ; pestourie2018inverse ) has permeated the field of metaoptics. Computational metaoptic imaging can therefore rely on the natural co-integration of optimization methods from computational imaging and metaoptics design. This Perspective aims at providing a comprehensive exploration of computational imaging empowered by metaoptics. We begin by revisiting the foundational principles of computational imaging with metasurfaces, underscoring their unique advantages over traditional lens-based systems. We then delve into the end-to-end (inverse) design of computational metaoptics, highlighting how the seamless co-design of hardware and software through gradient backpropagation can lead to superior imaging performance. Our discussion extends to advanced applications enabled by this approach, including phase imaging and quantum photonic state measurement. We also address the challenges of performance evaluation specific to computational metaoptics, proposing suitable metrics for assessing these systems that combine hardware and software. Finally, we outline new frontiers in the field, pointing toward future research directions and opportunities in this rapidly evolving domain. Figure 1: Computational imaging with metaoptics: degrees of freedom, physics, and algorithms. a. The general goal of a computational imaging device is to reconstruct various degrees of freedom of an incident light field, for instance its polarization, frequency, momentum, and complex amplitude distribution. Advanced degrees of freedom (e.g., density matrix of the quantum state of light) may also be of interest. b. Light manipulation is realized by leveraging physical properties of metaoptical devices, such as their ability to locally control the complex amplitude of an incoming wavefront, engineered spectral dispersion, non-locality (spatial dispersion), active control of physical properties (e.g., complex transmission), and nonlinear optical properties. c. Once imaged by a detector, the signal may be reconstructed using various reconstruction and estimation methods, such as least-square error minimization (which may include priors on the reconstructed degrees of freedom, such as high sparsity or low complexity). Black-box methods, such as fully connected neural networks, may also be utilized to classify detected signals and images. Other parameter estimation methods, such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) may also be used to estimate the degrees of freedom of the incident light field."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09071v2,Enhanced sensitivity of sub-THz thermomechanical bolometers exploiting vibrational nonlinearity,"A common approach to detecting weak signals or minute quantities involves leveraging on the localized spectral features of resonant modes, where sharper lines (i.e. high Q-factors) enhance transduction sensitivity. However, maximizing the Q-factor often introduced technical challenges in fabrication and design. In this work, we propose an alternative strategy to achieve sharper spectral features by using interference and nonlinearity, all while maintaining a constant dissipation rate. Using far-infrared thermomechanical detectors as a test case, we demonstrate that signal transduction along an engineered response curve slope effectively reduces the detector’s noise equivalent power (NEP). This method, combined with an optimized absorbing layer, achieves sub-pW NEP for electrical read-out detectors operating in the sub-THz range.","Transducer-based sensing – relying on the conversion of energy from one form (the measured quantity) to another (read-out signal) – strongly benefits from spectrally sharp transfer functions, as large derivatives translates into large responsivities. The usual route for optimizing the transfer functions relies on devising resonant elements with low energy loss rates; this manifests into narrow linewidths (large Q-factors) and leads to large sensitivities, which have been widely and successfully employed among the others in mass [1], aerostatic pressure [2], gas [3], temperature [4], polarization state [5] and refractive index [6] sensing. Increasing the Q-factors of nano- and micro-metric sized detectors, whose footprint is suitable for integration in electronic systems, represents a significant technological challenge, both in terms of design and fabrication. Notewhorty, an intense research has recently led to ultra-high Q-factors (exceeding one billion) in micromechanical resonators oscillating at frequencies from hundreds of kHz to MHz, obtained through soft clamping and dissipation dilution design as well as careful fabrication [7, 8, 9, 10]. Although impressive, reaching consistently these values in commercially compatible processes remains a significant challenge: device imperfections or intrinsic physical effects often create bottlenecks, ultimately limiting the maximum sensitivity of commercial devices, which routinely have Q-factor ranging around 104-105. A different, interesting route to obtain sharp features in the transfer functions relies on manipulating the resonant lineshape, creating steeper edges while mantaining the same energy loss rate. To this end, Fano-induced asymmetry has been used for sensing enhancement, showing promising results for gas [11, 12, 13], refractive index [14, 15] and temperature [16] sensing. Improvements based on exploiting Fano lineshapes are still restricted by the limited manipulation of the Fano factor, which usually depends on the coupling between a broad and a narrow linewidth cavity system [17]. Moreover, the maximum slope of a Fano response function is still connected to the resonator’s Q-factor. This further limit can be surpassed by taking advantage of the intrinsic device nonlinearities, which can produce massive linewidth deformations (foldover effect [18]) or lead to multistability[19], with internal transitions between stable solutions leading to, in principle, “infinitely sharp” spectral features. These concepts have been successfully implemented in several systems including superconductor [20] and semiconductor [21, 22] based single photon detectors. They also have focused applications in micromechanical systems, including mass sensors monitoring the shift of nonlinear resonant frequencies [23, 24], “threshold-based” sensors exploiting bifurcation phenomena for mass [25, 26] and gas [27, 28] limit detection, as well as more structured platforms exploiting exceptional points [29]. In this paper, we show how nonlinear transduction sensing can be employed to enhance the characteristics of far-infrared light detectors based on thermo-mechanical bolometers (TMBs). TMBs have recently emerged as a powerful technology which offers broadband detection at room-temperature, with single-pixel operation at video-rate and faster [30, 31, 32, 33, 34] and the possibility of scaling up the system to focal plane arrays for multiplexed imaging applications [35, 36]. The best TMB devices have a noise-equivalent power (NEP) in a range from a few \mathrm{pW/\sqrt{Hz}} level, to less than \mathrm{100\,\,pW/\sqrt{Hz}}, already outperforming some of the commercially available technologies [37]. Our approach to TMBs makes use of silicon nitride (Si3N4) trampoline resonators, which have previously shown a NEP of about \mathrm{100\,\,pW/\sqrt{Hz}} at 20 Hz operating speed in a 1 \times 1 mm sided membrane, illuminated with a 140 GHz source and optically read out via self-mixing interferometry [32]. Compared to our previous results, the devices here investigated have a reduced pixel size and employ specific layers for improved absorptance. In addition, addressing the TMB with metallic wires in a magnetic field, we switched to all-electrical probing via inductive read-out [38], which, respect to the cumbersome optical readout, is better suited for integration and parallelization in large-scale arrays. Finally, we exploited the material Duffing nonlinearity [39], an effect arising when the restoring force no longer follows Hooke’s law at high levels of strain, leading to an anharmonic response. By applying nonlinear transduction schemes, we achieve an ultrasmall NEP of about \mathrm{0.1\,\,pW/\sqrt{Hz}} in a narrow bandwidth, evaluated under an illuminating 140 GHz source and at room temperature. Combined with an operating speed of 40 Hz, our device characteristics and measurement technique challenge the state of the art for room-temperature bolometric detectors in the sub-THz range.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08990v1,Perfect absorption of molecular vibration enabled by critical coupling in molecular metamaterial,"The absorption and emission spectrum arising from the vibrational motion of a molecule is mostly in the infrared region. These fingerprint absorptions of polar bonds enable us to acquire bond-specific chemical information from specimens. However, the mode mismatch between the atomic-scale dimensions of the chemical bonds and the resonance wavelength limits the direct detection of tiny amounts of samples such as self-assembled monolayers or biological membranes. To overcome this limitation, surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA) has been proposed to enhance infrared absorption directly via local field enhancement. Here, we report on the perfect absorption of molecular vibration enabled by critical coupling in the metamaterials. Our molecular metamaterial design consists of a thin polymer layer sandwiched between a structured metal layer on top and a continuous metal layer at the bottom that supports the gap plasmon mode. The measured and simulated infrared spectra of the molecular metamaterial show broad and narrow absorption bands corresponding to the metamaterial and molecular vibration modes. We show that by tuning the structure’s molecular film thickness and periodicity, vibrational absorption can be enhanced to near unity. We also show that for a particular periodicity of the array, metamaterial resonance can be completely suppressed, and only molecular vibrational absorption is excited, giving rise to an extremely narrow absorption band.Keywords: Metamaterials, perfect absorption, molecular vibration, critical coupling, antenna.","Metamaterials, which are composite mediums of artificially designed subwavelength resonant particles (sometimes called meta-atoms or nanoantennas), have revolutionized the study of light-matter interaction by providing a fully controllable platform for light manipulation[1, 2, 3]. One of the most sought-after applications of metamaterials is in light confinement and light harvesting, where high absorption of electromagnetic waves is required, e.g., molecular sensing, photocurrent generation, and photodetection[4, 5]. In metamaterials, near-perfect absorption is achieved by tailoring the electric and magnetic resonances of its inclusions in such a way that the effective index of the homogenized medium matches with the free space. The most popular and fabrication-friendly design of highly absorbing metamaterials is a tri-layer metal-insulator-metal design with the top metal layer structured to act as an electric dipole resonator that determines the electric resonance of the medium[6]. The magnetic resonance of the medium is excited with the help of image charges of an electric dipole formed in the bottom metal layer, which is also known as the ground plane. The resultant circulating currents yield a magnetic dipole character response that is associated with a reduction in radiation damping. At a critical spacing thickness d, the radiation from these two induced dipoles is perfectly out of phase [7], leading to the cancelation of reflection. This condition is called the critical coupling condition and can be understood with the help of cavity losses [8, 9]. The reflection coefficient of the tri-layer metamaterial can be expressed using the coupled mode theory as \centering r(\omega)=\frac{({\gamma_{\mathrm{rad}}-\gamma_{\mathrm{abs}}})-i({% \omega-\omega_{0}})}{({\gamma_{\mathrm{rad}}+\gamma_{\mathrm{abs}}})+i({\omega% -\omega_{0}})}\@add@centering (1) where \omega_{0} is the resonant frequency of the eigenmode and \gamma_{\mathrm{rad}}, \gamma_{\mathrm{abs}} represent the radiative and the non-radiative losses, respectively. In tri-layer metamaterials, the thickness of the spacer layer provides an easy method to precisely tune the radiative loss of the system and \gamma_{\mathrm{rad}} can be engineered to match \gamma_{\mathrm{abs}} of the composite medium such that r(\omega) goes to zero. Moreover, the ground plane, which is an optically thick metal film, prevents any transmission of radiation, and thus most of the electromagnetic energy is confined in the insulating medium. The fundamental mode of the metamaterial is characterized by confined electromagnetic fields within the gap, with an enhanced electric field near the edges and a maximum magnetic field at the centre of the cavity. This deep sub-wavelength confinement of energy gives rise to drastically enhanced electric and magnetic fields that can be exploited to study the strong light-matter interactions across the spectrum. In the mid-infrared range, field enhancement can be exploited to directly enhance the infrared absorption of molecular vibrations that depend on the coupling between enhanced local electric fields and the fingerprint vibrations of the molecules of interest[10, 11]. This is done by tuning the metamaterial resonances to overlap with the absorption bands of targeted molecules. In general, metamaterial resonances are quite broad compared to molecular absorption bands because of strong radiative and nonradiative losses. Thus, interference of broad-band and narrow-band resonances results in an asymmetric line-shaped resonance, known as the Fano resonance. In most cases, the molecules to be detected are placed on top of the metamaterial surface, where they interact with the localized field near the edges of the electric dipole resonators. However, as discussed before, the maximum field enhancement is inside the spacer, so one needs to place the molecules in the gap, which is not possible because the gap is occupied by the insulating spacer layer. However, the hotspots in the gap can be accessed by modifying the geometry of the trilayer structure using the pedestal geometry[12, 13]. In this case, the molecules can interact with the electric field with maximum enhancement, and the sensitivity of detection can be increased further. It is important to note that an array of electric dipoles maximally absorbs 50 \% of the impinging light[14]. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, perfect absorption of molecular vibrations has not been achieved so far. In this work, we numerically demonstrate perfect absorption of the C=O stretch mode of PMMA molecules by adjusting the periodicity of the array and the thickness of the polymer film to obtain the critical coupling condition. Figure 1: (a) Schematic cross-sectional view of the metamaterial perfect absorber made of antenna array on top of a metallic ground plate separated by a PMMA layer. Parameters of molecular metamaterial include patch width w, PMMA thickness d, and periodicity of the square array p. (b) Scanning electron microscopic image of the fabricated sample. (c) Experimental and simulated reflection spectra of molecular metamaterial with periodicity p = 2.8 {\mu}m, PMMA film thickness d = 160 nm and patch width w = 1.2 {\mu}m. The proposed molecular metamaterial consists of a PMMA layer sandwiched between a metal ground plane and a patterned array of metallic nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). The size of the square metallic patches, which define the resonant wavelength, is precisely controlled by electron-beam lithography. Experimentally, a 1 mm2 square array of nanopatches was patterned onto a CaF2 substrate by electron beam lithography, metal evaporation, and lift-off. We start the fabrication by spin-coating a layer of approximately 400 nm ZEP 520A to serve as a positive-tone electron-beam resist layer. A thin conductive polymer layer (E-Spacer 300Z) is further spin-coated to mitigate charging effects during electron-beam lithography. After the exposer, the resist was developed using a ZED-N50 developer for 60 s and rinsed in ZMD-B for 30 s. A 5-nm thick Cr layer and an 80-nm Au layer were deposited on the developed sample, followed by the lift-off to form a nanoantenna array. Au is used for both metal layers and its thickness is approximately 100 nm. The remaining resist is finally removed by rinsing the sample in acetone overnight. The SEM micrograph of the nanopatch array is shown in Fig. 1(b). In Fig. 1 (c), we plot the experimental and simulated reflectance spectra of the proposed molecular metamaterial. Reflection spectra are measured for unpolarized light with 4 cm-1 resolution using a FTIR spectrometer (VERTEX 70v, Bruker). The hybrid system shows two dips at 1900 cm-1 and 1732 cm-1 that are due to the excitation of the gap plasmon mode (refer to metamaterial resonance from hereafter) and the vibrational mode associated with the C=O stretch of the PMMA molecule (refer to molecular resonance from hereafter). The gap plasmon mode is characterized by the excitation of electric and magnetic dipole modes in the metal-insulator-metal cavity as shown in Figs. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b) [15]. The induced electric dipole moment \mathrm{p_{x}} in the nanoantenna is expressed as \centering\mathrm{\textit{p}_{x}}=\epsilon_{0}\mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{ee}}% \mathrm{\textit{E}^{inc}_{x}}\@add@centering (2) where \mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{ee}} is the effective electric polarizability and \epsilon_{0} is the free space permittivity. Similarly, the magnetic dipolar moment can be written as \centering\mathrm{\textit{m}_{y}}=\mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{mm}}\mathrm{\textit{H}% ^{inc}_{y}}\@add@centering (3) where \mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{mm}} is the effective magnetic polarizability. The expression for the magnetic polarizability of the metamaterial was analytically derived by Bowen et. al [16, 17], and it is given by \centering\mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{mm}}=\frac{8dc^{2}cos^{2}({sin(\theta})kw_{% \mathrm{eff}}/2)}{\omega^{2}_{0}-\omega^{2}+i\omega^{2}/Q}\@add@centering (4) where w_{\mathrm{eff}} is the effective width of antenna, d is gap thickness and \theta is the angle of the incident magnetic field. 1/Q=1/Q^{\mathrm{rad}}+1/Q^{\mathrm{abs}} is the Q factor of the mode due to both radiative and Ohmic losses. The Q^{\mathrm{rad}} is defined by \centering Q^{\mathrm{rad}}=\frac{kp^{2}cos(\theta)}{2d(1-r_{TM})A_{\mathrm{t}% }(\theta)}\@add@centering (5) where A_{\mathrm{t}}(\theta) is cos^{2}[sin(\theta)kw_{\mathrm{eff}}/2] and r_{\mathrm{TM}} is the reflection coefficient for a transverse magnetic (TM) wave. It has been shown that maximum absorption occurs when \mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{mm}} = \mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{ee}}. This condition is called the balanced Kerker condition for effective polarizabilities[14]. As we can see from Equation 5, the radiative loss of the composite medium depends strongly on the periodicity of the array and the spacer layer thickness. This suggests that both periodicity and spacer layer thickness can be adjusted to obtain the critical coupling condition to achieve perfect absorption of radiation. Figure 2: Simulated electric and magnetic field in the molecular metamaterial at 1900 cm-1. The blue arrows in (a) show the incident electric field, while the red arrows show the field within the spacer layer. The electric field within the gap region shows the formation of two out-of-phase induced dipoles. These two dipoles lead to a magnetic moment, indicated with the color plot in Fig. (b). To understand the nature of metamaterial and molecular absorption modes and their dependence on different geometrical parameters, we performed comprehensive and parameterized electromagnetic simulations (COMSOL Multiphysics)[18] based on the Finite-Element Method (FEM). Periodic boundary conditions in the in-plane dimensions and perfectly matched layers in the out-of-plane dimension were used throughout with excitation due to a normally incident plane wave. The metallic parts of our metamaterial resonator were modeled using a Drude model with a plasma frequency of \omega_{\mathrm{p}}=2\pi\times2175 THz and collision frequency of \gamma=2\pi\times6.5 THz. The PMMA permittivity describing the C=O stretch was modeled as a Lorentz oscillator \varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}=\varepsilon_{\mathrm{b}}+f\omega_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}/(% \omega_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}-i\gamma_{\mathrm{m}}\omega-\omega^{2}), where the relative permittivity \varepsilon_{\mathrm{b}} is 2.2, the oscillator strength f is 0.01, the resonance frequency \omega_{\mathrm{m}} is 1732 cm-1, and \gamma_{\mathrm{m}} is 20 cm-1 [19]. We numerically calculated the S-parameter for all structures with normal incidence to obtain the reflectivity spectra. Figure 3: (a) Simulated absorption spectra plotted as a function of wavelength of molecular metamaterial with PMMA film thickness of 160 nm and variable lattice constant. The arrays lattice constant varies from 2.8 to 1.6 {\mu}m (bottom to top). (b) Absorption spectra with a fixed period of p = 2.8 {\mu}m and variable PMMA film thickness. The patch width was kept constant at w = 1.14 {\mu}m for both the cases. The spectra are offset vertically for clarity."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09515v1,Application of signal separation to diffraction image compression and serial crystallography,"We present here a real-time analysis of diffraction images acquired at high frame-rate (925 Hz) and its application to macromolecular serial crystallography. The software uses a new signal separation algorithm, able to distinguish the amorphous (or powder diffraction) component from the diffraction signal originating from single crystals. It relies on the ability to work efficiently in azimuthal space and derives from the work performed on pyFAI, the fast azimuthal integration library. Two applications are built upon this separation algorithm: a lossy compression algorithm and a peak-picking algorithm; the performances of both is assessed by comparing data quality after reduction with XDS and CrystFEL.","X-ray macromolecular crystallography is one of the most successful methods to determine the atomic structure of biological molecules. The achievable diffraction quality may often be limited by radiation damage. Although cryogenic conditions permit to extend the lifetime of crystals in the X-ray beam and to increase the maximum absorbed dose before inducing damage, they may hinder physiologically relevant conformations. This limitation has renovated the interest for room temperature macromolecular crystallography by applying a more drastic approach to overcome the radiation damage problem by collecting data from thousands of small crystals, in what became known as serial crystallography. First developed at X-ray free electron laser sources (xfel) [Chapman2011, structure_sx] the method is currently applied also at synchrotron sources [ssx, ssx_desy, ssx_id13, ssx_diamond]. 1.1 Serial crystallography using synchrotron sources (SSX) Serial crystallography consists in exposing thousands of small crystals to the X-ray beam only once in a serial way. Diffraction is collected with a very high flux density, in order to extract the most information from a single shot. This is in contrast with traditional rotational crystallography, where a complete dataset is collected from a single crystal rotated around one (or several) axis. Those SSX images represent a slice through the reciprocal space, thus intersect a lower fraction of the reciprocal space as the crystal is still, in comparison with rotational crystallography. To achieve a complete dataset, thousands of frames have to be collected, individually indexed and then merged. The high flux needed to collect all diffraction signal from a single crystal within a single exposure makes the SSX technique a good candidate to benefit from the 4th generation synchrotron sources, such as the new ESRF-EBS update [EBS]. However, macromolecular crystallography beam-lines (MX) have been extremely specialized towards rotational data-collection and thus require modifications to the experimental setup to perfom SSX experiments. The synchrotron serial crystallography beamline (ID29 at the ESRF) has been built to have a dedicated environment to perform SSX experiments with a high flux (using a larger energy bandwidth with a multilayer monochromator), a high-speed chopper (to separate X-ray pulses), several sample delivery methods and a fast detector. 1.2 Jungfrau 4M detector Macro-molecular crystallography has enormously progressed in the last decades with to the introduction of photon-counting detectors [pilatus]. With their absence of read-out noise and their fast speed, the main limitation of photon-counting detectors is the achievable count-rate, i.e. how fast the electronic of a pixel is able to count arriving photons. Unlike photon-counting detectors such as the Eiger detector [Eiger], the Jungfrau detector [jungfrau2016] is an integrating detector, thus, it is not limited by the count rate, even under the very intense flux expected when recording Bragg-peaks. To cope with this photons density, every single pixel implements an automatic gain switching mechanism (3 levels) which offers a precision of the order of one third of a keV on the higher gain mode, a precision of the order of one photon in the intermediate level and the ability to cope with thousands of photons in the lower gain mode. Moreover, the Jungfrau is able to operate at two kilohertz, which means the image must be read every half millisecond. Since the Jungfrau detector is an integrating detector, dark current and flat-field correction have to be applied: every pixel has three, so called, pedestals and three gain values (one for each gain level). This large number of parameters per pixel makes the pre-processing of raw signal challenging at full speed: the signal from a single pixel, initially packed with 16 bits per pixel, gets expanded to 32 bits (floating point or integer value), doubling the required bandwidth and the storage size [jungfrau_PSI]. The ID29 beamline features a Jungfrau 4M detector, operating at 1kHz, pace imposed by the chopper and synchronized with the photon bunches from the ESRF. At nominal speed, the detector will produce 16 GBytes of pre-processed data per second, making the data analysis and storage extremely challenging. 1.3 Requirements for online data processing Serial crystallography is one of the techniques where online data processing is likely to have most impact: millions of images are to be collected, and existing detector already saturate the fastest storage systems, not even considering the cost of this storage. Beside this, only a few percentage of the frames are expected to contain diffraction signal and out of them, a fraction will be indexed, integrated and thus useful to solve the protein structure. Efficient processing of raw images is thus essential for SSX, with 4 levels of increasing complexity: • image reconstruction with pedestal correction • veto-algorithm: be able to sieve-out images with poor signal • save only pixels with diffraction signal • precise location of peak position with indexation [toro] • real-time integration of diffraction peaks . Reconstruction and pedestal correction have been already described in \citeasnounlima2. This document will focus on the subsequent steps: the detection of signal is addressed in section 2, sparse data compression in section 3, and peak-finding in section 4 before drawing some conclusions in section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09346v1,Quantum emitters in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride,"Hexagonal boron nitride has been experimentally shown to exhibit room-temperature single-photon emission. This emission is attributed to defect states in the wide band-gap of hBN, which allow new optical transitions between these dispersion-less defect levels. In this work, we study the new spectral features introduced by interacting atomic defects in consecutive layers of bilayer hBN. Density Functional theory simulations have been carried out to calculate the energy band structure, frequency-dependent complex dielectric functions, and Kohn-Sham states to demonstrate and understand the cause of the emission enhancements. We found that placing colour centres in the vicinity of each other in bilayer hBN introduces new polarization dependent spectral features, with strong dependence on the distance and relative orientation between atomic defects. Our results provide a pathway to engineering single photon emission in hBN via inter-defect interaction.","Figure 1: Emission enhancement in defected bilayer hexagonal boron nitride. a and b show the schematic diagrams for monolayer and bilayer hBN (with C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} point-defect), respectively. c and d show the optical absorbance spectra for the systems in a and b, respectively. The labelled numbers are the peak heights for the Lorentzian region (yellow) and bulk region (blue) of \alpha_{xx}. Defect engineering in hexagonal boron nitride is a promising pathway towards achieving single photon emission in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectral regions[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Theoretical studies on colour centres in hBN traditionally investigate the electronic and optical properties of atomic point-defects in monolayer hBN. The energy and brightness of these emissions is determined by the nature of the defect and its interaction with the host lattice (the monolayer hBN). In this work, we study the new spectral features introduced by placing colour centres in the vicinity of each other in bilayer hBN. In addition to this, our study also proposes a method to tune the emission energies, by altering the relative orientation and distance between the defects in the two layers. Although studies have been carried out to investigate the effect of combining individual atomic defects in monolayer hBN [4], extensive research has not been conducted yet to investigate the tuning of the quantum emission by changing the relative distance and orientation between individual defects. Combining defects in monolayer hBN has the effect of eliminating spin-splitting and introducing a single new defect state above the Fermi energy (but below the bulk conduction bands), leading to a strong optical transition between the two defect states (marked as 1 and 2 in Fig. 6b). However, when such a defect dimer is introduced in both layers of bilayer hBN, the number of total defect states is doubled, with a slight energy difference between the electronic levels (the states marked as 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Fig. 7 b). The new feature offered by defects in bilayer hBN is that by tuning the distance and orientation between the bilayer dimer defects, we can break or restore inversion symmetry of the defect state wavefunctions, which imposes certain selection rules determining the allowed optical transitions between defect states in bilayer hBN. This allows us to dictate how many optical transitions are allowed between the multiple defect states, and in some cases also allows us to create a polarized quantum emitter (see Fig. 8). In addition to this, combining defects in bilayer hBN also leads to enhancement in the single photon emission. The enhancement in spectral features is quantified by the relative heights of the peaks, corresponding to the single photon emission and bulk-band transitions, in the absorbance spectrum (see Fig. 1). The absorbance in Fig.1 is calculated from the frequency-dependent complex dielectric function using the following formula [6]: \alpha(\omega)=\frac{2\omega}{c}\sqrt{\frac{|\epsilon(\omega)|-\text{Re}[% \epsilon(\omega)]}{2}}. (1) In Fig. 1, the absorbance spectra for monolayer and bilayer hBN show that there is an enhancement of 18.4% in the relative peak heights (the peak height of the Lorentzian region divided by the peak height of the bulk region, as shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. 1d), when two C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} defects are allowed to couple with each other in bilayer hBN. The enhancement is explained by the splitting of the bands in the band structure, when a second layer of hBN (with C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} defect) is superposed on top of the first layer of hBN (also with C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} defect). The band splitting gives rise to extra defect states below and above the Fermi energy, allowing for extra optical transitions with nearly the same energies. This result suggests that the emission from the bilayer is not simply an incoherent sum of the two monolayer defect spectra but rather shows a complicated behaviour involving inter-defect interaction. In the following sections, we study this interaction in more details highlighting the tunability of the spectral features of the single photon emission in the bilayer system. We begin by studying the optical and electronic properties of pristine monolayer and bilayer hBN, and see how these properties change with the addition of C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} defects in the monolayer and bilayer systems. Furthermore, we also investigate how the complex dielectric tensor changes when the distance and orientation between the defects is varied in bilayer hBN, and we explain these changes by looking at the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions for the resulting defect states."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09208v1,Spatial localization and diffusion of Dirac particles and waves induced by random temporal medium variations,"We investigate the consequences of temporal reflection on wave propagation and transformation in systems governed by a pseudospin-1/2 Dirac equation. These systems are spatially uniform but are subject to random temporal variations in mass, which correspond to the energy gap between the Dirac cones. By employing the invariant imbedding method on two complementary random models, we accurately compute all moments of temporal reflectance and derive their analytical expressions in short- and long-time regimes. In the long-time regime, the reflectance probability density is a constant equal to one, indicating uniform probability for any reflectance value. The group velocity of the wave decays to zero with time, signifying spatial localization induced by temporal variations. Numerical simulations of a wave pulse show that the initially narrow pulse evolves into a precisely Gaussian shape over time. In the long-time regime, the pulse center exhibits spatial localization, while its width shows ordinary diffusive behavior, increasing without limit. This behavior is universal, persisting regardless of the initial pulse shape or the probability distribution of the random mass. Our findings suggest that insulating behavior can be induced in Dirac materials by random temporal variations of the medium parameters. We discuss the possibilities of verifying our predictions in various experimental systems.","When waves encounter spatial variations in medium properties, as described by second-order differential equations in space, they may scatter at spatial boundaries, producing backward-propagating waves. Now, consider a wave propagating through a medium undergoing temporal variations. Even when the medium is spatially uniform, the wave can scatter backward if it follows second-order differential equations in time, such as those describing electromagnetic (EM), acoustic, and water waves [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Given the causality of time, these scattered waves travel in the opposite spatial direction. Although this phenomenon, known as temporal reflection, has long been recognized, there is currently a significant resurgence of interest in the propagation of waves in time-varying media [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. This renewed interest is primarily driven by the motivation to develop innovative methods for controlling wave-matter interactions and creating versatile active metamaterials. Many wave phenomena observed in spatially modulated systems find counterparts in temporally modulated cases. For instance, media with periodic temporal variations can exhibit a momentum gap [18, 19, 20]. Waves within this gap display exponential energy growth over time, contrasting with the exponential attenuation shown by waves within the frequency gap of spatially periodic media. The present paper focuses on the influence of random temporal variations on wave propagation, a subject recently explored for EM and water waves by several research groups [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. In these studies, there is a consistent observation that wave energy increases exponentially over time. Theoretical investigations of EM waves have revealed a vanishing group velocity, indicating spatial localization akin to Anderson localization in spatially random media. Furthermore, the probability distribution of wave energy has been demonstrated to follow a log-normal distribution after a sufficiently long time [21, 22]. Despite extensive studies of classical waves in time-varying media, research on analogous problems for quantum wave equations has been rare [26]. One of the main reasons for this rarity is that the Schrödinger equation is of first order in time and does not exhibit any temporal reflection effect. In our recent study, we investigated the propagation of waves governed by a generalized pseudospin-1/2 Dirac equation in the presence of various time-varying perturbations [27]. These systems are effectively governed by a wave equation with a second-order derivative in time and exhibit a temporal reflection effect. Intriguingly, we demonstrated that momentum gaps do not appear in such systems under periodic temporal variations. Additionally, unlike EM waves, we established that exponential growth of total wave energy does not occur under any temporal variation. Our primary objective in this work is to investigate the propagation and transformation of Dirac particles and waves under random temporal variations. Specifically, we explore cases in which the mass energy, governing the gap between the upper and lower Dirac cones, varies randomly over time. We analyze two complementary models using the invariant imbedding method (IIM) [28, 29]. This method enables us to calculate all moments of the temporal reflectance, the probability density of the reflectance, and the spatial distribution of the wave fields in a numerically precise manner. Our findings reveal that the group velocity for plane waves and pulses decreases exponentially over time, indicating spatial localization. We derive analytical forms for all reflectance moments in short- and long-time regimes. Notably, we observe that in both regimes, the probability distributions follow the beta distribution, with the long-time regime demonstrating that the probability density is a constant equal to 1. This implies that the reflectance can take any value between 0 and 1 with equal probability. Furthermore, we investigate the propagation of wave pulses with a nonzero central wave vector and finite pulse width through random temporal mass variations. Our findings reveal that the initially narrow pulse undergoes shape changes over time, transforming into a precisely Gaussian-shaped pulse. This pulse is a superposition of forward- and backward-propagating Gaussian pulses of identical shape. In the long-time regime, the pulse center exhibits spatial localization, while the pulse width displays diffusive behavior and increases without limit. This universal behavior persists irrespective of the initial pulse shape or the probability distribution of the random mass. Our results can be directly tested through experiments on EM and acoustic waves in metamaterials designed specifically to exhibit Dirac-type dispersion [30, 31, 32, 33]. In electronic systems that exhibit Dirac-type dispersion, such as graphene [34, 35, 36, 37], our findings indicate a fascinating phenomenon: insulating behavior, characterized by vanishing current and conductance, can be induced solely through the application of random temporal variations."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09039v1,Hidden nonlinear optical susceptibilities in linear polaritonic spectra,"Linear spectra of molecular polaritons formed by N molecules coupled to a microcavity photon mode are usually well described by classical linear optics, raising the question of where the expected nonlinear effects in these strongly coupled systems are. In this work, we derive a general expression for the polaritonic linear spectra that reveal previously overlooked finite-size quantum corrections due to vacuum-mediated molecular Raman processes. Using a 1/N expansion, we demonstrate that these nonlinearities are suppressed in typical low-Q cavities due to an emergent timescale separation in polariton dynamics yet manifest in high-Q single-mode cavities where the photon loss is comparable to the single-molecule light-matter coupling strength.","References Coles et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08738v1,An atlas of photonic and plasmonic materials for cathodoluminescence microscopy,"Abstract. Cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of materials at the nanoscale, offering unique insights into the behavior of photonic and plasmonic materials under electron excitation. We introduce an atlas of bulk CL spectra for a range of materials widely used in photonics and plasmonics. Through a combination of experimental CL spectroscopy and Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize electron penetration depth and energy deposition, offering a foundational reference for interpreting CL spectra and understanding material behavior under electron excitation. By capturing CL signal from a diverse range of materials, this atlas provides insights into the intrinsic emission properties essential for material selection and design in photonic and plasmonic device engineering.","Cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy is an indispensable tool for investigating the optical and electronic properties of materials at the nanoscale, providing valuable insights into photonic and plasmonic materials [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. When an electron beam interacts with a material, it leads to the emission of ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), and infrared (IR) photons. The detection of this optical signal combined with the techniques of electron microscopy allows for the spatial mapping of the material’s electronic and optical characteristics with nanoscale resolution. The wavelength and intensity of the emitted light are influenced by the material’s composition, defects, and structural features, making CL microscopy a valuable technique for understanding material properties and behavior. For in-depth insights into various aspects of CL, readers are directed to several comprehensive reviews, which include discussions on the physical fundamentals of CL [6, 7], its historical development and methods [8, 2, 3, 9, 10, 4, 11, 12], overviews on CL origin in a variety of semiconductors [1, 13, 14], and developments on CL microscopy for the study of nanophotonic and plasmonic systems [15, 16, 5]. In combination with far-field Fourier spectroscopy, CL microscopy offers a powerful method for distinguishing between coherent and incoherent light emission processes in materials [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Coherent CL arises from transition radiation, Smith-Purcell radiation, and collective oscillations of free electrons, such as surface-plasmon resonances in metals, while incoherent CL results from intrinsic processes (e.g., electron-hole recombination, defects) and extrinsic processes (e.g., dopants, impurity and color centers), which are typically observed in semiconductors and dielectrics. Differentiating and accurately attributing these mechanisms has become crucial in photonic and plasmonic systems, as they often involve materials that support both processes. The relative strength of incoherent and coherent mechanisms strongly depends on the system’s material composition. Therefore, for effective experiment design and interpretation, it is essential to understand the CL response of the materials used, independent of geometric effects, and to identify the origins of observed spectral features. An important parameter in CL microscopy is the electron penetration depth, which refers to how deeply the electron beam penetrates the material before losing its kinetic energy. The penetration depth varies depending on the material’s atomic number (Z), atom density, and the energy of electrons in the electron beam [22]. For low-Z materials like carbon (C) or silicon (Si), penetration depths can be relatively large (on scale of microns), allowing for bulk material analysis even at lower electron beam voltages. Conversely, in high-Z materials like gold (Au) or platinum (Pt), the penetration depth is significantly reduced (down to sub 10 nm), restricting the interaction volume to the surface or near-surface layers. Understanding the electron penetration depth is crucial for interpreting CL spectra accurately, as it determines whether the emission originates from the surface, subsurface, or bulk of the material. Figure 1: Cathodoluminescence microscopy and atlas materials overview. a Experimental setup for detection of CL energy and angular spectra. b Incoherent CL originates from recombination of electron-hole pairs created by incident electrons in the bulk. c Isotropic angular radiation pattern characteristic for incoherent CL. d Coherent CL originates from interaction of the electron beam with collective electron oscillations and transition radiation at the interface. e Dipolar emission pattern characteristic for coherent CL. f Investigated materials. In this article, we present a comprehensive study of optical response from a wide range of materials under low-energy electron beam excitation (1–30 keV), building up an atlas of CL spectra of materials for photonic and plasmonic systems. The materials studied include plasmonic and non-plasmonic metals, dielectrics, and semiconductors used in optics and photonics, as well as novel two-dimensional (2D) materials, topological insulators, and polymeric and resist materials used in the fabrication of nanostructured devices. Our aim is to probe the CL emission mechanisms (coherent/incoherent) and to characterize the emitted spectra and CL intensity from each material. We also conduct numerical simulations of electron penetration depth and energy absorption using Monte Carlo methods via the CASINO modeling tool [22]. These simulations provide detailed insights into the interaction of low-energy electrons with the investigated materials. Our work, which combines experimental CL analysis with Monte Carlo simulations of electron trajectories, provides a robust dataset for understanding how material properties and electron interactions influence CL behavior. Furthermore, this atlas serves as a foundational reference for interpreting CL data in various experimental contexts, reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation arising from surface or environmental effects. By systematically documenting the CL characteristics of key materials, this work supports the development of next-generation photonic and plasmonic technologies, guiding both experimental design and theoretical modeling efforts."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08729v1,Observation of non-Hermitian topology from optical loss modulation,"Understanding the interplay of non-Hermiticity and topology is crucial given the intrinsic openness of most natural and engineered systems and it has important ramifications in topological lasers and sensors. Intense efforts have been devoted to unveiling how non-Hermiticity may impact the most significant features of topological systems, but only recently it has been theoretically proposed that topological features could originate solely from the system’s non-Hermiticity in photonic systems. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the appearance of non-Hermitian topology exclusively from loss modulation in a photonic system that is topologically trivial in the absence of loss. We do this by implementing a non-Hermitian generalization of an Aubry-André-Harper model with purely imaginary potential in a programmable integrated photonics platform, which allows us to investigate different periodic and quasi-periodic configurations of the model. In both cases, we show the emergence of topological edge modes and explore their resilience to different kinds of disorder. Our work highlights loss engineering as a mechanism to generate topological properties.","The last two decades have witnessed outstanding progress in topological photonics [1, 2]. This has mainly been driven by the prospect of robust electromagnetic modes, protected by global topologies of the dispersion relation of photonic materials, and their applications on classical [3, 4, 5] and quantum integrated photonic devices [6, 7, 8]. While most of this progress has occurred in Hermitian (closed) systems, there have also been notable advances in open systems, where non-Hermiticity and topology interplay to produce unique features [9, 10]. Non-Hermiticity significantly enriches topological phases beyond the traditional Hermitian framework. By introducing a new class of symmetries [11], it substantially expands the existing symmetry classifications, thereby enhancing the complexity and diversity of topological phases beyond what is possible in Hermitian systems. A most notable feature of non-Hermitian topological systems is that they, generally, have complex eigenvalues, which has vast implications, including the appearance of exceptional points [12] and the emergence of eigenvalue topology [13]. Building on theoretical investigations [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], a number of optical experiments have demonstrated topological effects by incorporating gain or loss: from the observation of stationary zero-order topological states [20] and topological PT symmetric interface states [21] in non-Hermitian dimer chains to recent demonstrations of gain-related asymmetric long-range couplings in the Haldane model [22] and triple topological phase transitions in topological quasicrystals [23], all the way through the extensive literature in topological lasers [24, 25, 26, 3, 4]. All demonstrations to date relied on the introduction of loss and/or gain in systems that were already topological in their Hermitian version [20, 21, 25, 26, 24, 23] or used gain in an indirect way to engineer asymmetric couplings in Hermitian systems [22]. Recently, it was theoretically proposed that a photonic topological insulating phase can arise, exclusively, from system’s non-Hermiticity through gain and loss modulation in an otherwise topologically trivial system [27]. Subsequent theoretical studies have shown topological transitions and edge states in non-Hermitian AAH models with imaginary commensurate [28] and incommensurate [29] imaginary potentials. Although experimental demonstrations of topological phases arising solely from non-Hermiticity have occurred in electrical circuits [30], acoustics [31, 32], elastic waves [33], and plasmonics [34], an experimental demonstration remained elusive in photonic systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the appearance of non-Hermitian topology and the existence of edge modes, exclusively, from optical loss modulation. Our experiments realize a non-Hermitian generalization of the AAH model [29] in a reconfigurable integrated photonics platform [35]. We reveal the presence of topological transitions, the emergence of distinct topological phases, and the presence of topologically protected edge states, for both periodic (commensurate) and quasi-periodic (incommensurate) potentials. Thanks to the reconfigurability afforded by the programmable photonic platform, we systematically investigate the robustness of the system against different types of disorders. Our experimental results, in conjunction with theoretical analysis, illuminate the intricate interplay between disorder, topology, and the emergence of protected modes in photonic non-Hermitian periodic systems and quasicrystals. These findings may have implications in open topological systems and their applications, such as topological lasers and sensors, where gain and loss play a crucial role."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08385v1,Tailoring Transverse Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect Enhancement in Mie-resonant Nanowire-based Metasurfaces,"Enhancement and tailoring of the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) in hybrid metasurfaces comprising rectangular silicon nanowires coupled with a nickel substrate are demonstrated. The excitation of Mie modes of different orders in nanowires causes the enhancement. The in-plane magnetic dipole mode leads to the largest TMOKE enhancement compared to other Mie modes. Changing the width of silicon nanowires leads to a modification of that mode, thereby ensuring the tailoring of the TMOKE within the range of 2.2% – 3.8%. This tunability is associated with the modification of the near-field localized at the Si/Ni interface and the far-field response of the excited magnetic dipole mode. Adjusting these two quantities allows one to achieve the highest values of the TMOKE caused by individual Mie modes in silicon nanowires.","Efficiently controlling the light properties at the nanoscale level is crucial for modern nanophotonics. A promising way to achieve this control is to exploit the magneto-optical effects, which occur when light interacts with the magnetized media. These effects can be used to control light intensity, phase, and polarization through the use of an external magnetic field in a variety of applications including magneto-optical light modulators [1], sensors [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], data writing devices [7], Kerr microscopes [8, 9], and others. The magneto-optical effects in the most common magneto-optically active materials, such as ferromagnetic metals, do not typically reach the levels required for applications [10]. Advances in fabrication technologies have enabled the design of resonant nanostructures. Notably, magneto-optical effects can now be enhanced and tuned by tailoring the optical resonances due to a high localization of electromagnetic fields in subwavelength volumes [11, 12, 13]. The early enhancement methods were based on the use of ferromagnetic thin films [14], magnetoplasmonic crystals [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], and magnetic dielectric materials with noble metal plasmonic nanoparticles [30, 31, 32]. However, the enhancement in these cases is limited by the ohmic losses in the metal. Figure 1: (a1 – a4) SEM images of the four arrays of silicon nanowires with different widths (w) placed on the nickel substrate. (b) Sample scheme and incident light configuration. (c) Experimental setup: L — lamp; FD — field diaphragm; AD — aperture diaphragm; L1, L2, L3 — lenses; GT — Glan-Taylor prism; OF — optical fiber; S — spectrometer. Magnetophotonic crystals [33, 34] were the first dielectric resonant magneto-optical nanostructures proposed to overcome these losses. Further developments in nanophotonics focus on leveraging the properties of high refractive index dielectric metasurfaces [35, 36, 37]. They support electric and magnetic Mie resonances with high field localization, geometrical tunability of the resonant wavelength, and low absorption losses [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. Mie modes are induced by circular displacement currents, and their near-field distributions are confined inside the dielectric. Thus, two possible scenarios of magneto-optical enhancement emerge. On the one hand, magnetic dielectric-based metasurfaces can be used to localize light directly within the magnetic material [44]. However, this approach suffers from a relatively low refractive index and gyration constant of typical magnetic dielectric materials (i.e. Bi - substituted iron garnet). On the other hand, one could use high-index non-magnetic dielectric resonant nanostructures to localize light near the magnetic material, leveraging the fields at the interface. The previously studied disk-based metasurfaces covered with or placed on ferromagnetic [45, 46] and magnetic dielectric materials [47, 48] indeed provide a large magneto-optical response. However, in this approach it is crucial to properly optimize the interaction area between the magnetic material and Mie resonant nanostructures. Our idea is to use one-dimensional arrays of long rectangular nanowires that support the same Mie modes as in the case of nanodisks. In such a nanowire geometry, the Mie mode field distribution is more sensitive to the external magnetic field because of a more homogeneous field distribution along one of the dimensions [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56] than can be observed in the nanodisk case. This allows for both a stronger TMOKE enhancement and tailoring in magnitude compared to previous works. In this paper, we demonstrate a significant TMOKE enhancement in hybrid Si-Ni metasurfaces based on a one-dimensional Mie-resonant rectangular nanowire array. The magnitude, as well as the spectral features of TMOKE and the figure of merit, are controlled by varying the width of silicon nanowires. The observed tunability is associated with a modification of the magnetic dipole mode that causes a change in the near-field, localized in the nickel layer, and the far-field response of the structure."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08210v1,BOSON: Understanding and Enabling Physically-Roust Phtonic erse Design with Adaptive Variation-Aware ubspace ptimization,"Nanophotonic device design aims to optimize photonic structures to meet specific requirements across various applications. Inverse design has unlocked non-intuitive, high-dimensional design spaces, enabling the discovery of compact, high-performance device topologies beyond traditional heuristic or analytic methods. The adjoint method, which calculates analytical gradients for all design variables using just two electromagnetic simulations, enables efficient navigation of this complex space. However, many inverse-designed structures, while numerically plausible, are difficult to fabricate and highly sensitive to physical variations, limiting their practical use. The discrete material distributions with numerous local-optimal structures also pose significant optimization challenges, often causing gradient-based methods to converge on suboptimal designs. In this work, we formulate inverse design as a fabrication-restricted, discrete, probabilistic optimization problem and introduce BOSON-1, an end-to-end, adaptive, variation-aware subspace optimization framework to address the challenges of manufacturability, robustness, and optimizability. We explicitly consider the fabrication process and differentiably optimize the design in the fabricable subspace. To overcome optimization difficulty, we propose dense target-enhanced gradient flows to mitigate misleading local optima and introduce a conditional subspace optimization strategy to create high-dimensional tunnels to escape local optima. Furthermore, we significantly reduce the prohibitive runtime associated with optimizing across exponential variation samples through an adaptive sampling-based robust optimization method, ensuring both efficiency and variation robustness. On three representative photonic device benchmarks, our proposed inverse design methodology BOSON-1 delivers fabricable structures and achieves the best convergence and performance under realistic variations, outperforming prior arts with 74.3% post-fabrication performance. We open-source our codes at link.","Integrated photonics has shown a wide range of applications in computing, communication, and sensing. Currently, many photonic devices are manually architected by tuning a few design parameters via inefficient trial and error, which relies heavily on expert knowledge and time-consuming simulations. In contrast, inverse design requires minimal physical prior knowledge and opens up non-intuitive, high-dimensional design spaces, making it possible to discover highly efficient and compact device designs [8, 13]. The adjoint method-based inverse design [8] is particularly powerful for its ability to compute analytical gradients of an objective with respect to high-dimensional design variables using only two simulations. While the adjoint inverse design can produce numerically plausible designs, a significant gap exists between pre-fab and post-fab performance. Figure 1: Inverse design often yields non-fabricable devices. Optimization difficulty leads to suboptimal designs. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the inverse-optimized design exhibits high performance, but the tiny structures within the design pattern are non-manufacturable, leading to severe post-fabrication performance degradation. Additionally, fabrication variations during lithography and etching, along with operational variations such as temperature drift, introduce robustness concerns that further compromise the performance of inverse-designed devices. Previous approaches have attempted to address manufacturability issues by controlling the minimum feature size (MFS) during optimization through heuristic methods, such as blurring or adding curvature penalties, to eliminate non-fabricable structures and mitigate post-fabrication performance drops [1, 12, 18, 9, 16, 19, 17, 23, 4, 6]. To enhance fabrication robustness, prior work models variations as uniform erosion and dilation of the device geometry and simultaneously optimizes objectives under different variation corner cases. However, this oversimplified method only marginally improves robustness as it fails to capture actual variations accurately. When considering multiple variation effects, exhaustive Monte Carlo sampling of all corner cases induces exponential simulation cost. Beyond fabricability, solving this discrete high-dimensional stochastic optimization problem is particularly challenging. As the adjoint optimizer is only driven by a single objective sparsely defined in the device output port, it leads to a poor objective landscape shown in Fig. 1, making the optimization highly sensitive to initialization and prone to getting trapped in unreasonable suboptimal solutions. To address the photonic device inverse design challenge, which requires both fabricability and robustness, we formulate this task as a fabrication-restricted, robust stochastic optimization problem. We propose a novel inverse design framework, BOSON-1, which enables effective optimization directly within the fabricable subspace with full variation awareness, ensuring efficient inverse design toward robust device structures. Our main contributions are as follows: \bullet We provide a comprehensive analysis of the fabricability and optimization challenges in inverse design and introduce BOSON-1, an adaptive, variation-aware inverse design framework for physically robust photonic devices. \bullet Fabrication-Aware Subspace Optimization: BOSON-1 integrates differentiable fabrication modeling into adjoint optimization to ensure devices in the fabricable subspace. \bullet Loss Landscape Reshaping: BOSON-1 largely reduces the specious local optima by introducing auxiliary dense objectives, enhancing gradient flow and improving optimization. \bullet Local Optima Escaping: We introduce a light-concentrated initialization method with conditional subspace relaxation, facilitating escaping local optima toward better solutions. \bullet Linear-Cost Variation-aware Optimization: We propose an adaptive variation optimization method based on novel axial corner sampling and worse-case optimization, reducing simulation costs from exponential to linear. \bullet On three photonic device benchmarks, our BOSON-1 achieves 74.3% performance enhancement on average compared to previous art, enabling variation-robust photonic inverse design with high efficiency."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08844v1,Trapped-ion Laser Cooling in Structured Light Fields,"Laser cooling is fundamental to quantum computation and metrology with trapped ions, and can occupy a majority of runtime in current systems. A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches’ passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling’s advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to {}^{40}\text{Ca}^{+}{}, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.","I Carrier-free Doppler cooling The treatment of Cirac et al. (1992) showed that Doppler cooling for ions within the LDR at SW nodes allows higher cooling rates via use of higher cooling beam intensities, as well as lower final \bar{n}_{ss}, than possible with RWs. Since SW cooling is limited by saturation on sideband transitions (\Omega_{\mathrm{SB}}\propto\eta\Omega_{0}) instead of the carrier (\Omega_{\mathrm{car}}=\Omega_{0}) as in the usual RW, in a SW configuration and for ions within the LDR, W_{c}\propto\Omega_{\mathrm{SB}}^{2} can be increased by of order {\sim 1}/\eta^{2} before saturating the two-level system. This delayed saturation enables a significant gain in W_{c} given that typically, \eta\sim 0.1. Furthermore, an approximately 2\times reduction in final phonon number \bar{n}_{ss} is predicted. However, significantly different behavior, including heating, appears at other positions in the SW profile Cirac et al. (1992). Wavefunctions of highly excited ions outside the LDR, of practical interest to Doppler cooling, span lengthscales comparable to the wavelength (Fig. 1b), and hence compromised SW cooling performance is expected as compared to within the LDR as treated in Cirac et al. (1992). To study the cooling behavior beyond the LDR, here we employ numerical Lindblad master equation simulations including higher-order expansion terms (see Appendix). Our simulation quantifies the enhancement of Doppler cooling using SWs as compared to RWs both outside and inside the LDR, including effects of saturation from sideband excitation. We also discuss experimental configurations of carrier-free Doppler cooling based on integrated photonic addressing Vasquez et al. (2023); Mehta et al. (2020). In particular, we simulate the eight-level {}^{40}\text{Ca}^{+} structure as an example with a \hat{\pi}-polarized cooling beam (\Omega_{c}, \Delta_{c}) addressing the S_{1/2}\leftrightarrow P_{1/2} transition and a repumper (\Omega_{r}=2\pi\times 10 MHz, \Delta_{r}) with polarization \hat{\epsilon}_{p}=\hat{\pi}/\sqrt{2}+(\hat{\sigma}_{+}-\hat{\sigma}_{-})/2 between D_{3/2}\leftrightarrow P_{1/2} as shown in Fig. 1a, and with a quantizing magnetic field of B=1 G. Time evolution of the expectation phonon number \bar{n}(t) starting from a thermal state \bar{n}(0) is extracted from master equation evolution. The cooling rate at a given \bar{n} is defined as W_{c}=-\dot{\bar{n}}/\bar{n}, and the cooling limit \bar{n}_{ss} the final steady-state expectation phonon number. Figure 2: (a) Cooling rate (line) and limit (point) for \omega_{m}=2\pi\times 3 MHz and \Delta_{c}=-\Gamma/2. EF=1.5 for n=50 (solid line), EF=4.9 for n=5 (dotted line). The additional D states decrease the cooling for both SW and RW but also reduce the RW carrier heating. (b) Time evolution of SW and RW cooling for \omega_{m}=2\pi\times 3 MHz. Using \Delta_{c}=-0.5\Gamma and starting at \bar{n}=50, SW Doppler cooling reaches \bar{n}=4 within 34~{}\mu s with optimal Rabi frequency \Omega_{sw}=1.8\Gamma, while RW Doppler cooling takes 75~{}\mu s with optimal \Omega_{rw}=0.8\Gamma. Fig. 2a shows W_{c} in the full eight-level system as a function of \Omega_{c} for \omega_{m}=2\pi\times 3 MHz. \Delta_{c} is set to -\Gamma_{c}/2 which optimizes the cooling limit \bar{n}_{ss}. For small \Omega_{0}, RW and SW Doppler cooling rates increase quadratically with \Omega_{0} both inside (\bar{n}=5) and outside the LDR (\bar{n}=50) before saturation. For higher \bar{n}, the EF drops but remains larger than 1, achieved around the same \Omega_{c} both outside and near the LDR. Combined with the consistent improvement in \bar{n}_{ss}, this validates the advantage of SW Doppler cooling in the experiments. In Fig. 2b, we simulate a complete Doppler cooling process from \bar{n}=50 outside the LDR to the Doppler limit, using the optimal parameters for cooling rate found in Fig. 2a. We observe SW Doppler cooling take less than half of the time as compared to RW to reach \bar{n}=4, a reasonable starting point for ground-state cooling. Experimental implementation of carrier-free Doppler cooling may employ the configurations shown in Fig. 1c. Though for practical beam waists, the TE10’s effective \eta is lower than in a RW, optimal sideband coupling can be recovered by increasing \Omega_{0} inside the LDR to hold \eta\Omega_{0} constant. This allows cooling radial modes of multi-ion strings without requiring precise positioning of multiple ions along a series of SW fringes. Outside the LDR, however, cooling through higher-order sideband excitations (with coupling strengths proportional to \eta^{k} for a kth order sideband) contribute significantly to cooling, which are attenuated for lower driving beam LD parameter \eta and fixed first-order coupling \eta\Omega. In contrast the heating through spontaneous decay on a kth order sideband is proportional to \eta_{0}^{k} which is independent of the driving beam profile. As a result, the EF in cooling rate achievable with SW cooling decreases outside the LDR when using lower \eta values. For example, in our eight-level system simulations we observe that the EF for SW cooling with \eta=\eta_{0}/4 compared to the best case RW with \eta=\eta_{0} drops to nearly unity for \bar{n}=50. Our results quantify the performance of carrier-free Doppler cooling beyond the LDR previously treated. Though using {}^{40}\text{Ca}^{+} in the simulation as an example, similar advantage would hold for other ion species and are more favorable for lower intrinsic \eta_{0} Xing and Mehta (2023). While the advantage offered is modest in comparison to well within the LDR, our results indicate that such configurations can still be applied for highly excited ions. Therefore, early cooling stages can share the same cooling beam profile with carrier-free GS cooling schemes, for which more substantial enhancements are predicted."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08365v1,Non-Hermitian Effects in Dicke models,"The Dicke model, which describes the collective interaction between an ensemble of atoms and a single-mode photon field, serves as a fundamental framework for studying light-matter interactions and quantum electrodynamic phenomena. In this work, we investigate the manifestation of non-Hermitian effects in a generalized Dicke model, where two dissipative atom ensembles interact with a single-mode photon field. By applying the Holstein-Primakoff transformation, we explore the system in the semiclassical limit as a non-Hermitian Dicke model, revealing rich exceptional points (EPs) and diabolic points in such a system. We find that, by introducing the nonlinear saturation gain into an atomic ensemble, higher-order EP can be induced, leading to intriguing properties. Furthermore, if the system is extended to a one-dimensional chain, then the band topology will interplay with the non-Hermitian effect. In the quantum regime, we explore the quantum signature of EPs, noting that the conditions for their emergence are influenced by discrete photon numbers. We further study the transition from photon anti-bunching to bunching at a steady state, driven by non-Hermitian dynamics. Our findings deepen the understanding of non-Hermitian physics in light-matter interaction which is instructive for the design of advanced photonic and quantum systems.","In the past decade, the progress in non-Hermitian physics has significantly advanced the understanding of nonequilibrium systems and impacted the development in other fields including photonics, metamaterials, quantum optics, and topological physics Ding et al. (2022); Zhu et al. (2023); Lin et al. (2023); Bergholtz et al. (2021); Ashida et al. (2020a); Okuma and Saito (2023). Non-Hermitian systems are described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, of which the eigenvalues are real under the parity-time (PT) symmetry, whereas complex eigenvalues occur once such symmetry is broken. An exceptional point (EP) emerges at the symmetry-breaking transition, which is revealed as a spectral singularity where the eigenvalues coincide and the eigenvectors coalesce. Non-Hermitian light-matter interacting systems have attracted much attention both in semiclassical Wang et al. (2023); Meng et al. (2024); El-Ganainy et al. (2019) and quantum regimes Zhang et al. (2016); Lodahl et al. (2017); Bernier et al. (2017); Ashida et al. (2020b); Sun et al. (2023), where the light-matter interaction plays a crucial role in PT-symmetry breaking. Such non-Hermitian hybrid systems yield versatile phenomena and applications, including the PT-symmetry controlled lasers Yu and Vollmer (2021); Geva et al. (2022); Zhang et al. (2022a), non-Hermitian skin effects Liang et al. (2022); Zhang et al. (2022b); Li et al. (2024), non-Hermitian sensors Budich and Bergholtz (2020); Franke et al. (2023); Wiersig (2020), and non-Hermitian phase transitions Hanai et al. (2019). Meanwhile, the accompanied EP spectral singularity results in extraordinary topological features Qian et al. (2024); Roccati et al. (2024); Ding et al. (2022) and unconventional quantum thermodynamics Zhang et al. (2022c); Bu et al. (2023). Non-Hermitian effects in the quantum regime as described by the Liouvillian theoretical framework have also been discussed Minganti et al. (2019, 2018); Quijandría et al. (2018), where the Liouvillian EP is generally distinct from its Hamiltonian counterpart. Dicke model Dicke (1954), a prototype model of light-matter interacting systems, characterizes the collective interaction between an ensemble of atoms and a single-mode photon field and is known to yield the superradiant phase transitions Kirton et al. (2019) and criticality-enhanced sensing Chu et al. (2021); Ilias et al. (2022). A number of interesting theoretical works have been carried out to explore the influences of fertile light-matter interactions on the superradiant phase transition, including the counter-rotating-wave contributions Lambert et al. (2004), the anisotropic couplings Das et al. (2023), and the two-photon processes Garbe et al. (2017). When non-Hermitian effects in the Dicke model are included via, e.g., nonreciprocal couplings Deguchi and Ghosh (2009); Chiacchio et al. (2023) or complex potential energy Lu et al. (2023), unconventional superradiant phase transition features have been revealed. Higher-order EPs, i.e., the coalescence of multiple eigenvalues (and the corresponding eigenvectors) at fine-tuned parameters, have recently attracted increasing research interest Mandal and Bergholtz (2021); Hodaei et al. (2017); Fan et al. (2024). So far, most studies mainly focus on second-order EPs in two-level systems as the simplest prototypes of EPs that can enhance sensing. With higher-order EPs, a system can be very sensitive to external perturbations and exhibit versatile quantum geometry, as found in various systems recently Hodaei et al. (2017). Generally, to achieve an n-th order EP, one needs 2n-2 tunable physical parameters Mandal and Bergholtz (2021), which makes the realization of higher-order EPs rather challenging. In this work, we study the non-Hermitian effects in a generalized Dicke model where two individually dissipated atomic ensembles simultaneously interact with a single-mode photon field. In the semiclassical limit, i.e., the number of atoms (and photons) become extremely large, such a generalized Dicke model can be approximately described by a non-Hermitian Dicke Hamiltonian which can be obtained via the Holstein-Primakoff transformation. We find that this non-Hermitian Dicke Hamiltonian have rich non-Hermitian phases. We further extend the non-Hermitian Dicke model by considering the nonlinear saturation gain in one of the atomic ensembles which yields even higher-order EPs without increasing the degrees of freedom. By extending the non-Hermitian Dicke system to a one-dimensional (1D) Dicke chain, we find the intriguing interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology. In the quantum limit, i.e., when the number of photons is small, the quantum signature of EPs is discussed, featuring the photon-number-dependent EPs. Furthermore, the influence of non-Hermiticity on the photon statistics, e.g., photon bounching and anti-bunching, is analyzed. Finally, we discuss possible physical systems that realize the non-Hermitian Dicke model. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows: Section II contains the result for the semiclassical non-Hermitian Dicke model, analyzing the high-order EPs, nonlinear gain, dynamics, and topological phase transformation, accordingly. Section III explores the quantum counterpart of non-Hermitian Dicke model. Section IV conceives possible realizations of non-Hermitian Dicke model both in semiclassical and quantum regimes. Section V gives the conclusion and discussions for this work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08118v1,Coupled-mode theory for astrophotonics,"Coupled-mode theory (CMT) is a powerful tool for simulating near-harmonic systems. In telecommunications, variations of the theory have been used extensively to study waveguides, both analytically and through numerical modelling. Analogous mathematical techniques to the CMT are also widely used in quantum mechanics. The purpose of this work is to collect different formulations of the CMT and their underlying connections to quantum mechanical techniques, and to showcase their utility in modelling slowly varying waveguides including directional couplers and photonic lanterns. My choice of example waveguides is motivated by the astronomical applications of such devices in starlight nulling, wavefront sensing, and high-resolution spectroscopy. I first provide a brief review of the standard form of the CMT, applicable for waveguides with fixed eigenmodes. Next, I show that the CMT also applies for slowly varying waveguides, and demonstrate the close relation between the CMT and several well-known approximation methods from quantum mechanics, as well as concepts like geometric phase. Finally, I present a verification of my analysis, in the form of the numerical package cbeam.","1 Background 1.1 Astrophotonics The cross-disciplinary field of astrophotonics applies photonic devices to the technical challenges of astronomy (Jovanovic et al., 2023), and has since led to novel demonstrations of photonic nullers (Martinod et al., 2021; Xin et al., 2022), spectrometers (Gatkine et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2021), wavefront sensors (Norris et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2023), and wavefront correctors (Diab et al., 2024). Such devices offer new ways to process the light collected by astronomical telescopes, in a form factor much smaller than bulk-optical components. Figure 1 (panels a & b) show two examples of astrophotonic devices: the directional coupler (Agrawal, 2021), which acts as a photonic beamsplitter, and the photonic lantern (PL; Leon-Saval et al. 2005; Birks et al. 2015), which converts multi-moded light into single-moded light. With recent improvements in the fabrication capability for such devices, the astrophotonics community is now poised to consider how to tune designs for better performance in astronomical applications. This might include optimizing directional couplers or tricouplers (Klinner-Teo et al., 2022) and phase shifters for broadband nulling, or designing PLs which simultaneously maximize wavefront sensing and spectroscopy capability. To do so requires a physical understanding of how light propagates through astrophotonic devices. At least within the astrophotonics community, this understanding is often heavily reliant on numerical modelling techniques such as the finite-difference beam propagation method, which are accurate but opaque and difficult to intuit. At the same time, design optimizations for photonic devices would benefit from simulation methods that are faster than the standard methods used today. The goal of this paper is to introduce a mathematical tool that can be used to model and understand the propagation of light through a “slowly-varying” photonic device, through the lens of astronomical instrumentation. The precise meaning of the slowly-varying constraint will be developed later in this work, but for now it suffices to say that this constraint applies to the vast majority of astrophotonic devices, including PLs, photonic integrated circuits, arrayed waveguide gratings, directional couplers, multimode interferometers, fiber Bragg gratings, and Kerr combs; and that photonic devices not satisfying the slowly-varying constraint should probably be redesigned, if possible, to satisfy this constraint and simplify the modelling process. The mathematical tools reviewed in this work all fall under the broad category of “coupled-mode theory” (CMT). 1.2 Introduction to coupled-mode theory Figure 1: a. A 2\times 2 directional coupler, formed from two single-moded waveguide channels which brought close enough to transfer power and then separated again. b. A photonic lantern: an optical waveguide which looks like a few-moded optical fiber on one end and splits off into multiple single-moded outputs at the other. The propagation of light through this device also can be modeled as coupled harmonic oscillators. c. A mechanical system of coupled harmonic oscillators composed of masses and springs, constrained to move in one dimension along a frictionless surface. The CMT is a well-known and well-used mathematical tool. The origins of the CMT are often attributed to studies of radio transmission lines and electron beams by Miller and Pierce, respectively (Miller, 1954; Pierce, 1954); but the underlying ideas appear even earlier in quantum mechanics, for instance in studies of molecular dynamics by Born and Oppenheimer (Born & Oppenheimer, 1927). In telecommunications, the CMT has been widely used to study the propagation of light through few-moded optical waveguides, both analytically and numerically (Okamoto, 2006; Agrawal, 2021; Haus et al., 1987). To motivate the CMT, we will first consider a mechanical analog. Suppose we have a system of N masses connected by springs, as shown in Figure 1c; our goal is to determine the dynamics of the system given an arbitrary initial condition. We first consider the dynamics of a single mass-spring system (where the other end of the spring is fixed), which is a harmonic oscillator obeying \dfrac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}=-\dfrac{k}{m}x (1) where k is the spring constant, m the mass, and x denotes position. The corresponding solution for x(t) is the complex exponential. If we chain many mass-spring systems together, the dynamics of the system is that of a many harmonic oscillators, which can also transfer energy between each other. Mathematically, the equation of motion is \dfrac{d^{2}\bm{x}}{dt^{2}}=-A\bm{x} (2) where \bm{x}=[x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{N}]^{T} are the positions of each mass and A is an N\times N matrix whose off-diagonal terms correspond to the linkage between the individual mass-spring systems. To solve this equation, we assume the solution is harmonic in time, i.e. we propose the ansatz \bm{x}\propto\bm{u}e^{\i\omega t}. This reduces equation 2 to the eigenvalue problem \omega^{2}\bm{u}=A\bm{u} (3) where \bm{u} and \omega^{2} are identified as an eigenvector-eigenvalue pair. The motion of all the masses in the system may therefore be expanded in terms of the eigenvectors, whose amplitudes oscillate harmonically in time; this is “normal mode analysis”. So far, our analysis has been exact. We now consider the case where the the matrix A is allowed to vary with time, for instance through a gradual weakening of the springs or application of an external force. This is the problem that coupled-mode theory (CMT) attempts to solve. The principle of the CMT is as follows: suppose there is a system which supports a basis of harmonic oscillator eigenmodes. When a slowly varying perturbation is added, we assume that perturbed solutions will be “almost” harmonic, and attempt to find solutions formed from a linear combination of the unperturbed eigenmodes. To account for the perturbation, the modes are allowed to cross-couple through varying mode coefficients — hence the name “coupled-mode” theory. Existing treatments in the context of optical waveguides typically provide the “fixed-basis” formulation of the theory, suitable for optical fibers or composite waveguides composed of individual channels, such as directional couplers (Agrawal, 2021), but not for slowly varying waveguides whose eigenmodes change incrementally with longitudinal coordinate z. A motivating example for such a waveguide is the PL, which in recent years has been the subject of growing interest for astronomical applications such as telluric line suppression (Trinh et al., 2013), high-resolution spectroscopy (Jovanovic, N. et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2021), starlight nulling (Martinod et al., 2021; Xin et al., 2022), wavefront sensing (Lin et al., 2023), and spectroastrometry (Kim et al., 2024). The main purpose of this paper, comprising §2-3, is to provide an overview for the fixed-basis CMT as well as for the more broadly applicable “varying-basis” formulation (Snyder & Love, 1983), in some instances called “coupled local mode theory” (CLMT) (Jin et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2020), and to demonstrate its applicability to slowly varying waveguides. Unlike some previous implementations (Chen et al., 2020; Sunder & Sharma, 2020) which assume non-degenerate modes, the formulation presented here is applicable even in the presence of degeneracy, and accounts for non-adiabatic cross-coupling. The secondary purpose, comprising §4, is to show how many of the ideas in the varying-basis CMT have well-studied counterparts in quantum mechanics: concepts including the WKB approximation, perturbation theory, the adiabatic approximation, and geometric phase. While individual connections have been often drawn in previous studies, this work aims at establishing a broader connection, hopefully introducing the reader to techniques and ideas that have normally not been associated with coupled-mode theory and which could be useful in future developments of astrophotonic devices. Throughout, derivations are written using mathematical notation borrowed from quantum mechanics; I briefly review this notation for readers who may be less familiar with it. Finally, in §5 I verify my analysis with cbeam, a simple numerical implementation of the varying-basis CMT, and use it to simulate a two-channel directional coupler and a 6-port PL."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05921v1,Scalable Feedback Stabilization of Quantum Light Sources on a CMOS Chip,"Silicon photonics is a leading platform for realizing the vast numbers of physical qubits needed to achieve useful quantum information processing because it leverages mature complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing to integrate on-chip thousands of optical devices for generating and manipulating quantum states of light. A challenge to the practical operation and scale-up of silicon quantum-photonic integrated circuits, however, is the need to control their extreme sensitivity to process and temperature variations, free-carrier and self-heating nonlinearities, and thermal crosstalk. To date these challenges have been partially addressed using bulky off-chip electronics, sacrificing many benefits of a chip-scale platform and limiting the practically achievable system size. Here, we demonstrate the first electronic-photonic quantum system-on-chip (EPQSoC) consisting of quantum-correlated photon-pair sources stabilized via on-chip feedback control circuits, which is fabricated in a high-volume 45 nm CMOS microelectronics foundry. We use non-invasive photocurrent sensing in a tunable microring cavity photon-pair source to actively lock it to a fixed-wavelength pump laser while operating in the quantum regime, enabling large scale microring-based quantum systems. This is the first demonstration of such a capability, achieving a high coincidences-to-accidentals ratio of \sim134 with an ultra-low g^{(2)}(0) of 0.021 at \sim2.2 kHz off-chip detected pair rate and \sim3.3 MHz/mW2 on-chip pair generation efficiency, and over 100 kHz off-chip detected pair rate at higher pump powers (\sim1.5 MHz on-chip). We show that these sources maintain stable quantum properties in the presence of temperature variations and operate reliably in a practical setting with many adjacent photon-pair sources creating thermal disturbances on the same chip. Such dense integration of electronics and photonics enables implementation and control of quantum-photonic systems at the scale needed to achieve useful quantum information processing with CMOS-fabricated chips.","Photonics is a compelling approach for the development of quantum technologies such as quantum computing, secure communication, and sensing due to its robustness to decoherence at room temperature, natural compatibility with optical interconnects for entanglement distribution, and ability to be miniaturized into chip-scale devices [1, 2]. Silicon photonics [3] offers the most scalable platform for quantum-photonic systems, enabling them to be built using mature semiconductor fabrication techniques developed in the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) microelectronics industry [4, 5], which routinely produces chips with billions of functioning transistors in high volumes. Within this platform, third-order (\chi^{(3)}) optical nonlinearity in silicon and silicon nitride waveguides [6, 7] and microring resonators [8] enables the generation of quantum-correlated photon pairs via spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), which can be used to build compact sources of heralded flying qubits. Furthermore, recent advances in heterogeneous material integration onto silicon-photonic chips have the potential to create a library of optical devices needed to assemble a large-scale photonic quantum computer in a CMOS foundry platform [9]. These include III-V lasers for pumping single-photon qubit sources [10, 11], deterministic quantum emitters based on III-V quantum dots [12, 13, 14], electro-optic materials for high-speed, low-loss optical switches and modulators used in state preparation and manipulation [15, 16, 17, 18], and high-efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) for qubit readout and feedforward operations [19, 20, 21]. To function properly, however, silicon quantum photonic devices, especially micro-resonator based ones like photon-pair sources and filters, require continuous monitoring and control by electronic circuits. To date this has been carried out using bulky off-chip electronics [22], limiting the practically achievable system size and complexity. Realizing the full potential of silicon photonics as a platform for quantum information processing still requires this classical control bottleneck to be resolved. Microring resonator photon-pair sources are an essential building block for silicon quantum photonics as the field enhancement from their high cavity Q-factors and finesse boosts the rate and spectral brightness with which photon-pairs are generated [23], replacing millimeter-scale photon sources based on straight waveguides with resonators as small as a few tens of µm in diameter [24]. Such miniaturized sources can provide the vast numbers of heralded single photon qubits needed per chip for useful quantum information processing. However, the high (typically \gg10,000) Q-factors of microrings optimized for SFWM also create calibration and control challenges that have limited practical quantum-optical experiments based on silicon photonics to no more than a few interacting microring sources [25, 26, 27, 28, 29], with recent larger systems so far still relying on non-resonant devices [30, 31]. These challenges stem from the need for the narrow-linewidth resonances of all microrings in a system to be closely aligned to the same set of pump laser and output wavelengths (historically called the “signal” and “idler”) to produce streams of heralded photons capable of quantum interference [26, 32]. The sources of wavelength mismatch between different microring resonators can broadly be separated into two types: static mismatches and dynamic effects. The former arise from fabrication-induced variations inherent to semiconductor manufacturing such as uneven device layer film thicknesses and etch depths across a wafer, leading to initial differences on the order of nanometers between microring resonance wavelengths even in state of the art processes [33, 34]. Dynamic effects, however, arise from factors that are not fixed at fabrication time such as the temperature and free carrier concentration in each microring. These include thermal crosstalk from the calibration and reconfiguration of other nearby photonic components over the course of operating a system, as well as optical loss mechanisms such as two-photon absorption (TPA) [35] and free carrier absorption (FCA) [36], which lead to self-heating as the circulating optical power increases. When the pump laser power is boosted to maximize the photon-pair generation rate, this self-heating creates a positive feedback loop that eventually manifests as thermal hysteresis [37, 38], preventing an on-resonance lock between a microring and pump laser unless the microring’s temperature is initialized and stabilized properly [39, 40]. Additionally, plasma dispersion from electrons and holes generated by TPA and other parasitic absorption mechanisms shifts microring resonances in the opposite direction of self-heating [41]. This can result in unstable behaviour such as optical pulsing [42] where the two effects take turns pushing the microring’s resonances in opposite directions and cause the cavity’s optical energy to oscillate, sometimes chaotically [43], which prevents stable photon-pair generation. To make microring-based sources viable for large-scale quantum systems-on-chip, these calibration and control issues must be addressed using chip-scale electronics that are densely co-packaged with the silicon photonics and capable of correcting resonance wavelength errors in real time without disrupting the quantum characteristics of the system. To address this need, we introduce the first electronic-photonic quantum system-on-chip that is capable of stabilizing SFWM in microring resonators in a truly in-situ manner by sensing and minimizing their wavelength errors in the quantum regime using on-chip electronics with a compact footprint of 220 µm \times 190 µm. Figs. 1(a-c) show micrographs of the system-on-chip, where active silicon photonics optimized for generating photon-pairs in the C-band (1530-1565 nm wavelength) are fabricated in GlobalFoundries’ 45RFSOI CMOS process using the same silicon-on-insulator (SOI) layer as nearby analog and digital control electronics [44]. This approach was originally developed for integrating classical optical interconnects with microprocessors, where the operation of hundreds of silicon-photonic devices alongside tens of millions of transistors has already been demonstrated [45, 46, 47, 48, 49]. We also previously demonstrated passive quantum photonics in this platform [50], including a single chip with SFWM photon-pair generation and >95 dB pump filtering [51], as proofs of concept that quantum photonics can be implemented in a CMOS platform supporting electronic circuits. In this paper, we introduce new techniques to enable scalable quantum photonics to be integrated within this platform. We integrate non-invasive photocurrent sensors within SFWM-optimized microrings that allow their circulating optical power to be sensed directly, avoiding the need to switch between classical detectors for calibration and quantum detectors for operation [22], or to use separate post-filters and photodetectors that occupy additional area and must themselves be aligned to the correct range of wavelengths [28]. This demonstration of a fully integrated, modular control approach paves the way for silicon quantum photonics to achieve the massive scale required for future generations of quantum information systems."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07865v1,Computational refocusing in phase-resolved confocal microscopy,We demonstrate numerical refocusing in coherent confocal laser scanning microscopy based on synthetic optical holography. This physics-based approach implements a computational propagation on the complex signal recovered in synthetic holography consistent with the wave physics and the parameters of the microscope. An experimental demonstration is shown to restore an in-focus image of a test object from data acquired at several focal plane off-sets. Numerical refocusing can provide focused views on samples with large height variation with a potential application in confocal optical surface profiling.,"Quantitative phase imaging plays an important role in applications such as non-contact surface profiling of micromechanical structures [1, 2] and imaging of transparent biological objects [3, 4]. Knowledge of both amplitude and phase of the scattered field also allows for computational processing of the recorded images based in wave physics, thus enabling numerical refocusing on different object planes and the correction of aberrations after image acquisition [5, 6]. Driven by these advantages, digital holography has been an important area of research in wide-field microscopy and led to the development of commercial products. Confocal microscopy offers superior contrast and depth discrimination as compared to wide-field techniques and finds wide application in fluorescence and Raman imaging. Interferometric methods have been implemented for quantitative confocal phase imaging such as heterodyne [7, 8, 9], phase-locked [10], dual-phase [11] and scanning-interferometer techniques [12, 13], and optical surface profiling and refractive index mapping have been demonstrated [14]. Synthetic optical holography (SOH) is a recently introduced modality for scanning quantitative phase imaging in scanning imaging systems [15], which uniquely combines technical simplicity and high imaging speed. In SOH, the scattered field from a local probe (focus) is superposed with a reference field with a phase which varies slowly across the acquired image. While scanning the focus across the sample, the detected light is recorded as a function of position, yielding an image exhibiting a fringe pattern much like that found in an off-axis Leith-Upatnieks hologram, that is, the system generates a synthetic hologram in a pointwise fashion. Amplitude and phase images can then be reconstructed by numerical methods developed for holography. Applied in a confocal system to record the coherently back-scattered signal, the phase images offer the transverse resolution of the confocal system while providing the high sensitivity to axial variations in surface profile with sub-nanometer depth resolution [16, 17, 18]. With phase and amplitude available, physics-based methods for numerical refocusing or aberration correction should be possible. However, techniques from wide-field microscopy do not naively apply. As will be shown, the confocal geometry results in a rephasing factor of a different form to correct defocus. Here we derive and demonstrate numerical refocusing of the coherently back-scattered scattered field in confocal quantitative phase imaging (confocal QPI). A forward model is derived for confocal microscopy in the backscattering geometry. A back-propagation operator is found via a pseudoinverse for the imaging operator. An analytic solution is found that can be implemented as a rephasing in the Fourier domain. After developing the theory, results are demonstrated with a United States Air Force (USAF) target imaged with a confocal microscope with synthetic optical holography to obtain amplitude- and phase-resolved images. The numerically refocused data are compared to in-focus non-interferometric images."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07819v1,Heralded pure single-photon sources using nanophotonic waveguides with quadratic and cubic nonlinearities,"This paper presents, to our knowledge, a new approach in developing integrated pure heralded single-photon sources based on the interplay between the spontaneous four-wave mixing and sum-frequency generation parametric processes. We introduce a comprehensive quantum model to exploit this interplay in AlGaAs and LiNbO3 nanophotonic waveguides. The developed model is used to assess the performance of the sources based on the photon-pair generation and the associated spectral purity. We find that this approach can remarkably improve the spectral purity of low-pure generated photon pairs, relaxing the restrictions on the structure design and the used pump wavelength. In addition, it overcomes the current hurdles in implementing on-chip photon detectors operating at room temperature, paving the way for advanced applications in integrated quantum photonics and information processing.","Quantum photonics has emerged as a transformative field for exploiting the control of light at the quantum level in pioneering the next-generation technologies [1, 2]. In the centre of this advancement is a single-photon source (SPS) that is a cornerstone for a variety of applications, ranging from quantum computing to secure communication. The development and optimisation of an on-chip SPS are also critical for achieving compact scalable quantum systems and architectures [3, 4, 5, 6]. Single photons can be deterministically generated using quantum dots [7, 8]. However, practically they are less suitable for waveguide integration, because photons are usually emitted out-of-plane. Also, having multiple identical quantum-dot sources represents a major challenge, due to the difficulty in having dot-to-dot uniformity and inhomogeneous broadening. Alternatively, spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) or spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) can be utilised in generating probabilistic photon pairs. Single-photon sources can then be engineered by heralding the existence of one of the two photons. Despite the probabilistic nature of the latter technique that can pose synchronization challenges in quantum networks, it becomes the practical scheme for achieving single photons. Moreover, advances in multiplexing techniques compensate for the probabilistic nature of photon generation and enhance the system efficiency [9, 10, 11, 12]. Recent advances in fabrication techniques have enabled nanophotonic waveguides with enough intensities to excite intrinsic third-order \chi^{(3)} nonlinearities in non-centrosymmetric materials [13, 14]. Also, simultaneous exploitation of second-order nonlinear \chi^{(2)} interactions in these structures has been facilitated via altering the pattern of \chi^{(2)} to achieve quasi-phase matching [15, 16, 17, 18]. In this work, we propose a new integrated heralded SPS that exploits these recent advancements. The concept is based on the interplay between the SFWM and sum frequency generation (SFG) parametric processes. Two pump photons are annihilated to generate two sidebands signal and idler photons via the \chi^{(3)}SFWM process, simultaneously the latter photon is upconverted using another pump photon in a \chi^{(2)}SFG process, as depicted in Fig. 1. Figure 1: A schematic diagram explaining the concept of the proposed device, and SFWM and SFG interaction. The up-converted photon is used in heralding the signal photon. The proposed scheme tackles a significant challenge, which is an efficient on-chip detection of the heralding photon. Photon pairs are usually generated in the telecom regime with energies that fall beyond the activation threshold of the on-chip silicon photon detectors, for instance. Moreover, off-chip superconducting nanowire detectors have a limited frequency range in addition to the requirement of having cryogenic-temperature operation [19, 20, 21, 22]. The paper is organised as follows. In Sec. 2, we develop a quantum model to efficiently investigate the interplay between SFWM and SFG using continuous and pulsed-pump sources. In Sec. 3, we implement and simulate the developed approach for different nanophotonic waveguides with optimised geometries and modulation period of the \chi^{(2)} coefficient. Finally, our conclusions are summarised in Sec. 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07801v1,Triad of equivalence theorems for the radiant intensity of partially coherent beams on scattering,"By using Laplace’s method for double integrals and the so-called beam condition obeyed by a partially coherent beamlike light field, we report the equivalence theory (ET) of partially coherent beams on scattering for the first time. We present the necessary and sufficient condition for the two scattered fields that have the same normalized radiant intensity distribution when Gaussian Schell-model beams whose effective beam widths are much greater than the effective transverse spectral coherence lengths are scattered by Gaussian Schell-model media. We find that the condition contain three implications, and each of them corresponds to a statement of an ET of radiant intensity in a scattering scenario, which exposes the concept of a previously unreported triad of ETs for the radiant intensity of partially coherent beams on scattering. We also find that the existing ET of plane waves on scattering, which only asserts that two scatterers with scattering potentials’ correlations whose low-frequency antidiagonal spatial Fourier components are identical, essentially is merely the first member of our triad of ETs, while the other two hidden important members are completely ignored. Our findings are crucial for the inverse scattering problem since they contribute to avoid possible reconstruction errors in realistic situations, where the light field used to illuminate an unknown object is a partially coherent beam rather than an idealized plane wave.","References [1] M.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07775v1,Topological resilience of optical skyrmions in local decoherence,"The concept of skyrmions was introduced as early as the 1960s by Tony Skyrme. The topologically protected configuration embedded in skyrmions has prompted some investigations into their fundamental properties and versatile applications, sparking interest and guiding ongoing development. The topological protection associated with skyrmions was initially observed in systems with interactions. It is widely believed that skyrmions are stable yet relevant confirmation and empirical research remains limited. A pertinent question is whether skyrmion configurations formed by single-particle wave functions also exhibit topological stability. In this study, we affirm this hypothesis by investigating the effects of local decoherence. We analytically and numerically demonstrate the topological resilience of skyrmions and occurrence of transition points of skyrmion numbers in local decoherence of three typical decoherence channels. On the other hand, we show that these qualities are independent of the initial state. From the numerical results, we verify that inhomogeneous but continuous decoherence channels also adhere to the same behaviors and hold topological stability of skyrmions as homogeneous decoherence channels. These properties of skyrmions contribute to further applications in various areas including communication and imaging.","References Skyrme and Schonland (1961) T. H. R. Skyrme and B. F. J.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07655v1,Laguerre-Gaussian modes become elegant after an azimuthal phase modulation,"Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes are solutions of the paraxial Helmholtz equation in cylindrical coordinates and are associated with light fields carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM). It is customary to modulate such beams using phase-only vortex profiles, for example, when increasing (laddering up) or decreasing (laddering down) the OAM content of some given LG mode. However, the resulting beams have been shown to be hypergeometric-Gaussian modes, due to the changing radial amplitudes on propagation. In this work, we show that these beams in fact have the angular spectrum of elegant Laguerre-Gaussian (eLG) modes, and therefore map back to LG-type modes. Accordingly, the fields obtain new OAM and radial quantum numbers that depend on the initial OAM and additional OAM gained during modulation.","References [1] Y. Shen, X. Wang, Z.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07465v1,Hybrid skin-topological effect in non-Hermitian checkerboard lattices with large Chern numbers,"Non-Hermitian topology provides a research frontier for exploring topological phenomena, revealing novel topological effects and driving the development of emergent materials and platforms. Here, we explore the non-Hermitian Chern insulator phases and the hybrid skin-topological effects in checkerboard lattices with synthetic gauge fluxes. Such lattices can be realized in integrated silicon photonic nanocircuits and microresonators as well as in arrays of evanescently coupled helical optical waveguides. With a simple and tunable design, the system is found to support non-Hermitian hybrid skin topological effects, exhibiting corner skin effects when the lattice symmetry either C_{4} or C_{2}. An unconventional physical mechanism is revealed as the origin of such a transition which is connected to the corner-induced scattering between the multiple chiral edge channels. These properties are enabled by the large Chern number and the rich non-Hermitian topological edge states in our system, revealing the diverse non-Hermitian topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Our design offers excellent controllability and experimental feasibility, making it appealing for studying non-Hermitian topological phenomena.","Non-Hermitian physics provides an efficient framework for investigating non-equilibrium and open quantum systems as well as their classical counterparts, wherein dissipation, energy gain, and nonreciprocal couplings give rise to physical effects that are unattainable in conventional Hermitian systems. Non-Hermitian effects were found to result in versatile non-Hermitian phenomena such as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the exceptional points, lines and surfaces [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], the non-Hermitian topological band theory [15, 16, 17, 18], non- Bloch band theory [19, 20, 21, 22], unidirectional invisibility [23], and non-Hermitian states permutation [24]. The NHSE can be characterized by the spectral topology in the complex plane for finite non-Hermitian systems[25, 26]. Non-Hermitian skin modes coexist with topological edge modes and thus extends the bulk-edge correspondence to a more general picture[27]. A particularly promising frontier lies at the interface between topological physics and non-Hermitian physics. The interplay between NHSE and topological edge modes can bring interesting physics, such as hybrid topological-skin effects [28, 29, 30, 31], where corner localization is due to the coaction of topological localization and NHSE. Floquet non-Hermitian systems, with time-periodic modulation, provide a rich territory for exploring dynamic and topological phenomena [32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. Floquet systems can enable “synthetic dimensions” and create a platform to engineer desired effective Hamiltonian with unconventional properties [37]. Furthermore, Floquet systems can generate interesting spectral and dynamic properties, allowing for the emergence of various topological phases [38, 39, 40, 41]. The periodic modulation in Floquet systems introduces unique artificial gauge fields, enabling the manipulation of topological phases and the emergence of hybrid modes within a single setup. The hybrid topological-skin effects can be regarded as a second-order NHSE, where the topological edge states exhibit NHSE towards certain corner boundaries. However, the existing studies on hybrid topological-skin effects focus on the relatively simple regime where the spatial symmetry dictates the phenomena and there is only one branch of edge states. The hybrid topological-skin effects remain unknown in the regime with multiple branches of edge states where richer emergent phenomena are expected. In this work, we study the interplay between the NHSE and the topological physics in Floquet non-Hermitian checkerboard lattices. At the heart of our theory is the non-Hermitian topological phases induced only by gain and loss as well as their interplay with the artificial gauge fields. For concreteness, we design a coupled photonic waveguide lattice to realize the theoretical model, where the synthetic gauge flux is generated through the Floquet modulation. Nevertheless, the underlying physics is more general and is not restricted to photonic systems. For instance, the same physics can be realized also in cold atom systems where the synthetic gauge flux can be realized via other mechanisms. We find that our checkerboard lattices can efficiently generate non-Hermitian bands with large Chern numbers. The induced multiple chiral edge states have rich non-Hermitian skin effects due to that each branch of the chiral edge states have its own non-Hermitian properties. The total hybrid topological-skin effect comes from the NHSEs of the multiple chiral edge states as well as their interaction. We find that the scattering between these multiple non-Hermitian topological edge channels at the corner boundaries can induce an unconventional mechanism for the corner skin effect, which is distinct from the previous mechanisms solely associated with the nonreciprocal properties of the non-Hermitian edge states. With a simple and tunable design, the system is found to support non-Hermitian hybrid skin topological effects, exhibiting rich corner skin effects when the lattice symmetry is either C_{4} or C_{2}. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we introduce the non-Hermitian effective model of photonic checkerboard lattices and the topological phases, which provide the groundwork for realizing the NHSE. In Sec. III.1, we investigate the mixed skin-topological effects in the non-Hermitian effective model with C_{4} symmetry. We analyze the origin of corner skin modes from a dynamical perspective. The locations of different corner skin modes are influenced by various non-equilibrium interactions of topological edge states. In Sec. III.2, we explore the non-Hermitian effective model with C_{2} symmetry. Corner skin modes still exist, and we present the dynamic analysis process, finding that the locations of corner skin modes depend not only on the signs of group velocity and the gain/loss of topological edge states, but also on the contributions from the topological edge states. Finally, we conclude in Section IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07346v1,Unbounded Tellegen Response in Media with Multiple Resonances,"Tellegen response is a special type of nonreciprocal magneto-electric coupling which long remained elusive in photonics and extremely weak in condensed matter. It is widely accepted that the Tellegen coefficient is restricted by \chi^{2}<\epsilon\mu, where \varepsilon and \mu are permittivity and permeability of the material. Here, we demonstrate that this restriction is lifted in the medium with several close resonances, which provides a theoretical foundation for giant Tellegen response.","Artificially structured media enable exotic optical phenomena by tailoring light-matter interactions at subwavelength scales [1, 2, 3]. An example of such kind is bianisotropy also known as magneto-electric coupling [4]. In the simplest isotropic case it is captured by the constitutive relations \displaystyle{\bf D}=\varepsilon{\bf E}+(\chi+i\kappa){\bf H}\>, (1) \displaystyle{\bf B}=(\chi-i\kappa){\bf E}+\mu{\bf H}\>, (2) where \varepsilon and \mu are permittivity and permeability of the medium, while \kappa and \chi capture the effect of bianisotropy and are referred to as chirality and Tellegen response. In the absence of losses, both parameters are real. Chirality requires breaking of inversion symmetry and is ubiquitous in nature arising in many organic molecules with spiral structure. In contrast, Tellegen response is more exotic and occurs only if both inversion and time reversal symmetry of the medium are broken. Here, we focus on the latter response which was initially postulated by Tellegen in 1948 [5] and has since been a subject of active investigation. Initially, the very existence of the Tellegen response was disputed [6, 7, 8]. However, this debate is now resolved, as there are multiple examples of Tellegen media in condensed matter including magnetoelectrics (e.g. \mathrm{Cr}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3} [9]), multiferroics and topological insulators [10, 11]. Electromagnetics of those materials mirrors the equations of axion electrodynamics [12, 10]. However, the typical values of \chi are quite small ranging from 10^{-6} to 10^{-3} [13]. It is a commonly accepted notion [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 4] that the Tellegen response of isotropic medium is constrained by |\chi|\leq\sqrt{\varepsilon\mu} (3) Due to the small values of \chi in condensed matter, this constraint has never been approached. However, the situation has changed with the recent theoretical [19, 20, 21] and experimental [22] studies in photonics which suggested extremely strong Tellegen response of the order of 0.1-1. Although experimentally reported system is not yet bulk metamaterial, this creates tension between the established bound on the Tellegen coefficient and recent experimental findings. In this article, we prove that the restriction Eq. (3) on the Tellegen coefficient can be lifted if the medium possesses multiple spectrally close resonances, which lays the theoretical foundation for achieving strong Tellegen response. First, we reiterate the logic of the constraint Eq. (3). In the absence of sources and in the CGS system of units Maxwell’s equations take the form \displaystyle\mathop{\rm rot}\nolimits{\bf H}=\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial{\bf D}% }{\partial t}\>, (4) \displaystyle\mathop{\rm rot}\nolimits{\bf E}=-\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial{\bf B% }}{\partial t}\>, (5) \displaystyle\mathop{\rm div}\nolimits{\bf D}=0\>, (6) \displaystyle\mathop{\rm div}\nolimits{\bf B}=0 (7) with the constitutive relations Eqs. (1),(2). In monochromatic case, the latter two equations are a consequence of the first two and hence can be omitted. Without loss of generality, we denote the direction of propagation as z-axis and introduce the circular basis {\bf e}_{\pm}={\bf e}_{x}\pm i{\bf e}_{y}. The resulting equations for the amplitudes E_{\pm}, H_{\pm} of the circularly polarized modes read \displaystyle\varepsilon E_{\pm}+[\chi\mp in]H_{\pm}=0\>, (8) \displaystyle[\chi\pm in]E_{\pm}+\mu H_{\pm}=0\>, (9) n\equiv ck/\omega being a refractive index. Solving these equations yields the refractive index n=\sqrt{\varepsilon\mu-\chi^{2}}. Once |\chi|>\sqrt{\varepsilon\mu}, the refractive index becomes purely imaginary suppressing wave propagation. However, this does not mean that |\chi|>\sqrt{\varepsilon\mu} is impossible. It only means that the medium does not sustain the propagating modes. Such situation happens, for instance, in plasma below the plasma frequency and does not lead to any inconsistencies. Therefore, to derive the constraint on \chi, we compute the field energy in Tellegen medium neglecting losses and frequency dispersion and presenting energy density as a quadratic form [17, 18, 4] W=\frac{1}{16\pi}\begin{pmatrix}{\bf E}&{\bf H}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}% \varepsilon&\chi\\ \chi&\mu\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}{\bf E}\\ {\bf H}\end{pmatrix}^{*} (10) As the field energy must be non-negative, the material parameters should satisfy \chi^{2}\leq\varepsilon\mu\>,\quad\varepsilon>0\>,\quad\mu>0, (11) yielding the restriction Eq. (3). In the same spirit, we may consider a single Tellegen meta-atom [21] acquiring both electric {\bf d} and magnetic {\bf m} dipole moments in an external field. The dipole moments of such particle are expressed via polarizabilities taken scalar for simplicity: \displaystyle{\bf d}=\alpha^{ee}{\bf E}+\alpha^{em}{\bf H}\>, (12) \displaystyle{\bf m}=\alpha^{me}{\bf E}+\alpha^{mm}{\bf H}\>. (13) In case of Tellegen response both magneto-electric polarizabilities are real: \alpha^{em}=\alpha^{me}\in\rm I\!R. Neglecting frequency dispersion, we present the potential energy in the external field in the form U=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha^{ee}{\bf E}^{2}+\alpha^{mm}{\bf H}^{2}\right)-% \alpha^{em}{\bf E}\cdot{\bf H}\>. (14) As the potential energy should be non-positive for the arbitrary configuration of external field, \alpha^{ee}\geq 0, \alpha^{mm}\geq 0, and |\alpha^{em}|\leq\sqrt{\alpha^{ee}\alpha^{mm}}\>, (15) mirroring the constraints Eq. (11). Hence, in the absence of dispersion, i.e. away from the resonances of the medium, both bulk Tellegen response and magneto-electric polarizability of a single Tellegen particle are constrained in agreement with the early works. We now advance this description by introducing a single resonance in polarizabilitity. It is associated with the meta-atom eigenmode characterized by non-vanishing, collinear and in-phase electric and magnetic dipole moments. In such case, the analytical description of the meta-atom response should be based on its quasi-normal modes [23, 24]. However, to avoid the difficulties associated with the leaky nature of quasi-normal modes, we instead adopt conceptually similar quantum-mechanical methodology for computing electromagnetic response in the first-order of perturbation theory neglecting losses [25]. Technically, we analyze time-dependent Schrödinger equation \left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}-\hat{H}\right)\ket{\psi}=\hat{V}\ket{% \psi}\>, (16) where \hat{H} is an unperturbed Hamiltonian of the system, while \hat{V} quantifies the interaction with the incident electromagnetic field. We suppose that the system is electrically small and employ dipole approximation, assuming that the matrix elements of electric {\bf d} and magnetic {\bf m} dipole moments are significant, while the contribution of higher-order multipoles is negligible, therefore allowing us to recast the interaction Hamiltonian in the following form 2\hat{V}=-\hat{d}_{\beta}\hat{E}_{0\beta}e^{-i\omega t}-\hat{d}_{\beta}\hat{E}% _{0\beta}^{*}e^{i\omega t}\\ -\hat{m}_{\beta}\hat{B}_{0\beta}e^{-i\omega t}-\hat{m}_{\beta}\hat{B}_{0\beta}% ^{*}e^{i\omega t}\>. (17) Here {\bf E}_{0} and {\bf B}_{0} are complex amplitudes of the incident field, Greek indices denote vector components and the summation is performed over repeated indices. General first-order perturbation theory for the polarizabilities is provided in the appendix. In the simplest case of isotropic two-level system the set of polarizabilities reads \displaystyle\alpha^{ee}=\frac{2\omega_{10}}{3\hbar}\frac{||{\bf d}_{10}||^{2}% }{\omega_{10}^{2}-\omega^{2}}\>, (18) \displaystyle\alpha^{mm}=\frac{2\omega_{10}}{3\hbar}\frac{||{\bf m}_{10}||^{2}% }{\omega_{10}^{2}-\omega^{2}}\>, (19) \displaystyle\Im(\alpha^{em})=\frac{2\omega}{3\hbar}\frac{\Im{({\bf d}_{10},{% \bf m}_{10})}}{\omega_{10}^{2}-\omega^{2}}\>, (20) \displaystyle\Re(\alpha^{em})=\frac{2\omega_{10}}{3\hbar}\frac{\Re{({\bf d}_{1% 0},{\bf m}_{10})}}{\omega_{10}^{2}-\omega^{2}}\>. (21) Here, ({\bf a},{\bf b}) is a Hermitian product of the complex vectors {\bf a} and {\bf b}, i.e. {\bf a}^{*}\cdot{\bf b}, ||{\bf a}||^{2}\equiv({\bf a},{\bf a}), \omega_{jn} is the difference between j-th and n-th eigenfrequencies of the unperturbed system, \alpha^{me}=\left(\alpha^{em}\right)^{*} and \Re, \Im symbols stand for real and imaginary parts of the complex number. Real and imaginary parts of magneto-electric polarizability are readily identified as Tellegen response and chirality. From these expressions, we conclude that |\Re(\alpha^{em})|=\frac{2}{3\hbar}\frac{|\Re{({\bf d}_{10},{\bf m}_{10})}|}{|% \omega_{10}^{2}-\omega^{2}|}\leq\\ \frac{2}{3\hbar}\frac{||{\bf d}_{10}||\>||{\bf m}_{10}||}{|\omega_{10}^{2}-% \omega^{2}|}=\sqrt{\alpha^{ee}\alpha^{mm}}\>, (22) and the equality holds when {\bf d}_{10} and {\bf m}_{10} are in phase and parallel. Thus, in the presence of a single resonance, we recover the same restriction on magneto-electric polarizability Eq. (15), even though electric and magnetic polarizabilities can become negative at high frequencies. Essentially, this logic motivated the community to believe that the effective Tellegen response is restricted by Eq. (3), while Tellegen polarizability of a single particle is constrained by Eq. (15). However, this treatment is incomplete as it ignores an essential physical aspect: any Mie-resonant dielectric particle as well as any material has more than a single resonance. As we prove below, the interplay of close resonances allows to overcome the restriction Eq. (15) paving a way to strong Tellegen nonreciprocity. To illustrate that, we examine a system with two resonances (i.e. three-level system) using the same approach detailed in the appendix. Assuming isotropic ground state, we recover the polarizabilities \displaystyle\alpha^{em}=\frac{2}{3\hbar}\Big{[}\frac{1}{\omega_{10}^{2}-% \omega^{2}}(\omega_{10}\Re{({\bf d}_{10},{\bf m}_{10})}+i\omega\Im{({\bf d}_{1% 0},{\bf m}_{10})})+ \displaystyle\frac{1}{\omega_{20}^{2}-\omega^{2}}(\omega_{20}\Re{({\bf d}_{20}% ,{\bf m}_{20})}+i\omega\Im{({\bf d}_{20},{\bf m}_{20})})\Big{]}, (23) \displaystyle\alpha^{ee}=\frac{2}{3\hbar}\Big{[}\frac{\omega_{10}}{\omega_{10}% ^{2}-\omega^{2}}||{\bf d}_{10}||^{2}+\frac{\omega_{20}}{\omega_{20}^{2}-\omega% ^{2}}||{\bf d}_{20}||^{2}\Big{]}, (24) \displaystyle\alpha^{mm}=\frac{2}{3\hbar}\Big{[}\frac{\omega_{10}}{\omega_{10}% ^{2}-\omega^{2}}||{\bf m}_{10}||^{2}+\frac{\omega_{20}}{\omega_{20}^{2}-\omega% ^{2}}||{\bf m}_{20}||^{2}\Big{]}. (25) We introduce the following notation for the resonant Lorentz factors P(\omega_{i0})=\frac{2}{3\hbar}\frac{\omega_{i0}}{\omega_{i0}^{2}-\omega^{2}}. (26) For simplicity, we assume that the chiral response is absent, i.e. \Im({\bf d}_{i0},{\bf m}_{i0}). Hence, {\bf d}_{i0} and {\bf m}_{i0} are in phase and without loss of generality can be assumed real vectors. To check whether |\Re(\alpha^{em})|\leq\sqrt{\alpha^{ee}\alpha^{mm}} is satisfied, we examine the sign of the difference \Delta=\Re^{2}(\alpha^{em})-\alpha^{ee}\alpha^{mm}\>, (27) where \Delta>0 would indicate violation of restriction Eq. (15). Expanding expressions for polarizabilities yields \alpha^{ee}\alpha^{mm}=\\ P^{2}(\omega_{10})||{\bf d_{10}}||^{2}||{\bf m_{10}}||^{2}+P^{2}(\omega_{20})|% |{\bf d_{20}}||^{2}||{\bf m_{20}}||^{2}+\\ P(\omega_{10})P(\omega_{20})(||{\bf d_{10}}||^{2}||{\bf m_{20}}||^{2}+||{\bf d% _{20}}||^{2}||{\bf m_{10}}||^{2})\>, (28) \Re^{2}(\alpha^{em})=\\ P^{2}(\omega_{10})||{\bf d_{10}}||^{2}||{\bf m_{10}}||^{2}\cos^{2}\theta_{1}+% \\ P^{2}(\omega_{20})||{\bf d_{20}}||^{2}||{\bf m_{20}}||^{2}\cos^{2}\theta_{2}+% \\ 2P(\omega_{10})P(\omega_{20})||{\bf d_{10}}||\>||{\bf m_{10}}||\>||{\bf d_{20}% }||\>||{\bf m_{20}}||\cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2}, (29) where \theta_{i} is the angle between {\bf d}_{i0} and {\bf m}_{i0}. For clarity, we assume that {\bf d}_{i0} and {\bf m}_{i0} are parallel, i.e. \cos\theta_{i}=1. In such scenario \Delta=\Re^{2}(\alpha^{em})-\alpha^{ee}\alpha^{mm}=\\ -P(\omega_{10})P(\omega_{20})\>(||{\bf d_{20}}||\>||{\bf m_{10}}||-||{\bf d_{1% 0}}||\>||{\bf m_{20}}||)^{2}. (30) Expression in the brackets is always positive. Thus, the sign of the overall expression is defined by the sign of the two Lorentz factors -\frac{\omega_{10}\omega_{20}}{(\omega_{10}^{2}-\omega^{2})(\omega_{20}^{2}-% \omega^{2})}.

The resonances correspond to those in the Weyl-based meta-atom [21], with wavelengths \lambda_{1}=5 \mathrm{\mu}m, \lambda_{2}=5.36 \mathrm{\mu}m. Matrix elements of the dipole moments are chosen |d_{10}|=1.24,|d_{20}|=2.36,|m_{10}|=0.86,|m_{20}|=0.58 in arbitrary units. (a) Calculated dependence of polarizabilities on wavelength. (b) Wavelength dependence of the difference \Delta. Violation of restriction corresponds to \Delta>0. (c) Wavelength dependence of the difference \Delta^{\prime}, violation of restriction corresponds to \Delta^{\prime}>0. If \omega_{10}<\omega_{20}, the difference \Delta is negative for \omega<\omega_{10} and \omega>\omega_{20}. However, in the region between the resonances \omega_{10}<\omega<\omega_{20} the difference \Delta becomes positive, and thus the restriction on the Tellegen polarizability Eq. (15) is lifted. This conceptual conclusion is illustrated in Fig. 1, which depicts the polarizabilities computed for parameters close to Ref. [21] [Fig. 1(a)]. Figure 1(b) shows that the difference \Delta indeed takes positive values between the two resonances thus violating the celebrated restriction on the Tellegen response. Note that the above restriction is violated not due to the negative values of electric and magnetic polarizability, but rather due to the high \alpha^{em}, which is readily confirmed by plotting the difference \Delta^{\prime}=\Re^{2}(\alpha^{em})-|\alpha^{ee}\alpha^{mm}| in Fig. 1(c). To summarize, we have demonstrated that the Tellegen response of a non-reciprocal magneto-electric particle can exceed the bound Eq. (15) widely acknowledged in the literature. The conditions for that include several relatively close resonances and excitation frequency in the region between them. This provides an interesting parallel with related studies of chiral media [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] showing the possibility of strong chirality exceeding the limit \sqrt{\varepsilon\mu}. Even though our conclusion is based on a relatively simple model ignoring losses, we anticipate that the similar violation of restriction Eq. (15) occurs in realistic Mie-resonant meta-atoms typically featuring multiple spectrally close resonances. Accordingly, the metamaterial composed of such atoms is expected to violate Eq. (3) enabling strong Tellegen response. Our results provide the theoretical basis for achieving strong Tellegen response in artificial media paving a way to the enhanced nonreciprocal phenomena."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07926v1,Near-field refractometry of van der Waals crystals,"Common techniques for measuring refractive indices, such as ellipsometry and goniometry, are ineffective for van der Waals crystal flakes because of their high anisotropy and small, micron-scale, lateral size. To address this, we employ near-field optical microscopy to analyze the guided optical modes within these crystals. By probing these modes in MoS2 flakes with subwavelength spatial resolution at a wavelength of 1570\,\mathrm{nm}, we determine both the in-plane and out-of-plane permittivity components of MoS2 as 16.11 and 6.25, respectively, with a relative uncertainty below 1\%, while overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.","Introduction The discovery of the exceptional properties of graphene, enabled by a straightforward exfoliation technique to isolate monocrystalline graphitic films in the early 2000s Novoselov et al. (2004), ignited a search for other materials with layered structures held together by weak van der Waals (vdW) forces. These materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), have become a focal point in optoelectronics and quantum nanophotonics owing to their unique optical and electrical properties Song et al. (2024); Gonçalves et al. (2020); Reserbat-Plantey et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2021). Due to the layered structure of vdW materials, most of them are expected to exhibit giant anisotropy and even hyperbolic dispersion Gjerding et al. (2017), which cannot be found among previously known naturally occurring materials. TMDCs, for instance, display remarkable optical behavior; their monolayers, readily exfoliated from bulk crystals Novoselov et al. (2005); Velický et al. (2017); Frisenda et al. (2020), often exhibit optoelectronic properties distinctly different from those of their bulk counterparts Liu et al. (2016); Rasmussen and Thygesen (2015). Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), the TMDC considered in the present work, exemplifies this: it transitions from an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a 1.29 eV bandgap in bulk Böker et al. (2001) to a direct bandgap semiconductor with a 1.8–1.9 eV bandgap as a monolayer Mak et al. (2010); Li et al. (2014). Theoretical and computational advancements Cappelluti et al. (2013); Kormányos et al. (2015); Fang et al. (2015); Rasmussen and Thygesen (2015); Thygesen (2017) and experimental explorations Novoselov et al. (2005); Tang et al. (2014); Shen et al. (2013); Li et al. (2014); Yim et al. (2014) have propelled the understanding of vdW materials, yet the experimental characterization of their basic optical properties remains challenging. Exfoliated flakes are generally too small and non-uniform in thickness for traditional refractive index measurements, which limits precision in determining key optical parameters like the complex permittivity tensor. Understanding these optical properties is crucial for the design and optimization of devices based on vdW materials, such as metasurfaces Munkhbat et al. (2020), and could enable new applications previously limited by a lack of suitable materials with such unique properties. Some refractive index measurement methods rely on Snell’s law and goniometer setups to precisely measure refraction angles; however, they are ineffective for slab-like samples, where refraction results only in slight beam displacement. Techniques such as measuring critical angles for total internal reflection or using Brewster’s angle provide rough estimations but lack accuracy due to weak angular dependence. The most advanced method, ellipsometry, measures the change in polarization upon reflection, which is fitted by different models to extract the thickness and refractive index of the unknown layer. However, the precision of conventional spectroscopic ellipsometry relies on using a well-collimated beam with a spot size of >300\,\mathrm{\upmu m}, which is too large to make it reliable for the investigation of exfoliated flakes, because defects and non-uniformities are also illuminated Ermolaev et al. (2020); Munkhbat et al. (2022). This limitation is overcome in an imaging ellipsometry setup, which uses angled wide-field illumination and microscopy detection with an objective, claimed to have a lateral resolution below 10\,\mathrm{\upmu m} Ermolaev et al. (2021); Funke et al. (2016); Zotev et al. (2023). However, its primary purpose is imaging of material contrast, which might compromise the accuracy of refractive index measurements, especially for challenging samples as anisotropic TMDC flakes. Finally, the large refractive index of most TMDC materials results in low sensitivity of the above far-field methods to the out-of-plane component of the refractive index, because the incident illumination from the air even at large angles will be refracted to nearly normal direction inside the flake. FIG. 1: a) Artistic representation of the experiment where guided modes in an MoS2 flake are probed using a transmission s-SNOM setup. b) Differential interference contrast image of a t=185 nm thick MoS2 flake. The scale bar is 20 \mathrm{\upmu m}. c-d) Amplitude \left|E_{\mathrm{nf}}\right| and real part \mathrm{Re}\left\{E_{\mathrm{nf}}\right\} of the complex near-field map of the marked 40\,\mathrm{\upmu m} by 20\,\mathrm{\upmu m} region in panel b) (green dashed rectangle). The scale bar is 10 \mathrm{\upmu m}. e) Momentum-space representation of the complex near-field map, highlighting Fourier components associated with TE0 and TM0 modes. In contrast to far-field methods, scanning near-field microscopy (SNOM) bypasses the issue of lateral resolution. Here we implemented a method we termed ”near-field refractometry”, which works by probing guided modes within the material, whose properties are directly linked to the material optical properties Boroviks et al. (2022); Lebsir et al. (2022); Casses et al. (2022, 2024); Jang et al. (2024). Moreover, our approach demonstrated sensitivity to both in-plane and out-of-plane refractive index components, making it uniquely suited for measurements of highly anisotropic vdW materials. We demonstrate the precision and accuracy of our method by investigating a highly anisotropic vdW material, namely MoS2 Ermolaev et al. (2021), using a phase-resolved SNOM (Figure 1a). We map the near field of guided modes within MoS2 flakes of finite thickness (Figure 1c and d) at photon energies below the bandgap (\lambda_{0}=1570 nm), with a scan size as small as 40\,\mathrm{\upmu m} by 20\,\mathrm{\upmu m} (Figure 1b). First, the guided transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes are found by Fourier transforming the recorded near-field map (Figure 1e). After filtering in the Fourier domain, these modes are fitted in the direct space to extract their propagation constant. Finally, after collection of the thickness-dependent dispersion characteristics of these modes, we extract the anisotropic dielectric function of MoS2 and estimate its uncertainty."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07694v1,Collective multimode strong coupling in plasmonic nanocavities,"Plasmonic nanocavities enable access to the quantum properties of matter, but are often simplified to single mode models despite their complex multimode structure. Here, we show that off-resonant plasmonic modes in fact play a crucial role in strong coupling, and determine the onset of a novel collective interaction. Our analysis reveals that n strongly coupled plasmonic modes, introduce up to n(n+1)/2 oscillation frequencies that depend on their coupling strengths and detunings from the quantum emitter. Furthermore, we identify three distinct regions as the coupling strength increases: (1) single mode, (2) multimode, and (3) collective multimode strong coupling. Our findings enhance the understanding of quantum dynamics in realistic plasmonic environments and demonstrate their potential to achieve ultra-fast energy transfer in light-driven quantum technologies.","Strong coupling between light and matter is essential across various fields, as it connects nanophotonics, materials science, chemistry, and quantum technologies [1, 2, 3]. Strong light-matter coupling enables quantum emitters (QE) to coherently exchange energy with light, creating new polaritonic states that play a critical role in quantum information systems [4]. To reach the strong coupling regime, quantum emitters (such as molecular dyes, cold atoms and quantum dots) must be placed within regions of intense light, where light-matter interaction rates outpace losses. Therefore, plasmonic nanocavities (such as metallic nanostructures, dimers, and nanoparticle on mirror cavities) are ideal for realising strong coupling [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] as localised surface plasmons allow for exceptional subwavelength light confinement and extreme coupling strengths [11, 12]. In addition, they are straightforward to synthesize, chemically stable, and facilitate the precise positioning and alignment of molecules for reliable and highly reproducible experiments [13, 14, 15]. Theoretical descriptions reveal how these new polariton states emerge, and continue to guide experiments towards the generation of new quantum states. Although significant advancements have been made in describing QEs within plasominc nanocavities - accounting for more complex vibrational structures and larger numbers of molecules [16, 17, 18] - usually the underlying assumption is that they interact with just a single cavity mode. The single mode approximation originates from the analysis of Fabry-Pérot and photonic crystal cavities [19, 20, 21, 22], where modes are spectrally separated relative to their coupling strengths. However, multimode coupling has been shown to play an important role experimentally in some optical cavities [23, 24, 25, 26]. Plasmonic nanocavities in particular support a dense collection of modes that overlap in frequency, and often all exhibit significant field enhancements [27, 28, 29]. Although coupling to multiple plasmonic modes has been previously considered [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35] in general, the underlying origin and impact of the complex quantum dynamics that emerge in these multimode systems is still not known. In this work, we demonstrate that multiple, off-resonant plasmonic modes can significantly dominate the quantum dynamics of QEs in plasmonic nanocavities. In particular, we show that n strongly coupled modes introduce up to n(n+1)/2 distinct oscillation frequencies in the QEs excited state population. These frequency components depend on the number of strongly coupled modes, and their respective coupling strengths and detunings from the QE. In fact, we identify three distinct regions defined by the dipole moment: (1) single mode strong coupling, (2) multimode strong coupling, and (3) collective multimode strong coupling. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the quantum dynamics in multi-mode environments, and demonstrate how realistic plasmonic nanocavities can be used to achieve ultra-fast energy transfer, for use in light-driven quantum technologies."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07616v1,Stochastic resonance in vibrational polariton chemistry,"In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of ambient noise intensity on the rate modifications of ground-state chemical reactions in an optical cavity under vibrational strong-coupling conditions. To achieve this, we utilize a numerically exact open quantum system approach–the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space, combined with a flexible tree tensor network state solver. Our findings reveal a stochastic resonance phenomenon in cavity-modified chemical reactivities: an optimal reaction rate enhancement occurs at an intermediate noise level. In other words, this enhancement diminishes if ambient noise, sensed by the cavity-molecule system through cavity leakage, is either too weak or excessively strong. In the collective coupling regime, when the cavity is weakly damped, rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules couple to the cavity. In contrast, under strong cavity damping, reaction rates decline as the number of molecules grows.","Placing reactive molecules within an optical microcavity under conditions of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) has recently shown promise for manipulating chemical reactions, such as cavity catalysis and cavity-induced reaction selectivities, even in the absence of light.Ebbesen (2016) This concept has been demonstrated in several experiments, which suggests that adjusting the distance between two reflective dielectric mirrors in a Fabry-Pérot cavity so that the cavity frequency resonates with specific molecular vibrations can alter reaction rates or product ratios.Thomas et al. (2016); Vergauwe et al. (2019); Lather et al. (2019); Thomas et al. (2019); Hiura, Shalabney, and George (2019); Thomas et al. (2020); Hirai, Hutchison, and Uji-i (2020); Hirai et al. (2020); Sau et al. (2021); Lather et al. (2022); Ahn et al. (2023); Ebbesen et al. (2023) However, two independent experimental attempts to replicate these findings, while successfully reproducing VSC conditions, did not observe noticeable rate changes in an on-resonant cavity.Imperatore, Asbury, and Giebink (2021); Wiesehan and Xiong (2021) Different outcomes in the experiments suggest that additional factors beyond VSC, factors that may have been previously overlooked, could play a critical role in achieving cavity-induced modifications of ground-state chemical reactivities. In this study, we aim to explore one such experimental variable: the damping strength of the cavity mode. This damping, caused by ambient noise surrounding the cavity due to the unavoidable cavity leakage, may influence the extent of cavity-induced rate modifications. Naturally, this intriguing yet controversial phenomenon has spurred a substantial amount of theoretical research.Galego, Garcia-Vidal, and Feist (2016, 2017); Galego et al. (2019); Campos-Gonzalez-Angulo and Yuen-Zhou (2020); Mandal, Montillo Vega, and Huo (2020); Yang and Cao (2021); Li, Mandal, and Huo (2021a); Li, Nitzan, and Subotnik (2020); Li, Mandal, and Huo (2021b); Sun and Vendrell (2022); Schäfer et al.

(2023); Sokolovskii and Groenhof (2023); Pavošević, Smith, and Rubio (2023) Recent studies using quantum dynamical simulations underscore the necessity of a quantum discrete state description for both molecular vibrations and the cavity mode.Lindoy, Mandal, and Reichman (2023, 2024); Ying and Huo (2023); Hu, Ying, and Huo (2023); Ke, Borrelli, and Thoss (2022); Ke and Richardson (2024) However, this requirement introduces significant challenges, particularly in the collective regime, where a large ensemble of molecules couples to the cavity mode. To address the computational challenges, we employ the hierarchical equations (HEOM) of motion along with a tree tensor network state (TTNS) solver.Ke (2023) The HEOM method is a well-established, numerically exact approach for open quantum system dynamics,Tanimura and Kubo (1989); Yan et al. (2004); Ishizaki and Tanimura (2005); Xu and Yan (2007); Shi et al. (2009); Yan (2014); Jin, Zheng, and Yan (2008); Schinabeck, Härtle, and Thoss (2018); Hsieh and Cao (2018); Shi et al. (2018); Tanimura (2020) enabling a non-perturbative and non-Markovian treatment of system dynamics and bath-related observables. The TTNS,Shi, Duan, and Vidal (2006); Tagliacozzo, Evenbly, and Vidal (2009); Murg et al. (2010); Li, von Delft, and Xiang (2012); Changlani et al. (2013); Nakatani and Chan (2013); Lubich et al.

(2024) in addition, provides an efficient data compression scheme for storing and propagating the high-dimensional composite system-plus-bath wavefunction. To gain a preliminary understanding of how chemical reactions inside a cavity respond to ambient noise–stemming from interactions between the confined cavity mode and the continuum of far-field electromagnetic modes, which dampens the cavity’s oscillatory dynamics–we begin our study on the single-molecule level. Our results show that reaction rate enhancements within the cavity exhibit a typical stochastic resonance featureGammaitoni et al. (1998): neither excessively weak nor overly strong damping of cavity dynamics supports effective cavity-induced rate modifications. Instead, the rate constant inside a resonant cavity reaches its peak at an intermediate level of cavity damping. In the collective coupling regime, where multiple molecules are interconnected through a shared coupling with the cavity mode, rate modifications can display distinct behaviors as the system size grows. Under weak ambient noise, the rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules are coupled to the cavity mode. On the contrary, under conditions of strong cavity damping, the rate enhancement is attenuated with the increased number of coupled molecules. These observations lead us to ask an essential question: Could an ensemble of molecules on the macroscopic scale, immersed in a solvent and thus exposed to significant background noise, act cooperatively through collective coupling to the cavity mode, and synergetically harness a feeble external fluctuation to optimize the reaction efficiency? The following sections present a detailed account of our findings. Sec. II outlines an open quantum system model that describes chemical reactions in a condensed-phase optical cavity and the quantum dynamics methodology used. Sec. III presents and discusses the numerical results, followed by a summary and perspectives for our future research in Sec. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07517v1,"SoundSil-DS: Deep Denoising and Segmentation of 
Sound-field Images with Silhouettes","Development of optical technology has enabled imaging of two-dimensional (2D) sound fields. This acousto-optic sensing enables understanding of the interaction between sound and objects such as reflection and diffraction. Moreover, it is expected to be used an advanced measurement technology for sonars in self-driving vehicles and assistive robots. However, the low sound-pressure sensitivity of the acousto-optic sensing results in high intensity of noise on images. Therefore, denoising is an essential task to visualize and analyze the sound fields. In addition to denoising, segmentation of sound and object silhouette is also required to analyze interactions between them. In this paper, we propose sound-field-images-with-object-silhouette denoising and segmentation (SoundSil-DS) that jointly perform denoising and segmentation for sound fields and object silhouettes on a visualized image. We developed a new model based on the current state-of-the-art denoising network. We also created a dataset to train and evaluate the proposed method through acoustic simulation. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated and measured data. We confirmed that our method can applied to experimentally measured data. These results suggest that the proposed method may improve the post-processing for sound fields, such as physical model-based three-dimensional reconstruction since it can remove unwanted noise and separate sound fields and other object silhouettes. Our code is available at https://github.com/nttcslab/soundsil-ds.","Sound is one of the most important cues to understanding scenes as well as vision. For example, self-driving cars and assistive robots are equipped with ultrasonic sonars and microphones, which are used to gather information about their surroundings. Recently, research has been conducted on converting sound information into vision information and vice versa. Lindell et al. have proposed an acoustic non-line-of-sight imaging method for resolving three-dimensional object shapes hidden around corners through acoustic echoes [17]. Davis et al. have proposed a method with which sound waves are recovered through object vibrations captured using a high-speed camera [6]. Sheinin et al. have proposed a method of sensing sound at high speeds through object-surface vibrations [20]. These studies demonstrated the potential of capturing sound as images, paving the way for further advancements in the field. Figure 1: Conceptual diagram of proposed method. (a) Experimental setup for optical sound measurement, which is microphone-free sound measurement device. (b) Conceptual diagram. Sound field with interacting objects is captured as images with high-speed camera. Visualized images are converted to denoised and segmentation images with a DNN. A sound-visualization technique involving directly capturing and visualizing the density variations in air caused by sound has been proposed [27]. Such acousto-optic sensing can capture sound without any microphones by observing modulations of the phase of light passing through sound fields. By using high-speed cameras as sensors, it becomes possible to create visual representations of invisible sound waves as images [5, 22]. However, a significant challenge remains: the phase modulation of light induced by sound is extremely small, leading to a high level of noise in the measured images. Ishikawa et al. [4] have proposed deep sound-field denoiser (DSFD), the first denoiser to use deep neural networks (DNNs) for noise reduction in sound-field images, demonstrating that DNN-based methods achieve superior denoising performance compared with conventional filtering methods. With the optical technology and signal processing method, we can understand the nature of sound propagation. Therefore, the interaction between sound and objects, such as reflections and diffractions, can be visualized using acousto-optic sensing. To analyze such interactions between sound and objects, both denoising and segmentation of the sound field and object regions on visualized images should be done simultaneously. We propose a method for simultaneous denoising and segmentation of sound-field images including object silhouettes. A conceptual diagram is presented in Fig. 1. With this method, optically measured sound-field images with object silhouettes are denoised and segmented using a DNN. The sound field on the laser path is captured with a high-speed camera. The area where the object blocks the laser light can be visualized as noisy silhouettes in the visualized images. The visualized images are converted to denoised and segmentation images with the DNN. The DNN is constructed based on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) denoising network, which also has the potential for per-pixel feature segmentation. We created a dataset with acoustic simulation since there is no dataset that includes acoustic scattering by objects. Denoising and segmentation are expected to (1) enable analysis of the propagation, reflection, and diffraction of sound waves in space and (2) be used as an advanced measurement technology for sonars in self-driving vehicles and assistive robots. The contributions of our work are summarized as follows: • We propose a method for simultaneous denoising and segmentation of sound-field images with silhouettes. • We created a dataset considering acoustic scattering caused by various shapes of objects. • We confirmed that the proposed method performed effectively on denoising and segmentation tasks."

They have compelling applications in metrology, which has been demonstrated by their routine exploitation for improving the sensitivity of a gravitational-wave detector since 2010. Here, we report on the direct measurement of 15 dB squeezed vacuum states of light and their application to calibrate the quantum efficiency of photoelectric detection. The object of calibration is a customized InGaAs positive intrinsic negative (p-i-n) photodiode optimized for high external quantum efficiency. The calibration yields a value of 99.5 % with a 0.5% (k=2) uncertainty for a photon flux of the order 10^{17}\,s-1 at a wavelength of 1064nm. The calibration neither requires any standard nor knowledge of the incident light power and thus represents a valuable application of squeezed states of light in quantum metrology.","References (1) R.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07313v1,Quantum Metrology for Gravitational Wave Astronomy,"Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity predicts that accelerating mass distributions produce gravitational radiation, analogous to electromagnetic radiation from accelerating charges. These gravitational waves have not been directly detected to date, but are expected to open a new window to the Universe in the near future. Suitable telescopes are kilometre-scale laser interferometers measuring the distance between quasi free-falling mirrors. Recent advances in quantum metrology may now provide the required sensitivity boost. So-called squeezed light is able to quantum entangle the high-power laser fields in the interferometer arms, and could play a key role in the realization of gravitational wave astronomy.","I Gravitational waves Gravitational waves are ripples in space-time, i.e. dynamic changes in space curvature that propagate at the speed of light. According to GR they are transverse and quadrupolar in nature, have two polarization states, and are extremely weak. GWs of detectable amplitude cannot be generated on Earth, but a variety of known astrophysical and cosmological sources are predicted to emit gravitational radiation that should reach the Earth with a strength within reach SSc09 ; GWICweb . Whilst GWs have not yet been directly observed their existence is beyond doubt. A binary system of compact objects, such as neutron stars (as depicted in Figure 1) or black holes, emit GWs at twice their orbital frequency . The energy carried away by the GWs leads to a precisely predictable decay in the orbital period of the binary. Hulse and Taylor verified this mechanism for orbital decay to exquisite precision with observations of the binary pulsar system PSR1913+16, WTa05 . Their discovery is regarded as unequivocal, albeit indirect, proof of the existence of GWs that led to the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics. GWs from complex astrophysical sources carry a plethora of information that will have a major impact on gravitational physics, astrophysics and cosmology. GW signals are typically distinguished in one of four broad and often overlapping classes SSc09 ; GWICweb , based on expected waveforms, and hence optimal search techniques. They are: binary inspirals and mergers, burst sources, periodic sources, and stochastic sources. In the following we briefly review the physics and astrophysics that can be extracted from the observation of GWs emitted by these sources. Binary inspirals and mergers The final stages of life of neutron star binaries will provide the richest signals, see Fig. 1. As the binary loses energy, the orbital period decreases and enters the human audio frequency band. After another \approx 100 cycles the stars merge in a catastrophic explosion providing a GW burst signal of a few hundred Hertz up to a kiloHertz. The merger is expected to produce a black hole surrounded by a torus which will release a giant burst of gamma rays. Simultaneous observation of GWs and gamma rays would confirm that the merger of neutron stars is the engine of many of the observed short, hard gamma ray bursts AbbottETAL08a . Recent advances in numerical relativity now make it possible to make predictions of the waveforms generated around the merger BGR08 . Comparison with observed waveforms will provide accurate tests of GR in the hitherto untested strong-field regime. The imprint of tidal distortions on the GW waveform from a binary system with at least one neutron star will constrain the equation of state of the nuclear matter making up the star. Independent of the nature of the binary, the final state of the merger will be a perturbed black hole, whose oscillation modes will decay in time producing more gravitational radiation. Such observations offer a striking confirmation of the existence of black holes. The famous “no-hair” theorem says that black holes are completely characterized by their mass and angular momentum Chandrasekhar98 . Measuring the GWs emitted by black hole binary systems where the mass ratio of the components is large, the “no-hair” theorem can be tested. Direct observation of the gravitational waveforms from inspiralling black holes and neutron stars can also provide the luminosity distance to the source without any complex calibrations SSc09 . If, in addition, the redshift can be measured (via the identification of electro-magnetic counterparts), the Hubble parameter Sch86 , the dark energy and dark matter content of the Universe and the dark energy equation of state can be determined. Figure 2: Gravitational waves GWs are dynamical deformations of space-time perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. As a result, distances between free-falling test masses in a transverse plane will change with a strain h=\Delta L/L with quantities defined as shown. For a black hole or neutron star binary system with orbital frequency f_{\rm{BS}} distances will oscillate at twice that frequency f=f_{\rm{BS}}. The wavelength of this oscillation is given by \lambda=c/f with c the speed of light. Burst sources Burst sources refer to short-lived GW transients, the main known candidates being core-collapse supernovae and collapses to black holes DFM01 ; BRe06 . Observation of GWs will open a way to extract information about the dynamics occurring in the core of the supernova, and should complement and enhance the understanding gained from electromagnetic observations. Periodic sources Spinning compact objects will generate periodic GW signals depending on the degree of non-axisymmetric deformations OGu69 (departure from rotational symmetry is a necessary ingredient for generation of quadrupolar moments). Detection of GWs from such sources will confirm models of the underlying physics which might allow the growth of a “mountain” on a neutron star. The lack of observation of GWs from the Crab Pulsar at the sensitivity of current ground based detectors has already constrained its deviation from rotational symmetry AbbottETAL08a . The distribution of neutron stars in the Galaxy could be mapped out using GW observations. Spinning neutron stars currently invisible on Earth could be detected via their GW emission Abb09 . Stochastic sources Stochastic sources have both astrophysical and cosmological origins Peebles93 ; Mag00 . The “holy grail” is the Big Bang itself. In principle, we should be able to observe a relic background of GWs from the very early Universe, some time between 10-18 seconds and 10-9 seconds after the Big Bang, when light did not even exist. The electromagnetic analogue of this radiation is the cosmic microwave background, which gives information about conditions in the Universe 385,000 years after the Big Bang BenETAL03 ; SpeETAL03 . Gravitational radiation is the only way to observe the conditions in a much earlier epoch. Absence of a detectable stochastic background signal in current GW detectors has constrained certain models of the early Universe based on cosmic superstring population LIGO-Nat09 . Of course the most tantalizing sources are those we do not yet know exist. The opening of every major new electro-magnetic window to the Universe has revealed major surprises that have revolutionized our understanding of the Universe. Observing the Universe with an entirely new messenger will very likely continue this tradition. Frequencies of GWs GW astronomy targets phenomena that involve astronomically large masses in acceleration. This, in turn, leads to the expectation that GW emission frequencies will be low, typically below a few tens of kiloHertz. A black hole binary system, for example, has to have an orbital period of just 0.02 s in order to produce GWs at f=100 Hz (Fig. 2). Supernova explosions are expected to have a broad spectral emission, with components that may reach kiloHertz frequencies. However, the strongest detectable GWs are expected at lower frequencies, all the way down to the millihertz or even nanohertz regime. Strength of GWs Gravitational waves that reach the Earth are extremely weak. For example, the merger of two neutron stars at the other end of our galaxy (D\approx 50,000 light years away) would produce a GW strain amplitude of about h\approx 10^{-19} SSc09 . The same source at the distance of about 60 million light years, where the Virgo cluster which comprises up to 2000 Galaxies are located, would result in a corresponding strain amplitude of only h\approx 10^{-22}. With the sophisticated technology now available, such tiny strains of space-time can be detected and it is very probable that there will be numerous direct detections in the coming decade."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07311v1,GPU-Accelerated Inverse Lithography Towards High Quality Curvy Mask Generation,"Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) has emerged as a promising solution for photo mask design and optimization. Relying on multi-beam mask writers, ILT enables the creation of free-form curvilinear mask shapes that enhance printed wafer image quality and process window. However, a major challenge in implementing curvilinear ILT for large-scale production is mask rule checking, an area currently under development by foundries and EDA vendors. Although recent research has incorporated mask complexity into the optimization process, much of it focuses on reducing e-beam shots, which does not align with the goals of curvilinear ILT. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-accelerated ILT algorithm that improves not only contour quality and process window but also the precision of curvilinear mask shapes. Our experiments on open benchmarks demonstrate a significant advantage of our algorithm over leading academic ILT engines. Source code will be available at https://github.com/phdyang007/curvyILT.","Lithography plays a crucial role in semiconductor manufacturing. However, a mismatch between lithography technology and the critical dimensions of chips leads to the optical proximity effect, posing challenges to technological advancement. To mitigate this issue, chip design photomasks must be optimized to correct for lithography proximity distortion, a process known as mask optimization. Optical proximity correction (OPC) is the most widely used approach for mask optimization (OPC-DATE2015-Kuang, ; OPC-JM3-2016-Matsunawa, ; MEEF-TSM2000-Wong, ). It involves dividing the edges of chip design polygons into segments, which are then adjusted using heuristic rules to counteract optical proximity effects. However, as chip feature sizes continue to shrink, the limited robustness of heuristic optimization demands extensive engineering effort, jeopardizing design turnaround time and production yield. Inverse lithography technologies (ILT), with their gradient-based free-form optimization, provide a broader solution space that can effectively address critical patterns where traditional OPC falls short. Despite this advantage, ILT has long faced a dilemma: while free-form optimization leads to better convergence, it also presents a significant manufacturing challenge, as mask shops struggle to produce these complex free-form masks efficiently. A common workaround is to approximate the ILT-generated mask with rectangles, aligning the ILT output with OPC shape rules. However, this approach sacrifices some of the optimality that ILT offers. Recently, a multi-beam mask writer was introduced for advanced lithography mask manufacturing (mbmw, ). This innovation maintains a consistent mask production time, enabling the direct fabrication of freeform or curvilinear masks. Though curvilinear ILT faces mask writing challenges to enforce clearance of mask rule check (curvyMRC, ), it is now feasible to apply curvilinear inverse lithography technology (ILT) across a significant portion of chip design layers, leading to improved quality of results (QoR). The comparison among OPC, ILT, and Curvy ILT are listed in Table 1, and the development of Curvy ILT is our focus. Table 1. Mask optimization solution. Our efforts focus on the direct generation of curvy ILT, with a specifically designed algorithm for better curvature and reduced mask artifacts. Solution OPC ILT Curvy ILT Mask Writer Variable Shaped Beam Variable Shaped Beam Multibeam Mask Rule Manhattan Geometry Constraints Manhattan Geometry Constraints Width, Area, Curvature Efficiency Fast Slow Slow Solution Space Small Medium Large Optimizer Heurestic Gradient Gradient Example ILT has garnered significant attention in academic research due to its promising advantages. Much of this research has centered on enhancing algorithmic efficiency and optimizing the quality of the final simulated wafer. For example, Wang et al. (OPC-DAC2022-Wang, ) developed A2-ILT, introducing a spatial attention layer to regulate mask gradients, which however fails the growth of sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs)—a critical aspect for process window optimization. Additionally, Yu et al. (OPC-DATE2021-Yu, ) proposed using a level-set function to model the mask, improving smoothness during ILT procedures. More recently, an efficient ILT implementation was presented by Sun et al. (OPC-DAC2023-Sun, ), which has become the state-of-the-art by utilizing multi-level lithography simulations at different resolutions to achieve faster convergence. A similar implementation is also introduced in OpenILT (openilt, ). However, these efforts primarily address the mask manufacturing challenges associated with VSB technology and are not directly applicable to curvilinear mask optimization. For instance, there has been little focus on eliminating isolated artifacts that breach shape area constraints, and the balance between quality of results (QoR) and mask smoothness has not been adequately managed (OPC-DAC2023-Sun, ; OPC-DATE2021-Yu, ). To overcome the limitations of previous work and encourage further research into curvilinear ILT solutions, we introduce a new GPU-accelerated ILT algorithm that: 1) improves upon existing algorithms to achieve better optimality, and 2) addresses the challenges of curvilinear mask writing using differentiable morphological operators. Our major contributions include: • We thoroughly analyze the limitations of existing academic ILT algorithms and have developed a new algorithm that improves optimization convergence and enhances mask quality. • We develope the idea of curvilinear design retargeting to allow ILT solvers to optimize toward corner-smoothed targets leading to faster and better convergence. • We introduce a differentiable morphological operator that can be seamlessly integrated into legacy ILT algorithms to control mask curvature and shape without compromising the final quality of results (QoR). • We conduct experiments on layers from both real-world and synthetic designs, demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm. Reminder of the manuscript is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces related works and fundamental terminologies associated with mask optimization and ILT.; Section 3 provides a detailed description of the proposed ILT algorithm.; Section 4 presents a comprehensive analysis of the experimental results for our algorithm across various design layers; and Section 5 discusses future work and concludes the paper."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07236v1,Floquet Topological Dissipative Kerr Solitons and Incommensurate Frequency Combs,"Generating coherent optical frequency combs in micro-ring resonators with Kerr nonlinearity has remarkably advanced the fundamental understanding and applications of temporal dissipative solitons. However, the spectrum of such soliton combs is restricted to the conventional definition of combs as phase-locked, equidistant lines in frequency. Here, we introduce a new class of floquet topological soliton combs that emerge in two-dimensional arrays of strongly coupled resonators engineered using floquet topology. Specifically, we demonstrate novel incommensurate combs where the comb lines are not equidistant but remain phase-locked. These incommensurate combs are generated by self-organized, phase-locked floquet topological soliton molecules that circulate the edge of the array. We show that these floquet topological solitons are robust and they navigate around defects, allowing for agile tunability of the comb line spacing. Our results introduce a new paradigm in using floquet engineering to generate unconventional frequency combs beyond those achievable with single or weakly coupled resonators.","References [1] Cundiff, S.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07202v1,"Crossover from inhomogeneous to homogeneous response 
of a resonantly driven hBN quantum emitter","We experimentally investigate a solid-state quantum emitter —a B center in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)— that has lifetime-limited coherence at short times, and experiences inhomogeneous broadening due to spectral diffusion at longer times. By making use of power broadening in resonant laser excitation, we explore the crossover between the inhomogeneous and the homogeneous broadening regimes. With the support of numerical simulations, we show that the lineshape, count rate, second-order correlations and long-time photon statistics evolve from a regime where they are dictated by spectral diffusion to a regime where they are simply given by the homogeneous response of the emitter, yielding restored Lorentzian shape and Poissonian photon statistics. Saturation of the count rate and line broadening occur not at the onset of the Rabi oscillations, but when the power-broadened homogeneous response becomes comparable with the inhomogeneous linewidth. Moreover, we identify specific signatures in both the second-order correlations and long-time photon statistics that are well explained by a microscopic spectral diffusion model based on discrete jumps at timescales of micro- to milliseconds. Our work provides an extensive description of the photophysics of B-centers under resonant excitation, and can be readily extended to a wide variety of solid-state quantum emitters.","While a multitude of physical systems have demonstrated the ability to emit single photons on demand, only a small subset are suitable for applications to quantum technologies, considering the highly stringent requirements set on the single-photon sources in terms of coherence, stability and count rate. In particular, single-photon emitters (SPEs) in the solid state have a significant potential for integration Aharonovich16 ; Pelucchi22 ; Couteau23 , but typically suffer from the influence of the environment, which can yield pure dephasing Cassabois08 ; Flagg09 ; Tighineanu18 ; White21 and spectral diffusion (SD) Coolen09 ; Wolters13 ; Matthiesen14 ; Chen16 ; Spokoyny20 ; Fournier23PRB . Pure dephasing is fundamentally detrimental to photon indistinguisability. On the other hand, even in the absence of such fast process —if each of the emitted photons is perfectly coherent—, SD can cause effective dephasing by limiting the number of consecutive photons that can interfere with each other. However, it can in principle be counteracted by active feedback on the transition energy Prechtel13 ; Hansom14 . It is therefore essential to establish appropriate characterisation methods to identify and characterize these processes in depth. A combination of resonant laser excitation and photon correlations can efficiently characterize both dephasing and SD of individual quantum emitters Fournier23PRB ; Delteil24 . Based on this approach, in a prior work Fournier23PRB , we explored the purely inhomogeneous regime of a lifetime-limited emitter undergoing SD – a B-center in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). This family of emitters is characterized by a narrow electronic transition around 436 nm Fournier21 ; Shevitski19 ; Gale22 ; Fournier23PRA ; Horder22 . In the inhomogeneous broadening regime, if the atomic coherence is high enough, Rabi oscillations can nevertheless be observed in the g^{(2)} function above emitter saturation, despite the time-averaged linewidth being given by a large inhomogeneous distribution. This is understood in a simple picture where only the close-to-zero laser-emitter detuning periods efficiently contribute to the correlation measurement based on two-photon coincidences, which prevents effective damping of the measured Rabi oscillations. This allows a direct extraction of the atomic coherence time. Spectral diffusion then impacts the second-order correlation function at longer times, since center wavelength fluctuations are converted to intensity fluctuations under cw resonant excitation Fournier23PRB ; Delteil24 . Here, we take benefit from the power broadening phenomenon Loudon to use the laser power as a knob for tuning the spectral width of the homogeneous response of the emitter, allowing us to explore the crossover between the inhomogeneous and the homogeneous broadening regime of a resonantly driven emitter. The key is the observation of a single-photon emitter with a inhomogeneous linewidth a factor 10 above the natural linewidth, and that can be driven well above saturation, such that the power-broadened homogeneous linewidth exceeds the SD spectral distribution. This allows to explore the full range of regimes using a single quantum emitter. Using a conceptually simple description, we consistently account for the entirety of the SPE photophysics under resonant excitation. Our investigation includes the decay of Rabi oscillations, the line broadening, as well as the photon statistics at long times – namely, the second-order correlation function and the intensity fluctuations of the photon counts. We show that the crossover is associated with an effective saturation of the count rate, which does not correspond to the onset of Rabi oscillations at \Omega_{R}=\Gamma_{1}/\sqrt{2}, but to the situation where the power-broadened homogeneous linewidth saturates the total linewidth, i.e. \Omega_{R}\sim\Delta\omega_{\mathrm{inhom}}. Given that the particular microscopic process associated with SD can leave characteristic signatures in the photon statistics Delteil24 , we then study the impact of SD on long-time photon correlations as well as the intensity fluctuations. Based on the observed signatures, we associate SD in B centers to a process that can be faithfully described by a Gaussian random jump model Spokoyny20 ; Utzat19 ; Delteil24 , as we show based on statistical analysis and numerical simulations. Our work provides a full picture of the photon statistics of spectrally diffusive two-level systems, applicable to both inhomogeneously broadened and close-to-homogeneous emitters. It sheds light on the apparent contradiction between saturation power deduced from Rabi oscillations and from count rate saturation. It also reconciles linewidth and coherence measurements based on Rabi oscillations in resonant excitation under arbitrary inhomogeneous broadening. Altogether, our investigation deepens the understanding of photon statistics of resonantly driven quantum emitters. By applying our approach to B-centers in hBN, we provide valuable additional knowledge about their photophysics and their spectral diffusion mechanisms."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06947v1,Focused ion beam polishing based optimization of high-Q silica microdisk resonators,"Whispering gallery mode (WGM) microdisk resonators are promising optical devices that confine light efficiently and enable enhanced nonlinear optical effects. This work presents a novel approach to reduce sidewall roughness in SiO2 microdisk resonators using focused ion beam (FIB) polishing. The microdisks, with varying diameter ranging from 5 to 20 \mum are fabricated using a multi-step fabrication scheme. However, the etching process introduces significant sidewall roughness, which increases with decreasing microdisk radius, degrading the resonators’ quality. To address this issue, a FIB system is employed to polish the sidewalls, using optimized process parameters to minimize Ga ion implantation. White light interferometry measurements reveal a significant reduction in surface roughness from 7 nm to 20 nm for a 5 \mum diameter microdisk, leading to a substantial enhancement in the scattering quality factor (Qss) from 3\times 10^{2} to 2\times 10^{6}. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of FIB polishing in improving the quality of microdisk resonators and open up new possibilities for the fabrication of advanced photonic devices.","Whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators are optical devices that leverage the phenomenon of waveguiding by curved boundaries, akin to acoustic whispering galleries. These resonators can achieve high quality factors, enabling efficient light-matter interaction, which combined with their compact design allows for enhanced nonlinear optical effects[1], crucial for applications in nonlinear and quantum optics[2] and sensing[3]. WGM resonators can have various geometries that significantly influence their optical properties and applications, such as spherical, cylindrical, and ring configurations. These resonators are primarily characterized by their axisymmetric shapes, which facilitate the confinement of light through total internal reflection. Microdisks offer several advantages in optical applications, particularly in terms of quality factors, integration capabilities, and lasing efficiency. Microdisks can be easily integrated with fiber optics and other photonic components, allowing for robust coupling and versatile applications in photonic integrated circuits [4]. The ability to parallel integrate multiple microdisks with a single fiber taper enhances their utility in complex systems. Microdisks can achieve exceptionally high quality factors (Q), which is crucial for applications requiring low loss and high sensitivity [5]. While microdisks can achieve high Q values, they often face limitations that affect their performance in practical applications. Figure 1: Schematic of sidewall polishing using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technique Figure 2: Fabrication process flow for Silica microdisk with smooth sidewalls Both subtractive as well as additive fabrication processes have been employed for microdisks [6], on different material platforms. For instance, microdisk resonators were fabricated from an organic semiconductor material using vacuum vapor deposition and photolithography without dry etching [7]. Electron-beam direct-writing was employed to fabricate microdisk resonators with high-quality factors [8], ion slicing and wafer bonding for lithium niobate microdisk resonators [9], direct laser writing for polymeric microdisks on silicon [10], and wet etching for silica-based microcavities [11]. The fabrication of high-quality silicon optical microdisk resonators on silicon-on-insulator wafers was demonstrated using resist reflow and low-damage plasma dry etching [12]. These techniques offer various advantages in terms of scalability and ease of fabrication. Thus, the fabrication of microdisk resonators involves a range of materials and methods tailored to specific requirements such as high quality factors, tunability, and efficient coupling. While diverse approaches including resist reflow, dry etching, ion slicing, direct laser writing, and wet etching have been used to realize microdisk resonators with desired characteristics, most of these techniques result in sidewall roughness at multiple stages of the fabrication process. Interference fringes in photoresist used in lithography [13], formation of ripples during etching [14], gas flow rate, platen power, etching cycle time [15] can all be the parameters affecting sidewall roughness. Figure 3: (a) Wavelength-dependent variation of the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) for the SiO2 film deposited; (b) SEM image of the microdisk post DRIE, (inset) an optical micrograph of the same disk Sidewall roughness in microdisk cavities can be eliminated or reduced through various post-processing techniques and fabrication optimizations. The choice of method depends on factors such as the material used, the desired level of smoothness, and the specific requirements of the application. Chemo-mechanical polishing has been demonstrated to significantly reduce surface roughness in silica microdisks, resulting in ultra-high quality factors exceeding 10^{8} [16]. Thermal reflow techniques have shown promise in reducing sidewall roughness and associated optical scattering loss in high-index-contrast, sub-micron waveguides [17]. Wet chemical polishing combined with dry etching has been successfully applied to GaN sidewalls, removing etching damages and smoothing vertical sidewalls [18]. Femtosecond laser polishing has emerged as a flexible and non-contact method for post-processing additively manufactured parts, including sidewalls [19]. Resist reflow techniques, such as the chip-upending method, have been shown to reduce line edge roughness in submicron single-mode waveguides [20]. However, these techniques generally require complex fabrication techniques and precise control of parameters that alter the morphology of the designed microcavity. In this work, we propose using a focused ion beam to deterministically reduce the roughness by polishing the sidewalls of the microcavity (Figure 1). This method retains the shape and dimensions of the microcavity and allows for a sub-nanometer resolution of control of polishing."

In this Letter we propose a generalization of the interaction by considering linearly chirped electron wave packets interacting with chirped optical fields. We theoretically demonstrate that when matching the chirp parameters of the electron and light waves, the interaction leads to partial monochromatization of the electron spectra in one of the energy side-bands. Depending on the coherence time of the electrons, the electron spectrum may be narrowed down by a factor of 5-times with 26% of the electron distribution in the monochromatized energy band. This approach will improve the spectral resolution and reduce color aberrations in ultrafast imaging experiments with free electrons.","Acknowledgements The authors acknowledge funding from the Czech Science Foundation (project 22-13001K), Charles University (SVV-2023-260720, PRIMUS/19/SCI/05, GAUK 90424) and the European Union (ERC, eWaveShaper, 101039339).

However, despite extensive explorations of a low-loss and versatile integrated platform for Brillouin photonic circuits, current options fall short due to limited technological scalability or inadequate SBS gain. Here we introduce the thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform as the go-to choice for integrated Brillouin photonics applications. We report the angle-dependent strong SBS gain in this platform, which can overcome the intrinsic propagation loss. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first stimulated Brillouin laser in TFLN with a tuning range >20 nm and utilize it to achieve high-purity RF signal generation with an intrinsic linewidth of 9 Hz. Finally, we devise a high-rejection Brillouin-based microwave photonic notch filter, for the first time, integrating an SBS spiral, an on-chip modulator, and a tunable ring all within the same platform. This TFLN-based Brillouin photonics engine uniquely combines the scalability of this platform and the versatility of SBS. Moreover, it bridges SBS with other functionalities in the TFLN platform, unlocking new possibilities for Brillouin-based applications with unparalleled performances.","Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), arising from the coherent interaction between photons and phonons, is transforming integrated photonics Eggleton2019BrillouinPhotonics .

Furthermore, manipulating its phase matching condition gives rise to on-chip non-reciprocal devices Kim2015non-transparency ; Zhou2024NonreciprocalModes . Finding a versatile photonics platform that supports SBS is nevertheless challenging. Strong on-chip SBS gain requires large photoelastic coefficients of the material, simultaneous guidance of both the optical and acoustic waves, and low propagation loss of the platform.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06495v1,"Chiral quantum optics: recent developments, and future directions","Chiral quantum optics is a growing field of research where light-matter interactions become asymmetrically dependent on momentum and spin, offering novel control over photonic and electronic degrees of freedom. Recently, the platforms for investigating chiral light-matter interactions have expanded from laser-cooled atoms and quantum dots to various solid-state systems, such as microcavity polaritons and two-dimensional layered materials, integrated into photonic structures like waveguides, cavities, and ring resonators. In this perspective, we begin by establishing the foundation for understanding and engineering these chiral light-matter regimes. We review the cutting-edge platforms that have enabled their successful realization in recent years, focusing on solid-state platforms, and discuss the most relevant experimental challenges to fully harness their potential. Finally, we explore the vast opportunities these chiral light-matter interfaces present, particularly their ability to reveal exotic quantum many-body phenomena, such as chiral many-body superradiance and fractional quantum Hall physics.","Generally speaking in physics, chirality refers to situations where the mirror image of a physical state does not possess the same properties as the original. This feature has many intriguing manifestations in the context of light-matter interactions, leading to various momentum- and spin-dependent phenomena in both photonic and electronic degrees of freedom. The definition of what is chiral varies across different fields. Therefore, in the next Section II, we begin by introducing the basic definitions and concepts that we will use later in this Perspective. The mechanisms section provides a concise introduction to the key concepts required to study chiral quantum optics. We then discuss recent developments in experimental platforms in Section III. In Section IV, we present our view on potential future directions in the field of chiral quantum optics, ranging from single particles to many-body phenomena. We believe such a Perspective is timely, given the rapid evolution of this field since the visionary article by P. Lodahl et al. from 2017 [1]. This evolution has occurred not only in experimental platforms but also conceptually, with new types of chiral light-matter interactions emerging beyond what was referenced. Figure 1: Basic concepts in chiral quantum optics systems. Upper panel: Spin-momentum locking. An electromagnetic mode propagating in the +z direction of a dielectric waveguide (panel a) has a distribution of electric field intensity shown in panel b. For concreteness, the waveguide’s height and width are chosen to be 140 nm and 280 nm, respectively, and the electric field propagation of wavelength \lambda\!=\!940 nm is considered. The polarization of such a mode is determined by a position-dependent superposition of its transversal and longitudinal field components with a relative phase that varies from 0 to 2\pi. This leads to regions where the direction of propagation and the circular degree of polarization are locked, as shown in panel c. S_{3}\!=\!2\rm{Im}\{E_{x}E_{y}^{*}\}/|E|^{2} is the degree of circular polarization for the mode shown in b. In the presence of an external magnetic field that is perpendicular to the propagation direction, the circularly polarized transitions of the emitter are split. In this scenario, spin-momentum locking manifests as directional emission for each transition depending on the emitter’s position. (d) For a \sigma^{+}-polarized point source positioned in the upper (lower) part of the waveguide indicated by the dashed circle, the emission is preferentially in the right (left) direction of the waveguide. The emission direction will be reversed for \sigma^{-}-polarized point source (not shown)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06340v1,"Deep Learning in Classical X-ray Ghost Imaging for
Dose Reduction","Ghost imaging (GI) is an unconventional technique that combines information from two correlated patterned light fields to compute an image of the object of interest. A standard pixelated camera records the structure of one light field (that does not interact with the object), and a bucket detector (or single-pixel camera) measures the total intensity of the second light field that is transmitted or scattered by the object. GI can be performed with visible light as well as penetrating radiation such as x-rays, electrons, etc. Penetrating radiation is usually ionizing and damages biological specimens; therefore, minimising the dose of this radiation in a medical or biological imaging context is important. GI has been proposed as a potential way to achieve this. With prior knowledge of the object of interest, such as sparsity in a specific basis (e.g., Fourier basis) or access to a large dataset for neural network training, it is possible to reconstruct an image of the object with a limited number of measurements. However, low sampling does not inherently equate to low dose. Here, we specifically explore the scenario where reduced sampling corresponds to low-dose conditions. In this simulation-based paper, we examine how deep learning (DL) techniques could reduce dose in classical x-ray GI. Since GI is based on illumination patterns, we start by exploring optimal sets of patterns that allow us to reconstruct the image with the fewest measurements, or lowest sampling rate, possible. We then propose a DL neural network that can directly reconstruct images from GI measurements even when the sampling rate is extremely low. We demonstrate that our deep learning-based GI (DLGI) approach has potential in image reconstruction, with results comparable to direct imaging (DI) at the same dose. However, given the same prior knowledge and detector quantum efficiency, it is very challenging for DLGI to outperform DI under low-dose conditions. We discuss how it may be achievable due to the higher sensitivity of bucket detectors over pixel detectors.","X-ray technology is widely used to produce 2D and 3D images of structures inside the human body. Nevertheless, since x-rays are a form of ionizing radiation, overdoses of medical x-ray imaging may result in higher cancer incidence rates [1]. Consequently, there must be a trade-off between gaining more information or achieving higher image quality and minimising x-ray dose. In excised samples, an excessive dose can damage the structure, thus distorting the resulting images. So, “how can we reduce the dose while still obtaining a useful image?” becomes an important question. It has been proposed that ghost imaging has the potential to achieve this [2]. Ghost imaging (GI) is a new paradigm in imaging that was first realised using entangled photon pairs in the field of quantum optics late last century (see [3]). Classical variants were later realised using thermal light with structured/patterned illumination since only the position correlation property of the entangled photons was required [3]. The GI measurement process is outlined in Sec. II.1 and the image computation is detailed in Sec. III.1. Classical GI has now been extended from visible light to penetrating radiation such as x-rays [4, 5], electrons [6], neutrons [7], etc. The x-ray ghost imaging technology has been utilised in two-dimensions by Zhang et al. [8] and Pelliccia et al. [5], as well as in three-dimensions by Kingston et al. [9]. Without prior knowledge of the specimen, it is challenging to recover high quality images using classical GI. Kingston et al. showed that direct imaging or a scanning probe will always produce better results than classical GI under the same photon-shot noise [2]. However, classical GI can become advantageous when we have prior knowledge of the imaging object. It becomes theoretically possible to reconstruct the object with fewer measurements, thus resulting in reduced radiation dose, preventing the object from being damaged in biological-imaging settings. One way to achieve this is through compressed sensing (CS), in which an image is assumed to be sparse in a particular transform space or domain, (e.g., the Fourier space), allowing images to be reconstructed under a low sampling rate [10]. However, this requires an extremely sparse object image in some particular basis, and this is rarely satisfied. Another method is through artificial intelligence techniques such as deep learning [11], using a large dataset that encapsulates the prior knowledge to train a neural network. For example, Wang et al. have developed a neural network with a structure based on eHoloNet [12] that outperforms other ghost imaging reconstruction methods even when the sampling rate is low [13]. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of dose reduction in x-ray ghost imaging through deep learning. There have been many studies investigating GI with deep learning (e.g. [13, 14, 15]), even in the context of x-ray imaging [16] and neutron imaging [17]. Lyu et al. [15] showed that their deep learning ghost imaging approach outperforms classical compressive sensing techniques at extremely low sampling rates. Inspired by this, we aim to further explore its application in low-dose conditions. While a low sampling rate is often associated with a low-dose condition, it is not a direct correlation; it is possible to have a low sampling rate but a high dose, i.e., a significant amount of x-ray radiation is used. Hence, this work explores the application of deep learning ghost imaging (DLGI) in extremely low-dose conditions. We first assume that fewer measurements lead to a lower dose under the same conditions. We then attempt to find optimal illumination patterns and develop a neural network that minimises the number of measurements while still obtaining sufficient image information with a reasonable computation time. Following that, we compare our DLGI recovered images with images produced by conventional direct imaging subjected to the same total dose, to see if dose reduction can be achieved through this DLGI approach to classical x-ray ghost imaging. Note that in our simulations, we assume the same detector quantum efficiency in the comparison, where DLGI will be at an inherent disadvantage compared to direct imaging. In practice, we would anticipate an increase in measured flux in the GI data while maintaining the same dose on the object (see Sec. V.3)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06134v1,Bridging classical and quantum approaches in optical polarimetry: Predicting polarization-entangled photon behavior in scattering environments,"We explore quantum-based optical polarimetry as a potential diagnostic tool for biological tissues by developing a theoretical and experimental framework to understand polarization-entangled photon behavior in scattering media. We investigate the mathematical relationship between Wolf’s coherency matrix in classical optics and the density matrix formalism of quantum mechanics which allows for the extension of classical Monte Carlo method to quantum states. The developed generalized Monte Carlo approach uniquely integrates the Bethe-Salpeter equation for classical scattering, the Jones vector formalism for polarization, and the density matrix approach for quantum state representation. Therefore, this unified framework can model both classical and quantum polarization states, handle multi-photon states, and account for varying degrees of entanglement. Additionally, it facilitates the prediction of quantum state evolution in scattering media based on classical optical principles. The validity of the computational model is experimentally confirmed through high-fidelity agreement between predicted and measured quantum state evolution in tissue-mimicking phantoms. This work bridges the gap between classical and quantum optical polarimetry by developing and validating a comprehensive theoretical framework that unifies these traditionally distinct domains, paving the way for future quantum-enhanced diagnostics of tissues and other turbid environments.","Whether atmospheric aerosols, particulate matter, or biological tissues, each of the mentioned examples can be described as a turbid scattering medium. Optical metrology of such substances proved substantial for maintaining free-space optical communication links [1, 2], routine environmental monitoring [3], or characterization of biomedical samples [4], and, at the same time is challenged by the high optical losses of the probing light. This happens mainly due to a wide range of angles within which the photon can change its propagation direction upon each scattering event. Under such conditions, interpretation of the transmitted scalar intensity modulation induced by the sample often resigns in favor of vectorial polarization-based sensing, which implies examining the polarization response of an object/medium of interest and is known as optical polarimetry [5]. Among others, this technique offers insights into such internal characteristics of the specimen as chirality, anisotropy, and morphology [6, 7, 8], which are valuable for technical inspection, biomedical diagnostics, remote sensing and other fundamental and applied problems. Nowadays, intensive research activities are undertaken to boost the performance of optical metrology via employment of non-classical states of light. Examples of leveraging quantum light include the possibility to surpass the shot noise in imaging using two-photon correlated states [9], increasing the phase measurement sensitivity with squeezed states [10], and imaging with photons never interacting with the sample [11]. Recent years have shown a growing interest in application of quantum light also for polarization-based sensing. Here, one should mention the development of a general theoretical framework [12], experimental realization of nonlocal polarimetry [13, 14], and the evaluation of sensitivity enhancement in polarization sensing with NOON states [15, 16, 17]. Particularly attractive is the employment of polarization-entangled photons, which find extensive interest in quantum communication and sensing [18, 19]. Among findings relevant for biomedical diagnostics, it is worth mentioning theoretical prediction of entanglement conservation through a scattering medium [20] and first experiments indicating deeper penetration into a biological tissue [21]. In our earlier works, we have proved the applicability of polarization-entangled photons for sensing of samples with subtle polarization response including monolayer cell cultures and aqueous solutions of microorganisms [22, 23] and demonstrated enhanced precision of polarimetric measurement enabled by utilization of the entangled photon pairs [24]. Recently, we have also reported on a framework towards nonlocal polarization-based classification with substantially reduced number of measurements per sample [25, 26]. Nevertheless, quantum polarimetry still remains in the dawn of its establishment. In pursuit of real-life applications of quantum enhanced polarimetry for the quantitative diagnostics of practically relevant samples like biomedical tissues or other turbid environments, the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms behind the evolution of quantum states of light upon interaction with the sample under study is highly demanded and is not yet available. Taking into account the broad employment of polarization-entangled photons, the studies of such photonic states stand out as particularly important. Here, the possibility to interpret and predict the behavior of the probing photonic state dependent on the sample’s optical properties is a prerequisite for establishment of optimal measurement algorithms and definition of appropriate metrological metrics. In the present study, we focus on the field of biomatter-light interaction and refer to Monte Carlo (MC) modelling to approach the problem of fundamental understanding, interpretation and prediction of the polarization-entangled photons behavior driven by the medium under study. MC techniques are widely recognized as efficient tools for studying light transfer within biological tissues and other examples of turbid medium [27, 28, 29, 30] that find applications in such hot topics as early cancer diagnostics [31], photodynamic therapy [32], and many others [4, 33]. Particularly, we refer to the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) to track the polarization state of light attenuated by the turbid medium [34, 35, 36, 27]. This method, allowing to overcome the problem of polarized light tracing impossible in the early MC models [37], co-exists with the treatment of the polarized light via the vector radiative transfer equation (VRTE) [38, 39, 29, 40]. Both VRTE and BSE approaches ensure independent comprehensive means to follow photon polarization evolution induced by scattering, while exhibiting a fundamental relation between each other which has only recently been established [41]. The BSE framework appears especially notable for modelling polarization-entangled photonic states, since it inherently allows to trace different polarization states of each photon along its trajectory, simultaneously and independently. Another advantage of the BSE-based MC modelling is its close connection to the Jones vector formalism [42, 43, 27]. It implies the possibility to directly evaluate Wolf’s coherency matrix both for single photons and for photon ensembles and allows intuitive physical interpretation of the multiple scattering process via ladder diagrams [34, 43]. MC techniques have been already extensively used for addressing nontrivial quantum problems. The family of approaches known as Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have been employed to estimate the quantum state of many-body systems and investigate the behavior of complex quantum ensembles via wave function sampling [44, 45]. In this study, in contrast to QMC, we employ the MC principles to mimic the scattering process in a quantum channel and introduce a new model to expand the applicability of the approach to prediction of any two-photon quantum state evolution after interaction with a turbid medium. As an example, we consider a Bell state in the form |\Psi^{+}\rangle=1/\sqrt{2}(|HV\rangle+|VH\rangle) and scattering of one of its partner photons within a tissue mimicking phantom. The latter imitates the behavior of a real biomedical sample [46] whereas the exploited scenario can be translated to atmospheric aerosols, particulate matter, and other scattering media. We discuss in detail the performance of MC modelling for the described scenario and prediction of the photonic state evolution. We support our theoretical findings with a corresponding experimental demonstration. Hereby, the choice of the photonic state and sample within the study and the presented results appear interdisciplinary and bridging the fields of turbid medium optics and quantum enhanced technologies. This emphasizes the impact of the presented study and its importance for perspective applications ranging from biomedical metrology to quantum communication and remote sensing."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07131v1,Concurrence-Driven Path Entanglement in Phase-Modified Interferometry,"In this study, a novel experimental setup analogous to joint spin/polarization measurement experiments is proposed by establishing a direct relationship between path (momentum) entanglement and concurrence. The results demonstrate that joint-detection probabilities can be governed not only by phase shifts but also by concurrence, which arises from the angle between the motion direction of particles from the same source and the Beam Splitter (BS) axis. This approach aims to set a new standard in entanglement measurement by integrating path entanglement within a concurrence-based framework. Here, we first examine phase-retarder-modified Mach-Zehnder (MZ) configurations within single-quanton systems, subsequently extending this approach to two-quanton systems to establish a connection between spatial correlations and concurrence. Last, by analyzing joint-detection probabilities across various BS configurations, we evaluate the potential of these setups as analogs for spin/polarization measurement experiments.","In classical mechanics, the state of a physical system is the precise information of the position and momentum of all degrees of freedom constituting the system at any given time. However, in the quantum paradigm, the inability to precisely determine such dynamic parameters simultaneously leads to a radical change of the state concept, now characterized by wave functions. Within this framework, physical quantities are described by probability distributions, emphasizing the novel significance ascribed to the wave function. Composite systems are formed by combining two or more independent subsystems, which allows for quantum correlations. When the state of the composite system can be represented as a single tensor product of discrete and normalized states, it is classified as a product state. Conversely, if no such representation exists, the system is identified as a pure entangled state, capturing the intrinsic quantum correlations between its subsystems. Entanglement measures [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7] are crucial in emerging quantum technologies, impacting fields such as quantum computing [8; 9], ion trapping [10; 11], and precision sensor devices [12; 13] that surpass classical limitations. For two-quanton systems, the simplest and most compact method to determine the entanglement measure is the concurrence [1]. The concurrence numerically expresses the strength of entanglement between two quantons, ranging from 0 to 1, and provides a practical and concise indication of the correlation between the subparts. Accordingly, when C=0, the system represents product states in which the parts are independent, whereas C=1 indicates the existence of maximally entangled quantum states. These experiments are often conducted by examining correlations in light polarizations within complex setups using Mach-Zehnder (MZ) type interferometers [14; 15], or by analyzing spin correlations of moving particle in Bell-type experiments [16; 17; 18; 19]. Considering this framework, path (momentum) entanglement has also consistently emerged as a theoretically intriguing option [20; 21; 22; 23; 24; 25]. However, the fact that measurement probabilities for particles in maximally entangled states can only be controlled by phase shifts limits experimental flexibility and makes achieving precision challenging in the current theory. In this study, a direct relationship between path entanglement and concurrence is established, and a novel experimental setup is proposed to effectively utilize path entanglement in entanglement measurement experiments. The results demonstrate that the measure of the entanglement can be controlled not only through phase shifts but also by the angles between the direction of motion of particles produced from the same source with the Beam Splitter (BS) axis, and thus by concurrence. This approach provides substantial experimental flexibility and enables the construction of analogous setups for polarization/spin experiments. Consequently, our study aims to establish a new standard in entanglement measurement experiments by integrating path entanglement with a concurrence-based framework. This letter is organised as follows: In the second section, we focus on the use of MZ-type setups, modified by the phase retarder for one-quanton systems, considering the state of the system in new path-associated bases. In the third section, we first generalize this framework to two-quanton systems, establishing a connection between concurrence through the angles made with the BS axis. This formulation incorporates spatial correlations derived from momentum conservation in all directions within a comprehensive theoretical model. We then analyse in detail the joint-detection probabilities obtained depending on C and P in two possible BS scenarios. Last, we demonstrate that the probabilities derived in the proposed setups are equivalent to joint spin measurement probabilities.

Among the different types of solitons, we identified three main branches that are named according to their different amplitude: low, medium and high amplitude solitons. It was found that the first solitons are always unstable while the latter two exist and are stable in relatively large regions of the parameter space. Moreover, the stability regions of medium and high amplitude solitons overlap over a certain range of parameters, manifesting effects of bistability. The energy of high amplitude solitons increases quadratically with their width, whereas the energy of medium amplitude solitons may decrease or increase with the width depending on the parameter region. Furthermore, we have investigated the long term evolution of the continuous wave solutions under modulational instability, showing that medium amplitude solitons can arise in this scenario. Additionally, we assessed the effects of second and third order dispersion on medium and high amplitude solitons and found that both remain stable in the presence of these terms.","Quartic solitons are solitons of optical models whose dispersion is dominated by a fourth order term, whereas the term pure quartic solitons is reserved for models where only the fourth order dispersion is considered. They have been predicted [1, 2, 3] and observed [4, 5] in conservative models but they have been more acclaimed in dissipative models for their advantages in mode-locked lasers and Kerr soliton frequency combs whenever the fourth order dispersion (4OD) is negative (anomalous 4OD). In fact, in mode-locked lasers the negative quartic dispersion may give rise to pulses whose energy scales inversely with the width cubed, enabling very energetic ultrashort pulses [6, 7, 8]. For Kerr combs presenting negative 4OD, the same energy-width relation was found but more importantly solitons spectra is flatter [9]. Quartic solitons have also been studied in more complex models like vectorial models for mode-locked lasers [10] and a fiber resonator model allowing orbital angular momentum carrying modes [11]. In case of positive 4OD (also named normal 4OD), solitons do not exist for conservative models based on Kerr nonlinearity [12] but do exist in dissipative models. A triangular-shaped pulse with a double peak spectrum has been reported by Runge et al. [13] for a modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) comprising positive 4OD, Kerr effect and gain as well as for a mode-locked laser lumped model. Note that, this kind of pulses was already reported as non-soliton solutions of the NLSE with positive second order dispersion (2OD) and positive 4OD [14]. Another type of soliton solution for mode-locked laser models with positive 4OD was reported in [15, 7] which also presents a double-peaked spectrum but whose temporal profile consists of a sech central part on top of a large pedestal. Recently and while we were obtaining the results here reported, existence regions for both solutions by considering the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) were reported elsewhere [16]. In [15], a third kind of solution that is asymmetrical was reported. Nevertheless, all the reported solutions of mode-locked lasers dominated by normal 4OD were not yet sufficiently studied in terms of pulse characteristics, energy-width relation, regions of existence and stability, coexistence and onset from continuous wave evolution. Here, we report a thorough study of soliton solutions of a distributed model for mode-locked lasers [17, 7] dominated by normal fourth order dispersion. Two of the solutions are similar to the above referred solutions, namely, the triangular-shaped and the sech-pulse above a pedestal. We have found that they coexist in some region of the parameter space, at which they are also stable, manifesting dynamics of bistability. The other ones were obtained by solving the associated ordinary differential equation but are shown to be unstable. Three main branches of those solutions (one always unstable and two stable in some regions) are characterized in terms of amplitude, phase and spectrum profiles and in terms of energy exchange with the exterior and within themselves. The other branches occur on a bifurcation region of parameters and only the amplitude profiles are presented. The parameter regions of existence and stability of the two stable solutions are determined and their energy-width scaling is analyzed. The model is also studied concerning the modulational instability of its continuous wave (cw) solution and the relation of the modulational instability and the onset of solitons is analyzed. The influence of lower order dispersion terms, namely, second order dispersion (2OD) and third order dispersion (3OD), on the existence and stability of the stable solitons is investigated."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06566v1,A Fully Analog Pipeline for Portfolio Optimization,"Portfolio optimization is a ubiquitous problem in financial mathematics that relies on accurate estimates of covariance matrices for asset returns. However, estimates of pairwise covariance could be better and calculating time-sensitive optimal portfolios is energy-intensive for digital computers. We present an energy-efficient, fast, and fully analog pipeline for solving portfolio optimization problems that overcomes these limitations. The analog paradigm leverages the fundamental principles of physics to recover accurate optimal portfolios in a two-step process. Firstly, we utilize equilibrium propagation, an analog alternative to backpropagation, to train linear autoencoder neural networks to calculate low-rank covariance matrices. Then, analog continuous Hopfield networks output the minimum variance portfolio for a given desired expected return. The entire efficient frontier may then be recovered, and an optimal portfolio selected based on risk appetite.","Portfolio optimization involves creating an investment portfolio that balances risk and return. The objective is to allocate assets optimally to maximize expected returns while minimizing risk. Naturally, this problem is of great interest to financial organizations and is pivotal in risk management. However, the problem, formulated by Markowitz’s mean-variance model [1], must be solved in practice. Namely, it is well known that estimates of pairwise covariance between assets are notoriously poor [2]. A large financial company may have hundreds of thousands of assets n covering equities, bonds, derivatives, and more, but with only a small sample of observations over the desired timescale. The samples tend to include significant amounts of noise, distorting the underlying relationships between the assets. The symmetric covariance matrix has n(n+1)/2 total unique terms: n(n-1)/2 pairwise correlations and n variances. Hence, the number of unique terms behaves as \mathcal{O}(n^{2}), which leads to significant potential for an ill-conditioned covariance matrix [3]. To overcome this issue, factor models were introduced that vastly reduce the dimensionality, and thus the number of numerical estimates required [4]. Factor methods produce low-rank covariance matrices that retain only the largest eigenvalues and discard small eigenvalues associated with noise. Despite this development, the computation of optimal portfolios remains energy-intensive as the efficient frontier is mapped out in n dimensions. In high-frequency trading, this becomes a time-sensitive computation as assets are purchased and sold on microsecond timescales, and portfolios must be regularly rebalanced not to exceed risk appetites. Much attention has been focused on portfolio optimization in the high-frequency domain [5, 6, 7], including the use of evolutionary algorithms to update efficient frontiers [8]. By using such fundamental principles as minimizing entropy, energy, and dissipation [9], or, perhaps, incorporating quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement [10], we can advance and surpass the classical computations of these problems. At the forefront of this drive to alternate architectures is the integration of analog, physics-based algorithms and hardware, which involve translating complex optimization problems into universal spin Hamiltonians [11, 12, 13]. Indeed, the mean-variance portfolio optimization framework can be encoded into a Hamiltonian’s coupling strengths with the physical system recovering the Hamiltonian’s ground state, which corresponds to the optimal portfolio solution [14, 15]. Efficient mapping from the original problem description to spin Hamiltonian enables the problem to remain manageable despite increasing complexity [16]. In Section II, we introduce the mean-variance optimization framework for calculating optimal portfolios. Then, in Section III, we show that analog continuous Hopfield networks can solve portfolio optimization problems by evolving to the minimum of an energy function that encodes the problem parameters. In Section IV, we address the issues of estimating pairwise covariance by introducing the low-rank approximation that relies on a low-dimensional latent variable representation. In Section V, we show that calculating such a representation can be done using linear autoencoder neural networks, and in Section VI how these networks can be trained on analog hardware using equilibrium propagation. Section VII brings everything together, starting with raw data observations and working through the entire analog pipeline."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06480v1,Multifunctional 2d infrared photodetectors enabled by asymmetric singular metasurfaces,"Two-dimensional materials offering ultrafast photoresponse suffer from low intrinsic absorbance, especially in the mid-infrared wavelength range. Challenges in 2d material doping further complicate the creation of light-sensitive p-n junctions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a graphene-based infrared detector with simultaneously enhanced absorption and strong structural asymmetry enabling zero-bias photocurrent. A key element for those properties is an asymmetric singular metasurface (ASMS) atop graphene with keen metal wedges providing singular enhancement of local absorbance. The ASMS geometry predefines extra device functionalities. The structures with connected metallic wedges demonstrate polarization ratios up to 200 in a broad range of carrier densities at a wavelength of 8.6 \mum. The structures with isolated wedges display gate-controlled switching between polarization-discerning and polarization-stable photoresponse, a highly desirable yet scarce property for polarized imaging.","Methods Responsivity estimates. The power in the device plane was measured with a Thorlabs S302C thermal power head connected to a PM100D powermeter. We replaced the devices holder with the thermal head to preserve the optical path. The measured average laser power (50 % duty cycle) varies in the range P_{0}^{\rm avr}=1.52\dots 8.90~{}{\rm mW}, depending on the laser current, while the power amplitude is P_{0}=3.04\dots 17.8~{}{\rm mW}. The power per device area with dimensions L and W, illuminated by a Gaussian focused beam p(x)\propto e^{-(x^{2}+y^{2})/2\sigma^{2}} is P_{\rm dev}=\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{L}{2\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right)% \operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{W}{2\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right)P_{0}. (1) Our laser spot has \sigma = 20 \mum, thus the w-, t- and s-devices with L=W=30 \mum receive 30 % of total laser power. The amplitude of photovoltage under steady illumination V_{\rm ph} is calculated from lock-in readings V_{\rm LI} under meander-modulated illumination using V_{\rm ph}=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\,V_{\rm LI}, (2) The responsivities per total power (r_{\rm V}) and per power reaching the device (r_{\rm V,\,dev}) are r_{\rm V}=\frac{V_{\rm ph}}{P_{0}}\qquad{\rm and}\qquad r_{\rm V,\,dev}=\frac{% V_{\rm ph}}{P_{\rm dev}}. (3) Modeling. Electromagnetic modeling was implemented in Microwave Studio package with single-frequency finite element solver. The dielectric functions of contact metals and surrounding dielectrics were taken from refractiveindex.info database. Modeling of thermal transport is based on heat conduction equation for electron temperature T({\bf r}): -(\nabla,\chi_{e}({\bf r})\nabla T({\bf r}))=-\frac{C_{e}}{\tau_{\varepsilon}}% [T({\bf r})-T_{0}]+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{\rm opt}|{\bf E}|^{2}, (4) here \chi_{e} and C_{e} are the electronic thermal conductivity and heat capacity, respectively, \tau_{\varepsilon} is the energy relaxation time due to substrate phonons, T_{0} is equilibrium temperature. The last term in Eq. (4) is the Joule heating by electromagnetic field. Modeling of photo-thermoelectric response is based on continuity relation supplemented with microscopic expression for electron current. The latter includes thermal diffusion and drift components. The resulting equation on light-induced electric potential V({\bf r}) is (see Supplementary Information, Section II for derivation): (\nabla,\alpha_{e}({\bf r})\nabla T({\bf r})-\sigma_{e}({\bf r})\nabla V({\bf r% }))=0, (5) here \alpha_{e}({\bf r}) is the thermal diffusivity and \sigma_{e}({\bf r}) is the electron conductivity. The three functions \alpha_{e}, \chi_{e} and \sigma_{e} are bound by the Wiedemann-Frantz and Mott relations. Only one of them retains free, which we choose to be \sigma_{e}=\mu e(n+p). Equation (5) can be solved semi-analytically for the photocurrent I_{\rm ph} under assumption of uniform conductivity \sigma_{e}({\bf r})={\rm const}. The result reads as I_{\rm ph}=\frac{1}{V_{0}}\int{d{\bf r}({\bf E}_{0}({\bf r}),\alpha_{e}({\bf r% })\nabla T({\bf r}))}, (6) where {\bf E}_{0} is dc the electric field in the channel upon application of potential V_{0} to the drain (not to be confused with local radiation field {\bf E}({\bf r})). Eq. (6) shows that photocurrent sampling is most efficient from the points with strong local dc electric field, i.e. near the edges."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06026v1,Sub-Doppler cooling of a trapped ion in a phase-stable polarization gradient,"Trapped ions provide a highly controlled platform for quantum sensors, clocks, simulators, and computers, all of which depend on cooling ions close to their motional ground state. Existing methods like Doppler, resolved sideband, and dark resonance cooling balance trade-offs between the final temperature and cooling rate. A traveling polarization gradient has been shown to cool multiple modes quickly and in parallel, but utilizing a stable polarization gradient can achieve lower ion energies, while also allowing more tailorable light-matter interactions in general. In this paper, we demonstrate cooling of a trapped ion below the Doppler limit using a phase-stable polarization gradient created using trap-integrated photonic devices. At an axial frequency of 2\pi\cdot 1.45~{}\rm MHz we achieve \langle n\rangle=1.3\pm 1.1 in 500~{}\mu\rm s and cooling rates of {\sim}0.3\,\rm quanta/\mu s. We examine ion dynamics under different polarization gradient phases, detunings, and intensities, showing reasonable agreement between experimental results and a simple model. Cooling is fast and power-efficient, with improved performance compared to simulated operation under the corresponding running wave configuration.","Author Contributions The photonic structures were designed by SC, AH, MN, RS, and TS.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05319v2,Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation,"Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a {}^{87}\mathrm{Rb}-{}^{129}\mathrm{Xe} cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of 0.2\pm 0.1\muHz/pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.","Atomic sensors based on spin polarised ensembles have long been used for precision measurement. This includes measurements of magnetic fields, rotation, tests of fundamental physics [1, 2, 3], medical imaging [4] and device characterisation [5]. In all these applications, an alkali species is optically pumped to polarise the spin. The precession of this ensemble can then be measured with an optical probe. The large gyromagnetic ratio of alkali species means that alkali ensembles are particularly excellent sensors of magnetic fields. Indeed, modern atomic magnetometers based on spin polarised alkali atoms reach state of the art sensitivity, comparable to to Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) [6, 7]. An advantage over SQUIDs is that atomic magnetometers do not require cryogenic cooling, enabling cheaper and wider deployment in applications like magnetoencephalography [4]. The highest sensitivity atomic magnetometers rely on the Spin-Exchange Relaxation-Free (SERF) regime [8], which requires operating in a low-field environment. It has also been shown that full 3-axis readout is possible with SERF magnetometers via the application of magnetic field modulations [9, 10]. Atomic gyroscopes on the other hand, promise sensitivity comparable to the best optical systems, but with smaller volumes and lower power consumption. The gyromagnetic ratio of alkali atoms is problematic here though: they respond much more strongly to magnetic fields than any other effect. The best known method to improve non-magnetic sensing in these systems is to introduce a noble-gas with a long-lived nuclear spin into the same cell to make a ‘comagnetometer’ [11, 12]. Optical pumping of the alkali electron spin polarisation, \mathbf{P^{e}}, pumps the noble gas nuclear spin polarisation, \mathbf{P^{n}}, via spin-exchanging collisions. The polarised noble gas has three important properties. First, the gyromagnetic ratio is up to 1000 times smaller than that of alkali atoms, so it has a much smaller response to magnetic noise. Second, due to the much (>10^{4}\times) higher number density of the noble gas, the effective magnetisation of \mathbf{P^{n}} is typically much stronger than that of \mathbf{P^{e}}. Third, the coherence- and life-times of \mathbf{P^{n}} (seconds to hours) are much longer than those of \mathbf{P^{e}} (\simms). This combination of properties mean that \mathbf{P^{n}} will provide a strong, stable polarisation that is less sensitive to magnetic fields and thus better suited to sensing non-magnetic effects. What it lacks, however, is a suitable optical transition that allows direct measurement of \mathbf{P^{n}}. In a comagnetometer, we use the fact that \mathbf{P^{n}} provides strong magnetic driving of \mathbf{P^{e}}. Provided external magnetic noise can be sufficiently suppressed, an optical measurement of \mathbf{P^{e}} may provide a precise readout of \mathbf{P^{n}}. To distinguish the target signal from external magnetic noise, a common method is the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) gyroscope which uses two noble gas species with different nuclear gyromagnetic ratios [13]. The two species make nominally independent measurements of the effective magnetic fields they see, and a discrepancy in the measurements reveals the rotation rate. The role of the alkali atoms in this scheme is to pump the noble gas species and measure their dynamics, via the magnetic interaction between \mathbf{P^{n}} and \mathbf{P^{e}}. Recent work has also shown that modulation of the pump and applied bias field in NMR systems may be useful for reducing technical noise [14, 15]. The alkali in an NMR gyroscope does not work in the SERF regime, however, so spin relaxation noise limits how well an alkali species can measure the precession of the noble gas. To partly mitigate spin relaxation, pump pulses with alternating polarisation [16] and magnetic pulses [17] have shown promise. The scheme that we have developed is most closely related to the ‘self-compensated comagnetometer’ (SCC) [11, 12, 18] where co-magnetometry is between a single noble gas species and the alkali itself. In the SCC, a magnetic bias field is applied along the pump axis. The bias is tuned to precisely counteract the combined magnetisation of the alkali and noble gas spins in the cell. Under these conditions it will also be the case that the Larmor frequencies of the alkali and noble gas will be near-equal so the ensembles are strongly coupled. Under these conditions it can be shown that low frequency magnetic noise drives \mathbf{P^{n}} in a way that leads to cancellation of the external field, so that magnetic noise on \mathbf{P^{e}} is suppressed. Non-magnetic influences such as rotation, on the other hand, will not be suppressed and can even be enhanced by the strong coupling between species. A significant advantage of the SCC is that it can use high density alkali in the SERF regime, improving the sensitivity of the readout. This technique has been instrumental in setting new limits in various anomalous physics searches, including searches for a 5th force [19], violations of Lorentz invariance [18] and dark matter [20, 21, 22]. The gyroscopic performance of the SCC has shown excellent levels of sensitivity. For example Kornack et al. [12] found a noise floor \mathrm{5\!\times\!10^{-7}\,rad\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1/2}}, which was recently surpassed by Wei et al. [23] with \mathrm{3\!\times\!10^{-8}\,rad\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1/2}}. While impressive, these results are still over an order of magnitude above the atomic shot noise limit set by the alkali, and particularly limited at low frequencies where magnetic noise is typically largest. While some progress has been made reducing magnetic and other technical noise sources [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], a remaining challenge is that increased suppression of magnetic noise is not only hard to achieve, it is also difficult to maintain this suppression due to drifts in the operating point. In this work, we introduce a Perturbed Alkali-Noble Comagnetometer (PANCo) scheme. It may may be considered an evolution of a SCC, although self-compensation is no longer required. Figure 1: a) The essential components of the new scheme. A gas cell containing a mixture of noble gas and alkali metal is periodically pumped by strong laser pulses along the z-axis. This pumping creates a strong average alkali polarisation along z, which in turn also polarises the noble gas via spin exchanging collisions. A probe beam along the x-axis reads out the x component of the alkali spin. A perturbation of the system by a magnetic field or rotation means that the noble gas polarisation is tilted away from the z-axis. In this case, after excitation with the pump pulse, the alkali polarisation will precess around the total magnetic field in the cell, that will be a combination of the noble gas magnetisation, any external fields and the bias field applied along the z-axis. This leads to a signal on the polarimeter to be analysed. b) The pulse sequence used in our scheme. The \pi/2 magnetic pulses rotate the noble gas polarisation around the z-axis with alternating phase, causing any deviation of the noble gas away from z will cause a modulated field seen by the alkali. The optical pump pulses polarise the alkali atoms along the z axis. The precession of the alkali atoms is measured in the the intervals between pulses. The essential changes are the use of synchronous optical pump and magnetic pulses along the z-axis, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The magnetic pulses perturb \mathbf{P^{n}}, yet largely preserve its long-term average evolution. However the magnetic pulses do not affect \mathbf{P^{e}} as it is reset at the start of each measurement cycle by the optical pump. We will show that the controlled perturbation of \mathbf{P^{n}} enables our scheme to separate the influence of magnetic and non-magnetic driving. Meanwhile the pulsed optical pump and readout of each period of free precession of \mathbf{P^{e}} reduces the impact of laser intensity noise and means that we also gain sensitivity along the two axis perpendicular to the pump [26, 27]. The net result is that our scheme provides four output channels consisting of two rotational and two magnetic signals along axes perpendicular to the pump. We note that pulsed pumping [26, 27] and magnetic modulation [30, 28, 31] have been used previously to achieve dual-axis readout of rotations. Our work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first that combines dual-axis magnetic and rotational readout in a comagnetometer device. By transforming magnetic fields from a noise source into a distinguishable signal, the scheme can further reduce contamination of the rotation signal by magnetic noise. Our scheme also works over a wide range of bias field values, not just at the self-compensation point. The pulsed readout of the system also allows monitoring and suppression of other noise sources [26, 27], such as pointing error."
