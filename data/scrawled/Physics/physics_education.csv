https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08283v1,The surprising subtlety of electrostatic field lines,"Electric fields are commonly visualized with field line diagrams, which only unambiguously specify the field’s direction. We consider two simple questions. First, can one deduce if an electric field is conservative, as required e.g. in electrostatics, from its field lines alone? Second, are there conservative electric fields with straight field lines, besides the familiar textbook examples with spherical, cylindrical, or planar symmetry? We give a self-contained introduction to the differential geometry required to answer these questions, assuming only vector calculus background.","In electromagnetism, the electric and magnetic fields are the fundamental quantities, and field lines give only incomplete information about the fields. However, field lines remain a useful source of visual intuition. For example, the directions of electric and magnetic forces can be seen from field line diagrams [1], using Faraday’s idea that field lines carry a tension along them and an outward pressure perpendicular to them. Radiation from a kicked charge is readily visualized in terms of kinked electric field lines [2], and magnetic field lines in plasmas can be thought of as “moving” with the medium [3, 4, 5]. Field line diagrams are almost universally used in introductory physics courses, and it is well-known that they can lead to common student misconceptions [6, 7, 8, 9]. However, there are also legitimate questions that students may ask about them, which have surprisingly subtle answers. In this work, we consider two such questions. First, electric field lines are often used to depict electrostatic fields, which are conservative. But given a set of field lines, how can one tell if they can correspond to a conservative field? Second, introductory courses usually illustrate Gauss’s law by applying it to electrostatic fields with spherical, cylindrical, or planar symmetry, as these simple cases have only straight field lines. Are there any other electrostatic fields with only straight field lines? As we will discuss in Sec. II, these questions are nontrivial because the field’s magnitude is not determined by the field lines. We answer the first question in Sec. III. It turns out to require the geometric notion of Frobenius integrability, which is not commonly taught in undergraduate physics courses, but can be introduced with only vector calculus background. The second question is most simply answered by considering the Gaussian and mean curvatures of equipotential surfaces. We give a self-contained introduction to these concepts in Sec. IV, answer the question in Sec. V, and conclude in Sec. VI. These puzzles may be of interest to instructors, and their resolutions may expand the horizons of ambitious upper-division students. For more about the underlying geometrical ideas, we direct the reader to Refs. [10, 11, 12, 13]."
