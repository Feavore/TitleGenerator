https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10413v1,Experimental generation of extreme electron beams for advanced accelerator applications,"In this Letter we report on the experimental generation of high energy (10 GeV), ultra-short (fs-duration), ultra-high current (\sim 0.1 MA), petawatt peak power electron beams in a particle accelerator. These extreme beams enable the exploration of a new frontier of high intensity beam-light and beam-matter interactions broadly relevant across fields ranging from laboratory astrophysics to strong field quantum electrodynamics and ultra-fast quantum chemistry. We demonstrate our ability to generate and control the properties of these electron beams by means of a laser-electron beam shaping technique. This experimental demonstration opens the door to on-the-fly customization of extreme beam current profiles for desired experiments and is poised to benefit a broad swathe of cross-cutting applications of relativistic electron beams.","References Sessler and Wilson (2014) A.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10054v1,The Performance of Seeded Free-Electron Lasers Through Dispersion Strength Tuning,"Over the last decade, external seeded free electron lasers (FELs) have achieved significant advancements across various disciplines, progressively establishing themselves as indispensable tools in fields ranging from fundamental science to industrial applications. The performance of seeded FELs is critically dependent on the quality of the frequency up-conversion process. Optimized conditions for seeded FELs are typically considered as the maximization of the bunching factor. This paper discusses alternative perspectives on the optimization criteria for seeded FELs by analyzing the impact of dispersion strength on their overall performance. We investigate the relationship among the required dispersion strength for achieving the maximum bunching factor, maximum pulse energy, and optimal energy stability through theoretical analysis, simulation calculations, and experimental explorations. Additionally, the direct observation of pulse splitting emphasizes the consideration of trade-off between pulse energy and temporal coherence in seeded FELs. These results provide valuable insights and practical guidance for controlling the pulse characteristics of seeded FELs, contributing to the tuning and optimization of FEL facilities.","The revolutionary changes introduced by Free-electron Lasers (FELs) have significantly enhanced our ability to explore complex materials and biological systems with unprecedented precision and versatility, paving the way for groundbreaking discoveries across multiple fields, including medicine, materials science, and fundamental physics [1, 2, 3]. Currently, several FEL facilities have been constructed worldwide [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], serving as dispensable tools for a wide variety of scientific research. Of particular interest among these studies is the experiment implemented at seeded FELs, which has the major advantage of full coherence, precise control over arrival time, and a uniform longitudinal profile. The capability to produce stable, fully coherent radiation pulses has garnered sustained attention for external seeded FELs, which employ optical-scale electron beam manipulation with external seed lasers. The typical operation modes of external seeded FELs are high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) [11, 12, 13] and echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) [14, 15, 16]. In the HGHG scheme, an external seed laser interacts with the electron beam in the modulator, imprinting a sinusoidal energy modulation onto the longitudinal phase space. After passing through a dispersion chicane, this energy modulation is converted into a density modulation (micro-bunching), which contains frequency components at high harmonics of the seed laser. The desired coherent radiation is then generated and amplified in the subsequent undulator by this micro-bunched electron beam. In the EEHG scheme, two modulation-dispersion sections induce successive transformations of the electron beam longitudinal phase space, accumulating electrons into fine energy bands and leading to multiple density spikes within each seed wavelength. Other proposals, such as phase-merging enhanced harmonic generation (PEHG) [17, 18] and direct-amplification enabled harmonic generation (DEHG) [19], have not been experimentally validated due to the complexity of their required machine architectures. Building on the above introduction, it is evident that the frequency up-conversion process, which dominates the generation of bunching factor, plays a crucial role in determining the performance of seeded FELs. Once temporal and spatial synchronization between the seed laser and the electron beam is established [20, 21, 22], adjusting the magnet currents in the dispersion chicane is generally required to optimize the electron beam bunching factor. Indeed, one generally identifies the optimized conditions for seeded FEL emission as those that maximize the bunching factor [23, 24, 25]. However, to ensure the stable operation of FELs and the successful execution of user experiments, it is more critical to meet stringent specifications, particularly in terms of pulse energy and its stability as well as the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics of the FEL pulses [26, 27, 28]. Therefore, optimizing the parameters of the harmonic conversion stage to maximize pulse energy or achieve optimal energy stability, rather than merely maximizing the bunching factor as suggested in Ref. [29, 30], appears to be a more significant issue for consideration. Meanwhile, the evolution of other radiation pulse characteristics, such as power profile, spectrum and time-bandwidth product (TBP), under these newly optimized parameters requires further investigation. This paper explores an alternative optimization criterion for seeded FELs by analyzing the impact of dispersion strength on the performance of FEL pulses. The study investigates optimal conditions and FEL performance with respect to the maximum bunching factor, pulse energy, and energy stability through theoretical calculations, numerical simulations, and experimental observations. Furthermore, the direct experimental observations reveal the phenomena of pulse splitting and corresponding spectral splitting [23, 31, 32, 33], which are subsequently explained through theoretical analysis. The results provide new insights into the efficient control of FEL pulse characteristics and contribute to the tuning and optimization of seeded FELs."

A regime is possible in which the gradient affects only the relative phasing of the driver bunches and the wave, keeping the wave phase behind the driver stable. With this technique, it is possible to increase the energy gain of the accelerated witness bunch in a plasma section of limited length.",References
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09468v2,Harnessing Machine Learning for Single-Shot Measurement of Free Electron Laser Pulse Power,"Electron beam accelerators are essential in many scientific and technological fields. Their operation relies heavily on the stability and precision of the electron beam. Traditional diagnostic techniques encounter difficulties in addressing the complex and dynamic nature of electron beams. Particularly in the context of free-electron lasers (FELs), it is fundamentally impossible to measure the lasing-on and lasing-off electron power profiles for a single electron bunch. This is a crucial hurdle in the exact reconstruction of the photon pulse profile. To overcome this hurdle, we developed a machine learning model that predicts the temporal power profile of the electron bunch in the lasing-off regime using machine parameters that can be obtained when lasing is on. The model was statistically validated and showed superior predictions compared to the state-of-the-art batch calibrations. The work we present here is a critical element for a virtual pulse reconstruction diagnostic (VPRD) tool designed to reconstruct the power profile of individual photon pulses without requiring repeated measurements in the lasing-off regime. This promises to significantly enhance the diagnostic capabilities in FELs at large.","Electron beam accelerators are fundamental to numerous scientific and technological fields, encompassing medical therapies, material science, and particle physics research. Their effective operation depends heavily on the stability and precision of the electron beam, which in turn relies on advanced diagnostic technologies to monitor and maintain beam quality. Traditional diagnostic techniques, while valuable, often encounter difficulties in addressing the complex and dynamic nature of electron beams. This is where machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative technology, offering enhanced diagnostic capabilities. By improving precision, adaptability, and real-time analysis, ML-driven diagnostics are reshaping how electron beams are monitored and optimized[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. To achieve the required precision in experiments of free-electron lasers (FELs), various diagnostic methods have been developed. One such method is the transverse reconstruction of the electron beam and X-ray algorithm [6, 7]. This approach aims to reconstruct the temporal power profile I(t) of the beam. It does so by analyzing the product of the measured current profile and the difference between the energy spread or mean energy profiles of lasing-on and lasing-off shots using a transverse deflecting cavity (TDS) (see Figure 2 in [7]). However, this approach is constrained by the finite resolution of the TDS [8]. In addition, it is impossible to measure the lasing-on111a high intensity photon beam is produced by the FEL and lasing-off222no photon beam is produced by the FEL electron phase spaces for a single shot [9]. This means that during an experiment - where lasing must be on - the lasing-off electron phase space is inaccessible to experimental measurement. Currently, this limitation is worked around by performing batch calibrations: several hundred temporal power profiles of electron bunches are recorded without lasing (lasing-off regime), followed by several hundred shots with lasing (lasing-on regime). The power profiles of these shots are then averaged for each context and subtracted from each other. This produces a mean difference for lasing-on versus lasing-off power profiles. This allows us to calculate the mean temporal power profile I(t) of the photon pulse [6]. However, the state of the art approach cannot account for differences between individual pulses. Figure 1: Process workflow. During beamline operation, we obtain measured ""machine parameters"" and the longitudinal phase space (""phase image"") for each photon pulse. We use a multi-layer perceptron machine learning model (""MLP model"") to predict the temporal power profile of the electron bunch if it would be obtained without lasing (""lasing-off electron power""). From the phase image, we calculate the temporal power profile of the electron bunch with lasing (""lasing-on electron power""). Thus, we can estimate the temporal power profile for each individual photon pulse (""Photon power"") by subtracting the measured lasing-on electron power from the predicted lasing-off electron power. The top row (machine parameters \rightarrow MLP model \rightarrow lasing-off electron power) is the part of the process that we solved in this paper. This paper introduces an important step towards Virtual Pulse Reconstruction Diagnostic (VPRD), a tool designed to address the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods, particularly in the context of FELs. VPRD will leverage machine learning algorithms to reconstruct the longitudinal phase space of individual pulses of the electron beam without the need for repeated measurements in the lasing-off regime, offering a non-invasive and efficient method for characterizing free electron laser radiation pulses. Towards this end, VPRD will use the following workflow (Figure 1): For each electron bunch, the beam monitoring system records 22 machine parameters (Table 1) as well as a longitudinal phase space image in the lasing-on regime. The machine par ameters are used as input to predict the shape that the temporal power profile of the electron bunch would have in the lasing-off regime. The temporal power profile in the lasing-on regime is measured directly from the longitudinal phase space. Thus, we will be able to reconstruct the temporal power profile for each individual photon pulse. In this paper, we focus on the machine-learning part of the approach motivated above. Our contributions are as follows: We developed a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) machine learning model (section 2.1) that was able to predict the temporal power profile of the electron bunch in the lasing-off regime (section 3). Towards this end, we collected the machine parameters as well as the longitudinal phase space for 2826 electron bunches in the lasing-off regime as training data. We statistically validate predictions of our approach by comparing them to state of the art [6, 7] on a test set (section 3). Finally, we discuss the impact and limitations of our results (section 4)."

This is a proof-of-principle measurement using the existing AWAKE electron spectrometer to validate the measurement technique. Large values of the geometric emittance, compared to that of the injection beam, are observed (\sim$0.5\text{\,}\mathrm{mm}\text{\,}\mathrm{mrad}$ compared with \sim$0.08\text{\,}\mathrm{mm}\text{\,}\mathrm{mrad}$), which is in line with expectations of emittance growth arising from plasma density ramps and large injection beam bunch size. Future iterations of AWAKE are anticipated to operate in conditions where emittance growth is better controlled, and the effects of the imaging systems of the existing and future spectrometer designs on the ability to measure the emittance are discussed. Good performance of the instrument down to geometric emittances of approximately 1\text{\times}{10}^{-4}\text{\,}\mathrm{mm}\text{\,}\mathrm{mrad} is required, which may be possible with improved electron optics and imaging.","The Advanced WAKEfield (AWAKE) experiment at CERN is a proof-of-concept, particle-driven plasma wakefield accelerator [1]. It uses long (\sim 6\text{\,}\mathrm{cm}) proton bunches delivered by the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN at 400\text{\,}\mathrm{GeV} to drive wakefields in a 10\text{\,}\mathrm{m} Rb plasma column. The plasma is created using a 120\text{\,}\mathrm{fs} laser pulse passing through Rb vapour in a temperature-controlled chamber with Rb vapour sources at either end [2]. The laser and proton bunches propagate coaxially and cotemporally; the use of a long proton bunch relies on the self-modulation instability [3] to effectively drive large wakefields, and the plasma density step created by the laser ionization front provides the seed for this instability, ensuring phase repeatability [4]. This instability leads to periodic focussing and defocussing of the proton bunch, eventually resulting in a train of microbunches separated by one plasma wavelength (that is, \frac{2\pi c}{\omega_{p}}, where \frac{c}{\omega_{p}} is the plasma skin depth, \omega_{p} being the electron plasma frequency). Electrons are injected into the wakefield from a 18\text{\,}\mathrm{MeV} combined photoinjector and S-band booster [5, 6], the laser incident on the photocathode being derived from the main ionizing laser, which ensures phase stability with the seeded self-modulation instability. This in turn ensures that the electrons are, in principle, injected into the same phase of the wakefield each time. In practice, the electron bunch length is larger than the microbunch separation, has a transverse size on the scale of the plasma skin depth, and is subject to jitters in e.g. pointing, so different parts of the bunch (and successive shots) experience different parts of the wakefield. Using this injection scheme, acceleration up to 2\text{\,}\mathrm{GeV} of part of the injected bunch has been observed [7] for a plasma density of 7\text{\times}{10}^{14}\text{\,}{\mathrm{cm}}^{-3}. Normalized emittance is an invariant quantity under acceleration of a particle bunch, given in a single plane by: \displaystyle\epsilon_{n} \displaystyle=\gamma\beta\epsilon (1) \displaystyle\epsilon_{n} \displaystyle=\gamma\beta\sqrt[]{\det\Sigma} (2) where \epsilon is the geometric emittance (phase space projection area), \gamma and \beta the usual Lorentz factors, and \Sigma, the beam matrix, is \displaystyle\Sigma \displaystyle=\left[\begin{matrix}\sigma_{x}^{2}&\sigma_{xx^{\prime}}\\ \sigma_{xx^{\prime}}&\sigma_{y^{\prime}}^{2}\end{matrix}\right]. (3) Single-shot measurement of the emittance at AWAKE is desirable, as the variation in the injection process could lead to variation in the shot-to-shot accelerated beam parameters. Measurement techniques which rely on aggregated data from multiple shots will therefore not necessarily produce the correct result. As the proton drive beam and accelerated witness electrons propagate coaxially on exit from the plasma cell, measurements such as pepperpot emittance meters or analysis of optical transition radiation are impossible because the signal from the proton beam will vastly dominate. This leaves beam image analysis in a spectrometer as the only currently viable technique for determining the beam parameters of a single accelerated bunch. Although emittance is not expected to be preserved or well controlled with the present experimental geometry, measuring it is both interesting to test whether changes in the acceleration conditions can be detected through changes in the beam parameters, and a way to develop the instrumentation required for later AWAKE runs (e.g. run 2c)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08422v1,HTS Undulator Design Study and First Results,"Undulators are X-ray sources that are widely utilised in advanced synchrotron radiation sources and free-electron laser facilities. Due to sustainability and energy efficiency, the development focuses on small-scale, high-field, and especially compact undulators with short period lengths (\leq 10 mm) and narrow magnetic gaps (\leq 4 mm). Therefore, high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes, which can provide a high critical current density and high critical magnetic fields at higher temperatures, are extensively used and investigated at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. A new concept of superconducting undulators (SCUs) was introduced and further developed by laser-scribing a meander pattern into the superconducting layer to achieve a quasi-sinusoidal current path through the HTS tape.Here we present the complete and final design of such a compact SCU, in particular our latest results regarding the design of the liner with its tapering in the warm region, as well as the cryogenic cooling concept.","Insertion devices (IDs), such as undulators, are a crucial component for free-electron laser (FEL) facilities and advanced synchrotron radiation sources because they produce coherent photon beams with high brilliance and a broad spectral range. In principle, an ID consists of an arrangement of alternating magnetic dipoles, guiding electrons on a sinusoidal path through the device. The period length of the undulator is chosen in that way, that each time an electron emits synchrotron radiation due to deflection, and additionally the emitted light interferes constructively with the radiation at all other deflection points along the undulator [1]. Up to now, most recent undulator technology is based on the permanent magnets, so called permanent magnet undulators (PMU). By opening up the field towards superconducting materials by its commercial availability, superconducting undulators (SCUs) moved into the focus. As the current standard, promising results were achieved by using NbTi. However, Nb3Sn is increasingly being used to generate higher magnetic fields. With the latter, the handling and winding of the coils is more complex and more prone to faults, as special heat treatment is required for Nb3Sn [2]. In comparison to cryogenic PMUs, SCUs offer a higher magnetic peak field on symmetry axis for the same geometry (e.g. magnetic gap and period length) [3, 4, 5] and thus a higher tunability and brightness resulting in a wider range of applications at modern synchrotron light sources. This technology therefore holds great potential not only for current accelerators and beamlines, but also for future storage rings and linear accelerators such as FELs and laser plasma accelerators (LPAs). As the demands for sustainability, energy efficiency and resource conservation lead to the realisation of more compact accelerator facilities, IDs must follow this trend. But due to the natural extension of a NbTi wire cross-section, period lengths \leq 8 mm are not feasible. That is where high-temperature superconductors (HTS) become a promising candidate. To meet these new requirements, new concepts have been developed to produce more compact undulators based on HTS [6, 7, 8, 9]. Current developments in SCU undulator technology are described here [10, 11, 12]. To reach shorter period length, Prestemon et al. suggested to use non-insulated HTS tapes instead of wire and to structure the tape’s surface with a meander pattern [13, 14]. Based on these considerations, T. Holubek [15] and A. Will [16] have developed different realisations and methods, both of which are further developed at KIT. T. Holubek et al. designed a system using a 15 m long structured HTS tape, wound in a manner that stacks 30 layers of these tapes to produce an alternating magnetic field. To conserve HTS material and reduce costs, A. Will et al. suggested soldering short individual structured tapes together in an accordion-like configuration. In the following sections, the development of an HTS SCU based on structured tapes is presented. We start with an overview of the manufacturing process of the structuring and the two stacking methods. However, the focus is on the cooling concept, in particular on the integration of the magnetic coils in the cryostat and on the tapering for connection to a beam tube."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07866v1,"Practical aspects of transverse resonance island buckets at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring: design, control and application","In an accelerator, the nonlinear behavior near a horizontal resonance line (n\nu_{x}) usually involves the appearance of stable fixed points (SFPs) in the horizontal phase space, also referred to as transverse resonance island “buckets” (TRIBs). Specific conditions are required for TRIBs formation. At the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, a new method is developed to improve the dynamic and momentum apertures in a 6-GeV lattice as well as to preserve the conditions for TRIBs formation. This method reduces the dimension of variables from 76 sextupoles to 8 group variables and then utilizes the robust conjugate direction search algorithm in optimization. Created with a few harmonic sextupoles or octupoles, several knobs that can either rotate the TRIBs in phase space or adjust the actions of SFPs are discussed and demonstrated by both tracking simulations and experimental results. In addition, a new scheme to drive all particles into one single island is described. Possible applications using TRIBs in accelerators are also discussed.","In recent years, the nonlinear resonances forming stable islands in phase space, also referred to as transverse resonance island “buckets” (TRIBs), gain more interests in the light source and x-ray science community due to its distinct way of separating the x-ray pulses in both time and space Ries et al. (2015); Goslawski et al. (2019); Tavares et al. (2019); Holldack et al. (2020); Olsson and Andersson (2021); Kim et al. (2022); Wang and Khachatryan (2022); Holldack et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2023a, b); Nam et al. (2024); Wang and Khachatryan (2024). For example, at BESSY-II, the stable two-orbit operation utilizing the TRIBs to conduct unique x-ray experiments have been demonstrated Goslawski et al. (2019); Holldack et al. (2020, 2022). Progresses have also been made on the theoretical understanding of formation of TRIBs, advancing the tools to manipulate the TRIBs in phase space for better control the x-ray pulses from TRIBs Wang et al. (2023b). However, there has been a long history of utilizing the resonance nature of synchrotrons and storage rings, such as to extract particles in multi-turns at the CERN-PS and many other facilities Steinbach et al. (1993); Cappi and Giovannozzi (2002); Borburgh et al. (2016). This resonant extraction technique has been widely implemented to extract hardons for high energy fixed-target experiments or ion therapy Bryant (ed.). A recent effort is also made to study the extraction of electrons from low emittance booster rings using TRIBs at DESY Garcia et al. (2024). Thus it is evident that understanding TRIBs and developing techniques to control this unique nonlinear behavior are still necessary and useful for current and future applications. At the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), Hamiltonian perturbation theory and map-based PTC method have been successfully implemented to design a TRIBs lattice and predict the fixed points near a third-order (3\nu_{x}) resonance Wang et al. (2023b). Note PTC refers to “fully polymorphic package”-“polymorphic tracking code” library which handles Taylor map manipulation and Lie algebraic operations Forest (1997, 2016). Subsequent experiments confirmed the observed TRIBs locations near 3\nu_{x} as well as the 4\nu_{x} resonance, which agree reasonably well with theoretical calculation and simulations Wang et al. (2023b); Wang and Khachatryan (2024). While exploring the TRIBs experimentally in CESR, we have faced a few challenges such as experiencing poor lifetime while adjusting the horizontal tune near the resonance or with application of a sinusoidal kick, indicating limited dynamic aperture (DA) or momentum aperture (MA) near the resonance. Since the TRIBs lattice intrinsically contains large nonlinearity, conventional methods involving reducing the nonlinearity of the lattice in order to improve DA do not work for the TRIBs lattice. Besides improving beam lifetime and injection with improved DA, other practical subjects such as how to systematically tune the angles and locations of islands and driving particles into one single island have also been explored at CESR. In this paper, we will discuss a new method to improve DA and MA in the TRIBs lattice while preserving the properties of TRIBs. This method reduces the dimension of variables from 76 sextupoles to 8 DA knobs and then utilizes the robust conjugate direction search (RCDS) algorithm Huang et al. (2013) to optimize the DA or MA directly. Simulation shows the MA is improved significantly after optimization, confirmed by the experiments with improved lifetime. We will also discuss three knobs consisting of a few harmonic sextupoles or octupoles, which can either rotate the TRIBs in phase space or adjust the actions of stable fixed points (SFPs). Their effects are demonstrated by both tracking simulations and experiments. These practical knobs will be useful for fine tuning of x-ray pulses. Besides manipulating the TRIBs in phase space, a new scheme to drive all particles into one single island is described. Several potential applications using TRIBs in accelerators are also discussed. The paper is organized as follows. CESR lattice is briefly introduced in Sec. II. The method to improve the DA and MA is discussed in Sec. III while phase-space-control knobs are introduced and discussed in Sec. IV. In Sec. V, we then describe the new driving scheme that pushes all particles into one single island and explain the reason behind it. Finally, we discuss current and two potential applications in accelerators using TRIBs and conclude in Sec. VI.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07100v1,Positron Channeling in Quasi-Mosaic Bent Crystals: Atomistic Simulations vs. Experiment,"This paper reports on a comprehensive study of an ultra-relativistic positron beam deflection by an oriented quasi-mosaic crystal. The analysis was carried out for the positron energy of 530 MeV incident on the quasi-mosaic bent Si(111) crystal. This particular case was chosen because it has recently been studied experimentally at the Mainz Microtron MAMI. The results of the relativistic molecular dynamics simulations were compared with the experimental observations and a good agreement was found. The presence of planar channeling, de-channeling, volume reflection and volume capture processes in the angular distribution of deflected positrons for different beam-crystal alignments has been studied. Predictions have been made for certain crystal orientations for which experimental data are lacking.","Inside a crystalline solid, the positions of the constituent atoms follow a regular geometric pattern. This gives rise to an ordered and periodic structure of the crystalline environment, which is slightly disordered by the presence of the atoms’ thermal vibrations. As a result, the atoms in the crystal are arranged in crystalline rows and planes. Therefore, when a high-energy charged particle collides with a crystal, the interaction between the particle and the crystal depends significantly on the orientation of the crystal with respect to the direction of the particle’s motion. In this context, the seminal work of Lindhard Lindhard_1965 showed that the ordered arrangement of atoms within a crystal generates an electrostatic field that significantly affects the motion of charged particles passing through the crystal at small angles with respect to the crystallographic planes or axes. This effect is known as channeling, in which particles that move along a crystallographic plane (or an axis) undergo correlated interactions with the atoms that make it up. The study of the transport of ultra-relativistic charged particle beam through oriented crystals, including the phenomenon of channeling, has become a field of broad scope and investigation Biryukov_1997 ; Uggerhoj_2005 ; Korol_2014 ; Sytov_2019 ; Korol_2022 . The extensive theoretical and experimental studies of channeling and other related phenomena have provided many valuable insights Korol_2021 ; Haurylavets_2021 ; Sushko_2022 ; Bandiera_2013_1 ; Sytov_2016 ; Wistisen_2016 ; Scandale_2020 ; Ivanov_2006 ; Bandiera_2021_1 . This paper is devoted to the study of the phenomena that occur when an oriented quasi-mosaic bent Si(111) crystal is exposed to a well collimated positron beam. Positrons entering the crystal nearly parallel to the atomic planes can be channeled through the crystal and follow the crystal curvature. This process is called planar channeling (CH). As the positrons propagate through the crystal in the channeling regime, scattering events can lead to dechanneling (DCH), i.e. the process by which the positrons are thrown out of the channel. If the crystal is tilted at a small angle with respect to the positron beam, the positron trajectories can be aligned with the crystalographic planes within the crystal. This situation can lead to the volume reflection (VR) events, where positrons are reflected from the bent atomic planes, or to the volume capture (VC) events, where positrons are captured by the bent planar channels and continue their motion in the channeling regime. Recent theoretical and experimental contributions explain these processes very well and describe them with sufficient accuracy Korol_2014 ; Korol_2021 ; Haurylavets_2021 ; Scandale_2019_1 ; Mazzolari_2024 ; Paulo_2024 . In recent years, a number of experiments have been carried out at various accelerator facilities with the primary aim of exploring the specific features of the channeling process for different crystalline samples and the emission of radiation in bent and periodically bent crystals Guidi_2012 ; Bandiera_2013_2 ; Bagli_2014 ; Nielsen_2019 ; Mazzolari_2014 ; Wienands_2015 ; Scandale_2019_2 ; Bandiera_2015 ; Wistisen_2016 ; Bagli_2017 ; Sytov_2017 ; Wienands_2017 ; Bandiera_2021_2 . The present study explores the intricate dynamics of ultra-relativistic positrons as they propagate through a crystalline medium and interact with the crystal’s electrostatic field. To unravel the complexity of this phenomenon, the powerful technique of relativistic molecular dynamics Sushko_2013 is used, taking advantage of the state-of-the-art capabilities of the MBN Explorer software package Solovyov_2012 ; Solovyov_2017 ; MBN_Explorer ; Sushko_2019 . A comprehensive understanding of the problem has been achieved by rigorously comparing the results of the simulations with the recently reported experimental results Mazzolari_2024 , obtained for a bent silicon crystal exposed to irradiation with the 530 MeV positron beam recently developed at the Mainz Microtron MAMI. The relativistic molecular dynamics approach used in this work is one of a set of algorithms implemented in MBN Explorer, the advanced software package for multiscale simulations of complex molecular structure and dynamics. The case study reported in this work is in line with the recent roadmap paper on multiscale theory, simulation, and experiment in radiation-exposed condensed matter systems Solovyov_2024 . The study of the behavior of charged ultra-relativistic particles within crystalline structures is of immense importance, as it underpins a wide range of applications, from particle accelerator technologies to advances in materials science and beyond. As is well known, the interaction between charged particles incident on a crystalline medium allows us to understand the fundamental mechanisms that govern their dynamics. This research aims to unravel the details of this dynamics. By exploiting the synergy between the advanced computational modeling and experimental results, this work aims is to push the frontiers of knowledge in this field and pave the way for innovative applications and further scientific discoveries. Section 2 provides an overview of the methodology used in this study, including the target parameters and the details of the simulations. Section 3 presents the numerical results obtained and, where possible, compares them with the experimental data collected at MAMI. It also analyses the deflection of the positron beam as a function of the parameters characterizing the crystal geometry and the divergence of the incident beam. This analysis is based on the atomistic simulations of positron trajectories using the relativistic molecular dynamics approach. Section 4 summarises the conclusions of this work and outlines future prospects."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07018v1,"Data-Driven Gradient Optimization for Field Emission Management
in a Superconducting Radio-Frequency Linac","Field emission can cause significant problems in superconducting radio-frequency linear accelerators (linacs). When cavity gradients are pushed higher, radiation levels within the linacs may rise exponentially, causing degradation of many nearby systems. This research aims to utilize machine learning with uncertainty quantification to predict radiation levels at multiple locations throughout the linacs and ultimately optimize cavity gradients to reduce field emission induced radiation while maintaining the total linac energy gain necessary for the experimental physics program. The optimized solutions show over 40% reductions for both neutron and gamma radiation from the standard operational settings.","Jefferson Lab’s Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) [1] relies on two superconducting radio-frequency linear accelerators (SRF linacs) to deliver high-energy electron beams to nuclear physics experiments in the four experimental halls [2]. An integral part of these linacs are cryomodules which contain multiple SRF cavities. These SRF cavities provide the main accelerating gradients to the electron beam, and currently produce the 12\text{\,}\mathrm{G}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V} beam necessary for scientific discovery. I.1 Field Emission When SRF cavities are operated at high radio-frequency (RF) gradients, it is possible for electrons to be emitted from the cavity walls, known as field emission (FE) [3, 4]. The basic physics of FE in SRF cavities is generally understood [5, 6, 7], and modern cavity surface processing and assembly techniques control FE well prior to installation [8]. However, during routine operation, degradation of the FE onset (i.e., the gradient at which the first FE-induced gammas are detected) has been observed. It is believed this degradation is caused by particulates and hydrocarbons entering the cavity, contaminating its surface, and introducing new field emitters [9]. Field emission is one of the most detrimental problems for CEBAF linacs [10, 11, 12, 13]. When field emitted electrons hit the cavity walls, cryogenic heat loads increase. If those electrons are accelerated beyond the source cavity, their energies can exceed neutron production and material activation thresholds, producing radiation and damaging beamline components. Prior to the 12\text{\,}\mathrm{G}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V} upgrade to CEBAF, activation levels detected were typically low enough to not require “Radiation Area” postings. These postings are required for areas where the whole-body radiation dose is >0.005\text{\,}\mathrm{r}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{m}\mathrm{/}\mathrm{h}. However, since the energy upgrade, CEBAF has suffered from significant FE induced radiation. With RF on, dose rates observed at 30\text{\,}\mathrm{cm} from the beamline are as high as 10\text{\,}\mathrm{r}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{m}\mathrm{/}\mathrm{h} and 100\text{\,}\mathrm{r}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{m}\mathrm{/}\mathrm{h} for neutron and gamma radiation, respectively. This level of radiation causes significant damage to beamline components, including vacuum valves, magnets, and cables of beam position monitors and ion pumps. Replacing these components can use significant resources. Worse, portions of both linacs are considered “Radiation Areas” for days or even weeks into scheduled downtime, limiting maintenance activities to repair and replace components, and increasing radiation doses for personnel. Most vacuum valves in both linacs are now damaged causing them to leak. Radiation damaged valves, where the valves’ seals become brittle might be one of the most detrimental problems preventing higher cavity gradients. Particulates from the damaged seals propagate through the beamline, entering the cryomodules. This contamination introduces FE even at very low gradients and requiring the removal and the refurbishments of the cryomodules. The leaky valves prevent vacuum isolation of the cryomodules, complicating the maintenance activities and the removal and installation of cryomodules. Pending available funds, CEBAF has started on a multi-year project to replace Viton vacuum valves in the linacs with all-metal valves [14]. The refurbishment is further complicated by the activation of many of the cryomodule and beamline components due to FE. Determining FE-source cavities is challenging for a number of reasons. At CEBAF, existing radiation monitors were designed to detect high bursts of gamma radiation due to beam loss events and quickly shutdown the beam. Until recently, there was no readily available way to continuously monitor the relatively low level of radiation produced by FE in real-time within the accelerator. Newly designed neutron and gamma radiation dose rate detectors (NDX) [15, 16] were successfully installed and provide real-time radiation measurements in 13 locations along both linacs at CEBAF. However, detecting FE at the cavity level remains a challenge as each set of 13 detectors covers a total of 200 cavities. Additionally, field emitted electrons may be captured and accelerated from the source cavity, causing radiation far away from the source. Tests at CEBAF have shown that FE can be accelerated in either direction in the linac, with one instance passing through 14 cryomodules (>100\text{\,}\mathrm{m}) [13]. Figure 1: NDX 2L25 detector positioned next to the beamline connecting two cryomodules at a distance of about 0.5\text{\,}\mathrm{m}. Neighbouring cryomodules are separated by a 1.2\text{\,}\mathrm{m} long beamline. The white polyethylene outer layer of the detector is yellowing due to FE radiation. Figure 1 shows one of the NDX detectors positioned between two cryomodules at a distance of about 0.5\text{\,}\mathrm{m} from the beamline. At the center of the detector, two identical ionization chambers [17] filled with different helium gas isotopes ({}^{3}\text{He} and {}^{4}\text{He}) serve as the sensors in the detector. The chambers’ output currents are measured by highly sensitive electrometers [18]. This configuration enables accurate measurement of the two different radiation dose rates. A diagram of the south linac including the locations of the 25 cryomodules (containing eight cavities each) and 13 detectors is given in Fig. 2. These detector locations correspond to cryomodules with expected FE activity. Cryomodule styles are typically denoted based on the expected total energy gain. A C25 cryomodule, for example, would be expected to produce around 25 MeV of energy gain. In CEBAF’s south linac, detectors have been placed near the C50 and C100 cryomodules which produce its highest gradients and are therefore more likely to produce FE. Figure 2: Layout of the CEBAF south linac. Cryomodules are outlined in blue, detectors in red. There are 8 individual cavities per cryomodule (shown in black). The south linac contains three cyromodule types indicated by their background color: C25, C50, and C100, where the numbers indicate the nominal energy gain in \text{\,}\mathrm{M}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V} expected from each type. I.2 Methodology If an FE source cavity can be determined, radiation levels can be minimized by lowering its gradient and redistributing gradient to other FE-free cavities. A proof-of-principle test of this gradient redistribution for reducing FE radiation was demonstrated in the injector by slowly increasing the gradient for each cavity individually to determine its contribution to the radiation levels [13]. Individual testing like this is not feasible as a long-term solution, as it requires a significant investment in time. Additionally, it is very likely for field emitters to be enhanced and new field emitters to be excited, causing previous FE onset values to change. These changing onset values, as well as changes in field emission intensity, make the task of modeling radiation responses particularly challenging. Furthermore, a cavity’s contribution to radiation levels is rarely isolated, as interactions with nearby cavity gradients can alter radiation response by accelerating FE upstream or downstream. These complex interactions and the high dimensional input space of the problem make it an ideal problem for machine learning (ML). Our goal is to produce an ML surrogate model that predicts radiation levels based on cavity gradients. This model will power an offline optimization process for redistributing gradients to reduce radiation levels while maintaining linac energy gain. This will be the first time ML is used to mitigate the problem of field emission in an SRF linac with a great number of cavities. Other ML efforts at CEBAF to improve SRF operation are described in [19, 20, 21], while work at other SRF facilities can be found in [22, 23, 24]."
