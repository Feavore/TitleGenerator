https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09606v1,Carl Wirtz’ article from 1924 in Astronomische Nachrichten on the radial motions of spiral nebulae,"In the year 1924, a paper by Carl Wirtz appeared in ”Astronomische Nachrichten"", entitled ""De Sitter’s cosmology and the radial motion of spiral galaxies"". This paper and its author remained largely unnoticed by the community, but it seems to be the first cosmological interpretation of the redshift of galaxies as a time dilation effect and the expansion of the Universe. Edwin Hubble knew Wirtz’ publications quite well. The modern reader would find Wirtz’ own understanding diffuse and contradictory in some aspects, but that reflected the early literature on nebulae, to which he himself made important contributions. The 100th anniversary provides a good opportunity to present an English transcription to the community, which can be found in the appendix. This anniversary also provokes to ask for the present status of cosmology which many authors see in a crisis. From an observational viewpoint it shall be illustrated that until today there is no consistent/convincing understanding of how the Universe evolved.","1 Carl Wirtz and the expansion of the Universe, the beginning of modern observational cosmology 1.1 Carl Wirtz is not prominent The discovery of the expansion of the Universe marked the beginning of modern observational cosmology. How that happened was rather a process than a moment (e.g. van den Bergh \APACyear2011; Grøn \APACyear2018; Cervantes-Cota \BOthers. \APACyear2023) and the prominent names are known to every astronomer and with Einstein even outside the astronomical community. Relativistic cosmology has been founded by Einstein himself and de Sitter, but de Sitter was also a key author for making Einstein’s theory quickly known to the English speaking community (de Sitter, \APACyear1916\APACexlab\BCnt1, \APACyear1916\APACexlab\BCnt2) (de Sitter wrote German articles as well). The same can be said for Eddington (\APACyear1923) and Weyl (\APACyear1922). Friedmann’s fundamental papers on world models as general solutions of Einstein’s field equations (Friedmann, \APACyear1922, \APACyear1924) were written in German and were more or less ignored by the community for about a decade (although Einstein knew them well) until Robertson (\APACyear1933) presented his review of relativistic cosmology. Friedmann already introduced the beginning of he Universe and described pulsating Universes with a period of the order 10^{10} years. On the observational side, the question who discovered the expansion normally leads to the names of Lemaitre and Hubble. However, in the recent review article of Cervantes-Cota \BOthers. (\APACyear2023), a paragraph is also devoted to Carl Wirtz, a name that is not known to every astronomer. The low prominence the work of Carl Wirtz enjoys in comparison with Lemaitre and Hubble, is inappropriate. There are a few modern references to Wirtz in the English literature, most notably Duerbeck (\APACyear1989), Seitter \BBA Duerbeck (\APACyear1999) and Duerbeck (\APACyear2002), now also Cervantes-Cota \BOthers. (\APACyear2023). There are a few more in German in amateur journals, we cite Priester \BBA Schaaf (\APACyear1987), Duerbeck \BBA Seitter (\APACyear1990\APACexlab\BCnt1), Duerbeck \BBA Seitter (\APACyear1990\APACexlab\BCnt2), and Appenzeller (\APACyear2009). In the year 1924, Wirtz published in ""Astronomische Nachrichten"" a paper (Wirtz, \APACyear1924) which has the characteristics to count as the starting point of modern observational cosmology (at the time of writing: 22 citations). We find its 100th anniversary a nice opportunity to present that short paper in an English translation to the community in the same journal. The translated article is presented in the Appendix. Basic biographical dates: Carl Wirtz was born 1876 in Krefeld and died 1938 in Hamburg. He got his PhD 1899 at Bonn University, worked as assistant in Vienna until 1901, then moved to Strasbourg, where he got a professorship in 1909 and stayed there until 1919. Then he moved to Kiel as professor and was forced into early retirement 1937. In the following, the work of Carl Wirtz shall be briefly introduced in the context of cosmological quest in the early 20th century. 1.2 Earlier work of Carl Wirtz in the context of cosmology from 1915 -1923 It was Schwarzschild who introduced the concept of curvature of space in cosmology (Schwarzschild, \APACyear1900; Stewart \BOthers., \APACyear1998). He estimated the minimal curvature radius of the Universe to be approximately 10^{8} astronomical units by consideration of the maximal inhomogeneity of the distribution of stars. When Einstein (\APACyear1915) published his famous equation connecting gravity with the geometry of space-time, the Universe was still commonly understood as consisting mainly of a stellar system populating a large volume, as Schwarzschild did. The distinction between Galactic and extragalactic objects had no reason. The distances and nature of the spiral nebulae were unknown. de Sitter (\APACyear1917) published his world models as cosmological solutions to Einstein’s equations. De Sitter’s Universe (his model B) was finite with a certain curvature radius R, static and empty. Time delation with distance r resulted through the metric tensor element g_{44} which in the four-dimensional line element ds^{2}=...+cos^{2}(r/R)c^{2}dt^{2} effectively gives a non-linear relation between redshift and distance. de Sitter himself tried to identify cosmological redshifts among various types of stars and only had the Andromeda nebula, NGC 1068, and NGC 4696 as extragalactic objects. But Andromeda is approaching and the other two galaxies show quite similar velocities about 1000 km/s, so the effect of increasing time dilation with distance which he hoped to see, was not visible. At about the same time Wirtz (\APACyear1918) wrote a paper on proper motions of 378 spiral nebulae. That was a topic that he had addressed earlier in several contributions. He used the (spurious) proper motions to derive an apex of the solar motion quite similar to that from stellar streams. The mean proper motion for the spirals resulted to 0.027 ""/year. However, this time he also compiled 15 radial velocities of spiral galaxies and noted the higher velocities with respect to the stellar system, but also that a common velocity and a vertex direction is not a good representation. The introduction of a constant K independent from the coordinates at the sphere led to a much better representation through the equation v=V_{x}*cos\alpha~{}cos\delta+V_{y}*sin\alpha~{}cos\delta+V_{z}*sin\delta+K (1) v being the velocity of an individual object at spherical coordinates \alpha and \delta, and V_{x},V_{y},V_{z} the velocity components of the (negative) apex motion of the observer. He got the best fit of the above relation for V_{x}=-145 km/s, V_{y}=-268 km/s, V_{z}=-762 km/s (i.e. V=-820 km/s), and K=+656 km/s, and interpreted V as the radial correspondence to the proper motion. Then it is straightforward to derive a mean distance for the spiral nebulae. His result was 6.66 kpc and he concluded that the spiral nebulae are located outside the Milky Way system. He then tried to interpret the ""strange"" constant K. In his own words: If we give this value a literal interpretation, then it means that the system of spiral nebulae drives apart with respect to the actual position of the solar system as the centre with a velocity of +656 km/s. The paper concludes: Also in the case of the nebulae one expects that we hold single threads of a mesh in hands whose complete pattern we still cannot disentangle. Four years later Wirtz published a paper entitled On the statistics of the radial motions of spiral nebulae and globular clusters (Wirtz, \APACyear1922), again in ""Astronomische Nachrichten"". Strikingly, proper motions of the nebulae that had accompanied his scientific career for a long time, were not mentioned at all. Apparently this chapter had been closed with the previous paper. Now Wirtz lists only radial velocities of 29 spiral nebulae and 10 globular clusters. For the spiral nebulae, he finds a somewhat higher K-term of +887 km/s, meaning that the entire system is moving away with this common radial velocity. He now considers the residuals to this common movements which he calls ""errors"" and understands them as the peculiar velocities of the spiral galaxies. For these velocities, he finds a slight dependence on Galactic latitude in the sense that the polar nebulae have higher velocities and on apparent magnitude, where the brightest nebulae are approaching and the fainter ones receding. This dependence also appears with the angular diameters. Wirtz: Of course, one finds the analog relation also with the diameter of the nebulae, where small diameters belong to a positive change of the distance, large diameters to a negative change. These statistical phenomena occur on top of the most striking and principal instance that can be described as if the system of spiral nebulae was drifting apart relative to our position… and the dependence on magnitude indicates that the nearest or the most massive spiral nebulae show a slower outward motion than the more distant or the less massive ones. Here appears for the first time the notion of a radial velocity dependent on distance, but disguised as a second order effect that is still covered by the imagination of a system of spiral galaxies moving away with a constant velocity. In modern language, Wirtz had to deal with the fact that many of his galaxies are not in the Hubble-flow. Wirtz’ main observational work in Strasbourg was the photometry of nebulae, including globular clusters. This resulted in a catalogue of surface brightnesses, total brightnesses, and angular diameters for 566 objects (Wirtz, \APACyear1923). Presumably, Wirtz saw that apparent magnitudes and angular diameters are not well correlated and therefore did not use magnitudes as distance indicators. 1.3 The role of Friedmann Two publications of the mathematician, meteorologist, geophysicist, pilot and adventurer dominated the cosmological field for (at least!) 100 years. In a static Universe the old mystification of circular orbits may have survived. Planetary orbits must(!) be circular, elliptical orbits are ugly. And the Universe cannot be variable! In this analogy, Friedmann’s role is the closest to Kepler’s. In an expanding Friedmann universe, time dilation results naturally as proportional to 1+z and a linear velocity-distance relation is necessary to maintain homogeneity. In 1922 Friedmann (\APACyear1922) already introduced ""non-stationary"" world models (in German). There are no indications that Wirtz was aware of Friedmann’s work, but even Einstein needed some time to see that Friedmann’s solutions were indeed correct. The most famous physicist of the epoch gives in a brief note his blessings to the concept of an expanding Universe and is ignored himself (Einstein, \APACyear1923)! Perhaps the German language again was an obstacle for the international community. Also Friedmann’s last paper (Friedmann, \APACyear1924) did not express interest in observational evidence for his models. 1.4 The work of Silberstein, Oepik, Lundmark and Strömberg In the same year 1924 appeared the work of Silberstein (\APACyear1924). Silberstein understood de Sitter’s time dilation as a relativistic Doppler effect and derived a relation between redshift and curvature radius of the Universe. To determine this radius R, he used the radial velocities of 7 globular clusters and got R=1.1\times 10^{7} pc. Silberstein (\APACyear1929) still argued strongly for a value of 1.67\times 10^{6}pc, meaning that in his de Sitter model, the largest possible distance in the Universe would be 1.3\times 10^{6} pc, contradicting strongly the by then established extragalactic distances. The extragalactic nature of the Andromeda nebula was by 1922 quite clear. Oepik (\APACyear1922), by using the rotational velocity and applying an early version of the Tully-Fisher relation, got a distance of 500000 pc, three years before E\BPBIP. Hubble (\APACyear1925) published in a much more famous paper the Cepheid distance of NGC 6822 of 214 000 pc, in Hubble’s words the first object definitely assigned to a region outside the galactic system. However, it is Lundmark (\APACyear1924\APACexlab\BCnt1) who deserved the credit to have shown the first ""Hubble-diagram"", although a velocity-distance relation is not recognisable in his graph. As for Silberstein, his main objective was to measure the curvature radius of a de Sitter Universe, and not the nature of spiral galaxies. For that he needed absolute distances for the spiral nebulae. He used the Andromeda nebulae as the reference distance of 200 000 pc which he got from comparing Galactic novae with novae in Andromeda. He explicitly did not exclude a distance of 500 000 pc, as favoured by Oepik (\APACyear1922). Lundmark adopted Silberstein’s formula and interpretation, but with a much enlarged data set, ranging from nearby stars over Cepheids and novae to the sample of spiral galaxies which had been used also by Wirtz (he apparently got the spiral galaxy data personally from Slipher, Lundmark \APACyear1924\APACexlab\BCnt2). Lundmark determined individual distances for his spiral galaxies through the comparison with Andromeda regarding brightnesses and angular diameters. Without an established distance scale, the individual errors are of course large, particularly the three most distant galaxies (on Lundmark’s scale) NGC 278, NGC 1700, and NGC 2681 show moderate velocities around 700 km/s. And many nebulae are, in modern terms, not in the Hubble flow, unfortunately also Andromeda which is the reference. Lundmark also gives ""mean distances"" for his sample by the comparison of the K-term with (spurious) proper motions. Although he labels the proper motion values as ""illusory"" and ""only of use for giving a upper limit to the motion"", the mere fact that there is a common proper motion of spiral nebulae, clashed with the concept of expansion. A third author who used Slipher’s radial velocities in a cosmological context was Gustaf Strömberg (Stromberg, \APACyear1925). He performed his analysis without the knowledge of Lundmarks results, but expressed in the published paper his satisfaction about the agreement with the main result, namely that there is no relation of redshift with distance. Strömberg calculated the distances for spiral nebulae as 10^{0.2m} where the m are apparent magnitudes as given by Wirtz (\APACyear1923)! He only gives correlation coefficients. The strongest correlation has been found with the angular distance from the sun’s apex. As one sees already from Lundmarks sample, the individual distances based on magnitudes are simply too uncertain to uncover any velocity-distance relation. One may find some irony in the fact that Wirtz’ own measurements are used against his findings. Strömberg moreover understood the redshifts as caused by de Sitter’s time dilation not as indicating a real motion, which he considers to be ""ficticious"". 1.5 Wirtz’ influence on Hubble To what degree Hubble was influenced by the reading of Wirtz’ publications will remain elusive in detail (see Way \APACyear2013 for more comments on Hubble’s work) , but there is no doubt that Hubble knew Wirtz’ 1924 paper (and others) quite well. The German language apparently was no obstacle to him. He cited regularly German papers, but firstly not Wirtz, particularly not in E. Hubble (\APACyear1929) nor in E. Hubble \BBA Humason (\APACyear1931). However, Wirtz occupies a quite prominent place in Hubble’s book ""The realm of the nebulae"" from 1936. In the chapter ""The velocity-distance relation"" Hubble describes the content of Wirtz (\APACyear1918) and Wirtz (\APACyear1922) in some detail (for the latter paper, he cites the year as 1921, not 1922). But he praises Wirtz mainly as the discoverer of the ""K-term"", the mean residual of radial velocities of the nebulae after correction for solar motion. Hubble calls Wirtz even ""the leader in the field"". He qualifies the results of the 1924 paper as ""suggestive rather than definitive"". In conjunction with the discussion of the work of Lundmark (\APACyear1924\APACexlab\BCnt2) and Strömberg (\APACyear1925), Hubble concluded that by 1925, ""the data did not establish a relation"" (between distance and radial velocity) and so repeated Lundmark’s and Strömberg’s statements, probably without looking further into the details of their distance determinations. Nevertheless, Hubble adds a footnote ""Wirtz later published a stimulating popular presentation of the investigation and the implications of the results (Scientia, 38, 303, 1925) in which he assumes that de Sitter’s prediction has been verified."" The 100 years after Wirtz’ paper have mainly seen an acceptance of Friedmann’s understanding of the expansion of the Universe, culminating in the emergence of the ""standard cosmology"" with Dark Matter and Dark Energy as its pillars, simultaneously its threats."
