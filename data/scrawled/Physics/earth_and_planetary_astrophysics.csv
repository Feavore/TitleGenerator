In this paper, we use MAROON-X observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect to measure the projected obliquity of the LP 261-75 (also known as TOI-1779) system, focusing on the fully-convective M dwarf LP 261-75A and the transiting brown dwarf LP 261-75C. This is the first obliquity constraint of a brown dwarf orbiting an M dwarf and the seventh obliquity constraint of a brown dwarf overall. We measure a projected obliquity of 5^{+11}_{-10} degrees and a true obliquity of 14^{+8}_{-7} degrees for the system, meaning that the system is well-aligned and that the star is rotating very nearly edge-on, with an inclination of 90^{o}\,\pm\,11^{o}. The system thus follows along with the trends observed in transiting brown dwarfs around hotter stars, which typically have low obliquities. The tendency for brown dwarfs to be aligned may point to some enhanced obliquity damping in brown dwarf systems, but there is also a possibility that the LP 261-75 system was simply formed aligned. In addition, we note that the brown dwarf’s radius (R_{C}\,=\,0.9 RJ) is not consistent with the youth of the system or radius trends observed in other brown dwarfs, indicating that LP 261-75C may have an unusual formation history.","A system’s obliquity (\psi) is the angle between a star’s rotation axis and the angular momentum of its companions’ orbits. The obliquity of a planetary system can give us insight about a system’s formation and dynamical history. Alignment (zero obliquity) makes sense assuming a planet and its stars form out of the same rotating gas cloud, and implies a dynamically inactive system (or, alternatively, alignment due to tidal interactions between the star and its companions- see, e.g., Albrecht et al., 2022, and the references therein). Misalignment may be a sign of past dynamical interactions, but some studies have shown that some systems may form misaligned, due to magnetic disk-star interactions (Lai et al., 2011) or chaotic accretion processes during formation (Takaishi et al., 2020), though chaotic accretion cannot account for \psi\,>\,20^{o}. Measuring \psi directly is difficult. However, we can measure a star’s projected obliquity (\lambda) using the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect (Rossiter, 1924; McLaughlin, 1924), which utilizes high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements of the host star in order to track the transiting companion’s passage over the surface of the star. As the companion travels over the rotating star’s surface, it will eclipse blueshifted and redshifted portions of the star, making the stellar surface appear to be “redder” and “bluer” respectively. This will cause a RV anomaly whose precise shape depends on the orientation of the companion’s orbit. The RM effect has been used to great success to study the orbits of many exoplanet systems (e.g., Queloz et al., 2000; Winn et al., 2005, 2006). Several trends have emerged from the ensemble of well-characterized planet orbits to-date. It appears that planets orbiting stars with T_{\mathrm{eff}}\,>\,6250 K tend to have misaligned orbits, while cooler stars tend to have more aligned orbits (Winn et al., 2010). The location of this break point is comparable to the Kraft break (Kraft, 1967), above which stars lack convective envelopes. This seems to imply that the characteristics of a star’s convective envelope could influence the realigning timescale (or primordial alignment) of its companions, with highly convective stars having more aligned companions (see, e.g., Albrecht et al., 2022). However, it is difficult to extrapolate this trend to fully-convective stars (which are stars with masses below about 0.35 M_{\odot}, see Chabrier & Baraffe, 1997), as there are relatively few obliquity measurements of M dwarfs. Currently, there are only seven systems around M dwarfs with measured obliquities: AU Mic (Addison et al., 2021), TRAPPIST-1 (Hirano et al., 2020; Brady et al., 2023), GJ 436 (Bourrier et al., 2022), GJ 3470 (Stefánsson et al., 2022), K2-25 (Stefànsson et al., 2020), K2-33 (Hirano et al., 2024), and TOI 4201 (Gan et al., 2024). The small number of obliquities is due to several factors. Firstly, M dwarfs tend to be dim, making it difficult to perform the high-precision spectrograph measurements necessary to measure a planet’s obliquity. Additionally, the RM effect signal is directly proportional to the star’s rotation velocity, and there are relatively few known M dwarfs with both high rotational velocities and known transiting planets. This is exacerbated by the fact that rapidly-rotating M dwarfs tend to be highly active, which can obscure transiting planet signals in their photometry. Of the well-studied M dwarf systems, two (AU Mic and K2-33) have ages below 30 Myr (Mamajek & Bell, 2014; Mann et al., 2016). Both stars have strong activity signals in their RVs that complicate the measurements of their obliquities (and lower their precision), but both are consistent with being well-aligned. If we consider the obliquity damping timescale for stars with convective envelopes (utilizing equilibrium tide theory) from Albrecht et al. (2012), we find that both systems are unlikely to have undergone significant realignment over their lifetimes. It is thus reasonable to assume these obliquities are primordial. This seems to imply that M dwarf systems may tend to have low primordial obliquities, but additional (and higher-precision) measurements of young M dwarf planet obliquities are necessary to support this hypothesis. Turning our attention to the remaining older M dwarfs, we expect that, due to the convective nature of their host stars, their planets would have low obliquities. However, two of the five systems (GJ 436 and GJ 3470) have misaligned, near-polar orbits. This is especially interesting given their similar masses (within a factor of two) to one of the well-aligned M dwarfs, K2-25. The obliquity damping timescales discussed in the previous paragraph indicate that none of these three systems have had time to damp their stars’ obliquities, so it is unexpected that one is aligned while the other two are not. While this could be the result of primordial obliquity differences, it is also notable that the two misaligned planets orbit stars with M\,>\,0.35\,M_{\odot} (and are thus unlikely to be fully convective), while K2-25’s host is likely fully convective, with a mass of 0.26 M⊙ (Stefànsson et al., 2020). This seems to point to some change in obliquity damping processes at the fully-convective boundary. However, given the small sample size, we need to increase the number of M dwarfs with well-characterized obliquities in order to explore this trend. In this paper, we measure the obliquity of the LP 261-75 system. LP 261-75A is a small, nearby mid-M dwarf. It has a mass of around 0.3 M_{\odot} (Irwin et al., 2018; Paegert et al., 2021), meaning that it is likely to be fully convective (Chabrier & Baraffe, 1997). LP 261-75 is fairly unique compared to other M dwarfs with RM measurements. Its membership in the AB Doradus Moving Group (Sun et al., 2022) means that it is likely around 100 Myr old, making it intermediate in age between K2-33 and the older M dwarfs with measured obliquities. Unlike the other young M dwarfs, however, LP 261-75A has an extremely large transiting companion- the brown dwarf LP 261-75C is about 30% the radius of the primary. As the strength of the RM signal is proportional to the ratio of the radii of the companion to the host squared, it provides us with a uniquely large RM signal to study. LP 261-75C also has a <\,2d orbital period that places it well within the brown dwarf desert, a well-known under-density of brown dwarfs at orbital periods <\,100 days (Grether & Lineweaver, 2006), which may be due to their different formation mechanisms compared to planets. There are currently only RM obliquity measurements for six other brown dwarf systems: CoRoT-3b (Triaud et al., 2009), KELT-1b (Siverd et al., 2012), WASP-30b (Triaud et al., 2013), HATS-70b (Zhou et al., 2019), GPX-1b (Giacalone et al., 2024), and TOI-2533b (Ferreira et al., 2024). Additionally, there are no obliquity measurements for brown dwarfs around M dwarfs. Despite their different formation mechanisms, brown dwarfs may still have high obliquities. Jennings & Chiang (2021) showed that the turbulence and collisions between fragments in a disk can create brown dwarfs with obliquities up to 90o. While Marcussen & Albrecht (2022) found that the majority of close double stars are aligned, their studied sample primarily consisted of stars with much earlier spectral types than LP 261-75A, making it difficult to generalize their results. LP 261-75C’s large radius, short orbital period and rapidly-rotating host star thus give us the unique opportunity to perform a very high-precision RM measurement of a star in a young system, bridging the gap between the uncertain obliquities of the young M dwarfs and the precise obliquities of the older M dwarfs. It also provides us with the chance to study a young brown-dwarf desert object in a system with a well-characterized age. This is the first measurement of a brown dwarf obliquity around a cool host star. In Section 2, we will summarize the properties of the LP 261-75 system. In Section 3, we describe the MAROON-X RVs that we have collected on the LP 261-75A, as well as all other observations available on the system. Section 4 details our analyses on the photometry, spectra, and RVs of the system. Section 5 touches on the implications our our results, and Section 6 concludes."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10313v1,"A Survey of Cassini Images of Spokes in Saturn’s Rings: 
Unusual Spoke Types and Seasonal Trends","Spokes are localized clouds of fine particles that appear over the outer part of Saturn’s B ring. Over the course of the Cassini Mission, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) obtained over 20,000 images of the outer B ring, providing the most comprehensive data set for quantifying spoke properties currently available. Consistent with prior work, we find that spokes typically appear as dark features when the lit side of the rings are viewed at low phase angles, and as bright features when the rings are viewed at high phase angles or the dark side of the rings are observed. However, we also find examples of spokes on the dark side of the rings that transition between being brighter and darker than the background ring as they move around the planet. Most interestingly, we also identify spokes that appear to be darker than the background ring near their center and brighter than the background ring near their edges. These “mixed spokes” indicate that the particle size distribution can vary spatially within a spoke. In addition, we document seasonal variations in the overall spoke activity over the course of the Cassini mission using statistics derived from lit-side imaging sequences. These statistics demonstrate that while spokes can be detected over a wide range of solar elevation angles, spoke activity increases dramatically when the Sun is within 10∘ of the ring plane.","Spokes are forward-scattering clouds of micron-sized particles found above Saturn’s B-ring (Collins et al., 1980; Porco & Danielson, 1982; D’Aversa et al., 2010) that can appear as light or dark patches depending on the lighting geometry (Smith et al., 1981; Grün et al., 1983). They were first officially seen in images obtained by Voyager 1 in 1980 and Voyager 2 in 1981 (Collins et al., 1980; Smith et al., 1981). However, there are some indications they were seen earlier than this. Stephan O’meara reported seeing them in 1976, when the ring plane opening angle was approximately 15\degree. There are also reports of ‘clouds,’ ‘spots,’ and other peculiarities appearing within the rings of Saturn going as far back as the 1700s (Alexander, 1962; Robinson, 1980). The Voyager data showed that spoke activity was correlated with asymmetries in Saturn’s magnetosphere (Porco & Danielson, 1982), while more recent observations revealed that the prevalence of spokes varies with Saturn’s seasons, with them occurring most prominently around Saturn’s equinoxes (McGhee et al., 2005; Horányi et al., 2009; Simon et al., 2023). Multiple explanations have been proposed for how these features form over the B ring. The seasonality of the spokes’ appearance and their correlation with asymmetries in Saturn’s magnetosphere (Porco & Danielson, 1982; Mitchell et al., 2013) strongly suggest that non-gravitational processes are involved. These features could be triggered by electric storms on Saturn (Jones et al., 2006) or meteoroid impacts (Goertz & Morfill, 1983) and the dusty material released by these events could be dispersed by a plasma cloud, electron beams, plasma waves or avalanches of small dust particles (Hill & Mendis, 1982; Goertz & Morfill, 1983; Tagger et al., 1991; Grün et al., 1992; Yaroshenko et al., 2008; Hirata et al., 2022; Farmer & Goldreich, 2005; Morfill & Thomas, 2005; Hamilton, 2006). However, thus far none of these theoretical ideas have been fully tested against the full span of the Cassini observations. While Cassini obtained over 20,000 images of spokes over the course of the mission, published studies of those data have focused primarily on only a few observations from time periods when the spokes first became obvious (Mitchell et al., 2006) and when the spokes were strongly active (Mitchell et al., 2013). This study provides a more comprehensive look of the available spoke observations that should help facilitate future investigations of their properties and origins. Section 2 describes how we cataloged many of the spoke observations obtained by the Cassini cameras and how the data from each image were transformed into standardized maps of ring brightness versus radius and longitude that facilitate comparisons among different observations. Section 3 provides a high-level qualitative summary of these data, including which observations contained visible spokes and whether those spokes appeared as dark or bright features. This survey also revealed some unusual and previously unreported types of spokes, including spokes that could appear as either bright or dark depending on where they were observed, and others that have both bright and dark components. Next, Section 4 examines how spoke activity varies over time. We identify a small number of faint spokes visible late in the Cassini mission. In addition, we develop some simple metrics for average spoke activity that we apply to a sub-set of the lit-side spoke images. These data provide a clearer picture of how spoke activity changes with Saturn’s seasons. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the findings of this preliminary study."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10305v1,Three-dimensional dynamical evolution of cloud particle microphysics in sub-stellar atmospheres,"Context. Understanding of cloud microphysics and the evolution of cloud structures in sub-stellar atmospheres remains a key challenge in the JWST era. The abundance of new JWST data necessitates models that are suitable for coupling with large-scale simulations, such as general circulation models (GCMs), in order to fully understand and assess the complex feedback effects of clouds on the atmosphere, and their influence on observed spectral and variability characteristics.Aims. We aim to develop a 2-moment, time-dependent bulk microphysical cloud model that is suitable for GCMs of sub-stellar atmospheres.Methods. We derive a set of moment equations for the particle mass distribution and develop a microphysical cloud model employing a 2-moment approach. We include homogeneous nucleation, condensation, and collisional microphysical processes that evolve the moments of a particle size distribution in time. We couple our new 2-moment scheme with the Exo-FMS GCM to simulate the evolution of KCl clouds in a T_{\rm int} = 400 K, log g = 4.25 Y-dwarf atmosphere and examine the effect of cloud opacity on the atmospheric characteristics.Results. Our results show a generally homogeneous global KCl cloud, with only slight variations occurring in the equatorial regions. The atmosphere is generally sluggish and stagnant, with near-zero vertical velocities throughout most of the atmosphere. Only very small grains \sim0.01 \mum remain lofted in the atmosphere. Our results conform with dynamical theories for this parameter regime, with our model showing minimal (\sim0.2%) spectral variability at mid-infrared wavelengths.Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that the 2-moment bulk cloud microphysical scheme is a highly suitable method for investigating cloud characteristics and feedback in GCMs and other large scale simulations of sub-stellar atmospheres. Split moment schemes and mixed material grains will be explored in a follow up study.","JWST has revolutionised both the quantity and detail of data available for characterising the atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. In addition to offering clearer signatures of the gas phase compositions of sub-stellar atmospheres compared to previous data, JWST provides valuable constraints on the global cloud components in these atmospheres through measuring their wavelength dependent impacts on the spectrum. This presents an opportunity to model and gain deeper insights into the 3D processes of cloud formation in these atmospheres. It also allows us to understand their feedback effects on thermal profiles, gas phase chemistry, and dynamical flows. Unveiling how each microphysical process affects global cloud structures and goes on to impact observed properties of sub-stellar objects will be key questions to answer in the coming years. Before JWST’s launch, several studies looked at the possibility of detecting the infrared features of cloud particle absorption by different condensates for hot Jupiter exoplanets (Wakeford & Sing, 2015), as well as possibly inferring differences in the east-west limb-to-limb variance in cloud coverage (Parmentier et al., 2016; Powell et al., 2019). Recently, evidence for these effects in JWST data have been discovered, with silicate features present in WASP-17b (Grant et al., 2023), WASP-107b (Dyrek et al., 2024), and HD 189733b (Inglis et al., 2024) as well as cloud and chemistry limb asymmetry found in WASP-39b (Espinoza et al., 2024) and WASP-107b (Murphy et al., 2024). The evidence of limb asymmetry shows that cloud formation is inherently a 3D problem in gas giant atmospheres, with the microphysical properties of the clouds interacting with the dynamical flows of the atmosphere giving rise to this inhomogeneity. Moran et al. (2024) suggest that the shape of the SiO2 absorption features in hot Jupiters could infer the specific temperature-pressure dependent crystal structure of the cloud particles, further linking the local atmospheric thermochemical environment to the observed cloud properties. Emission spectra are also aiding the characterisation of clouds, for example Bell et al. (2024) reported that the phase curve of WASP-43b showed consistent evidence of strong cloud coverage on the nightside of the planet. Schlawin et al. (2024) also reported strong temperature and cloud inhomogeneity on the dayside of WASP-69b from its JWST emission spectrum. Studies coupling time-dependent clouds in multi-dimensional simulations for hot Jupiter atmospheres have been explored in recent years, with several schemes available in the literature. Lines et al. (2019) and Christie et al. (2021) couple the diagnostic eddysed model of Ackerman & Marley (2001) to the Unified Model UK Met Office GCM to model the clouds on HD 209458b. Komacek et al. (2022) present a single moment saturation adjustment scheme with relaxation timescale based on the model presented in Tan & Showman (2019). This model was applied in an ultra hot Jupiter context in Komacek et al. (2022), with similar saturation adjustment schemes now being used by several groups (e.g. Teinturier et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024). Lee et al. (2016) and Lines et al. (2018) use a moment scheme based on the Helling et al. (2008) methodology coupled to a GCM to examine 3D cloud microphysics in the canonical hot Jupiters HD 189733b and HD 209458b. Lee (2023) present the ‘mini-cloud’ 4-moment scheme based on the asymptotic giant branch outflow dust formation theory in Gail & Sedlmayr (2013), with additions for ‘dirty’ mixed composition grains following Helling et al. (2008). Powell & Zhang (2024) used a pseudo-2D version of the CARMA bin microphysical cloud model (Gao et al., 2018; Gao & Benneke, 2018), showing a complex dynamic exchange of vapour and condensed species across the globe compared to static 1D models. They show that differences in cloud composition and particle sizes are driven by dynamical processes as well as microphysical processes. Despite this progress, modelling cloud microphysics self-consistently in exoplanet dynamical models remains a challenging prospect, but is key goal required for deeper understanding of the effect of clouds in hot Jupiter atmospheres. In brown dwarf atmospheres, evidence of silicate features were seen in Spitzer IRAC data of L-dwarfs (e.g. Cushing et al., 2006; Suárez & Metchev, 2022), suggesting that active cloud formation was occurring in these objects. In addition, photometric surveys using ground based instruments and Spitzer showed signs of variability in T and L dwarf atmospheres, in particular at the L-T transition (e.g. Radigan et al., 2014; Apai et al., 2017; Vos et al., 2019), which suggested cloud formation was driving atmospheric variability. HST observations, sometimes with combined with Spitzer, also provided evidence of cloud driven spectral variability in some objects (e.g. Yang et al., 2015; Biller et al., 2018; Bowler et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), with large \gtrsim 10% variations in the amplitude of the near-infrared \ceH2O features found in a variety of objects. With this evidence of the effects of cloud coverage in brown dwarfs, the launch of JWST offers the ability to fully characterise the complexity of these clouds to understand their compositions, effect on the thermal and mixing properties of the atmosphere, and how they interact with chemical species. Miles et al. (2023) report a wide wavelength range spectrum of VHS 1256 b, finding disequilibrium chemistry and a silicate feature. Biller et al. (2024) recently published spectral variability light curves across the NIRSpec Prism and MIRI Low Resolution Spectrograph (LRS) wavelength ranges for WISE 1049A and WISE 1049B, finding evidence for chemical species and cloud coverage variability in their atmospheres, in addition to a variable silicate absorption feature for WISE 1049A. This suggests a strongly inhomogenous atmosphere with dynamically driven small and large scale dynamical features forming and dissipating in these atmospheres at shorter timescales than the rotational period. Previous theoretical and modelling studies of brown dwarfs have revealed the time-dependent connection between atmospheric temperatures, dynamics, cloud coverage and chemistry. Zhang & Showman (2014) used a pulsing thermal perturbation scheme to imitate the temperature forcing induced by convection near the radiative-convective boundary coupled to a global shallow-water model. They found the strength of the atmospheric temperature variability greatly depended on the dynamical regime of the atmosphere. Robinson & Marley (2014) used a 1D model with deep temperature perturbations to investigate the connection between deep convective motions and the observed spectral features. Morley et al. (2014) modeled variability of T- and Y-dwarfs with patchy sulfide and salt cloud layers. Tan & Showman (2019) find that cloud opacity feedback can trigger convective motions, giving rise to cloud condensation and evaporation cycles. Tremblin et al. (2020) apply modified temperature-pressure (T-p) profiles to mimic thermal variability and also investigate the effects of non-equilibrium chemistry on the variability and strength of spectral features. Luna & Morley (2021) use the Ackerman & Marley (2001) equilibrium cloud model to produce vertical cloud profiles that attempt to fit the Spitzer IRS silicate feature in brown dwarfs (Cushing et al., 2006; Looper et al., 2008) and Spitzer photometric band variability (Metchev et al., 2015). Hammond et al. (2023) found four main dynamical regimes for brown dwarfs, depending on the non-dimensional radiative timescale and thermal Rossby number. Lacy & Burrows (2023) show significant effects when considering the impact of \ceH2O clouds on Y-dwarf thermal structures. Lee et al. (2023) and Lee et al. (2024) examine the impact of large scale dynamical features in brown dwarfs and directly imaged exoplanets on the 3D chemical, cloud and variability characteristics of the atmosphere. Owing to the continued release of JWST data starting to characterise the cloud structures of sub-stellar atmospheres in detail, microphysical models are warranted to deeply understand the processes that give rise to the specific features and effects seen in the spectra of sub-stellar objects. Bulk, also known as moment, schemes remain a popular option in Earth Science for modelling cloud microphysics due to their relative simplicity and computational efficiency (for review, see e.g., Morrison et al., 2020). Only a few moments (in this paper, two) are required to be evolved in the dynamical system, with each moment representing an average value of the particle size distribution and the microphysical processes altering these mean values in time. For sub-stellar atmospheres, bulk schemes have been developed by a few groups (e.g. Helling et al., 2008; Ohno & Okuzumi, 2017, 2018; Ormel & Min, 2019; Woitke et al., 2020; Lee, 2023; Huang et al., 2024) but only a few studies have used bulk schemes directly coupled time-dependently to 3D atmospheric simulations (e.g. Lee et al., 2016; Lines et al., 2018; Lee, 2023). Bulk schemes are contrasted with bin or spectral models (e.g. CARMA, Gao et al., 2018), which evolve the discretised particle size distribution in time through calculating the fluxes in and out each bin size. Typically 40-70 or more mass or size bins are required to adequately resolve the size distribution in these models (e.g. Adams et al., 2019), making them much more computationally demanding than bulk methods and more challenging to include in large scale 3D atmospheric modelling with present resources. In this study, we expand the mini-cloud code package (Lee, 2023) to include a new 2-moment cloud microphysical scheme able to be efficiently coupled to time-dependent sub-stellar atmosphere simulations in a simple manner. The present 2-moment scheme also newly implements the collision growth of cloud particles, which is a key process to produce rain droplets in Earth clouds (Morrison et al., 2020). In Section 2, we present the mass moment scheme and detail the individual microphysical source and sink terms in the set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In Section 3, we couple our new 2-moment scheme to the 3D Exo-FMS GCM to simulate a Y-dwarf as a test application. In Section 5, we post-process our simulation and generate emission spectra and variability light curves. In Section 6, we discuss our results in context to other modelling efforts and observational data. Section 7 contains the summary and conclusions of our study. Each of the new moment schemes are available online111https://github.com/ELeeAstro/mini_cloud."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09940v1,Modeling protoplanetary disk heating by planet-induced spiral shocks,"We investigate the heating of protoplanetary disks caused by shocks associated with spiral density waves induced by an embedded planet. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the dependence of shock heating rates on various disk and planetary parameters. Our results show that the shock heating rates are primarily influenced by the planet’s mass and the disk’s viscosity, while being insensitive to the thermal relaxation rate and the radial profiles of the disk’s surface density and sound speed. We provide universal empirical formulas for the shock heating rates produced by the primary and secondary spiral arms as a function of orbital radius, viscosity parameter \alpha, and planet-to-star mass ratio q. The obtained formulas are accurate within a factor of a few for a moderately viscous and adiabatic disk with a planet massive enough that its spiral arms are strongly nonlinear. Using these universal relations, we show that shock heating can overwhelm viscous heating when the disk viscosity is low (\alpha\lesssim 10^{-3}) and the planet is massive (q\gtrsim 10^{-3}). Our empirical relations for the shock heating rates are simple and can be easily implemented into radially one-dimensional models of gas and dust evolution in protoplanetary disks.","Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets. Their physical properties, such as temperature and ionization structures, influence the characteristics of the planets that form within them. The disk’s temperature structure is of particular interest because it plays a crucial role in determining the chemical composition of forming planets (e.g., Bitsch et al., 2019). For instance, the location of the snow line significantly influences the water content of protoplanets (e.g., Sato et al., 2016), although other internal processes can also affect their water budgets (Lichtenberg et al., 2019; Johansen et al., 2021). Most models of disk thermal evolution (e.g., Bitsch et al., 2015; Mori et al., 2021) assume that disks are primarily heated by stellar irradiation and/or accretion heating. However, this assumption may not hold for disks that already harbor a massive planet. A planet embedded in a gas disk excites spiral density waves (e.g., Goldreich & Tremaine, 1979), which eventually shock as they propagate away from the planet (Goodman & Rafikov, 2001; Rafikov, 2002). These shocks generate entropy, causing secular heating of the disk gas (Rafikov, 2016). If the planet is massive and the disk is optically thick, this shock heating can raise the disk temperature (Richert et al., 2015; Lyra et al., 2016; Rafikov, 2016; Ziampras et al., 2020), potentially altering the chemical composition of the gas and dust remaining in the disk. Recent discoveries of protoplanetary disk substructures (e.g., Andrews, 2020; Bae et al., 2023) and isotopic dichotomies in meteorites (e.g., Kruijer et al., 2020; Kleine et al., 2020) suggest that giant protoplanets may have formed while their parent disks, including the solar nebula, were still abundant in solids. This implies that planet-induced shock heating could have impacted the composition of solar system bodies and exoplanets that formed from solids in the vicinity of giant planets. Recently, Ziampras et al. (2020) conducted a systematic study of planet-induced shock heating using two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic simulations of disks with an embedded giant planet. They demonstrated that shock heating by a Jupiter-mass planet can significantly alter the disk’s temperature profile and even shift the location of the snow line. However, the disk temperature obtained directly from such simulations depends not only on shock heating but also on the disk’s radiative cooling (i.e., opacity) and accretion heating. Both the disk’s opacity and accretion heating rate are largely uncertain and can change with dust evolution (e.g., Oka et al., 2011; Kondo et al., 2023; Delage et al., 2023; Fukuhara & Okuzumi, 2024). To model planet-induced shock heating as independently as possible from these uncertainties, it is necessary to extract the shock heating rate from these simulations and analyze its dependence on the planet’s mass and distance from the planet. In this paper, we model the planet-induced shock heating rate using 2D hydrodynamic simulations of disks with an embedded planet. From these simulations, we extract the radial profiles of the shock heating rates by directly measuring the jumps in the disk’s specific entropy across planet-induced shock waves. We discover universal scaling relations for the radial heating rate profiles from the simulations and provide simple analytic expressions for these universal relations. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the simulation setups and analysis methods. Section 3 presents our simulation results and analysis. Section 4 discusses an application and caveats of our study, and Section 5 presents a summary."

Formulation and proof-of-concept simulations,"Planetesimal formation via the streaming and gravitational instabilities of dust in protoplanetary disks requires a local enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio. Radial drift of large grains toward pressure bumps in gas disks is a plausible mechanism for achieving the required dust concentration. However, recent millimeter disk observations suggest that the maximum sizes of dust grains in these disks are considerably smaller than predicted by dust evolution models that assume sticky grains. This indicates that the grains may be more strongly coupled to the gas and hence drift more slowly than previously anticipated. In this study, we propose a new dust retention mechanism that enables an enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio in disks with slowly drifting grains. This mechanism assumes that a surface accretion flow driven by magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) winds removes disk gas while retaining the slowly drifting grains below the flow. This process is expected to occur when the timescale of gas removal is shorter than the timescale of dust radial advection. To test this, we develop a radially one-dimensional framework for the transport of gas and dust in a disk with a vertically nonuniform accretion structure. Using this framework, we simulate the growth, fragmentation, and radial transport of dust grains in surface-accreting disks. Our simulations confirm a significant enhancement of the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratio when the predicted conditions for dust retention are met. Dust retention by MHD-driven surface accretion flows may thus pave the way for planetesimal formation from poorly sticky grains.","How dust grains in protoplanetary disks form kilometer-sized planetesimals remains an outstanding question in planet formation theory. It is widely accepted that (sub)micron-sized grains in these disks coagulate through mutual sticking, forming macroscopic aggregates, often called “pebbles” (Johansen et al., 2014). However, the extent to which these aggregates can grow is much less clear, as their collision velocities often exceed 1–10 \rm m~{}s^{-1}, potentially leading to fragmentation or bouncing rather than sticking upon collision (e.g., Güttler et al., 2010; Zsom et al., 2011; Birnstiel et al., 2012; Dominik & Dullemond, 2024). In addition, aerodynamic drag causes macroscopic aggregates to drift radially, either inward or outward, relative to the background gas (Whipple, 1972; Adachi et al., 1976; Weidenschilling, 1977). Growth of the aggregates can only occur if they grow faster than they drift. If the grains are extremely sticky, they may form highly porous aggregates and grow faster than they drift (Okuzumi et al., 2012; Kataoka et al., 2013). Otherwise, the aggregates can only grow to the maximum size limited by bouncing, fragmentation, or radial drift (Birnstiel et al., 2012). In this case, planetesimal formation is expected to occur via the gravitational collapse of dust overdensities produced by dust settling and radial pile-up (e.g., Goldreich & Ward, 1973; Sekiya, 1998; Youdin & Shu, 2002; Ida & Guillot, 2016; Hyodo et al., 2021), the streaming instability (e.g., Youdin & Goodman, 2005; Johansen & Youdin, 2007; Carrera et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017; Li & Youdin, 2021), pressure bumps (e.g., Whipple, 1972; Haghighipour & Boss, 2003; Pinilla et al., 2012), vortices (e.g., Barge & Sommeria, 1995), or secular gravitational instability (e.g., Youdin, 2011; Takahashi & Inutsuka, 2014; Tominaga et al., 2020). The stickiness of dust grains dictates which pathway of planetesimal formation is likely to be realized. However, the stickiness of real dust grains in protoplanetary disks is poorly understood from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. In principle, the stickiness of grains depends on their size, surface roughness, and material composition (Dominik & Tielens, 1997). Until recently, it was believed that grains coated with water ice are so sticky that they can stick at collision velocities up to 10–70 \rm m~{}s^{-1}, depending on the size of the grains constituting the aggregates (Dominik & Tielens, 1997; Wada et al., 2009, 2013; Gundlach & Blum, 2015). This led to the conventional idea that grains in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks, which are presumably ice-rich, could grow to sizes ranging from centimeters to even decimeters (e.g., Birnstiel et al., 2010; Okuzumi et al., 2012). However, more recent experiments (Gundlach et al., 2018; Musiolik & Wurm, 2019) suggest that water ice is not as sticky at low temperatures (\lesssim150–200 K) as previously thought. Additionally, other experiments (Musiolik et al., 2016a, b; Fritscher & Teiser, 2021) indicate that CO2 ice, which likely exists in disk regions with temperatures below 80 K (e.g., Okuzumi et al., 2016), is less sticky than water ice (see Arakawa & Krijt 2021 for a possible explanation of why CO2 ice is less sticky). Clearly, further theoretical and experimental investigations are needed to fully understand the sticking properties of dust grains of various compositions. On the other hand, growing observational evidence suggests that grains in the outer parts of protoplanetary disks are indeed less sticky than previously expected. Multiwavelength and polarimetric observations of dust thermal emission at (sub)millimeter wavelengths provide information about the size distribution of dust grains/aggregates in disks (for a review, see Miotello et al., 2023). Uniformly polarized (sub)millimeter emission from a number of disks (e.g., Stephens et al., 2017, 2023; Hull et al., 2018) is widely interpreted as evidence for \sim 0.1–1 mm-sized grains being abundant, at least in the outer parts of these disks (Kataoka et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016; Ueda et al., 2021). The necessity for abundant 0.1–1 mm-sized grains also aligns with the spectral slopes of the (sub)millimeter emission (Liu, 2019; Zhu et al., 2019; Ueda et al., 2020; Chung et al., 2024). Since turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks is generally weak (for a review, see Rosotti, 2023), the dominance of 0.1–1 mm-sized grains suggests that they are poorly sticky; otherwise, they would grow larger in such a quiescent environment. These observations are consistent with dust evolution models that assume poorly sticky grains, with maximum sticking velocities as low as 0.2–1 \rm m~{}s^{-1} (Okuzumi & Tazaki, 2019; Jiang et al., 2024; Ueda et al., 2024). The possibility that dust grains in protoplanetary disks may be poorly sticky has significant implications for our understanding of dust evolution and planetesimal formation. Firstly, it seems extremely unlikely that dust coagulation alone leads to planetesimal formation. Secondly, since poorly sticky grains stop growing while still being strongly coupled to the gas disk, they would only drift radially at a slow speed. Interestingly, millimeter disk observations show that the dust disks in the \sim5-Myr-old Upper Scorpius star-forming region are, on average, smaller than those in \sim1–2 Myr-old star-forming regions, but only by a factor of \sim2 (Hendler et al., 2020). This could potentially indicate that the grains only drift on a timescale of several Myr. In comparison, conventional sticky icy grains would grow to 1–10 cm in size and drift toward the central star within 1 Myr (e.g., Birnstiel et al., 2012; Okuzumi et al., 2012), unless they are trapped by pressure bumps (Pinilla et al., 2012). Recently, Lee (2024) analyzed the masses of dust rings found in recent millimeter disk observations and concluded that the grains would be considerably coupled to the gas, meaning they would drift inward only slowly. This is because the inferred dust ring masses are considerably smaller than what would be expected if the pressure bumps had already trapped all the grains in the outer disks. A low speed of dust radial drift could severely limit the potential pathways for planetesimal formation. Both runaway dust settling toward the midplane (Sekiya, 1998; Youdin & Shu, 2002) and strong dust clumping by the streaming instability (Carrera et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017; Li & Youdin, 2021) require a prior enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio. Radial dust drift toward pressure bumps has been considered a plausible mechanism for local dust concentration leading to planetesimal formation (e.g., Haghighipour & Boss, 2003; Johansen et al., 2014). However, slow radial drift delays this concentration process. The analysis by Lee (2024) suggests that the observed dust rings are stable against strong clumping by the streaming instability. Even if radial dust concentration is inefficient, increasing the disk’s dust-to-gas mass ratio is possible by removing gas. Previous studies have proposed that gas removal by photoevaporative (Gorti et al., 2015; Carrera et al., 2017) and magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) disk winds (Suzuki et al., 2010; Bai, 2016) can potentially lead to planetesimal formation. However, the efficiency of planetesimal formation via wind mass loss critically depends on the assumed mass loss rate and its radial profile (Ercolano et al., 2017). In this study, we propose surface gas accretion driven by MHD winds as an alternative mechanism for dust retention in disks with slowly drifting grains. Global non-ideal MHD simulations of protoplanetary disks show that gas accretion is narrowly concentrated on the surface of inner disk regions having a poorly ionized interior (e.g., Bai, 2013, 2017; Bai & Stone, 2013; Gressel et al., 2015; Riols et al., 2020; Lesur, 2021; Iwasaki et al., 2024). The emergence of this surface accretion flow is a consequence of the disk surface being relatively well-ionized and, therefore, well-coupled to the magnetic field threading the disk. The wind, driven by the global magnetic field, extracts angular momentum from the disk surface, driving a surface accretion flow. This flow transports gas, but will not transport dust that has already settled on the midplane due to stellar gravity. In this study, we demonstrate that surface gas accretion, combined with slow radial dust drift, can indeed lead to the enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio required for planetesimal formation. Figure 1: Schematic showing gas and dust transport in protoplanetary disks with uniform and surface accretion flows (left and right figures, respectively). In a disk with a vertically uniform accretion flow, the gas flow around the midplane flushes the vertically settled dust toward the central star. In a disk with an accretion flow localized near its surface, the settled dust avoids accretion toward the star. As long as the disk gas remains approximately in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium, the decrease in gas surface density due to surface accretion always results in a decrease in midplane gas density (see text). Therefore, the dust-to-gas ratio at the midplane in the surface-accreting disk would increase over time, provided that the radial inward drift of the dust due to gas drag is slow. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the basic mechanism of dust retention proposed in this study. We then formulate the radial transport of gas and dust in surface-accreting disks in section 3. Our proof-of-concept simulation models are presented in section 4 and their results are provided in section 5. Our conclusions are presented in section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09908v1,A Non-Primordial Origin for the Widest Binaries in the Kuiper Belt,"Nearly one-third of objects occupying the most circular, coplanar Kuiper belt orbits (the cold classical belt) are binary, and several percent of them are “ultra-wide” binaries (UWBs): \sim100-km-sized companions spaced by tens of thousands of km. UWBs are dynamically fragile, and their existence is thought to constrain early Solar System processes and conditions. However, we demonstrate that UWBs can instead attain their wide architectures well after the Solar System’s earliest epochs, when Neptune’s orbital migration implants the modern non-cold, or “dynamic”, Kuiper belt population. During this implantation, cold classical belt binaries are likely to have close encounters with many planetesimals scattered across the region, which can efficiently dissociate any existing UWBs and widen a small fraction of tighter binaries into UWB-like arrangements. Thus, today’s UWBs may not be primordial and cannot be used to constrain the early Solar System as directly as previously surmised.","At least \sim30% of cold classical belt objects actually consist of binary systems of typically roughly equal-size companions orbiting one another, distinguishing the cold classical belt from the rest of the Kuiper belt where these binaries are significantly rarer (31; 30). Amongst these binaries, perhaps 1–10% are UWBs, in which the two components co-orbit with semimajor axes of at least 7% of the system’s Hill radius (though lower UWB fractions are possible since observing biases favor discovery of easily resolved, wide binaries; 24; 36; 4). Due to their extreme companion separations, UWBs are dynamically fragile, and UWB companions can be dissociated through moderately close (\lesssim 1 Neptunian Hill radius) encounters with Neptune (34; 41), impacts with \simkm-scale trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs)(38; 35), and close (<1 system Hill radius) gravitational encounters with other large TNOs(38; 5). Although they are relatively rare, UWBs’ existence and their susceptibility to disruption have been leveraged to constrain their minimum proximity to Neptune in the early solar system(34) and the number of \simkm-sized TNOs residing in the modern Kuiper belt(35). In addition, the mutual orbits of TNO binaries have been used to constrain the distribution of angular momentum within planetesimal-forming clumps of pebbles in the early solar system and generating the widest binaries is a challenge for planetesimal formation models(42; 15; 28). A critical implicit assumption upon which these constraints rest is that UWB orbital architectures are in fact primordial. However, past works have shown that UWBs can be derived via the expansion of more tightly bound binaries’ semimajor axes through repeated impacts with small TNOs(35; 4) as well as close, impulse-delivering passages of larger TNOs, since these random impulses drive a diffusion in binary orbital energy (5). Nonetheless, significant UWB production in this manner requires numbers of passing/impacting TNO bodies that are well in excess of the modern Kuiper belt’s population estimates(35; 5). This population discrepancy may not invalidate a non-primordial UWB production mechanism, though. While the cold classical belt likely formed in-situ and is stable indefinitely, the same cannot be said for much of the rest of the Kuiper belt(25; 6). Over time, the orbits of some objects occupying the detached, resonant, scattering, and hot Kuiper belt populations(12) (which we group together as a “dynamic” Kuiper belt) diffuse until they begin strongly interacting with the giant planets, and they are ultimately ejected from the solar system or trapped into the Oort cloud(33; 21; 8). Thus, the population of the dynamic Kuiper belt is smaller today than it has ever been, and its time-averaged value over the solar system’s history must be higher than the modern one. In addition, it is generally thought that the dynamic Kuiper belt is derived from a primordial belt of planetesimals whose population was \sim2–3 orders of magnitude greater than the modern Kuiper belt’s(26; 22). As Neptune migrated away from the Sun and through this primordial belt, some of these belt members become trapped into the modern dynamic Kuiper belt, but this process is extremely inefficient(27). All but 0.1–1% of primordial belt objects are ejected or trapped in the Oort cloud during this process. However, the removal of a primordial belt object typically takes at least tens of Myrs, during which these eventually-lost objects spend much of their time crossing the cold classical belt. This again suggests that the time-averaged number of TNOs crossing the cold classical belt may be substantially higher than that implied from modern observations. Thus, prior work studying the widening of TNO binaries may have significantly underestimated the effect since they did not consider the larger numbers of TNOs in earlier epochs(5). This is confirmed in Figure 1. Here we analyze the time-varying distribution of orbits within a 4-Gyr numerical simulation of Kuiper belt formation that includes our inner 3 giant planets on their modern orbits while Neptune migrates from 24–30 au(2). We use this simulation’s orbital distribution to estimate the expected encounter rate between simulation bodies and members of the cold classical Kuiper belt at any given simulation time(5; 40; 1). In Figure 1A, we plot this encounter rate relative to the encounter rate implied at the end of the simulation (which we assume is analogous to the modern Kuiper belt), and we see that during the simulation’s first 35 Myrs, the encounter rate is over 100 times greater than the modern one. Moreover, it remains elevated by an order of magnitude for another 200 Myrs and is at least double the modern encounter rate for \sim1 Gyr. Although many of the bodies that transiently cross the cold classical belt do so at higher inclinations, which decreases their individual encounter probabilities, the probabilities are still significant (7; 1), and the number of such bodies is huge compared to the modern dynamic Kuiper belt. This acts to significantly enhance the number of close encounters we expect a binary to undergo. Figure 1B plots the cumulative encounter flux, and we see that half of all expected encounters should occur during the first 100 Myrs of solar system history, when the Kuiper belt has orbital properties very different from today’s. This leads to variations in the encounter velocity distribution, which is shown in Figure 1C. Here we see that the median encounter velocity exceeds 2 km/s for much of the first Gyr, which is well above the 1 km/s encounter velocities assumed in many past works(38; 35; 4). Thus, considering the long-term evolution of the Kuiper belt is critical when modeling the dynamical evolution of UWBs. Figure 1: Changes in the TNO encountering population over time. A: The predicted rate of TNO encounters for a cold classical body as a function of time inferred from a simulation of Kuiper belt formation(2) (red curve). The predicted rate is plotted and normalized relative to a fixed rate inferred by the end state of the simulation (dashed line), and the shaded region highlights the excess encounters predicted relative to the assumption of a non-evolving Kuiper belt. B: The cumulative flux of TNO encounters for a cold classical body as a function of time inferred from the Kuiper belt formation simulation (red curve). The cumulative flux is also shown for a static Kuiper belt inferred by the end state of the simulation (dashed curve), and the difference between the two is shaded. C: The median TNO encounter velocity for a cold classical body as a function of time inferred from the Kuiper belt formation simulation (red curve). The shaded region spans the 5th to 95th encounter velocity percentiles, and the dashed line marks the 1 km/s velocity assumed in prior studies of TNO binary dynamics(35; 4)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09905v1,Eccentricities of Close Stellar Binaries,"Orbits of stellar binaries are in general eccentric. This encodes information about the formation process. Here, we use thousands of main-sequence binaries from the GAIA DR3 catalog to reveal that, binaries inwards of a few AU exhibit a simple Rayleigh distribution with a mode \sigma_{e}\simeq 0.30. We find the same distribution for binaries from M to A spectral types, and from tens of days to 10^{3}days (possibly extending to tens of AU).This observed distribution is most likely primordial. Its Rayleigh form suggests an origin in weak scattering, while its invariant mode demands a universal process. We experiment with exciting binary eccentricities by ejecting brown dwarfs, and find that the eccentricities reach an equi-partition value of \sigma_{e}\simeq\sqrt{M_{\rm bd}/M_{*}}. So to explain the observed mode, these brown dwarfs will have to be of order one tenth the stellar masses, and be at least as abundant in the Galaxy as the close binaries. The veracity of such a proposal remains to be tested.","Binary stars are common in the Galaxy (Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Fischer & Marcy, 1992). Their orbits are invariably eccentric. The distribution of these eccentricities encodes accessible information about their formation, and is a useful property invoked in a wide range of studies. Surprisingly, for binaries closer than tens of AU (’close binaries’), such a fundamental property is not well known. Multiple lines of evidences suggest two main modes of binary formation (see Duchêne & Kraus, 2013; Offner et al., 2023, for reviews). Wide binaries (>50 AU,111Interestingly, 50AU, or P\sim 10^{5}days, is roughly the peak of the binary distribution for Sun-like stars (Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Raghavan et al., 2010). see, e.g., Parker et al., 2009) likely form following direct collapse of individual components. These are either weakly bound at birth or are captured after birth. Their occurrence is insensitive to or rises with stellar metallicity (El-Badry & Rix, 2019; Hwang et al., 2021), and the two components appear to be randomly paired in mass (Moe & Di Stefano, 2017). Close binaries, on the other hand, are now thought to have formed through gravitational fragmentation in massive circum-stellar disks (see review by Kratter & Lodato, 2016). Their occurrence anti-correlates with stellar metallicity (Moe et al., 2019), and the two masses are correlated (Raghavan et al., 2010; Duchêne & Kraus, 2013; Moe & Di Stefano, 2017) with an excess at equal-mass (’twin-binaries’, Moe & Di Stefano, 2017; El-Badry et al., 2019). These different formation pathways also manifest in binary eccentricities – a property that is observationally accessible and dynamically informative. Wide binaries are observationally determined to have a thermal distribution (dN/de\propto e), as inferred from spectroscopic binaries (Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Raghavan et al., 2010) and visual binaries(Tokovinin, 2020; Hwang et al., 2022).222Very wide binaries (>10^{3} AU) also appear to be super-thermal (Tokovinin, 2020; Hwang et al., 2022), suggesting another mechanism at play. This reflects a dynamic past in the birth clusters (Parker et al., 2009), where plentiful scatterings with other stars have relaxed the binaries towards a ’thermal’ equilibrium (Jeans, 1919; Heggie, 1975). This concordance between theory and observation does not, however, extend to close binaries. There are no theoretical predictions for their e-distribution, owing to the uncertain fragmentation process. On the observational side, their e-distribution remains murky, though it clearly differs from that of the wide binaries. The current wisdom is that they are consistent with being uniform,333Binaries with massive primaries (O/B stars) appear ’thermal’, down to periods as short as tens of days, possibly related to their higher triple fraction (Moe & Di Stefano, 2017). dN/de\propto e^{0} (Raghavan et al., 2010; Duchêne & Kraus, 2013; Moe & Di Stefano, 2017; Tokovinin, 2000; Geller et al., 2021; Hwang et al., 2022), but this is only a best-guess estimate that is based on small samples444Some studies have suggested a more ’bell-shaped’ e-distribution (Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Geller & Mathieu, 2012), but Moe & Di Stefano (2017) concluded that the data are too sparse to tell. and has no ready theoretical explanation. For instance, selecting from the volume-complete (to 25pc) Solar-type sample (Raghavan et al., 2010; Moe & Di Stefano, 2017), for binaries with periods 10^{2}-10^{3}d, so as to exclude binaries that may have experienced tidal circularization or may have been disturbed by passing-by stars, we are left with only 18 binaries. It is clear a much larger sample is sorely needed. The Gaia mission (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2016, 2023a), especially with its most recent non-single-star catalogue published in DR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2023b), provides just this sample. The GAIA binaries, as we show here, sharpen our vision dramatically. The e-distribution for those inward of a few AU follows, distinctly, a Rayleigh distribution."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09506v1,Gl 725A b: a potential super-Earth detected with SOPHIE and SPIRou in an M dwarf binary system at 3.5 pc,"We report the discovery of a super-Earth candidate orbiting the nearby mid M dwarf Gl 725A using the radial velocity (RV) method. The planetary signal has been independently identified using high-precision RVs from the SOPHIE and SPIRou spectrographs, in the optical and near-infrared domains, respectively. We modelled the stellar activity signal jointly with the planet using two Gaussian Processes, one for each instrument to account for the chromaticity of the stellar activity and instrumental systematics, along with a Keplerian model. The signal is significantly detected with a RV semi-amplitude of 1.67\pm 0.20 m/s. The planet Gl 725A b is found to be in an orbit compatible with circular with a period of 11.2201\pm 0.0051 days. We analysed 27 sectors of TESS photometry on which no transit event was found. We determined a minimum mass of M_{p}\sin{i}=2.78\pm 0.35\,M_{\oplus} which places the planet in the super-Earth regime. Using Mass-Radius relationships we predict a planetary radius to be between 1.2 and 2.0\,R_{\oplus}. The proximity of Gl 725A, of only 3.5 pc, makes this new exoplanet one of the closest to Earth and joins the group of S-type low-mass planets in short orbits (P<15 d) around close M dwarfs.","M dwarfs are cool and low-mass stars that comprise the most abundant stellar type in our Galaxy, reaching up to 75% of the galactic stellar population (Henry et al. 2006). They are attractive targets for exoplanetary science, in particular for the search of Earth-mass planets. Due to their low mass and size, the Doppler shift and transit depth produced by a small planet orbiting an M dwarf is larger than that of a Sun-like star, for a given planet mass/radius, and orbital distance. Reylé et al. (2021) found that 61\% of stars and brown dwarfs within the Solar neighborhood (d¡10 pc) are M dwarfs. However, only 24\% of these group of close M dwarfs have known exoplanets111As of March 2024, source: the Exoplanet Archive exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu. Most of the exoplanets around M dwarfs in the Solar neighbourhood have been discovered with the radial velocity (RV) technique and therefore, only a minimum mass can be determined. Regarding the multiplicity of the stellar host, Reylé et al. (2021) found a stellar multiplicity frequency of 27\% in the Solar neighbourhood. However, only nine multiple M dwarf systems have been confirmed as exoplanet hosts, and for all the them, the planets found only orbit one component of the system. This type of planet is known as circumstellar or S-type planet (Dvorak 1986). Several surveys focused on searching for planets around M dwarfs have started in the last decades, using transit photometry and RV techniques. On the photometry side, some examples of projects are MEarth (Nutzman & Charbonneau 2008), TRAPPIST (Gillon et al. 2011), SPECULOOS (Delrez et al. 2018), and TIERRAS (Garcia-Mejia et al. 2020). On the other hand, projects such as: HPF (Mahadevan et al. 2012), HARPS (Bonfils et al. 2013), HARPS-N (Covino et al. 2013), IRD (Kotani et al. 2014), CARMENES (Quirrenbach et al. 2018), MAROON-X (Seifahrt et al. 2018), SOPHIE (Hobson et al. 2018), SPIRou (Donati et al. 2020), and NIRPS (Artigau et al. 2024), rely on high-precision Doppler spectroscopy. One key results of these surveys is that low-mass planets (1 ¡ M_{p}\sin{i}/M_{\oplus} ¡ 10) are common around M dwarfs (Bonfils et al. 2013; Kopparapu 2013; Dressing & Charbonneau 2013, 2015; Sabotta et al. 2021) and their frequency may be closely related to the spectral type (e.g., Pinamonti et al. 2022). However, despite the technical developments and efforts to discover low-mass planets around M dwarfs, stellar activity is currently one of the main challenges that hinders their detection. Cool stars host magnetic fields that generate activity features all over the stellar surfaces (Reiners 2012). These features co-rotate with the star producing quasi-periodic variations in the observed RVs. These RV variations induced by stellar activity can reach amplitudes of a few meters per second, even for less active stars, which can lead to false-positive exoplanet detection (e.g., Queloz et al. 2001; Huélamo et al. 2008; Carolo et al. 2014; Bortle et al. 2021). The development of near-infrared (NIR) spectrographs has been fundamental to enriching our understanding of the activity of M dwarfs. These stars emit most of their flux at NIR wavelengths, allowing to achieve higher sensitivity and precision than in the optical domain. Moreover, the spot-induced RV variability tends to decrease as a function of wavelength (Martín et al. 2006; Desort et al. 2007; Reiners et al. 2010; Mahmud et al. 2011; Cale et al. 2021) since the flux contrast between the stellar surface and the dark spots is smaller at NIR wavelengths, and therefore the induced RV jitter decreases (Reiners et al. 2010; Andersen & Korhonen 2015). As the stellar activity signal is chromatic, optical and NIR observations are of great help to disentangle the stellar activity jitter from the Keplerian signals (Reiners et al. 2013; Robertson et al. 2020). TW Hydrae (Huélamo et al. 2008), and AD Leo (Carleo et al. 2020; Carmona et al. 2023) are two examples of how multi-wavelength observations helped to reject the planet candidates as activity-induced false positives. SOPHIE and SPIRou are high-precision spectrographs in the optical and NIR domains, respectively. Our team is carrying out a synergy program in which dozens of early to mid-M dwarfs are observed with both instruments, providing in many cases contemporary observations. This allows us to have a better phase coverage of planet candidates and to study the chromaticity of the stellar activity signatures in the RVs. The results from this program (e.g., Carmona et al. 2023, Cortés-Zuleta et al. 2023) highlight the importance of using multi-wavelength observations to understand the activity of M dwarfs and their planets. In this work, we present the analysis of Gl 725 A, the brighter component of an M dwarf binary system in the Solar neighbourhood, located at only 3.5 pc from Earth. The mean angular separation of the binary system is of 14.9′′ which allows gathering individual high-precision spectroscopy. Gl 725 A is a mid M dwarf with low activity levels and a rotation period previously measured at 103.1\pm 6.1 d (Donati et al. 2023). The analysis of SOPHIE and SPIRou high-precision RV time series indicates the presence of a low-mass planet in a 11-day orbit, potentially in the super-Earth regime.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09417v1,The GAPS programme at TNG LXIV:,"Context. Super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are the most common types of planets outside the Solar System and likely represent the link between terrestrial planets and gas giants. Characterizing their physical and orbital properties and studying their multiplicity are key to testing and understanding their formation, migration, and evolution.Aims. We examined in depth the star BD+00 444 (GJ 105.5, TOI-2443; V=9.5 mag; d=23.9 pc), with the aim of characterizing and confirming the planetary nature of its small companion, the planet candidate TOI-2443.01, which was discovered by the TESS space telescope and subsequently validated by a follow-up statistical study.Methods. We monitored BD+00 444 with the HARPS-N spectrograph for 1.5 years to search for planet-induced radial-velocity (RV) variations, and then analyzed the RV measurements jointly with TESS and ground-based photometry.Results. We determined that the host is a quiet K5 V star with a radius of R_{\star}=0.631^{+0.013}_{-0.014}\,R_{\sun} and a mass of M_{\star}=0.642^{+0.026}_{-0.025}\,M_{\sun}. We revealed that the sub-Neptune BD+00 444 b has a radius of R_{\rm b}=2.36\pm 0.05\,R_{\oplus}, a mass of M_{\rm b}=4.8\pm 1.1\,M_{\oplus} and, consequently, a rather low-density value of \rho_{\rm b}=2.00^{+0.49}_{-0.45} g cm-3, which makes it compatible with both an Earth-like rocky interior with a thin H-He atmosphere and a half-rocky, half-water composition with a small amount of H-He. Having an orbital period of about 15.67 days and an equilibrium temperature of about 519 K, BD+00 444 b has an estimated transmission spectroscopy metric (TSM) of 159^{+46}_{-31}, which makes it ideal for atmospheric follow-up with the James Webb Space Telescope. Notably, it is the second most eccentric inner transiting planet, e=0.302^{+0.051}_{-0.035}, with a mass below 20\,M_{\oplus}, among those with well-determined eccentricities. We estimated that tidal forces from the host star affect both planet b’s rotation and eccentricity, and strong tidal dissipation may signal intense volcanic activity. Furthermore, our analysis suggests the presence of a sub-Neptune-mass planet candidate, BD+00 444 c, having an orbital period of P_{\rm c}=96.6\pm 1.4 days, and a minimum mass M_{\rm c}\sin{i}=9.3^{+1.8}_{-2.0}\,M_{\oplus}. With an equilibrium temperature of about 283 K, BD+00 444 c is right inside the habitable zone; however, this candidate necessitates further observations and stronger statistical evidence to be confirmed. We explored the formation and migration of both planets by means of population synthesis models, which revealed that both planets started their formation beyond the water snowline during the earliest phases of the life of their protoplanetary disk.","One of the main findings of the NASA Kepler mission (Borucki et al., 2010) is that, in our Galaxy, small planets (R_{\rm p}<4\,R_{\oplus}) at short orbital periods (P_{\rm orb}<100 days) are the most common type (see, e.g., Bean et al. 2021; Biazzo et al. 2022a for recent and comprehensive reviews). Small planets with 1R_{\oplus}<R_{\rm p}<4\,R_{\oplus} are thought to bridge the gap between the rocky, terrestrial planets and gas giants, even though they may have very large masses, such as the ultra-dense K2-292 b (M\approx 25\,M_{\oplus}; Luque et al., 2019). Kepler also revealed a deficit in the occurrence rate distribution at 1.5–2.0 R_{\oplus}, which is associated with a bimodality in their radius distribution (Fulton et al., 2017), probably depending on whether their rocky cores have been able to retain a substantial hydrogen-rich envelope or not. This dichotomy has now become the classical way to a further sub-classification into super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. At the same time, statistical studies of the orbital eccentricity of transiting planets with R_{\rm p}<6\,R_{\oplus} tell us that single transiting planets display higher average eccentricities than transiting planets in multiple systems, possibly reflecting differences in their formation pathways (Van Eylen & Albrecht, 2015; Xie et al., 2016). Numerical simulations show that massive external companions in multi-planet systems containing sub-Neptunes may perturb their orbits by exciting their eccentricity, producing wider spacing and increasing the mutual inclination among planets (Pu & Lai, 2018), thus making it more unlikely to observe multiple transiting planets. This result can explain why systems with fewer transiting planets are dynamically hotter (i.e., they are more eccentric and inclined) than those with more transiting planets, although this excitation can also be self-induced in tightly packed systems (Van Eylen et al., 2019). Currently, with TESS (Ricker et al., 2014) continuously scanning the skies, a large number of new sub-Neptune exoplanets are being discovered (see, e.g., Badenas-Agusti et al. 2020; Cointepas et al. 2021; Burt et al. 2021; Gan et al. 2022; Kiefer et al. 2023; Suárez Mascareño et al. 2024; Montalto et al. 2024). Characterizing these planets is crucial for enhancing our understanding of this class of exoplanets, particularly those that are favorable targets for atmospheric studies with the JWST. Indeed, observational constraints on sub-Neptune atmospheres can provide information on their compositions, though their atmospheric chemistry is still largely unknown given the technical difficulty of probing them until recently (e.g., Kreidberg et al., 2014; Tsiaras et al., 2016; Mikal-Evans et al., 2023). Thanks to JWST, which began operations in July 2022, we just entered a new era of atmospheric characterization (JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Team et al., 2023). The first investigations of sub-Neptunes atmospheres have already been performed, like those of K2-18 b (Madhusudhan et al., 2023) and TOI-270 d (Holmberg & Madhusudhan, 2024), although the interpretation of these transmission spectra raised some controversies (e.g., Wogan et al. 2024). A large observational program is currently running to investigate the atmospheric presence and composition of a dozen super-Earths and sub-Neptunes exoplanets (i.e., Compositions of Mini-Planet Atmospheres for Statistical Study, COMPASS; Wallack et al., 2024). Figure 1: Target pixel file from the TESS observation of Sector 31, centered on BD+00 444, which is marked with a white cross. The SPOC pipeline aperture is shown by shaded red squares, and the Gaia satellite DR3 catalog (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2023) is also overlaid with symbol sizes proportional to the Gaia magnitude difference with BD+00 444. On 6 January 2021, the TESS target star TIC 318753380 (BD+00 444, GJ 105.5) was officially named TOI-2443 (TESS Object of Interest; Guerrero et al. 2021), following the summary of the data validation report (DVR) produced by the TESS Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) (Jenkins et al., 2016) pipeline at the NASA Ames Research Center through the Transiting Planet Search (TPS; Jenkins 2002; Jenkins et al. 2010, 2020) and data validation (Twicken et al. 2018, Li et al. 2019) modules. In particular, as stated in this report, the difference image centroid locates the source of the transits within 4 arcsec of the target star’s location. The candidate TOI-2443.01 was designated as planet TOI-2443 b after the statistical validation of Mistry et al. (2023), in which the false positive probability was evaluated using the TRICERATOPS tool (Giacalone et al., 2021). However, in this work, we use the star’s original designation and refer to the planet as BD+00 444 b. Figure 2: Light curve of BD+00 444 as collected by TESS in Sector 31 with a two-minute cadence. Top panel: Light curve from the PDC-SAP pipeline. The black line represents our best-fit transit model (from Sect. 4.2). Bottom panel: Residuals of the best-fit model in parts per million. Within the Global Architecture of Planetary Systems (GAPS) Neptune project (Naponiello et al., 2022, 2023; Damasso et al., 2023), we started monitoring this target in July 2021, as the potential host of a sub-Neptune exoplanet. In particular, we took Doppler measurements with the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N; Cosentino et al. 2012) instrument installed at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) in La Palma (Spain). Here, we report the results of our observations and analyses that allowed us to measure the mass of BD+00 444 b and discover a new candidate planet in the system. In particular, BD+00 444 b emerged as the second most eccentric inner transiting planet with a mass below 20M_{\oplus}, among those with eccentricities determined with at least 5\sigma accuracy, after the recently discovered TOI-757 b (Alqasim et al., 2024), and the only one with a possible companion in the habitable zone (Sect. 5.1). This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the details of the photometric and RV observations. The star characterization is detailed in Sect. 3, while the analysis of the planetary signals is presented in Sect. 4 and discussed in Sect. 5. Finally, we draw the conclusions in Sect. 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09194v1,Enhanced Stability in Planetary Systems with Similar Masses,"This study employs numerical simulations to explore the relationship between the dynamical instability of planetary systems and the uniformity of planetary masses within the system, quantified by the Gini index. Our findings reveal a significant correlation between system stability and mass uniformity. Specifically, planetary systems with higher mass uniformity demonstrate increased stability, particularly when they are distant from first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs). In general, for non-resonant planetary systems with a constant total mass, non-equal mass systems are less stable than equal mass systems for a given spacing in units of mutual Hill radius. This instability may arise from the equipartition of the total random energy, which can lead to higher eccentricities in smaller planets, ultimately destabilizing the system. This work suggests that the observed mass uniformity within multi-planet systems detected by Kepler may result from a combination of survival bias and ongoing dynamical evolution processes.","NASA’s Kepler (Borucki et al., 2010) mission has uncovered a multitude of multi-planet systems characterized by compact and coplanar configurations (Lissauer et al., 2011; Fabrycky et al., 2014). Notably, these systems exhibit a remarkable tendency—the planets within them often share similar sizes and planetary masses, a phenomenon affectionately termed the ‘peas-in-a-pod’ trend (Weiss et al., 2018; Millholland et al., 2017; Wang, 2017; Goyal & Wang, 2022; Otegi et al., 2022). Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origins of the ‘peas-in-a-pod’ trend, which generally fall into two frameworks: planet formation and dynamical instability. In the former scenarios, attention is directed towards the early stages of planet assembly (Adams, 2019; Adams et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2021; Batygin & Morbidelli, 2023), where the planet formation process tends to yield planets with comparable masses. Conversely, the latter framework suggests that post-formation dynamical processes naturally lead to the observed intra-system uniformity through frequent planetary collisions, even if such uniformity was absent initially (Goldberg & Batygin, 2022; Lammers et al., 2023; Ghosh & Chatterjee, 2024). In this context, we propose an alternative viewpoint: multi-planet systems with relatively uniform planetary masses are more likely to have extended stable lifetimes, increasing their detectability. The dynamical instability of multi-planet systems has been extensively studied. A key factor that determines the stability of a particular system is the mutual separation K between neighboring planets, which is defined as follows: K=\frac{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}{R_{H}}, (1) where a_{i} and a_{i+1} represent the semi-major axes of consecutive planets (from inner to outer). The mutual Hill radius R_{H} is defined as: R_{H}=\frac{a_{i}+a_{i+1}}{2}\left(\frac{m_{i}+m_{i+1}}{3M_{\star}}\right)^{1/% 3}, (2) where m_{i} and m_{i+1} are the masses of the respective planets, and M_{\star} is the mass of the host star. Historically, most research (Chambers et al., 1996; Zhou et al., 2007; Smith & Lissauer, 2009; Funk et al., 2010; Obertas et al., 2017; Rice et al., 2018) has concentrated on systems with equal mutual separation (i.e. equal K) and equal mass, finding that the dynamical instability timescale \tau (the physical timescale t scaled by the orbital period of the inner most planet t_{0}) is proportional to K. Rice & Steffen (2023) investigates the dynamical instabilities in planetary systems with equal separations but non-equal masses, finding that the relationship between \tau and K persists as long as mass deviation remains below 30%. However, the study did not address how varying degrees of mass non-uniformity affect dynamical instability times. In this work, we explore the correlation between the dynamical instability timescale of planetary systems and their intra-system mass uniformity. Section 2 outlines the basic setup of our simulations. Section 3 discusses the relationship between the dynamical instability timescale and mass heterogeneity. A discussion on the dynamical instability of near resonant systems are given in Section 4. Section 5 provides a brief conclusion to our work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09179v1,Solar Energetic Particle Track Accumulation in Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt Dust Grains,"Interplanetary dust grains (IDPs) originate from a variety of sources and are dynamically transported across the solar system. While in transport, high-Z solar energetic particles (SEPs) with energies of \sim1 MeV/nuc leave damage tracks as they pass through IDPs. SEP track densities can be used as a measure of a grain’s space exposure and in turn, help to constrain their lifetimes and origins. Stratospherically collected IDPs with relatively high track densities (>10^{10} cm-2) have been interpreted as originating from the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. To further test this hypothesis, we use a dynamical dust grain tracing model to explore the accumulation of SEP tracks within EKB dust grains. We demonstrate that, neglecting collisions, dust grains with radii up to 500 \mum are capable of transiting from the EKB to 1 au despite gravitational perturbations from the outer planets, albeit with decreasing probability as a function of size. Despite this, we find that EKB grains cannot accumulate sufficient tracks to match those reported in the terrestrial stratospheric IDP collection when applying SEP track accumulation rates established from lunar samples at 1 au and assuming the SEP flux scales with heliocentric distance as r^{-1.7}. By exploring the radial scaling of the SEP flux, we find that a shallower SEP radial distribution of r^{-1.0} does allow for the accumulation of >10^{10} tracks cm-2 in EKB dust grains that reach 1 au. We urge further research into the propagation and distribution of high-Z SEPs throughout the heliosphere in order to better constrain track accumulation in IDPs.","Interplanetary dust grains (IDPs) originate from a wide variety of sources in the solar system, including asteroids, comets, and Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt (EKB) objects (e.g., see review by Koschny et al., 2019). After their birth, these grains are subject to several forces, including gravity, solar radiation pressure, Poynting-Robertson and solar-wind drag, and electromagnetism (e.g., Burns et al., 1979; Gustafson, 1994), which in turn allows IDPs to migrate long distances from their birthplace (e.g., Grün et al., 1985; Jackson & Zook, 1992; Liou et al., 1995; Landgraf et al., 2002; Moro-Martín & Malhotra, 2003). Thus, the influx of interplanetary dust grains to any object in space is dependent both on the location of such object and the time-integrated dynamics of IDPs originating from various sources. At Earth, for example, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the IDP influx is primarily composed of dust originating from Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) (e.g., Nesvorný et al., 2010; Carrillo-Sánchez et al., 2016) with smaller contributions from Oort Cloud comets (Nesvorný et al., 2011), Halley-type comets (Pokorný et al., 2014), and the main asteroid belt (e.g., Durda & Dermott, 1997; Nesvorný et al., 2010). In contrast, the IDP influx in the outer solar system is believed to transition from JFC-dominated near Jupiter to EKB-dominated near Neptune (e.g., Kuchner & Stark, 2010; Vitense et al., 2012; Poppe, 2016; Poppe et al., 2019; Piquette et al., 2019; Bernardoni et al., 2022). Additionally, dynamical simulations have also suggested the possibility that IDPs from the EKB could potentially migrate all the way to 1 au and comprise a component of the zodiacal cloud at Earth (e.g., Liou et al., 1996; Moro-Martín & Malhotra, 2003); however, supporting evidence for an influx of EKB grains to Earth has, until recently, remained lacking. As interplanetary dust grains migrate through the solar system, they are subjected to charged-particle irradiation over a wide range of species and energies. Among these various populations, high-Z (Z\geq 26) ions with energies of \sim1 MeV/nuc leave visible damage tracks within meteoritic minerals due to local melting and subsequent amorphization (e.g., Fleischer et al., 1975; Szenes et al., 2010). These track-inducing particles, comprised mainly of iron (Fe, Z=26) with minor contributions from even heavier elements (e.g., Ni, Zn, etc.), primarily originate from solar flares near the Sun’s surface or from coronal mass ejections that propagate through the heliosphere and are part of a broader population of ‘solar energetic particles’ (SEPs) (e.g., Reames, 2013, 2019). The convolution of the track-inducing SEP distribution throughout the heliosphere and the time history of IDP trajectories governs the rate at which IDPs accumulate damage tracks. Additionally, energetic particle irradiation of interplanetary dust grains by both SEPs and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) can also stimulate the formation of cosmogenic radionuclides (e.g., 10Be, 26Al, 53Mn, 60Fe), observations of which have recently been used to infer an outer solar system origin for several terrestrial micrometeorites (e.g., Feige et al., 2024). While highly complementary to the analysis of SEP-induced track densities studied here, we note that the production of cosmogenic nuclides within IDPs is not the focus of the current study and is left to future work. At Earth, interplanetary dust grains that have entered the terrestrial atmosphere can be collected in the stratosphere for inspection and analysis in ground-based laboratories. Bradley et al. (1984) reported the first discovery of SEP-induced tracks in stratospherically collected IDPs and subsequent studies have used SEP track densities to establish the exposure ages of IDPs and by extension, constrain their parent populations (e.g., Sandford, 1986; Flynn, 1989; Thiel et al., 1991). Building on this idea, Flynn (1994) and Flynn (1996) suggested that one could identify EKB grains that managed to transit to 1 au based on an unusually high amount of space exposure in the form of SEP-induced tracks. Recently, Keller & Flynn (2022) have reported the possible discovery of such EKB grains in the stratospheric IDP collection, based on a combination of unusually high SEP-induced track densities within some IDPs, \sim0.4–5\times 10^{11} tracks cm-2, and a revised calibration for the SEP track-production rate at 1 au based on lunar samples returned from the Apollo missions (Keller et al., 2021). By employing an analytical model of interplanetary dust grain dynamics under the influence of only Poynting-Robertson drag (i.e., without planetary perturbations), Keller & Flynn (2022) noted that grains released from the EKB region (\sim40-50 au) tended to accumulate between 0.4–4.0\times 10^{10} tracks cm-2, somewhat lower than their observed distribution. Keller & Flynn (2022) further suggested that, based on the dynamical results of Liou et al. (1996), trapping within MMRs outside the orbit of Neptune could yield the additional fraction of accumulated track densities needed to achieve a more satisfactory comparison with the observed high-track-density SEPs; however, an explicit dynamical calculation of this potential effect was not performed. Here, we build upon and extend the work of Keller & Flynn (2022) by using a dynamical dust grain model that includes all major perturbing forces to investigate the dynamics and track accumulation of interplanetary dust grains originating from the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. In particular, we explicitly assess the role that planetary perturbations, including trapping within MMRs, play in the overall accumulation of SEP-induced tracks within IDPs. Section 2 describes the modeling approach used in the study, including both the interplanetary dust dynamics model and the distribution of track-inducing SEPs. Section 3 presents the results of our simulations while Section 4 provides a discussion of our findings in the context of explaining high-track-density IDPs at 1 au. Finally, we conclude in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09011v1,Water vapor as a probe of the origin of gas in debris disks,"Context. Debris disks embrace the formation and evolution histories of planetary systems. Recent detections of gas in these disks have received considerable attention, as its origin ties up ongoing disk evolution and the present composition of planet-forming materials.Aims. Observations of the CO gas alone, however, cannot reliably differentiate between two leading, competing hypotheses: (1) the observed gas is the leftover of protoplanetary disk gas, and (2) the gas is the outcome of collisions between icy bodies. We propose that such differentiation may become possible by observing cold water vapor.Methods. Order-of-magnitude analyses and comparison with existing observations are performed.Results. We show that different hypotheses lead to different masses of water vapor. This occurs because, for both hypotheses, the presence of cold water vapor is attributed to photodesorption from dust particles by attenuated interstellar UV radiation. Cold water vapor cannot be observed by current astronomical facilities as most of its emission lines fall in the far-IR (FIR) range.Conclusions. This work highlights the need for a future FIR space observatory to reveal the origin of gas in debris disks and the evolution of planet-forming disks in general.","Debris disks are an integral component of (exo)planetary systems and are recognized as a good record holder of important insights about their origins and dynamical histories (e.g., Wyatt 2008; Hughes et al. 2018). They emerge after most of the gas in protoplanetary disks is gone, that is, systems are older than a few Myrs (typically 10-100 Myrs). These disks are viewed as massive or younger counterparts of the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt in the present-day solar system. Debris disks are, by definition, gas-free or at least gas-poor, and hence detections of gas in the disks have been one fundamental question (Slettebak 1975; Hobbs et al. 1985).111 Historically, the unusual presence of atomic absorption lines in stellar spectra was claimed by Slettebak (1975). The importance of this problem has recently been boosted up by unexpected detections of CO gas in \sim 20 relatively young (\sim 10-100 Myr) debris disks (e.g., Dent et al. 2014; Moór et al. 2017; Kral et al. 2017; Marino et al. 2020; Rebollido et al. 2022). The successful detections of gas in debris disks are still very limited as high sensitivity observations with long integration times are required even for known massive debris disks. The advent of Herschel and ALMA made it possible to conduct such observations. These observations detect the absorption and emission lines originating from atomic and molecular gas in debris disks, including C, O, Na, Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, Ti, Cr (e.g., Hobbs et al. 1985; Brandeker et al. 2004), and CO (e.g., Dent et al. 2014; Hughes et al. 2017). For emission lines, CO gas is the only confirmed molecule so far. Ongoing JWST observations aim to discover other molecules, including hot water vapor. Figure 1: A schematic diagram of time-evolution of planet-forming disks. The host star is denoted by the star symbol, planet-forming materials are represented by the brown and blue dots, and disk gas by the green ovals. Hypothesis 1 considers that observed gas is the leftover of primordial gas, while Hypothesis 2 considers that the gas is produced by collisions among icy bodies. Two competing hypotheses are currently proposed to understand the origin of gas in debris disks (e.g., Kral et al. 2016; Marino et al. 2020; Nakatani et al. 2021; Smirnov-Pinchukov et al. 2022, Figure 1): the first one is that observed gas may be leftover from massive gaseous protoplanetary disks, i.e., of primordial origin, and the competing one is that the gas may be recently generated by colliding planetesimals after gas disks dissipate, that is, it is of secondary origin.222 For the secondary origin, another hypothesis proposed in the literature is that the observed gas originates either from evaporation of cometary bodies due to the host stellar radiation (Beust et al. 1990) or from planetesimals degassing driven by radiogenic heating (Davidsson 2021; Bonsor et al. 2023). We hereafter refer to these two hypotheses as Hypothesis 1 and 2, respectively. A current, outstanding issue is that observations of CO gas alone cannot reliably determine which hypothesis is dominant. We here propose that water vapor can serve as a better probe to differentiate the origin of gas in debris disks. By performing order-of-magnitude calculations and comparing them with existing observations, we show that the mass of cold water vapor as a function of CO mass exhibits a non-monotonic distribution, leading to better differentiation. The detection of such water vapor will become possible only by a future far-IR (FIR) space observatory. This work therefore supports development of a FIR space probe mission to reveal the origin of gas in debris disks and the evolution of planet-forming disks in general."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08960v1,NGTS-33b: A Young Super-Jupiter Hosted by a Fast Rotating Massive Hot Star,"In the last few decades planet search surveys have been focusing on solar type stars, and only recently the high-mass regimes. This is mostly due to challenges arising from the lack of instrumental precision, and more importantly, the inherent active nature of fast rotating massive stars. Here we report NGTS-33b (TOI-6442b), a super-Jupiter planet with mass, radius and orbital period of 3.6 \pm 0.3 MJ, 1.64 \pm 0.07 RJ and 2.827972\pm 0.000001 days, respectively. The host is a fast rotating (0.6654\pm 0.0006 day) and hot (Teff = 7437 \pm 72 K) A9V type star, with a mass and radius of 1.60 \pm 0.11 M⊙ and 1.47 \pm 0.06 R⊙, respectively. Planet structure and Gyrochronology models shows that NGTS-33 is also very young with age limits of 10-50 Myr. In addition, membership analysis points towards the star being part of the Vela OB2 association, which has an age of \sim 20-35 Myr, thus providing further evidences about the young nature of NGTS-33. Its low bulk density of 0.19\pm0.03 g cm-3 is 13\% smaller than expected when compared to transiting hot Jupiters with similar masses. Such cannot be solely explained by its age, where an up to 15\% inflated atmosphere is expected from planet structure models. Finally, we found that its emission spectroscopy metric is similar to JWST community targets, making the planet an interesting target for atmospheric follow-up. Therefore, NGTS-33b’s discovery will not only add to the scarce population of young, massive and hot Jupiters, but will also help place further strong constraints on current formation and evolution models for such planetary systems.","The detection of the first hot Jupiters (HJ; Mayor & Queloz, 1995; Charbonneau et al., 2000) set a great milestone in the exoplanet field, paving the way to the detection of several more extra-solar planets. Ground-based spectroscopic (Valenti & Fischer, 2005; Jenkins et al., 2009) and photometric surveys (Bakos et al., 2004; Pollacco et al., 2006; Wheatley et al., 2013) were initially responsible for the detection and characterisation of several massive HJs. Yet, though challenging, a few Neptunes (e.g., HAT-P-11b, NGTS-14Ab; Bakos et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2021) have also been confirmed. Such selection bias towards massive planets is mostly due to the larger Doppler signal as well as transit depths induced by HJs given their mass and short orbital periods (P < 10 days), making their detection more favourable compared to less massive and/or longer period worlds. Besides that, ground-based missions are limited by atmospheric conditions (Cubillos et al., 2016; O’Brien et al., 2022) as well as the day-night cycle, hence challenging the discovery of long-period planets. On the other hand, space-based missions such as CoRoT (Auvergne et al., 2009), Kepler/K2 (Borucki et al., 2010) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; Ricker et al., 2015) were free of such atmospheric limitations, helping to reduce the bias by increasing the number of planet detections1115675 planets on 15 May 2024 according to https://exoplanet.eu/ significantly, with Kepler being responsible for the discovery of several (mini-)Neptunes (10M⊕\leqM<38M⊕) and (super-)Earths (1M⊕\leqM<10M⊕), whilst providing robust statistical constraints on planet occurrence rates (Mulders et al., 2015; Hsu et al., 2019), as well as the multiplicity nature of rocky worlds (Cochran et al., 2011; Gillon et al., 2017). In addition, the dearth of Neptune planets with orbital periods interior to 4 days, known as the Neptune desert, first dropped out of the Kepler data, and subsequently corroborated by the relatively low Neptune discoveries from TESS mission. Though rare, planets have been detected and characterised in this region (e.g., LTT9779b; Jenkins et al., 2020; Hoyer et al., 2023; Fernández Fernández et al., 2024), which were fundamental to constrain the most likely scenario for these planets. In addition, the evolution of giant planets may even be associated to the emergence and form of the desert, where a combination of tidal migration with atmospheric photoevaporation (Lopez & Fortney, 2013; Owen & Wu, 2017) may have been able to strip off the migrating giants’ envelopes, giving rise to a population of Neptune-desert planets. Like the Neptune desert planets, the HJ population remains subjected to intense scrutiny, especially the transiting HJs (THJs), where besides their masses, radii (Rp) and bulk densities (\rho_{\rm p}) can be estimated at high precision. Moreover, atmospheric follow-up may help reveal key properties (e.g, day-night temperatures, albedos/reflectivity and atmosphere abundances), making them great test beds for probing giant planet formation and evolution histories. For instance, HJs are not expected to form in-situ but farther out in the disc where an initial \sim 10 M⊕ protocore mass is fundamental to the onset of a runaway gas accretion process leading to the formation of giant planets (Pollack et al., 1996; Alibert et al., 2005; Piso & Youdin, 2014). In addition, HJs formation and disc migration must occur quickly (\sim 5-10 Myr), with timescales being a function of the protostar mass as well as the disc properties, specially its mass and metallicity (see, Fortney et al., 2021). In fact, it has been noted that stellar metallicity ([Fe/H]) correlates with giant planet fraction (fp), indicating that such planets are formed more effectively around metal-rich stars (Gonzalez, 1997; Santos et al., 2001; Fischer & Valenti, 2005; Osborn & Bayliss, 2020). Moreover, an increase in [Fe/H] leads to a higher fp, providing further evidences that disc metallicity plays an important role in the formation of giant planets (Santerne et al., 2016; Buchhave et al., 2018; Barbato et al., 2019). For instance, Jenkins et al. (2017) finds a correlation between giant hosts [Fe/H] and P, where the population of giants exterior to P\leq100 days are more metal-rich with a [Fe/H] mean difference \sim 0.16 dex. Therefore, they point out that such correlation may indicate the initial location where giant planets formed in the protoplanetary disc. Finally, giant planets seem to be more abundant around more massive stars, where higher fp are observed as a function of stellar mass (Johnson et al., 2010; Reffert et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2016). Such results point to a correlation between the central star and disc masses, where the former plays an important role in the type of planets that will be formed. In other words, an increase in the stellar mass leads to higher disc masses, hence more material with which to quickly form massive giant planets before the disc disperses. Therefore, these results are in agreement with the current findings of massive stars harbouring massive gas giant planets, particularly at short periods where the HJ population is located. As mentioned, the evolution of giant planets may have been subjected to disc migration rather than in-situ formation. Further evidence against the latter include the detection of atmospheric escape in HJs (e.g., HD209458b, HD 189733b, KELT-19b; Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Des Etangs et al., 2010; Wyttenbach et al., 2020) and high obliquities of close-in giants, which may be explained by the planets’ evolution through high eccentricity (e) migration by secular interactions with outer companions (Fortney et al., 2021; Vick et al., 2023). In fact, a handful of hot hosts have massive HJs with non-zero obliquities (e.g., KELT-17b, MASCARA-1b, TOI-1431b), with some even retrograde (HAT-P-14b; Winn et al., 2011), whereas cool stars tend to have HJs with low obliquities (Winn et al., 2011), thus showing that massive giant planets might have gone through multiple migration channels. Here, we report the detection of NGTS-33b, the first NGTS discovery of a super-Jupiter hosted by a massive star. This detection will add to the small, but growing number of massive systems, that will help us to better understand the formation and evolution processes of massive planets around hot stars. The manuscript is organised as follows, in \S 2, we present the photometry extraction from NGTS and TESS lightcurves, spectroscopic follow-up with FEROS, HARPS and CORALIE and their respective spectral line activity diagnosis. \S 3 describes the data analysis, where we extract stellar parameters (\S 3.2), assess its age (\S 3.2.1), perform a global modelling to derive the planetary parameters (\S 3.3). Stellar rotation period, transit timing variation as well as dynamical stability were probed in \S 3.1, 3.4, and 3.5, respectively. Finally, we discuss our results in \S 4 and set out the conclusions in \S 5. 1.1 The Next Generation Transit Survey The Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS; Chazelas et al.,, 2012; McCormac et al.,, 2017; Wheatley et al.,, 2018) is located at the ESO Paranal Observatory in Chile, with the objective of detecting new transiting planetary systems. The consortium has 12 telescopes with 0.2 m diameter each, and individual fields of view of 8 deg2, which combined provides a wide-field of 96 deg2. The NGTS detectors host 2K\times2K pixels, with individual pixels measuring 13.5 \mum, which corresponds to an on-sky size of 5 arcseconds/pixel, thus providing high sensitivity images over a wavelength domain between 520-890nm. This combination allows 150 ppm photometry to be obtained on bright stars (V<10 mags) for multi-camera observations, while for single telescope mode at 30 min cadence, a precision of 400 ppm is achievable (Bayliss et al., 2022). The project has been operational since February 2016, and over the past 8 years has so far acquired over 400 billion measurements of over 30 million stars. Within this treasure-trove of data, the NGTS has discovered 26 new planetary systems (e.g., Bayliss et al.,, 2018; Bryant et al.,, 2020; Tilbrook et al.,, 2021; Bouchy et al.,, 2024), with more yet to be confirmed. A few of the highlights include the discovery of the Neptune desert planet NGTS-4b (West et al., 2019), an ultra short period Jupiter NGTS-6b (Vines et al., 2019), the shortest period hot Jupiter NGTS-10b around a K5V star (McCormac et al., 2020), an inflated HJ around a low-mass and metal-poor K dwarf (Alves et al., 2022), and a few warm planets (e.g., NGTS-29b, NGTS-30b; Gill et al., 2024; Battley et al., 2024)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08959v1,A complete Herbig disk mass survey in Orion,"Context. Disks around intermediate mass stars called Herbig disks are the formation sites of giant exoplanets. Obtaining a complete inventory of these disks will therefore give insights into giant planet formation. However, until now no complete disk survey has been done on Herbig disks in a single star-forming region. Aims. This work aims to obtain the first complete survey of Herbig disks. Orion is the only nearby region with a significant number of Herbig disks (N=35) to carry out such a survey. The resulting dust mass distribution is compared to other dust mass distributions of disks around proto- and pre-main sequence stars in Orion. In addition we ascertain if previous ALMA observations have been biased towards the most massive and brightest Herbig disks.Methods. Using new NOEMA observations of 25 Herbig disks, in combination with ALMA archival data of 10 Herbig disks, results in a complete sample of all know Herbig disks in Orion. Using uv-plane analysis for the NOEMA observed disks, and literature values of the ALMA observed disks, we obtain the dust masses of all Herbig disks and obtain a cumulative dust mass distribution. Additionally, six disks with new CO isotopologues detections are presented, one of which is detected in \ceC^17O. We calculate the external ultraviolet (UV) irradiance on each disk and compare the dust mass to it.Results. We find a median disk dust mass of 11.7 M_{\oplus} for the Herbig disks. Comparing the Herbig disks in Orion to previous surveys for mainly T Tauri disks in Orion, we find that while \sim 50% of the Herbig disks have a mass higher than 10 M⊕, this is at most 25% for the T Tauri disks. This difference is especially striking when considering that the Herbig disks are around a factor of two older than the T Tauri disks. Comparing to the Herbig disks observed with ALMA from a previous study, no significant difference is found between the distributions. We find a steeper (slope of -7.6) relationship between the dust mass and external UV irradation compared to that of the T Tauri disks (slope of -1.3). Comparing our results to a recent SPHERE survey of disks in Orion, we see that the Herbig disks present the largest and brightest disks and have structures indicative of gas-giant formation.Conclusions. Herbig disks are on average more massive compared to T Tauri disks. This work shows the importance of complete samples, giving rise to the need of a complete survey of the Herbig disk population.","Herbig disks are disks around pre-main sequence stars with spectral types of B, A, and F, and stellar masses of 1.5-10 M⊙ with H\alpha indicating ongoing accretion (Herbig, 1960; Brittain et al., 2023). These disks are the prime formation site of giant exoplanets: directly imaged exoplanets are often found around early spectral type stars (Marois et al., 2008, 2010; Lagrange et al., 2010), and exoplanet population studies show that the occurrence rate of massive exoplanets is highest around intermediate mass stars (e.g., Johnson et al., 2010; Nielsen et al., 2019). Recent work by Stapper et al. (2022) has shown that the mean mass of Herbig disks is higher compared to disks around lower mass T Tauri stars. The interpretation of these higher disk fluxes are still being discussed: either as a consequence of massive exoplanets forming in these disks stopping radial drift and keeping the emitting area of the dust large (Stapper et al., 2022), and/or high dust masses causing massive exoplanets to form in these disks (e.g., Guzmán-Díaz et al., 2023). Regardless of interpretation, massive exoplanets are likely forming in these disks. Some of the most well-known protoplanetary disks are Herbig disk. These millimeter-bright disks display many different types of structures, and are therefore especially favored for in-depth morphological (e.g., Andrews et al., 2018), kinematical (Pinte et al., 2018, 2019; Izquierdo et al., 2022), and chemical studies (e.g., Öberg et al., 2021; Booth et al., 2024). Stapper et al. (2022) compiled all ALMA data available of Herbig disks within 450 pc, including these well-studied disks. They found a clear increase in the mean dust mass compared to disks in the Lupus and Upper Sco star-forming regions, which primarily consist of T Tauri stars, showing that the stellar mass - disk mass relationship extends to the intermediate mass regime. Still, both Herbig and T Tauri disks span the same range of masses, although their distributions are skewed to different averages. Since the T Tauri samples are complete and the Herbig sample of Stapper et al. (2022) is constructed from Herbig disks studied in a variety of ALMA projects (still 64% complete including all nearby star-forming regions), the question remains if the ALMA coverage of Herbig disks is biased toward well-known and ‘interesting’ objects with higher disk masses. Figure 1: Positions on the sky of the Herbig disk sample used in this work shown as the gray markers. The numbers next to the markers correspond to the numbers in Table 1. The background is an IRAS 100\mum image (Neugebauer et al., 1984). The positions of six disk surveys have been indicated as well: \sigma Ori (Ansdell et al., 2017), ONC (Eisner et al., 2018), OMC-2 (van Terwisga et al., 2019), \lambda Ori (Ansdell et al., 2020), NGC 2024 (van Terwisga et al., 2020), and L1641/L1647 (SODA, van Terwisga et al., 2022). Orion (\sim300–475 pc, Großschedl et al. 2018) is the closest star-forming complex with enough pre-main-sequence stars to harbor a sizeable number of Herbig Ae/Be stars. Many population studies have been done in different parts of Orion, tracing different star-formation environments from tranquil regions to more UV-dominated regions. In the \sigma Orionis cluster, an intermediate aged region of 3 Myr old, the disk dust masses were found to depend strongly on the distance to the O9 star at its center (Ansdell et al., 2017). Only 12% of their disks were more than 10 M⊕ in mass. Furthermore, CO was only detected in disks more than 1.5 pc separated from the O-star. On the other hand, the disks in the older \lambda Orionis cluster of 5 Myr have not been significantly impacted by the massive stars or the supernova which occurred in the cluster (Ansdell et al., 2020). Interestingly, there is one significant outlier, HD 245185 which is a Herbig disk, which has a more than an order of magnitude higher disk mass than any of the other disks in this region. The younger (0.5 Myr) NGC 2024 cluster was surveyed by van Terwisga et al. (2020). This cluster consists of two populations, the eastern population is shielded from FUV irradiation and is similar to other isolated regions, while the western population is older and may be affected by the FUV irradiation. Other younger clusters such as the Orion Nebula Cluster and Orion Molecular Cloud-2 have been surveyed as well (Eisner et al., 2018; van Terwisga et al., 2019), and even class 0 and I surveys have been done (Tobin et al., 2020). Lastly, the largest population study of disks to date, consisting of 873 disks, has been done in the L1641 and L1647 regions of the Orion A cloud (SODA, van Terwisga et al. 2022, for L1641 also see Grant et al. 2021). The plethora of population studies available in Orion gives a solid basis for a comparison between T Tauri disks and Herbig disks. In this work we present new Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations of all Herbig disks in Orion. Section 2 shows how the targets were selected, the NOEMA data were reduced, and the dust masses were obtained. In Section 3 the resulting dust mass distribution is presented and compared to distributions of other proto- and pre-main sequence stars in Orion, in addition CO spectra are presented. In Section 4.1 the dust mass distribution is compared to the one of ALMA from Stapper et al. (2022). The impact of external UV irradiation on the dust masses is determined in Section 4.2, and a comparison to scattered light is made in Section 4.3. Our results are summarized in Section 5.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08953v1,Intermediate mass T Tauri disk masses and a comparison to their Herbig disk descendants,"Context. Herbig disks are the prime sites for the formation of massive exoplanets, so looking into the precursors of these disks can give us clues in planet formation timescales. The precursors of Herbig stars are called Intermediate Mass T Tauri (IMTT) stars, which have spectral types later than F, but stellar masses between 1.5 and 5 M_{\odot}, and will eventually become Herbig stars with spectral types of A and B.Aims. The aim of this work is to obtain the dust and gas masses and radii of all IMTT disks with ALMA archival data. The obtained disk masses are then compared to Herbig disks and T Tauri disks and the obtained disks sizes to those of Herbig disks.Methods. ALMA Band 6 and 7 archival data are obtained for 34 IMTT disks with continuum observations, 32 of which have at least \ce^12CO, \ce^13CO, or \ceC^18O observations although most of them at quite shallow integrations. The disk integrated flux together with a stellar luminosity scaled disk temperature are used to obtain a total disk dust mass by assuming optically thin emission. Using thermochemical Dust And LInes (DALI) models from previous work, we additionally obtain gas masses of 10/35 of the IMTT disks based on the CO isotopologues. From the disk masses and sizes cumulative distributions are obtained.Results. The IMTT disks in this study have the same dust mass and radius distributions as Herbig disks. The dust mass of the IMTT disks is higher compared to that of the T Tauri disks, as is also found for the Herbig disks. No differences in dust mass are found for group I versus group II disks, in contrast to Herbig disks. The disks for which a gas mass could be determined show similar high mass disks as for the Herbig disks. Comparing the disk dust and gas mass distributions to the mass distribution of exoplanets shows that there also is not enough dust mass in disks around intermediate mass stars to form the massive exoplanets. On the other hand there is more than enough gas to form the atmospheres of exoplanets.Conclusions. We conclude that the sampled IMTT disk population is almost indistinguishable compared to Herbig disks, as their disk masses are the same, even though these are younger objects. Based on this, we conclude that planet formation is already well on its way in these objects, and thus planet formation should start early on in the lifetime of Herbig disks. Combined with our findings on the group I and group II disks, we conclude that most disks around intermediate mass pre-main sequence stars converge quickly to small disks unless prevented by a massive exoplanet.","Herbig disks are planet-forming disks around pre main-sequence stars called Herbig stars characterized by spectral types of B, A, and F, and stellar masses of 1.5 M_{\odot} to 10 M_{\odot} (e.g., Herbig, 1960; Brittain et al., 2023). These disks are the precursors of famous directly imaged planetary systems such as HR 8799 (Marois et al., 2008, 2010), \beta Pic (Lagrange et al., 2010), and 51 Eri (Chauvin et al., 2017), and host some of the first kinematically detected planets (Pinte et al., 2018; Izquierdo et al., 2023). How these planets have formed is not known, but we do know from exoplanet statistics that the prevalence of giant planets is highest around intermediate mass stars (e.g., Johnson et al., 2007, 2010; Nielsen et al., 2019; Fulton et al., 2021). Comparing dust structures and planet occurrence rates indeed shows a positive correlation between the two, and an increase in the prevalence of dust structures with stellar mass (van der Marel & Mulders, 2021). Hence, Herbig disks are an important piece of the planet formation puzzle. Figure 1: An HR-diagram of the Herbig star sample of S22, and the compiled IMTT sample in this work. The effective temperatures and luminosities are taken from Vioque et al. (2018) and Valegård et al. (2021) for the Herbig stars and IMTT stars respectively. Pre-main sequence tracks of different intermediate mass stars, and an isochrone of 2.5 Myr as the dashed line, are shown from Marigo et al. (2017). Figure 2: Histogram of the spectral types (left panel) and stellar masses (right panel) of the IMTTs in this work (from Valegård et al., 2021) compared to the Herbig star sample of S22 and references therein, and the surveys of Lupus (Ansdell et al., 2016) and Upper Sco (Barenfeld et al., 2016). However, Herbig disks are generally quite old (a median age of 6 Myr for Herbig Ae stars, Vioque et al. 2018), many showing structures indicative of planet formation making these some of the most famous and best investigated disks (e.g., HD 100546, HD 163296, MWC 480; Fedele et al. 2017; Teague et al. 2018; Öberg et al. 2021; Booth et al. 2023). Planets may already form early on in the lifetime of the disk, as there is an apparent lack of solids in class II disks to form the observed family of giant exoplanets (Manara et al., 2018; Tychoniec et al., 2020), and structures are already visible in earlier stages (ALMA Partnership et al., 2015; Segura-Cox et al., 2020). While the recent ALMA large program eDisk (Ohashi et al., 2023) does not show as many substructures in class 0 and class I objects as expected, possibly because these structures have not formed yet or have high continuum optical depth, planetesimals, i.e., planets’ building blocks, are likely to already form in these younger objects (e.g., Dr\każkowska & Dullemond, 2018). Hence, these younger objects can still give us insights into planet formation timescales. In total around 380 Herbig stars are known (Vioque et al., 2018; Wichittanakom et al., 2020; Guzmán-Díaz et al., 2021; Vioque et al., 2022). In addition, around 1500 more Herbig candidates have been identified by Vioque et al. (2020), so the total population size is expected to be much larger. A recent compilation of all available ALMA archival data out to Orion (\sim 450 pc) has shown that these Herbig disks are more massive in dust mass than the disks around their lower stellar mass counterparts (with spectral type F and later, and a stellar mass of \lesssim 1.5 M_{\odot}) called T Tauri stars (Stapper et al., 2022). This could naturally result in the higher prevalence of giant exoplanets around higher mass stars (e.g., Johnson et al., 2010). Moreover, work by Stapper et al. (2024) indicates that the Herbig disks are much warmer compared to T Tauri disks, causing less CO freeze-out and reprocessing in Herbig disks, consistent with thermo-chemical models (Bosman et al., 2018). This makes CO a viable mass tracer in Herbig disks. However, due to the relatively horizontal pre main-sequence evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, there are intermediate mass objects which were not part of the analysis of Stapper et al. (2022, 2024) which have the same stellar mass as Herbig stars but a spectral type later than F. These are called Intermediate mass T Tauri (IMTT) stars, the precursors of Herbig stars, with spectral types of F to K3 and stellar masses between 1.5 and 5 M_{\odot}, which look like T Tauri stars but have an intermediate mass star (Calvet et al., 2004; Valegård et al., 2021). This is shown in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram in Fig 1 in which the difference in effective temperatures can be seen between the Herbig stars and IMTT stars. As a reference the 2.5 Myr isochrone is shown, which clearly indicates that the IMTT stars are younger than their Herbig star descendants, though the ages can be relatively uncertain. Valegård et al. (2021) has compiled a sample of 49 IMTTs based on optical photometry. All stars within 500 pc with spectral types ranging from F0 to K3, and with a stellar luminosity of at least 2.1 L_{\odot} (i.e., M_{\star}\geq 1.5 M_{\odot}) were selected. The resulting sample, while not as young as class I objects, has a median age of 4 Myr, ranging from 0.3 Myr to 9 Myr, based on isochrones. We note that, like the Herbig disks, the IMTT disks are likely biased towards the high accretors and brightest disks (see, e.g., Figure 1 of Grant et al. 2023). A millimeter study into this sample will give insight into the evolution of the dust and gas around these intermediate mass objects. A significant fraction of the IMTTs compiled by Valegård et al. (2021) has ALMA millimeter observations. In this work we compile the available ALMA data and compare the obtained dust masses to previous works of Herbig disks (Stapper et al., 2022, hereafter S22), and gas masses to Herbig disks (Stapper et al., 2024, hereafter S24), and to T Tauri disks (e.g., Ansdell et al., 2016, 2017; Barenfeld et al., 2016; van Terwisga et al., 2020, 2022; Manara et al., 2023). In Section 2 the data selection and reduction procedures are set out. In Section 3 we explore if new models are needed compared to the DALI (Bruderer et al., 2012; Bruderer, 2013) thermochemical models run for Herbig disks in S24, which can then be used to determine the gas masses from the CO observations. In Section 4 we show the resulting continuum and gas images in §4.1 and §4.2 respectively, obtain a dust mass and dust radius distribution and compare these to previous works in §4.3, and obtain the gas masses and radii in §4.4 and compare these to previous works. We discuss these results in Section 5, in the context of the Meeus et al. (2001) groups and the evolution of disks around intermediate mass stars in §5.1, and discuss the implications on planet formation around intermediate mass stars in §5.2. Lastly, Section 6 summarizes our conclusions."

new opportunities for underground rare-event searches","We study neutrino, muon, and gamma-ray fluxes in extraterrestrial environments in our Solar System via semi-analytical estimates and Monte Carlo simulations. In sites with negligible atmosphere, we find a strong reduction in the cosmic-ray-induced neutrino and muon fluxes relative to their intensities on Earth. Neutrinos with energies between 50 MeV and 100 TeV show particularly strong suppression, by as much as 103, even at shallow depths. The solar neutrino suppression increases as the square of the site’s distance from the Sun. Natural radiation due to nuclear decay is also expected to be lower in many of these locations and may be reduced to effectively negligible levels in the liquid water environments. The sites satisfying these characteristics represent an opportunity for greatly extending the physics reach of underground searches in fundamental physics, such as searches for WIMP Dark Matter, neutrinoless double-beta decay, the diffuse supernova neutrinos, and neutrinos from nearby supernova. As a potential near-term target, we propose a measurement of muon and gamma-ray fluxes in an accessible underground lunar site such as the Mare Tranquillitatis Pit to perform a first measurement of the prompt component in cosmic-ray-induced particle production, and to constrain lunar evolution models.","The past decade has shown a rapid increase in human activities in space from both commercial and government sectors Heldmann et al. (2021). In the US, for example, the NASA Artemis program is being vigorously pursued in cooperation with private endeavors such as SpaceX and Blue Origin to return humans to the moon and beyond Smith et al. (2020). Similar programs are being undertaken elsewhere, including in China, India, etc. Rocket launch costs are decreasing rapidly while loading capacities are substantially increasing, potentially leading to a new space era with great opportunities Jones (2018); mor . Recently, researcgers from scientific fields such as quantum technologies Belenchia et al. (2022), astronomy Serjeant et al. (2020); Jani and Loeb (2021); Burns et al. (2021); Bandyopadhyay et al. (2021), and particle physics Zaitsev (2020); Beacham and Zimmermann (2022); Baum et al. (2024); Demidov and Gorbunov (2021); Solomey and Tripathi (2022); Solomey et al. (2023), have started investigating these opportunities. In this work, we explore novel opportunities for extending the sensitivity of fundamental-physics rare-event searches. Such searches include attempts to detect weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter by scattering off nuclear targets Roszkowski et al. (2018), to observe the direct creation of matter in the form of neutrinoless double-beta decay Agostini et al. (2022), or to search for astrophysical signals such as diffuse supernova neutrinos (DSNs) Kresse et al. (2021), or direct neutrino signals from a nearby supernova Al Kharusi et al. (2021). Such experiments are being pursued in deep underground laboratories around the world Bettini (2011) that provide shielding from cosmic rays, primarily muons generated in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, that would otherwise swamp those sensitive detectors. To extend their reach, these experiments are pursuing larger detectors with lower backgrounds in each successive generation. In the coming generation of experiments, background due to solar neutrinos is expected to begin to play a significant role. For neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, solar neutrino backgrounds may begin to limit the sensitivity, with a much higher impact for some detection techniques relative to others Elliott and Ejiri (2017). In the case of direct dark matter detection, coherent scattering of solar and atmospheric neutrinos—born in the same interactions that produce cosmic ray muons—presents an irreducible “neutrino fog” Monroe and Fisher (2007); Strigari (2009); Billard et al. (2014); Akerib et al. (2022); Bo et al. (2024); Aprile et al. (2024) common to all experiments, beyond which a background-free experiment is no longer possible even in principle. At higher energies relevant for astrophysical neutrino detection, even the deepest underground laboratory experiments suffer from atmospheric neutrino backgrounds. Below, we study these neutrino and muon fluxes in environments without an atmosphere in the Solar System. The solar neutrino flux scales as the squared inverse of the Sun-detector distance. Thus, this flux can only be reduced if the detector is moved far from the Sun Solomey and Tripathi (2022). Keeping this point in mind, we will focus on the cosmic-ray-induced fluxes in the extraterrestrial environments in this paper. We find that over a broad energy range, the cosmic-ray-induced fluxes can be drastically reduced in these environments. These sites also offer advantages in terms of natural radioactivity, for which we perform a preliminary investigation. We examine specifically two archetypical sites: one at shallow depth in a lava tube on the Moon, and another in the form of a human-made ice ball in space. These sites potentially offer orders-of-magnitude (10^{3-4}) reduction of muon and neutrino fluxes relative to what is possible on the Earth. They thus could enable a new generation of ultra-sensitive experiments capable of detecting new physics that would otherwise remain beyond reach. Our studies of these two sites allow for a qualitative analysis of physics possibilities at a number of other, more exotic sites. It is worth noting that several studies Shapiro and Silberberg (1985); Cherry and Lande (1985); Petschek (1985); Cherry (1990); Mann and Zhang (1990); Cherry (1990); Wilson (1998); Wilson et al. (2003a, b); Miller and Cohen (2006)—mostly in the 1980s—have schematically estimated cosmic-ray-induced neutrino fluxes on the Moon and explored potential implications for detecting DSNs and high-energy galactic neutrinos there. Recent works Gaspert et al. (2023); Solomey and Tripathi (2022) have also discussed the potential relevance of the extraterrestrial sites for dark matter detections. In contrast, the current work is the first comprehensive study of this issue combining semi-analytic and Monte Carlo simulations; it covers both neutrinos and muons in different energy ranges at various extraterrestrial sites; and natural radioactivity is also investigated to some extent."

microlensing events involving two lens masses and two source stars","Aims. We carried out a project involving the systematic analysis of microlensing data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network survey. The aim of this project is to identify lensing events with complex anomaly features that are difficult to explain using standard binary-lens or binary-source models.Methods. Our investigation reveals that the light curves of microlensing events KMT-2021-BLG-0284, KMT-2022-BLG-2480, and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 display highly complex patterns with three or more anomaly features. These features cannot be adequately explained by a binary-lens (2L1S) model alone. However, the 2L1S model can effectively describe certain segments of the light curve. By incorporating an additional source into the modeling, we identified a comprehensive model that accounts for all the observed anomaly features.Results. Bayesian analysis, based on constraints provided by lensing observables, indicates that the lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are binary systems composed of M dwarfs. For KMT-2022-BLG-2480, the primary lens is an early K-type main-sequence star with an M dwarf companion. The lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are likely located in the bulge, whereas the lens of KMT-2022-BLG-2480 is more likely situated in the disk. In all events, the binary stars of the sources have similar magnitudes due to a detection bias favoring binary source events with a relatively bright secondary source star, which increases detection efficiency.","Since the mid-2010s, the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) team has been conducting gravitational microlensing experiments using a network of three wide-field telescopes deployed in the Southern Hemisphere (Kim et al., 2016). The data collected from these observations are transmitted almost in real-time to the headquarters of the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) for processing. A self-developed algorithm (Kim et al., 2018) is employed to identify lensing events, and the light curves of these detected events are meticulously examined for any discontinuous anomalies. These anomalies undergo careful analysis by multiple researchers to determine their origins and confirm whether they are caused by planetary companions to the lens, which is the primary objective of the experiment. Currently, the KMTNet experiment detects over 3,000 gravitational lensing events annually, with about 10% of these events exhibiting anomalies of various origins (Zang et al., 2021b, 2022). Of these anomalies, approximately 10% are confirmed to be of planetary origin (Gould et al., 2022). Anomalies in lensing light curves can arise from various factors. The most common cause is the binarity of the lens (Mao & Paczyński, 1991). In these binary-lens single-source (2L1S) events, caustics form on the source plane, and the source’s passage through these caustics results in light curves that differ from those of single-lens single-source (1L1S) events (Schneider & Weiss, 1986). These caustics exhibit complex patterns depending on the separation and mass ratio between the lens components and, along with various source trajectories, produce a wide range of anomaly patterns (Erdl & Schneider, 1993; Han, 2006; Cassan, 2008; Gaudi, 2012). Another important cause of anomalies is the binarity of the source. In these single-lens binary-source (1L2S) cases, the event’s light curve is the superposition of the lensing events occurring for each individual source, which leads to deviations in the lensing light curves (Griest & Hu, 1992; Di Stefano & Esin, 1995; Han & Gould, 1997; Dominik, 1998; Han & Jeong, 1998). In some rare cases, the observed anomalies cannot be explained by a three-body lensing model (lens plus source) and require a four-body lensing model, which includes an additional lens or source component. To date, 14 events have been identified as 3L1S events, in which the lens consists of three masses. Of these, six events correspond to planetary systems consisting of a host star and two planets, seven involve binary systems that include a planet, and the remaining event has been identified as a triple stellar system composed of three stars. Another type of four-body event occurs when both the lens and the source are binaries, known as a 2L2S event. So far, ten such events have been identified, four of which involve binary lenses that include planetary companions. In Table 1, we provide a summary of some of the known four-body lensing events, along with a brief description of the corresponding lens systems.

In the initial phase, we examined lensing events from the KMTNet survey that exhibited anomalies in their light curves, which were then independently analyzed by multiple modelers. Most of these anomalies were successfully explained using either 2L1S or 1L2S models. However, for a small subset of events in which these three-body models could not account for the anomalies, we carried out more detailed analyses using advanced models. These analyses revealed that the difficulty in explaining the anomalies in some events was due to significant higher-order effects, such as lens orbital motion, as seen in events like OGLE-2018-BLG-0971, MOA-2023-BLG-065, and OGLE-2023-BLG-0136 (Han et al., 2024a). In other cases, the anomalies were caused by the presence of an additional source or lens component, as shown in the 2L2S and 3L1S events summarized in Table 1. It is important to note that the list of four-body lensing events in the table is not complete, as the nature of the anomalies in some events remains unclear, and more advanced models are currently being tested to interpret them. In this work, we present analyses of three lensing events with complex anomalies in their light curves that were successfully interpreted using 2L2S models. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we detail the observations conducted to collect the data used for our analyses, including a brief description of the instrumentation. We also outline the procedures for data reduction and photometry. Section 3 begins with the definition of the lensing parameters used in our modeling across different interpretations of lensing events. We then describe the procedure of light curve modeling employed to determine these parameters. Subsequent subsections present the analysis process and results for each individual event. Each subsection discusses specific anomalies observed in the event’s light curve, provides model parameters derived from the analysis, and outlines the configuration of the lens system. In Sect. 4 we identify the source stars associated with each event and estimate the angular Einstein radius based on the derived information on the source star. Section 5 outlines the physical quantities of the lens determined based on the observables of individual events. Lastly, Sect. 6 summarizes our findings and presents the conclusions drawn from the study."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09078v1,Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at an oblique heliospheric termination shock,"Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at a heliospheric termination shock is investigated. Using two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation, accelerated pickup ions are self-consistently reproduced by tracking long time evolution of shock with unprecedentedly large system size in the shock normal direction. Reflected pickup ions drive upstream large amplitude waves through resonant instabilities. Convection of the large amplitude waves causes shock surface reformation and alters the downstream electromagnetic structure. A part of pickup ions are accelerated to tens of upstream flow energy in the time scale of \sim 100 times inverse ion gyro frequency. The initial acceleration occurs through shock surfing acceleration mechanism followed by shock drift acceleration mechanism. Large electrostatic potential accompanied by the upstream waves enables the shock surfing acceleration to occur.","A collisionless shock is ubiquitous in space. It is an energy converter formed in a supersonic plasma flow. A variety of explosive phenomena in space, stellar wind, astrophysical jet accompany collisionless shocks. One of the outstanding issues of collisionless shock physics is the mechanism of particle acceleration occurring around it. It is believed that cosmic rays are produced in a collisionless shock through the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism (e.g., Blandford & Eichler (1987)). In order for the DSA mechanism to work, preaccelerated nonthermal particles have to exist near a shock front. However, the mechanism producing such nonthermal particles, which should be dominated by complex microstructures of local electromagnetic fields, has been an open question for a long time. This is called the injection problem (Balogh & Treumann, 2013; Burgess & Scholer, 2015; Amano et al., 2022). The heliospheric termination shock (HTS) is thought to be an ideal laboratory to study the injection process, because the anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) having typically several tens of mega electron volts (MeV) are believed to be accelerated there (Chalov, 2006). However, the Voyager spacecraft observed only little amount of ACRs in the heliosheath, downstream of the HTS (e.g., Stone et al. (2005)). The reason for this was inferred by McComas & Schwadron (2006) as that efficient acceleration of ACRs occurs in the flank regions of the HTS, where geometrical condition of the local HTS is more suitable for particle acceleration than that of the HTS where the two Voyager spacecraft crossed. On the other hand, Giacalone et al. (2021) recently performed hybrid (kinetic ions with charge neutralizing electron fluid) simulations and showed that the acceleration rate of low energy (\lesssim 50 keV) pickup ions (PUIs) is more or less independent of the position in the HTS. The nonthermal particles in this energy range are expected to have their global map obtained in the near future through the IMAP (Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe) mission. In their simulation (Giacalone et al., 2021), turbulence in the solar wind is taken into account. Particles are expected to undergo scattering by the turbulent field, leading to some degree of acceleration, and there is a potential for these particles to be injected into the DSA process (Giacalone et al., 2021; Trotta et al., 2021; Pitňa et al., 2021; Zank et al., 2021; Trotta et al., 2022; Nakanotani et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). Another expected effect is the tilting of local magnetic field line. In oblique shocks particles reflected by the shock travel upstream, exciting waves themselves and generating mildly accelerated particles injected into the DSA process. Such a situation may occur in some specific regions of termination shock and perhaps locally everywhere when solar wind is turbulent. In this scenario, the generation of mildly accelerated particles needs to occur near the shock, but the detailed mechanism is not well understood. This study aims to validate the latter scenario. It is thought that initial acceleration sets in when a particle is reflected at the shock. In general shock potential strongly affects the reflection of PUIs. In a hybrid simulation, the electrostatic potential is typically derived from a generalized Ohm’s law, which includes a term proportional to the electron pressure gradient. Calculating this electron pressure gradient term requires assuming a specific equation of state for electrons. Consequently, the electrostatic field in a hybrid simulation becomes model-dependent. Swisdak et al. (2023) pointed out that fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation leads to higher fluxes and maximal energies of PUIs than hybrid simulation likely due to differences in the shock potential. Before the Voyager spacecraft crossed the HTS, the shock surfing acceleration (SSA) was widely accepted as a plausible mechanism of injection (Lee et al., 1996; Zank et al., 1996). However, the Voyager did not observe the expected amount of high energy particles when they crossed the HTS (Decker et al., 2008). This implies that the shock surfing acceleration mechanism did not work effectively either. The reason for that SSA does not work in the termination shock was explained by Matsukiyo & Scholer (2014) by using one-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of (quasi-)perpendicular shock that most of potential jump in a PUI mediated shock occurs in an extended foot produced by reflected PUIs so that the potential jump at a shock ramp is insufficiently small for the SSA mechanism to work. The shock potential in an oblique PUI mediated shock has not been extensively studied so far. Although the ab-initio PIC simulation is useful to reproduce complex multiscale electromagnetic structures responsible for injection processes, it requires large numerical cost. That is why PIC simulation of a collisionless shock in a plasma containing PUIs has been limitted mainly to the cases with one spatial dimension (e.g., Lee et al. (2005); Matsukiyo et al. (2007); Matsukiyo & Scholer (2011, 2014); Oka et al. (2011); Lembege & Yang (2016, 2018); Lembege et al. (2020)). Two-dimensional PIC simulations including PUIs are first conducted by Yang et al. (2015). They focused on the impact of PUIs on shock front nonstationarity of a perpendicular shock, \Theta_{Bn}=90^{\circ}, and energy dissipation up to t=8\Omega^{-1}_{i}, where \Theta_{Bn} denotes the shock angle, the angle between shock normal and upstream magnetic field, and \Omega_{i} is upstream ion cyclotron frequency. Kumar et al. (2018) performed longer simulation up to t\sim 30\Omega^{-1}_{i} for quasi-perpendicular shocks, \Theta_{Bn}=80^{\circ}. They paid more attention to energy distribution of PUIs and solar wind ions (SWIs) for different upstream velocity distribution functions of PUIs. A little longer calculation up to t\sim 40\Omega^{-1}_{i} was done with \Theta_{Bn}=70^{\circ} by Swisdak et al. (2023). However, since the shock angle is close to or equal to perpendicular in the above previous studies, significant acceleration of PUIs are not reproduced. Indeed, when considering the average values, the shock angle of the termination shock is nearly perpendicular. However, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, it is easy to predict that the local shock angle fluctuates significantly due to the effects of solar wind turbulence and unsteady solar activity. This fluctuation could have important implications for the ion injection process. In this study we focus the initial acceleration, which is often called injection process, of PUIs at an oblique HTS. The microstructures of a local oblique HTS with \Theta_{Bn}=50^{\circ}, and with 60^{\circ} and 70^{\circ} for comparison, mediated by the presence of PUIs and their impact on PUI acceleration are discussed by performing two-dimensional full PIC simulation with unprecedentedly long simulation time (t_{max}=125\Omega^{-1}_{i})."

Asteroid 2024 PT5 experiences recurrent co-orbital engagements and mini-moon events of the temporarily captured flyby type. Its visible spectrum is consistent with that of an Sv-type asteroid or perhaps lunar ejecta. Its rotational period could be \lesssim1 h.Conclusions. The discovery of 2024 PT5 confirms that temporarily captured flybys are relatively frequent and involve objects larger than a few meters, suitable as accessible targets for scientific research activities and commercial mining ventures in space.","Both ESA and NASA are pushing into the commercial space sector supporting a nascent global space economy (see, e.g., Rausser et al. 2023; Paravano et al. 2024). Scientific exploration and mining of asteroids are activities well suited for development within the context of this fast-evolving sector (see, e.g., Sommariva 2015; Sachdeva 2018; Xie et al. 2021), but only if there are enough targets for low-cost missions. NASA’s Near-Earth Object Human Space Flight Accessible Targets Study (NHATS, Abell et al. 2012)111https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/nhats/ is compiling a list of near-Earth objects (NEOs) that identifies potential targets for future exploration, but such a database must include information on the composition of the targets for better mission planning. Reflectance spectroscopy can help in finding what these more accessible targets are made of (Licandro et al. 2020; de León et al. 2021). The NHATS list includes thousands of targets, but just a few have been characterized spectroscopically (Popescu et al. 2019). Most targets with the highest number of viable trajectories (the most accessible ones) follow Earth-like paths, they are part of a secondary asteroid belt that surrounds the orbit of the Earth–Moon system. Its members define a dynamical class, the Arjunas, that follow heliocentric trajectories with orbital periods close to one sidereal year, low eccentricity, and low inclination (Rabinowitz et al. 1993). Within the 25 most accessible targets, a handful undergo recurrent temporarily captured flyby or orbiter events, also called mini-moon episodes (Granvik et al. 2012). The recently found asteroid 2024 PT5 is part of the group of very accessible targets (de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2024). Here, we use reflectance spectroscopy, photometry, and N-body simulations to confirm its nature and dynamical context. This Letter is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce the background of our research, and present the data and tools used in our analyses. In Sect. 3, we determine if 2024 PT5 is natural or artificial and its probable origin. In Sect. 4, we discuss our results and Sect. 5 summarizes our conclusions. Appendices include supporting material."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08659v1,Realistic outcomes of moon-moon collisions in Lunar formation theory,"The multiple impact hypothesis proposes that the Moon formed through a series of smaller collisions, rather than a single giant impact. This study advances our understanding of this hypothesis, as well as moon collisions in other contexts, by exploring the implications of these smaller impacts, employing a novel methodological approach that combines self-consistent initial conditions, hybrid hydrodynamic/N-body simulations, and the incorporation of material strength. Our findings challenge the conventional assumption of perfect mergers in previous models, revealing a spectrum of collision outcomes including partial accretion and mass loss. These outcomes are sensitive to collision parameters and Earth’s tidal influence, underscoring the complex dynamics of lunar accretion. Importantly, we demonstrate that incorporating material strength is important for accurately simulating moonlet-sized impacts. This inclusion significantly affects fragmentation, tidal disruption, and the amount of material ejected or accreted onto Earth, ultimately impacting the Moon’s growth trajectory. By accurately modeling diverse collision outcomes, our hybrid approach provides a powerful new framework for understanding the Moon’s formation. We show that most collisions (\approx 90\%) do not significantly erode the largest moonlet, supporting the feasibility of lunar growth through accretion. Moreover, we revise previous estimates of satellite disruption, suggesting a higher survival rate and further bolstering the multiple-impact scenario.","Terrestrial planets are thought to form during the first 10-100 Myr of the evolution of a planetary system. During the last stages of terrestrial planet formation, planets grow mainly through many impacts with large planetary embryos (e.g. Agnor et al. (1999)). In the most studied scenario, the giant impact scenario, the Moon is thought to have formed following the last (and single) such giant impact to occur with the proto-Earth. In this model the Moon typically coagulates from a debris disk formed following this impact; and is affected by the mutual Earth-Moon tides, leading to its outward migration, thus explaining its current location. However, the (single) giant-impact scenario, though extensively studied, still encounters major challenges in explaining the Earth-Moon system and its physical and compositional properties (see Mastrobuono-Battisti et al. (2015); Mastrobuono-Battisti & Perets (2017), and recent reviews by Asphaug (2014); Canup et al. (2023) and references therein). More importantly, such a scenario is intrinsically incomplete and disconnected from the wider picture of terrestrial planet formation, in which the proto-Earth had experienced and grown through multiple giant impacts (Agnor et al., 1999). Consideration of only the last giant impact in the prevailing paradigm disregards the critical evolution taking place prior to (and possibly following) this event. In particular, it ignores smaller-scale impacts which are deemed incapable of forming large moons in a single event. Furthermore, even in the context of the single giant-impact hypothesis, models that try to overcome the aforementioned difficulties such as high angular momentum impacts (Ćuk & Stewart, 2012) or Synestia Lock et al. (2018) require specific initial conditions for the Earth, which are nevertheless dictated by its previous impact history. Indeed, an initial fast spin of the Earth is required for high angular momentum impacts or the Synestia models, but it could be challenged by a history of multiple impacts because then a fast rotation of the Earth is difficult to achieve (Rufu et al., 2017; Canup et al., 2023). Similarly, solutions requiring a pre-existing Earth magma ocean (Hosono et al., 2019) depend on previous impacts and their resulting heating of the Earth (e.g. Citron & Stewart, 2022). In addition, the probability for a late high mass-ratio giant impact as required in the giant impact hypothesis, is by itself low (~{}6.7\%; Mastrobuono-Battisti & Perets (2017)), further making the scenario more fine-tuned. Finally, multiple moons might in principle form following the single impact scenario (Canup et al., 1999), and therefore understanding the interactions and collisions of moons in the framework of multiple impacts, and even in the context of the single giant-impact scenario, is important. Our working hypothesis, following the current understanding of terrestrial planet formation, is that such small impacts are the norm during planet formation. They are significantly more abundant could form smaller moons, and play a major role in the evolution of the proto-Earth. In previous studies, we have suggested that multiple moons have formed around the proto-Earth following multiple planetary-scale impacts in the past, a sequence that has thereby affected the evolution of both the Earth and the Moon (Ringwood, 1989; Citron et al., 2014; Rufu et al., 2017; Citron et al., 2018; Malamud et al., 2018). In the multiple impact framework, the moon formation processes described above occur repeatedly after each planetary-scale impact on the proto-Earth. A moonlet (or even several moonlets) formed in a previous impact on the proto-Earth, may already exist when another external proto-planet perturber interacts with the system. There are several potential modes of interaction, one of which is to form a new debris disk, and eventually another moonlet (as a result of coagulation from the disk). The new moonlet could then migrate outwards (due to tides) and eventually interact with a pre-existing (by then slower-to-migrate) moonlet. Possible outcomes of this interaction (Citron et al., 2018) are a collision between the two moonlets, or ejection/infall onto the proto-Earth (typically one of the moonlets, see Malamud et al. (2018)). Cases in which both moonlets did not survive are referred to as disruptive. Citron et al. (2018) tried to estimate the relative probabilities of each of these outcomes. They found them to depend on various parameters (especially the mass ratio between the outer and inner moon), however, if one were to generalize their results, the probability for a merger was found to be approximately similar to that of survival of only the outer moon (which was assumed to be more massive). The probability of completely disrupting the system was found to be somewhat smaller but still of the same order of magnitude. This meant that in the framework of multiple impacts, each impact had a reasonable chance to increase the moon’s mass or at least keep the system from disrupting. However, in the framework of the Citron et al. (2018) study, as typically in other dynamical studies (Haghighipour & Raymond, 2007; Fischer & Ciesla, 2014), every merger was assumed to be a perfectly plastic merger. In reality, a physical collision between two moonlets does not necessarily imply a convergence of their masses. Hence, the aforementioned merger probability should be revised by considering a more realistic collision outcome, expecting it to branch into several different probabilities. These depend primarily on the collision velocity (Asphaug, 2010). A perfect merger is more likely to occur at low velocities, while higher velocities may lead to hit-and-run outcomes or even a partially/fully disruptive collision in which a debris disk forms. The mass of the debris (e.g, relative to that of the largest fragment) increases with the collision velocity (Genda et al., 2012; Leinhardt & Stewart, 2012; Emsenhuber et al., 2024). Our goal in this study is to track the realm of potential outcomes in moon-moon collisions by combining two different simulations for the short- and long-term collision evolution, thereby revisiting the actual sequence of events subsequent to a collision, and in turn, revising the merger probabilities that were found in previous studies. The effects of the Earth during moon-moon collisions are not negligible since the planet’s tidal forces can influence the distribution of material during a merger (Rufu & Aharonson, 2019). During more disruptive collisions, the escape velocity from the Earth (below about 10-15 R⊕) is considerably larger than the Lunar escape velocity, hence increasing the likelihood of trapping fragments in bound Earth orbit. Additionally, as major moonlets or other minor fragments in the debris field of a disruptive collision enter the Roche limit, they can be tidally disrupted. One previous study has looked into the collision dynamics of moonlets within the Earth’s potential (Rufu & Aharonson, 2019). However, here we aim to introduce several methodological improvements: (a) We will perform hydrodynamic collision simulations considering material strength (instead of pure hydrodynamic simulations). As recently demonstrated by Emsenhuber et al. (2024) via a large ensemble of giant impact collisions with material strength, the latter is important for collisions of moonlet-sized objects (even without a central planet as proposed here, and certainly when tidal effects by a planet are involved); (b) We will adopt self-consistent collision initial conditions directly from the N-body simulations of Citron et al. (2018), instead of performing a general parametric study where otherwise ad-hoc values are chosen for the velocity, impact angle and distance from the Earth; (c) We will alternate back and forth between short time scale hydrodynamic impact simulations and much longer time scale N-body simulations, tracking a complete and detailed chain of events leading to the collision outcome (instead of only simulating the initial collision and making various guesses regarding the subsequent evolution)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08159v1,Two Super-Jupiters around M-dwarfs – Signatures of Instability or Accretion?,"We present the discovery of TOI-6303b and TOI-6330b, two massive transiting super-Jupiters orbiting a M0 and a M2 star respectively, as part of the Searching for GEMS survey. These were detected by TESS and then confirmed via ground-based photometry and radial velocity observations with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF). TOI-6303b has a mass of 7.84 \pm 0.31 MJ, a radius of 1.03 \pm 0.06 RJ, and an orbital period of 9.485 days. TOI-6330b has a mass of 10.00 \pm 0.31 MJ, a radius of 0.97 \pm 0.03 RJ, and an orbital period of 6.850 days. We put these planets in context of super-Jupiters around M-dwarfs discovered from radial-velocity surveys, as well as recent discoveries from astrometry. These planets have masses that can be attributed to two dominant planet formation mechanisms — gravitational instability and core-accretion. Their masses necessitate massive protoplanetary disks that should either be gravitationally unstable, i.e. forming through gravitational instability, or be amongst some of the most massive protoplanetary disks to form objects through core-accretion. We also discuss the eccentricity distribution of these objects, as a potential indicator of their formation and evolutionary mechanisms.","M-dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the Milky Way (Henry et al., 2006; Reylé et al., 2021). Searches for habitable and Earth-like worlds largely focus on these systems due to the close-in nature of their habitable zones (HZs; Kasting et al., 1993; Scalo et al., 2007; Kopparapu et al., 2013; Childs et al., 2022), and relatively higher planetary detection amplitudes through deeper transit dips, larger RV semi-amplitudes, and more advantageous star-planet contrast ratios when compared to FGK stars. Previous efforts have provided occurrence rates of terrestrial planets around these types of stars (Dressing & Charbonneau, 2015; Hardegree-Ullman et al., 2019; Hsu et al., 2020; Ment & Charbonneau, 2023), even though the occurrence rate of habitable-zone planets around M-dwarf stars is still debated (Bergsten et al., 2023). HZ/terrestrial planets can be affected by their giant planet companions (Childs et al., 2019; Schlecker et al., 2021; Bitsch & Izidoro, 2023). Around M-dwarfs, giant and terrestrial planets have yet to be seen in the same system. This is derived from a lack of observed giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars (GEMS). An increase in observed GEMS with precise mass measurements and orbital characteristics would enhance our ability to determine the frequency of giant planets around M-dwarfs and the effects terrestrial and giant planets have on one another. Additionally, we would increase our understanding of giant planet formation around M-dwarfs. Core-accretion is the commonly accepted formation pathway for close-in giant planets (\gtrsim 8 R_{\oplus}) (Fischer & Valenti, 2005; Narang et al., 2018). This formation is a ‘bottom-up’ approach to planetary formation where an \sim 10 M⊕ core is accreted followed by an exponential gas accretion that forms the planet’s gaseous envelope. The alternate mode of formation is the gravitational instability scenario (Boss, 1997, 2006), which occurs in the protostellar phase of massive disks where the disk fragments into gravitationally bound clumps. It is expected that core-accretion should produce fewer GEMS because of lower disk masses and longer orbital timescales, causing it to be more difficult to reach the exponential runaway gas accretion (Laughlin et al., 2004; Ida & Lin, 2005). NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; Ricker et al., 2014) has enabled the discovery of many Jupiter-sized exoplanets (e.g. Cañas et al., 2020; Kanodia et al., 2023; Hobson et al., 2023; Delamer et al., 2024), and brown dwarfs (e.g. Artigau et al., 2021; Cañas et al., 2022) orbiting M-dwarf stars, which have already started to raise interesting questions about the formation and evolution of these planets (Durisen et al., 2007; Chabrier et al., 2014). However, the current sample size (\sim 30) is insufficient to enable a comprehensive understanding of these systems. We have therefore started the volume limited (< 200 pc) Searching for GEMS survey (Kanodia et al., 2024), to increase the sample size of these planets to \sim 40 transiting GEMS. This will enable robust statistical comparisons of these planets with their FGK counterparts, thereby helping shed light on their formation mechanisms. Studies of giant planet dependence on host star metallicity have shown that the region between \sim 4 and 10 MJ is sparsely populated by giant planets for FGK host stars (Santos et al., 2017; Schlaufman, 2018; Narang et al., 2018). It is believed that this marks the transition between the two giant planet formation mechanisms — core accretion and gravitational instability. This is because the objects below 4 MJ are believed to have formed through core-accretion, whereas those above 10 MJ are formed through gravitational instability (Santos et al., 2017; Schlaufman, 2018; Narang et al., 2018). As part of the Searching for GEMS survey, we present the discovery of two super-Jupiters around early M-dwarfs — TOI-6303b at 7.84 \pm 0.31 MJ and TOI-6330b at 10.00 \pm 0.32 MJ. These objects populate the upper limit of the transition zone between core accretion and gravitational instability. In Section 2 we present our observations of both systems. We detail our photometric observations from TESS, RBO, APO/ARCTIC, and Keeble observatory, precision radial velocities from HPF, and high-contrast speckle imaging from ShaneAO and NESSI. In Section 3 we detail the analysis performed to obtain the stellar parameters and the planetary parameters. In Section 4 we discuss the possible formation paths of these objects and place them in context of the giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Lastly, we summarize our discovery in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08094v1,"Stellar Obliquity Excitation via Disk Dispersal-Driven Resonances in
Binaries","The stellar obliquity of a planetary system is often used to help constrain the system’s formation and evolution. One of the mechanisms to reorient the stellar spin involves a secular resonance crossing due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the system also has an inclined, distant (\sim 300\;\mathrm{AU}) binary companion. This mechanism is likely to operate broadly due to the \sim 50\% binary fraction of FGK dwarfs and can play an important role in setting the initial stellar obliquities prior to any dynamical evolution. In this work, we revisit this mechanism analytically for idealized, homologously evolving disk models and show that the resulting stellar obliquities are broadly distributed between 60^{\circ} and 180^{\circ} for most warm and cold planets. We further show that non-homologus disk dissipation, such as the development of a photoevaporatively-opened gap at \sim 2\;\mathrm{AU}, can help maintain orbital alignment of warm planets, in agreement with observations. Our results represent the proper primordial obliquities for planetary systems with distant binary companions. They also represent the obliquities of stars with no present-day binary companions if these companions are dynamically unbound during the birth cluster phase of evolution, a process that occurs on a comparable timescale as the disk-driven obliquity excitation.","In traditional theories of planet formation, the orbits of planets and the spins of their host stars are expected to be closely aligned, because they form out of the same protoplanetary disks (PPDs). This is motivated by the observed small 7^{\circ} misalignment between the solar spin axis and the normal to the ecliptic (Beck & Giles, 2005). Measurement of this misalignment angle in exoplanetary systems, known as the stellar obliquity111Not to be confused with the “planetary obliquity” of a planet, the misalignment angle between a planet’s spin axis and its own orbit normal. has become moderately widespread in the recent years using various techniques such as the Rossiter-Mclaughlin effect (Rossiter, 1924; McLaughlin, 1924). Surprisingly, a substantial (though still minority) fraction of stellar obliquities are large, including tentative evidence for an excess near 90^{\circ} (Albrecht et al., 2021, but see Dong & Foreman-Mackey, 2023; Siegel et al., 2023). The origin of these large misalignments is currently unknown, and a broad range of causes has been proposed (see Albrecht et al., 2022 for a good review). Distinguishing among these scenarios requires careful studies of various trends in the measured population. Among the measured stellar obliquities (we will refer to these as just “obliquities”), a few notable clues help constrain the mechanisms responsible for misalignments. The most well-known trend is the strong dependence of obliquity on stellar temperature among hot Jupiter hosts: stars with surface temperatures below 6100\;\mathrm{K} have low obliquities, while their hotter counterparts have large obliquities (Winn et al., 2010). This is commonly attributed to dissipation of the tide raised on the star by the hot Jupiter, a process that is much more efficient in the deep convective envelopes present in stars cooler than \sim 6100\;\mathrm{K} (Albrecht et al., 2012; Lai, 2012; Zanazzi et al., 2024). However, recent observations of lower-mass Kepler systems suggest preferential spin-orbit alignment below 6100\;\mathrm{K} as well (Louden et al., 2021, 2024); the tides raised by such low-mass planets are unlikely to be capable of realigning the stellar spin in standard tidal scenarios, as the alignment timescale is inversely proportional to the planet mass. This result is consistent with the general lack of correlation between spin-orbit misalignment and planet properties reported by Albrecht et al. (2021). While the evidence is certainly not yet conclusive, it motivates a closer look at mechanisms for producing spin-orbit misalignment that are largely independent of planetary mass. Many mechanisms fit this constraint; a few that we will not discuss include: magnetic torques (Lai et al., 2011; Foucart & Lai, 2011; Spalding & Batygin, 2015, 2016), stochastically-excited internal gravity waves (Rogers et al., 2012, 2013), stellar spin stochasticity at formation (Bate et al., 2010; Spalding et al., 2014; Fielding et al., 2015), and stellar flybys (Batygin et al., 2020; Rodet et al., 2021). The mechanism that is the focus of this paper was first proposed by Batygin (2012) and involves a star, its surrounding PPD, and a distant binary companion. During the subsequent dissipation of the PPD, the secular precession frequency of the stellar spin driven by disk and that of the disk driven by the binary become commensurate, and the resulting secular resonance crossing excites the obliquity to large values (Batygin & Adams, 2013; Lai, 2014; Spalding & Batygin, 2014; Zanazzi & Lai, 2018a, b; Spalding & Millholland, 2020; Gerbig et al., 2024). The result of this mechanism is a nontrivial distribution of the primordial obliquities. The properties of this distribution have ramifications for the predictions of subsequent secular evolution of the system, such as the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai migration of giant planets (e.g. Vick et al., 2023). Thus, a detailed characterization of the primordial obliquities is of great importance. One attractive feature of this mechanism is that \sim 50\% of FGK stars are in binaries (e.g. Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Raghavan et al., 2010; Tokovinin, 2014), with an increase towards more massive stars (Offner et al., 2023). Morever, binarity statistics in young star-forming environments suggest that binaries may be more common at early stellar ages (e.g. in the Taurus star-forming region; Kraus et al., 2011) and may be rarer in dense star clusters (e.g. in the Orion Nebula Cluster; Reipurth et al., 2007; Duchêne et al., 2018). Taken together, these statistics suggest that the present-day FGK binary fraction of 50\% is likely to be an underestimate of their binarity at formation, which may decrease to its present-day value due to dynamical scattering. It is therefore imperative to account for this disk dissipation-driven resonant obliquity excitation mechanism, as it is likely to operate in a substantial fraction of planet-hosting systems. In this paper, we revisit this disk dissipation-driven misalignment scenario. Our objectives are to provide a compact semi-analytical description of the resulting obliquity distribution in the simplest approximation (i.e. a homologously-disspating rigid disk), then to explore some variations of this result under different initial conditions. In particular, we study the effect of non-homologous disk evolution, in which photoevaporation opens a \sim 2\;\mathrm{AU}. We show that this non-homologous evolution changes the predicted obliquities for planets with semimajor axes \lesssim 1\;\mathrm{AU} compared to the models adopted in the literature. In particular, while the standard disk models result in a prediction of general misalignment for all but the closest Earth and Super Earth-mass planets (which is in disagreement with observation, e.g. Winn et al., 2017; Albrecht et al., 2022), our model results in low primordial obliquities for warm planets \lesssim 1\;\mathrm{AU} (weakly dependent on uncertain disk physics) independent of planet mass. In Section 2, we review the essential theoretical results for our analysis. In Section 3, we present a systematic exploration of the obliquity evolution when assuming a standard, homologously-dissipating disk. In Section 4, we study the effect of including photoevaporative gap opening in the disk evolution. We summarize and discuss in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08092v1,Preparing for the Early eVolution Explorer: Characterizing the photochemical inputs and transit detection efficiencies of young planets using multiwavelength flare observations by TESS and Swift,"Ultraviolet flare emission can drive photochemistry in exoplanet atmospheres and even serve as the primary source of uncertainty in atmospheric retrievals. Additionally, flare energy budgets are not well-understood due to a paucity of simultaneous observations. We present new near-UV (NUV) and optical observations of flares from three M dwarfs obtained at 20 s cadence with Swift and TESS, along with a re-analysis of flares from two M dwarfs in order to explore the energy budget and timing of flares at NUV–optical wavelengths. We find a 9000 K blackbody underestimates the NUV flux by \geq2\times for 54\pm14% of flares and 14.8\times for one flare. We report time lags between the bands of 0.5–6.6 min and develop a method to predict the qualitative flare shape and time lag to 36\pm30% accuracy. The scatter present in optical-NUV relations is reduced by a factor of 2.0\pm0.6 when comparing the total NUV energy with the TESS energy during the FWHM duration due to the exclusion of the T_{\mathrm{eff}}\approx5000 K tail. We show the NUV light curve can be used to remove flares from the optical light curve and consistently detect planets with 20% smaller transits than is possible without flare detrending. Finally, we demonstrate a 10\times increase in the literature number of multi-wavelength flares with the Early eVolution Explorer (EVE), an astrophysics Small Explorer concept to observe young clusters with simultaneous NUV and optical bands in order to detect young planets, assess their photochemical radiation environments, and observe accretion.","The evolution of stellar activity from young stars and the formation of planetary systems are inextricably linked. Heightened levels of stellar emission at X-ray to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths during the pre-main sequence drives atmospheric escape (Owen & Wu, 2013; Lopez & Fortney, 2014; Ribas et al., 2016) and disequilibrium chemistry in planetary atmospheres (Loyd et al., 2018; Tilley et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021). Atmospheric escape models find enhanced X-ray and extreme UV (XUV) emission during the first 100 Myr of the stellar lifetime is responsible for the majority of atmospheric loss for small planets with radii near 2R_{\oplus} (e.g. Owen & Wu 2013; Jin et al. 2014; Lopez & Fortney 2014). At the same time, accretion of material from the inner edge of the protoplanetary disk onto the star is thought to drive stellar angular momentum evolution through both spin up (e.g. Armitage & Clarke 1996; Amard & Matt 2023; Zwintz & Steindl 2022) and disk locking (e.g. Koenigl 1991; Venuti et al. 2017; Rebull et al. 2018). Angular momentum evolution is responsible for changes in the strength and organization of the surface magnetic field with age, leading to a general decrease in stellar activity in the form of spots and flares (e.g. West et al. 2008, 2015; Davenport et al. 2019; Magaudda et al. 2020; Ilin et al. 2021). The enhanced rate of stellar flares at young ages provides a significant contribution to the high-energy radiation environments of planets orbiting young stars (Loyd et al., 2018; Johnstone et al., 2021). Although true of all pre-main sequence stars, the impact of this activity is thought to be most significant for planets orbiting M dwarfs. M dwarfs spin down slowly and experience elevated levels of high-energy radiation throughout their long pre-main sequence phase, which can last up to 200–300 Myr for mid M dwarfs and up to a Gyr for late M-dwarfs (Baraffe et al., 2015; Godolt et al., 2019). As a result, understanding the impact of stellar activity on planetary atmospheres is a necessary precursor to identifying habitable conditions for life as described in “Pathways to Habitable Worlds,” one of three priority areas identified in the 2020 Astronomy Decadal Survey (NASEM, 2023). Flares occur when magnetic reconnection events in the corona accelerate charged particles along field lines toward the photosphere, heating the plasma. Particles with different energies brake at different depths in the stellar atmosphere and produce different amounts of flux at each wavelength (Klein & Dalla, 2017). The far-UV (FUV; 90–170 nm) and near-UV (NUV; 170–320 nm) emission that drive photochemistry in planetary atmospheres originate in the upper chromosphere and transition region and are observed immediately following an episode of electron beam heating (Fleming et al., 2022). Optical emission is the most commonly observed component of the flaring process, results from heating in the lower chromosphere, and typically occurs in two phases. Prompt optical emission with an effective temperature of 9,000–16,000 K occurs first, followed by a more gradual period of emission of \sim5000 K (Kowalski et al., 2016; Howard et al., 2023). Here, we define effective temperature (T_{\mathrm{eff}}) or equivalent color temperature as the blackbody temperature that best fits an observed spectral energy distribution or set of broadband observations (Kowalski, 2024). Transmission spectroscopy observations with JWST are illuminating the role of high-energy stellar radiation for photochemistry in planetary atmospheres. Sulfuric photochemistry has been detected through an SO2 feature at 4.05 \mum in the hydrogen-rich irradiated atmosphere of WASP-39b (Alderson et al., 2023; Rustamkulov et al., 2023; Tsai et al., 2023). A plethora of Cycle 3 JWST programs have now been selected to explore the impact of photochemical processes on the transmission spectrum (GO 5177, PI: Hu; GO 5191, PI: Ducrot; 5311, 5959, Co-PIs: Feinstein & Welbanks; GO 5844, PI: Radica; GO 5863, PI: Murray). Although photochemistry is driven by FUV–NUV radiation, the contribution of emission at these wavelengths to the energy budget of flares remains largely unknown. While the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; Ricker et al. 2014) has observed more than 106 flares from 140,000 stars (Günther et al., 2020; Feinstein et al., 2022a; Yang et al., 2023; Feinstein et al., 2024), simultaneous UV observations exist for only a few dozen events (MacGregor et al., 2021; Paudel et al., 2021; Jackman, 2022; Inoue et al., 2024; Jackman et al., 2024; Paudel et al., 2024). Of these, only 17 flares have been observed during the flare peak and at sub-minute cadence in each band (Inoue et al., 2024; Jackman et al., 2024; Paudel et al., 2024). Longer cadences fail to resolve the structure of the flare peak, which evolves on timescales of \sim1–30 s (Kowalski et al., 2019; Aizawa et al., 2022; Howard & MacGregor, 2022). Simultaneous UV and optical observations of fifteen flares from six stars have also been obtained using facilities besides Swift and TESS (Hawley & Pettersen, 1991; Robinson et al., 1993; Osten et al., 2016; Wargelin et al., 2017; Kowalski et al., 2019; Brasseur et al., 2023; Tristan et al., 2023). The current lack of a statistical sample of simultaneous UV observations prevents us from inferring the photochemical radiation environments of planets from optical flares to within a factor of \sim10 (Paudel et al., 2024). As UV emission from the host star serves as the largest source of uncertainty in photochemical models of small, young planetary atmospheres (Teal et al., 2022) and remains a significant source of uncertainty for larger planets (Hu, 2021; Yu et al., 2021), we require a better understanding of the UV output from stellar flares. Flare emission at UV wavelengths is the largest source of uncertainty because different quiescent spectra result in larger changes to the planetary spectrum than do other model inputs, and because the intensity and spectral shape during flares further increases the uncertainty relative to quiescence. In the absence of simultaneous observations, the UV emission of optical flares is usually estimated assuming a blackbody spectrum with an T_{\mathrm{eff}} of \sim9000 K (e.g. Shibayama et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2017; Günther et al. 2020; Ducrot et al. 2020; do Amaral et al. 2022). This approach is motivated by the observation that many optical flare spectra are well-described by a spectrum reminiscent of an A0 star or hot blackbody of 9000–10,000 K (Hawley & Fisher, 1992; Hawley et al., 2003; Kowalski et al., 2013; Osten & Wolk, 2015). As noted by Jackman et al. (2023), applications of the 9000 K blackbody to scaling optical flare energies into the UV involve various degrees of complexity. For example, some UV-optical relations adjust the spectrum of the 9000 K blackbody by including actual UV flare observations (e.g., Segura et al., 2010; Tilley et al., 2019; Feinstein et al., 2022b; Konings et al., 2022; Louca et al., 2023). However, the accuracy of the 9000 K blackbody scaling is increasingly being called into question as flares are observed in new UV and optical datasets (Jackman et al., 2023; Paudel et al., 2024). Although the UV and optical emission of some flares are consistent with the 9000 K blackbody (Hawley & Pettersen, 1991; Paudel et al., 2021; Inoue et al., 2024), other events are not. Simultaneous optical and NUV Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectroscopy of two flares from the M4 dwarf GJ 1243 show the NUV emission is underestimated by 2-3\times when scaling from the optical using a 9000 K blackbody due to the presence of Fe II and Mg II lines and ionized Balmer continuum below 364 nm (Kowalski et al., 2019). Likewise, the FUV emission of a flare from Proxima Cen observed simultaneously by HST and TESS is underestimated by 12.2\times relative to the 9000 K blackbody (MacGregor et al., 2021). At least 8 flares observed simultaneously with Swift and TESS exceed the NUV flux predicted from the 9000 K blackbody by factors of 3–17 (Paudel et al., 2024), corresponding to T_{\mathrm{eff}} values of 12,000–26,000 K. Non-simultaneous UV and optical flare rates also indicate the UV energies of optical flares are underestimated. Jackman et al. (2023) measure the average flare rates of a sample of 1250 M-dwarfs with GALEX and TESS observations obtained 6–17 years apart. The TESS flare rates are scaled into the FUV and NUV using the 9000 K blackbody and then compared with the observed GALEX NUV flare rates. Jackman et al. (2023) split the sample into partially and fully convective stars and compute empirical correction factors (ECF) for each sample and flare template. They find the NUV energies derived from the 9000 K blackbody must be scaled by ECFs of 2.7\pm0.6 and 6.5\pm0.7 to bring the flare rates into alignment with the GALEX observations of the partially and fully convective stars, respectively. Even small underestimates at NUV wavelengths can correspond to much larger underestimates at FUV wavelengths given the assumption that the flare spectrum is described by a blackbody of T_{\mathrm{eff}}. For example, an ECF of 2.7\pm0.6 in the NUV corresponds to an ECF of 6.4\pm2.8 in the FUV while an ECF of 10\pm1 in the NUV corresponds to an ECF in the FUV of 93\pm11. Deriving energy budgets from average flare rates obtained in two different wavelength regimes is only possible under the assumption that the processes driving emission in both bands are closely coupled. As a result, Jackman et al. (2023) state that simultaneous observations are required to confirm any relationship between flare energy and flare T_{\mathrm{eff}}, and to discover under what conditions NUV flares have optical counterparts. Figure 1: Although flare rates and energies are measured in the optical for most stars, the FUV and NUV energies determine the photochemical radiation environment of orbiting planets during these events. Simultaneous observations at UV and optical wavelengths are needed to derive the energy budget as flares with similar emission levels at optical wavelengths can produce NUV fluxes that differ by 2–20\times depending on the T_{\mathrm{eff}} of the flare, correlating with order-of-magnitude discrepancies at FUV wavelengths. Spectra of \epsilon Eri during the two flares are obtained by superimposing the flare blackbody onto the semi-empirical base spectrum from Behr et al. (2023). Flares also serve as an unpredictable source of stellar contamination in the search for young transiting exoplanets (Newton et al., 2019; Martioli et al., 2021; Gilbert et al., 2022), biasing the transit parameters or even resulting in false negative detections for particularly active systems (Luger et al., 2017; Gilbert et al., 2021; Mann et al., 2022). Although flare contamination is worse at shorter wavelengths, flares observed from the young M-dwarf AU Mic during transits of its two warm Neptunes AU Mic b and c in broadband TESS photometry (600–1000 nm) have been observed to alter the ingress and egress shape, reduce the transit depth, and in some cases largely mask the transit itself (Martioli et al., 2021; Gilbert et al., 2021; Mann et al., 2022). While TESS has been used to detect nearly a dozen new young transiting planets (e.g. Benatti et al. 2019; Newton et al. 2019; Plavchan et al. 2020; Mann et al. 2020; Rizzuto et al. 2020; Tofflemire et al. 2021; Zhou et al. 2021, 2022; Mann et al. 2022; Vach et al. 2022), the increased stellar activity levels of young stars has lead to substantial losses in the yield of young planets with radii R<3R⊕ and orbital periods P_{\mathrm{orb}}>10 d (Newton et al., 2019; Rizzuto et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021). Simultaneous monitoring of many young stars at NUV and red optical wavelengths is needed to determine the relative contribution of flares at UV wavelengths and to mitigate flare contamination in searches for young transiting planets. The Early eVolution Explorer (EVE) is a NASA astrophysics Small Explorer concept to investigate the earliest stages in the shared evolutionary pathways of stars and planets. EVE would obtain simultaneous NUV and red optical photometry of the dense core regions of nearby young moving groups and clusters with ages of approximately 5–100 Myr. The mission would observe 12–24 targeted regions for approximately 30 d each and at cadences of 30–60 s. The addition of the simultaneous NUV band compared to missions like Kepler or TESS enables the measurement of the NUV-optical relation for hundreds to thousands of flares over the mission lifetime from 104 stars of different masses and ages, while providing an independent lever arm to identify and remove photometric scatter in transit light curves due to flares. EVE would determine the degree to which the UV radiation environments of young planets are underestimated from optical observations as a function of flare size and shape in order to constrain the impact of photochemistry on sub-Neptune transmission spectra (Konings et al., 2022; Louca et al., 2023) and biosignature false positives for small planets (Harman et al., 2015). New results from GALEX demonstrate that simultaneous NUV and optical observations with EVE would provide strong constraints on the FUV to NUV ratios of optical flares, which determine the photochemical state of planetary atmospheres. The GALEX observations of the FUV to NUV energy ratios of 182 flares from 158 M dwarfs find that the distribution of FUV/NUV energy ratios of their sample is surprisingly narrow, with a mean and 1\sigma uncertainty of 0.46\pm0.23 (Berger et al., 2023). As a result, a successful NUV-TESS scaling relation would unlock the photochemical radiation environment of the extensive TESS flare archive. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of the EVE flare science objective using new multi-wavelength observations of flares from G 41-14, GJ 674, and EV Lac and new analysis of flares from AP Col and YZ CMi, all obtained simultaneously at 20 s cadence with Swift and TESS. In Section 2, we describe the Swift and TESS observations, data reduction, and identification of simultaneous flare detections. In Section 3, we discuss the methods used to characterize the time lag and energy budget of the flares at each wavelength. In Section 4, we present population-level results for the consistency of the flare energy budget with a 9000 K blackbody at NUV to optical wavelengths. In Section 5, we explore improvements to the transit detection efficiency obtained from the addition of the NUV band. In Section 6, we present simulations of the number of flares required to discriminate between flare samples with energy budgets consistent with the 9000 K assumption and NUV-luminous flares relative to the 9000 K assumption. We then present a list of candidate clusters and a trade study to ensure EVE can feasibly detect a sufficient number of multi-wavelength flares. In Section 7 we discuss the implications of our work to exoplanet photochemistry and to EVE."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08462v1,High-Time-Cadence Spectroscopy and Photometry of Stellar Flares on M-dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with Seimei Telescope and TESS. I. Discovery of Rapid and Short-Duration Prominence Eruptions,"M-dwarfs show frequent flares and associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may significantly impact close-in habitable planets. M-dwarf flares sometimes show red/blue asymmetries in the H\alpha line profile, suggesting prominence eruptions as an early stage of CMEs. However, their high-time-cadence observations are limited. We conducted spectroscopic monitoring observations of the active M-dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with \sim1 minute time cadence using the Seimei telescope, simultaneously with the optical photometric observations by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We detected 27 H\alpha flares with H\alpha energies ranging from 1.7 \times 1029 to 3.8 \times 1032 erg and durations from 8 to 319 minutes. Among them, we identified 3 blue asymmetry and 5 red asymmetry events based on criteria using the Bayesian Information Criterion. The maximum velocity of the blue- and red-shifted components ranges from 250 to 450 km s-1 and 190 to 400 km s-1, respectively. The duration and time evolution show variety, and in particular, we discovered rapid, short-duration blue/red asymmetry events with the duration of 6–8 minutes. Among the 8 blue/red asymmetry events, two blue and one red asymmetry events are interpreted as prominence eruptions because of their fast velocity and time evolution. Based on this interpretation, the lower limit of occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions can be estimated to be \sim1.1 events per day. Our discovery of short-duration events suggests that previous studies with low time cadence may have missed these events, potentially leading to an underestimation of the occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions/CMEs.","Solar and stellar flares are explosive phenomena that occur suddenly in the corona of the Sun and stars (e.g., Kowalski, 2024). They are observed as an increase in electromagnetic radiation, ranging from X-rays to radio waves. These flares are believed to be caused by the conversion of magnetic energy into kinetic and thermal energy through magnetic reconnection (Shibata & Magara, 2011). Some of the energy released in the corona is transported to the chromosphere and photosphere via heat conduction and high-energy particles. This leads to chromospheric evaporation, chromospheric condensation, and radiation from the corona, transition region, chromosphere, and photosphere (e.g., Fisher et al. 1985; Allred et al. 2006). Part of the magnetic energy is released for plasma ejections known as prominence/filament eruptions. On the Sun, they often develop into coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which can significantly impact Earth’s environment (e.g., Bisi et al. 2010; Gopalswamy 2016). In recent years, M-dwarfs are considered as prime targets for the search for habitable planets (Nutzman & Charbonneau, 2008; Gilbert et al., 2020) and have been observed to show very high flare activity. Superflares with more than ten times the energy of the largest solar flares are observed (Namizaki et al., 2023). If CMEs associated with these superflares can eject from the stellar surface, the impact on surrounding close-in planets would be significant. Large CMEs could cause atmospheric erosion if they collide with a close-in planet (Lammer et al., 2007). Additionally, high-energy particles accelerated by fast shocks produced during CMEs could promote chemical reactions in planetary atmosphere (Airapetian et al., 2016). This could potentially lead to the origin of life-essential molecules such as amino acids (Kobayashi et al., 2023). Since M-dwarfs have habitable zones closer to the star compared to G-dwarfs and K-dwarfs, such impacts on close-in habitable planets can be greater (Lingam et al., 2018). Therefore, understanding the frequency and energy of prominence/filament eruptions, and eventually CMEs, in active M-dwarfs is crucial for evaluation of habitable condition of exoplanets. Over the past several decades, optical spectroscopic observations have revealed that chromospheric line profiles often show blue asymmetries during flares on M-dwarfs, suggesting possible prominence/filament eruptions (e.g., Houdebine et al. 1990; Vida et al. 2016, 2019; Maehara et al. 2021; Notsu et al. 2024; Inoue et al. 2024). Vida et al. (2016) reported a blueshifted component with a maximum radial velocity of 675 km s-1 during an H\alpha flare on the M4 dwarf V374 Peg. Additionally, Vida et al. (2016) observed an H\alpha flare where a red asymmetry followed the blue asymmetry in the H\alpha line, suggesting that some of the ejected low-temperature plasma returns to the stellar surface. Honda et al. (2018) reported a long-duration blue asymmetry lasting about 2 hours at a velocity of approximately 100 km s-1 during an H\alpha flare on the M4.5 dwarf EV Lac. Maehara et al. (2021) reported a blue asymmetry lasting about 1 hour without significant white-light brightening (a possible non-white-light flare) during an H\alpha flare on the M4.5 dwarf YZ CMi. Furthermore, Inoue et al. (2024) reported a blue asymmetry appearing about 1 hour after the peak of an H\alpha flare on the M4.5 dwarf EV Lac. Notsu et al. (2024) reported 7 blue asymmetries among 41 H\alpha flares in the M-dwarfs YZ CMi, EV Lac, and AD Leo, with durations ranging from approximately 20 minutes to 150 minutes and velocities ranging from about 73 km s-1 to 122 km s-1. It has been discussed that they can be interpreted as prominence/filament eruptions based on the velocity and mass. However, the time cadence (>5 min) of the previous observations is not necessarily high enough to capture and trace the rapid velocity changes of prominence eruptions on M-dwarfs with strong surface gravity. Actually, some solar prominence/filament eruptions change their velocities in less than 5 minutes (Otsu et al., 2022). Higher-time-cadence (\sim1 min) is essentially required not to miss even such short-duration/fast phenomena especially for M-dwarfs. Meanwhile, the nature and origin of the H\alpha blue asymmetries during M-dwarf flares are still under debate, and simultaneous observations with multiple wavelength ranges and different methods (e.g., photometry) are useful for this purpose. For example, the blue asymmetries could also be explained by the upward flow of low-temperature plasma associated with chromospheric evaporation, as observed in the early stage of solar flares (Tei et al., 2018; Canfield et al., 1990). However, white-light flares represent the emission only from flare ribbons originated from chromospheric evaporation/condensation during impulsive phase (Watanabe et al., 2013; Namekata et al., 2017), thus it is crucial to compare the emission energy and temporal variation of white-light emission with those of H\alpha blue asymmetries. One-month continuous photometric observations by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS, Ricker et al. 2015) have enabled simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations, providing a good opportunity to investigate statistical relationships between blue asymmetries and white-light flares, rotational phase which reflects starspots distribution (Ikuta et al., 2023). From these statistical investigations, we can explore the typical properties of blue asymmetries on M-dwarfs, including the location of occurrence. Previous studies with such simultaneous observations using white-light photometry and H\alpha line spectroscopy (Maehara et al., 2021; Namizaki et al., 2023; Notsu et al., 2024) reported only three blue asymmetries during the non-white-light flares or a partial white-light flare (occurring not concurrently with the white-light flare, but shortly after its decay) observed by TESS. The number of such observations is still small, and there are no systematic studies using monitoring observations by TESS. In this study, we conducted high-time-resolution (approximately 1 minute) H\alpha line spectroscopic observations of the active M-dwarf YZ CMi using the Seimei telescope (Kurita et al., 2020). Simultaneously, high-precision optical photometric observations were conducted by TESS. We performed this simultaneous campaign observation for 12 nights. This significantly increases the sample size of observations of H\alpha red/blue asymmetries for white-light/non-white-light flares, which is expected to be helpful to identify the origin of blue asymmetries. For this statistical sample, we incorporated a new criteria to identify the asymmetric or symmetric profiles by using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; Section 3.3). The data and observations are described in Section 2. The analysis methods are explained in Section 3. The analysis results are presented in Section 4. A detailed discussion of the H\alpha blue asymmetries is in Section 5. The summary and conclusions are provided in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08050v1,Spherically symmetric Earth models yield no net electron spin,"Terrestrial experiments that use electrons in Earth as a spin-polarized source have been demonstrated to provide strong bounds on exotic long-range spin-spin and spin-velocity interactions. These bounds constrain the coupling strength of many proposed ultralight bosonic dark-matter candidates. Recently, it was pointed out that a monopole-dipole coupling between the Sun and the spin-polarized electrons of Earth would result in a modification of the precession of the perihelion of Earth. Using an estimate for the net spin-polarization of Earth and experimental bounds on Earth’s perihelion precession, interesting constraints were placed on the magnitude of this monopole-dipole coupling. Here we investigate the spin associated with Earth’s electrons. We find that there are about 6\times 10^{41} spin-polarized electrons in the mantle and crust of Earth oriented anti-parallel to their local magnetic field. However, when integrated over any spherically-symmetric Earth model, we find that the vector sum of these spins is zero. In order to establish a lower bound on the magnitude of the net spin along Earth’s rotation axis we have investigated three of the largest breakdowns of Earth’s spherical symmetry: the large low shear-velocity provinces of the mantle, the crustal composition, and the oblate spheroid of Earth. From these investigations we conclude that there are at least 5\times 10^{38} spin-polarized electrons aligned anti-parallel to Earth’s rotation axis. This analysis suggests that the bounds on the monopole-dipole coupling that were extracted from Earth’s perihelion precession need to be relaxed by a factor of about 2000.","Many extensions of the Standard Model suggest new bosonic particles, several of which (e.g. the axion) are also interesting dark-matter candidates [1]. The virtual exchange of these bosons can result in new exotic (non-Standard Model) forces between particles [2, 3, 4]. Searches for exotic spin-dependent forces provide important constraints on the coupling strength of these bosons [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] as well as on torsion gravity [10]. A comprehensive review of existing experimental and observational constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions can be found in Ref. [11]. Spin-polarized electrons within Earth’s mantle and crust (geoelectrons) have been demonstrated to be a vast and valuable spin source in searches for exotic long-range spin-spin [12] and velocity-dependent spin-spin [13] interactions. Recently, it has been suggested that this large reservoir of spin-polarized geoelectrons can be combined with experimental measurements of the precession of the perihelion of Earth in order to establish bounds on exotic monopole-dipole couplings between the Sun and the spin-polarized electrons of Earth [14]. To establish such a bound, the magnitude and direction of the net electronic spin of Earth must be known. Here we use the electron-spin model developed in Ref. [12] to estimate the magnitude and direction of the net spin associated with these geoelectrons. Assuming only that Earth’s mantle and crust are non-conductive and that their temperature, density, pressure, and chemical composition are spherically symmetric, we come to the general and somewhat surprising conclusion that the net spin of Earth’s geoelectrons is zero. This is despite the fact that we estimate that there are about 6\times 10^{41} spin-polarized geoelectron’s in Earth’s mantle and crust pointing anti-parallel to their local magnetic field. In order to determine a lower bound on the magnitude of the net spin along Earth’s rotation axis we consider the breakdown of Earth’s spherical symmetry associated with the large low shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs), the crustal composition, and the oblate spheroid of Earth. We conservatively estimate that there are at least 5\times 10^{38} spin-polarized electrons aligned anti-parallel to Earth’s rotation axis. This analysis suggests that the bounds on the monopole-dipole coupling established in [14] need to be relaxed by a factor of \sim 2000."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08029v1,The discovery and characterization of minimoon 2024 PT,"Minimoons are asteroids that become temporarily captured by the Earth-Moon system. We present the discovery of 2024 PT5, a minimoon discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) Sutherland telescope on 2024 August 7. The minimoon with heliocentric semi-major axis, a\sim1.01 au, and perihelion, q\sim0.99 au, became captured by the Earth-Moon system on 2024 September 29 and left on 2024 November 25 UTC. Visible g, r, i, and Z spectrophotometry was obtained using Gemini North/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on 2024 September 27. The color indices are g-r = 0.58\pm0.04, r-i = 0.29\pm0.04, i-Z = -0.27\pm0.06, and the spectrum best matches lunar rock samples followed by S-complex asteroids. Assuming an albedo of 0.21 and using our measured absolute magnitude of 28.64\pm0.04, 2024 PT5 has a diameter of 5.4\pm1.3 m. We also detect variations in the lightcurve of 2024 PT5 with a 0.28\pm0.07 magnitude amplitude and a double-peaked period of \sim2600\pm500 s. We improve the orbital solution of 2024 PT5 with our astrometry and estimate the effect of radiation pressure on its deriving an area-to-mass ratio of 7.02\pm2.05\times10-5 m2/kg, implying a density of \sim3.9\pm2.1 g/cm3, compatible with having a rocky composition. If we assume 2024 PT5 is from the NEO population, its most likely sources are resonances in the inner Main Belt by comparing its orbit with the NEO population model, though this does not exclude a lunar origin.","Evidence from observations of near-Earth objects (NEOs) suggests that the majority originate from the Main Belt asteroids (MBAs) and Jupiter Family Comet (JFC) populations (Granvik et al., 2018; Nesvorný et al., 2023, 2024). A small percentage of NEOs can become temporary Earth co-orbitals, located in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with the Earth (Morais & Morbidelli, 2002) where they can become Trojans or quasi-satellites of the Earth for several thousand years (Brasser et al., 2004). A small portion of NEOs, less than 1/10,000,000 of the total NEO population, can become temporarily captured by the Earth-Moon system’s gravity and enter its Hill sphere, becoming a so-called “minimoon” (Granvik et al., 2013; Jedicke et al., 2018). Minimoons are captured at low relative velocities with the Earth-Moon system, less than 1 km/s, where they can be captured on timescales as long as 10s of days to years (Granvik et al., 2012; Fedorets et al., 2017). The first known minimoon, 2006 RH120, remained in orbit around the Earth for \sim400 days (Kwiatkowski et al., 2008), and the second, 2003 CD3 was captured for \sim900 days (Naidu et al., 2021) before escaping the Earth’s Hill sphere. Thus, the capture duration of minimoons represents a small portion of the time they share the Earth’s orbit. While it is assumed that Earth co-orbitals such as minimoons are captured from the NEO population, emerging evidence suggests that some may originate as lunar impact ejecta. Ejecta from lunar impacts can be re-captured onto Earth-similar orbits where they can last for thousands of years (Gladman et al., 1995). Additionally, the observed spectral properties of some minimoons and quasi-satellites such as 2020 CD3 and (469219) Kamo‘oalewa resemble some lunar samples (Bolin et al., 2020; Sharkey et al., 2021). This evidence has led some to suggest a recent lunar impact as the origin for some Earth co-orbitals (e.g., Jiao et al., 2024) This paper discusses the discovery of minimoon, 2024 PT5, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope and observations taken at Gemini North. We will use the approach of Bolin et al. (2021, 2022, 2023) to use spectrophotometric observations at different visible wavelengths to constrain its physical properties as a test of whether 2024 PT5 has an asteroidal or Lunar debris origin. We will also use the astrometry reported from our observations and the observations of others to refine the orbit of 2024 PT5 , measuring the effect of non-gravitational perturbations on its orbit (e.g., Micheli et al., 2012) and compare its orbit with the NEO population model (Morbidelli et al., 2020; Nesvorný et al., 2023)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07922v1,The impact of water clouds on the prospective emission spectrum of Teegarden’s Star b as observed by LIFE,"Non-transiting terrestrial planets will be accessible by upcoming observatories of which LIFE is an example. Planet b orbiting Teegarden’s Star is one of the optimal targets for such missions.We use a one-dimensional atmospheric model with real-gas radiation, a multi-species pseudo-adiabatic convection-condensation scheme, and a water cloud scheme, to estimate the impact of the cloud coverage on the emission spectrum of the target, as well as to assess how sensitive LIFE could be to changes in outgoing flux caused by these clouds.Though the emergent flux decreases with a higher cloud coverage, it does not decrease by more than one order of magnitude as the coverage increases from 0% to 90%. This allows LIFE to retain a high sensitivity to the cloud cover fraction for wavelengths longer than 7 microns. In this spectral range, with at least 1 bar of N2, LIFE is able to distinguish cloud cover fractions as small as 10% given an integration time of 24 hours, and yields much better precision with a week-long integration. An integration time of one week also allows the resolution of local variations in spectral flux, which can lead to an easier molecule identification. This ability remains if the planet is a CO2-dominated Venus analog. Partial pressures of N2 lower than 1 bar may create a degeneracy with the cloud cover fraction.LIFE shows promising potential for detecting and characterizing atmospheres even with a high cloud coverage, and retaining a fine sensitivity to relatively small differences in cloud cover fractions.","LIFE (quanz2022large) is a candidate direct imaging mission whose science priorities conform to those detailed in the Voyage 2050 long-term plan in the ESA Science Programme. It will attempt to constrain \eta_{\mathrm{hab}} and \eta_{\mathrm{life}}, the occurrence rates of habitability and life on nearby exoplanetary systems, including terrestrial planets orbiting Sun-like stars. It will use nulling interferometry to block the light from the host stars and spatially resolve rocky exoplanets in mid-infrared thermal emission. The LIFE community has identified Teegarden’s Star as one of its golden targets, as it is a nearby ultracool M dwarf about 3.8 parsecs away and orbited by two planets discovered through radial velocity (zechmeister2019carmenes). A third planet was detected by dreizler2024teegarden. There is as of yet no sign of any of them transiting, which makes them only accessible to direct imaging facilities. zechmeister2019carmenes estimated their masses at 1.05\begin{subarray}{c}+0.13\\ -0.12\end{subarray} M_{\mathrm{Earth}} for planet b and 1.11\begin{subarray}{c}+0.16\\ -0.15\end{subarray} M_{\mathrm{Earth}} for planet c. Using a mass-radius relation based on the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) (zeng2016mass), they showed that assuming a roughly rocky bulk composition leads to radii close to the radius of the Earth. dreizler2024teegarden estimated slightly different masses, 1.16\begin{subarray}{c}+0.12\\ -0.11\end{subarray} M_{\mathrm{Earth}} for planet b, 1.05\begin{subarray}{c}+0.14\\ -0.13\end{subarray} M_{\mathrm{Earth}} for planet c, and 0.82\begin{subarray}{c}+0.17\\ -0.17\end{subarray} M_{\mathrm{Earth}} for planet d. The Teegarden planets are prime candidates for habitability not only because their orbits are within their habitable zones, but also due to the low activity of their host star (dreizler2024teegarden). atri2021stellar suggested that M4 to M10 stars are the least likely to erode secondary atmospheres by stellar flares and XUV irradiation. Teegarden’s Star is an M7, which increases the likelihood that planet b retained a secondary atmosphere. stassun2019revised investigated the habitability of planets b and c, suggesting that their orbits might allow for the presence of liquid water at intervals of latitude that vary depending on the semi-major axis and the efficiency of atmospheric heat redistribution around the planet. This approach lacked realistic representations of gas and cloud radiative transfer and convection. The present work aims to explore the impact of different cloud configurations on the emission spectra that LIFE might obtain from an N2-H2O atmosphere with the properties of Teegarden’s Star b. We use for this purpose spectrally resolved gas and cloud radiation modelling, as a first step of a broader study that will include more complex compositions and three-dimensional dynamics in subsequent works. The radiation model is coupled to an idealized column model which enables the exploration of different parameter spaces. We sweep over the fraction of cloud coverage, the surface temperature, and the partial pressure of nitrogen. We compute the resulting spectral thermal emission in each case and use it to estimate the performance of LIFE under different scenarios. In Sect. 2 we describe the tools used for the modelling and the parameters used. We present results in Sect. 3. We discuss the significance of the results for future observations in Sect. 4 and conclude in Sect. 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07861v1,Detectability of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Atmosphere of WASP-6 b with  NIRSpec PRISM,"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been detected throughout the universe where they play essential roles in the evolution of their environments. For example, they are believed to affect atmospheric loss rates of close-in planets and might contribute to the pre-biotic chemistry and emergence of life. Despite their importance, the study of PAHs in exoplanet atmospheres has been limited. We aim to evaluate the possibility of detecting PAHs on exoplanets considering future observations using JWST’s NIRSpec PRISM mode. The hot Saturn WASP-6 b shows properties that are consistent with a potential PAH presence and is thus used as a case study for this work. Here, we compare the likelihoods of various synthetic haze species and their combinations with the influence of PAHs on the transmission spectrum of WASP-6 b. This is possible by applying the atmospheric retrieval code petitRADTRANS to a collection of data from previous observations. Subsequently, by exploring synthetic, single transit JWST spectra of this planet that include PAHs, we assess if these molecules can be detected in the near future. Previous observations support the presence of cloud/haze species in the spectrum of WASP-6 b. While this may include PAHs, the current data do not confirm their existence unambiguously. Our research suggests that utilizing the JWST for future observations could lead to a notable advancement in the study of PAHs. Employing this telescope, we find that a PAH abundance of approximately 0.1 per cent of the ISM value could be robustly detectable.","We all have produced PAHs at home when burning food. If not, we have most likely inhaled them in polluted cities or when someone smokes. This distinct group of molecules is defined by their chemical constituents, including multiple benzene rings. Thus, they come in all shapes and sizes ranging from a few ten to hundreds of carbon atoms (for examples, refer to NASA Ames PAH database: Boersma et al., 2014; Bauschlicher et al., 2018; Mattioda et al., 2020). Their diversity is sheer limitless as they additionally tend to form molecular complexes, so-called PAH clusters, with sizes up to tens of thousands of single molecules depending on the environment they are thriving in (Lange et al., 2021, 2023). PAHs have been found all over the universe thanks to their unique absorption cross-sections with multiple pronounced features. The corresponding infrared transitions are generated by C-H and C-C stretching and bending modes (e.g. Draine & Li, 2007) which are shared by most PAH species regardless of the size. As a consequence, scientists were able to detect these features beyond the confines of our home planet e.g. on Saturn’s hazy moon Titan using data from the space probe Cassini (Dinelli et al., 2013; López-Puertas et al., 2013). Accordingly, the upper atmosphere harbours a PAH abundance of about (2-3)\times 10^{4} particles per cubic centimetre with observed sizes ranging from 9 to 96 carbon atoms. Their presence in the ISM is well-established with a relative number density of approximately 3\times 10^{-7} respective to hydrogen nuclei (Tielens, 2008). Furthermore, PAHs are known to be part of all types of protoplanetary discs (e.g. Geers et al., 2006; Acke et al., 2010; Valegård et al., 2021). Their spectral trademarks are in fact so prominent that PAHs can even be detected in extragalactic sources with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) (Chastenet et al., 2023; Sandstrom et al., 2023). However, not only are these molecules known for their unique infrared features, their existence usually does not stay without consequence as they alter and shape their environments. For example, they efficiently turn UV photons into heat (Bakes & Tielens, 1994). Thus, they play a crucial role in heating the ISM within photo-dissociation regions (e.g. Wolfire et al., 2022, and references therein).

(2015) This effect has made the PAH spectral signature a tracer of the star-formation rate (e.g. Shipley et al., 2016). PAHs are also thought to significantly impact the chemical and hydrodynamical evolution of protoplanetary discs (Dullemond et al., 2007) and most likely atmospheric loss rates of close-in planets (Gorti et al., 2009; Mitani et al., 2020). In addition to that, their standing in the astrobiology field grows because they might have played an important role as carbon sources for the synthesis of organic compounds, such as amino acids and nucleotides. Giese et al. (2022) experimentally demonstrated that no reaction of PAHs with ammonia and ammonia salts at temperatures of up to 150°C was detectable. However, it was observed before that PAHs can be pyrolyzed at elevated temperatures or even activated with Fenton’s reagent resulting in the formation of functionalized aromatic compounds (Kanel et al., 2004; Gai et al., 2016). So far they have not been investigated in detail as potential photosensitizers in other photochemically driven reactions. Beyond using them as a carbon source they might have played a role in enabling transformations such as photoredox catalyzed alkylation of carbonyl compounds. PAHs can therefore be considered as both markers and carbon reservoirs for reduced and aromatic carbon compounds. In spite of their significance, until today, the technical capabilities of modern space and ground-based observatories have not been sufficient to detect these molecules in exoplanetary atmospheres. However, with ever-better telescopes such as the JWST and its unmatched precision and accuracy, we may be closer than ever to finding them in these environments. The production and destruction processes of PAHs are not well understood (Kislov et al., 2013; Dubey et al., 2023). This makes it challenging to identify a sweet spot in the stellar-planetary parameter space to look for a promising candidate. However, a large number of studies have already been conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and other facilities, which contain spectral information that could give a hint about the possible presence of PAHs. Most exoplanets recorded today are known to be either fully or partially cloudy or hazy (e.g. Edwards et al., 2023; Samra et al., 2023; Rustamkulov et al., 2023) which is usually expressed through a scattering component in the transmission and emission spectra for example a steep slope in the optical regime. But not all exoplanets show such a feature (e.g. Sing et al., 2016), and its origin is still under debate (e.g. He et al., 2018; Kawashima & Ikoma, 2018; He et al., 2020a, b). In our previous study (Ercolano et al., 2022), we speculated that the origin of such slopes could be, at least partially, photochemically produced haze particles, such as PAHs. This speculation has been recently strengthened by He et al. (2024) who presented lab experiment-based evidence of aromatic compounds in photochemically produced hazes of exoplanets. Consequently, planets showing a strong slope component in their spectra might currently represent the best candidates to search for atmospheric PAHs. The target planet of this work, WASP-6 b, is a hot Saturn whose spectrum meets the criterion of a high slope (see e.g. Figures 2 and 2). The available dataset is a combination of observations from a recent analysis (Carter et al., 2020, hereafter referred to as C20). In this system, the host star is relatively quiet and the effect of stellar light contamination due to its heterogeneity on this slope would be minimal. Therefore, the feature is likely to have a planetary origin (C20). This gas giant, with around 50 per cent of the mass but 1.2 times the size of Jupiter, is orbiting its G8 type host star in about 3.4 days (Gillon et al., 2009) making it a convenient target for observation. Besides, it is very similar to WASP-39 b which was already part of a successful ERS program in cycle 1 of the JWST mission (e.g. Rustamkulov et al., 2023). Furthermore, it has an equilibrium temperature of around 1200 K (C20), a temperature regime at which molecular dynamics and thermochemical simulations suggest an onset of high concentration of thermalized PAHs (Hirai, 2021) and efficient PAH production from dehydrogenated benzene (Hanine et al., 2020). Moreover in our most recent work (Dubey et al., 2023), we used self-consistent 0-D simulations for a variety of PAH species to show that their abundances peak in these environments approximately at said temperatures. Lastly, the presence of an optical haze component in the atmosphere has already been proposed in C20 further indicating that WASP-6 b might be a favourable target for finding PAHs. In this paper, we compare different sources for the optical slope and quantify their likelihood using the atmospheric retrieval method (Madhusudhan, 2018) to show the possibility of a PAH presence and retrieve best-fitting models which are subsequently used as reference spectra. In the second part, we want to assess if JWST provides the necessary precision to detect PAHs on WASP-6 b in the future. Accordingly, in section 2, we lay out the retrieval assumptions and parameters as well as the process of creating the synthetic datasets. In section 3, we present and discuss our results divided into the analysis of the real and simulated observations. Finally, we conclude our work in section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07797v1,A close outer companion to the ultra-hot Jupiter TOI-2109 b?,"Context. Hot Jupiters with close-by planetary companions are rare, with only a handful of them having been discovered so far. This could be due to their suggested dynamical histories, leading to the possible ejection of other planets. TOI-2109 b is special in this regard because it is the hot Jupiter with the closest relative separation from its host star, being separated by less than 2.3 stellar radii. Unexpectedly, transit timing measurements from recently obtained CHEOPS observations show low amplitude transit-timing variations (TTVs).Aims. We aim to search for signs of orbital decay and to characterise the apparent TTVs, trying to gain information about a possible companion.Methods. We fit the newly obtained CHEOPS light curves using TLCM and extract the resulting mid-transit timings. Successively, we use these measurements in combination with TESS and archival photometric data and radial velocity data to estimate the rate of tidal orbital decay of TOI-2109 b, as well as characterise the TTVs using the N-body code TRADES and the photodynamical approach of PyTTV.Results. We find tentative evidence at 3\sigma for orbital decay in the TOI-2109 system, when we correct the mid-transit timings using the best-fitting sinusoidal model of the TTVs. We do not detect additional transits in the available photometric data, but find evidence towards the authenticity of the apparent TTVs, indicating a close-by, outer companion with P_{\mathrm{c}}>1.125\,d. Due to the fast rotation of the star, the new planetary candidate cannot be detected in the available radial velocity (RV) measurements, and its parameters can only be loosely constrained by our joint TTV and RV modelling.Conclusions. TOI-2109 could join a small group of rare hot Jupiter systems that host close-by planetary companions, only one of which (WASP-47 b) has an outer companion. More high-precision photometric measurements are necessary to confirm the existence of this planetary companion.","There are more than 500111According to the NASA Exoplanet Archive as of 26.02.2024. hot Jupiter (HJ) systems known, only a few of which are known to host close-by planetary companions. These are WASP-47 (Hellier et al., 2012; Becker et al., 2015; Neveu-VanMalle et al., 2016; Nascimbeni et al., 2023), Kepler-730 (Thompson et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018; Cañas et al., 2019), TOI-1130 (Huang et al., 2020; Korth et al., 2023), TOI-1408 (Galazutdinov et al., 2023; Korth et al., 2024), WASP-132 (Hellier et al., 2017; Hord et al., 2022), and WASP-84 (Anderson et al., 2014; Maciejewski et al., 2023). The HJs in these systems all host only inner companions in the Earth- to Neptune-regime, except for WASP-47, which also contains a close outer sub-Neptune companion to the HJ, and a long-period giant planet. An overview of these systems is given in Fig. 1. Other systems worth mentioning are TOI-2000 (Sha et al., 2023), containing a hot Saturn with an inner companion, TOI-5398 (Mantovan et al., 2024), hosting a warm Saturn with an inner sub-Neptune, and WASP-148 (Hébrard et al., 2020), consisting of a hot Saturn and a non-transiting misaligned outer Saturn, near a 4:1 mean-motion resonance (MMR). Furthermore, a recent study by Wu et al. (2023) finds that at least 12\%\pm 6\% of hot Jupiters should have close-by companions, according to their analysis of the full Kepler data set. This indicates that there should be more of these hitherto rare systems within the sample of known hot Jupiter systems. Theories for the origins of hot Jupiters include in situ formation, disk migration and high-eccentricity tidal migration (for a review see e.g. Dawson & Johnson 2018). As found by Rice et al. (2022), the distributions of obliquities and eccentricities that have been observed, are consistent with high-eccentricity migration and tidal damping, and do not strictly require in situ formation or disk migration. Due to strong tidal interactions with their host star, misalignments and eccentricities can be damped relatively quickly, effectively erasing the imprints of formation and migration. However, this only applies to hot Jupiters orbiting cool stars, since tidal interactions are less efficient for hot host stars, as has been observed by Albrecht et al. (2021). A recent review on stellar obliquities is given by Albrecht et al. (2022). Violent migration scenarios, like planet-planet scattering, make it hard to explain close planetary companions to hot Jupiters. A study on in situ formation using N-body simulations, focussed on hot Jupiters with companion super-Earths, found that they can produce such systems, obtaining similar occurrence rates for hot Jupiters with inner companions, but according to their simulations, hot Jupiters should not be detected as single transiting planets as often. A fraction of their simulations also led to two close-in gas giants (Poon et al., 2021). Close-by planetary companions, especially when in resonance, can induce strong transit timing variations (TTVs) on one another, see e.g. Nascimbeni et al. (2023) for a dynamical modeling of the WASP-47 system, making use of high-precision CHEOPS photometry. A few other prominent examples of the effect of TTVs are the Kepler-9 system (Holman et al., 2010), Kepler-80 (MacDonald et al., 2016), TRAPPIST-1 (Gillon et al., 2017; Grimm et al., 2018), and TOI-178 (Leleu et al., 2021). Examining TTVs has the potential to deliver more information about the observed system, like constraining planetary masses or orbital periods of non-transiting companions (Lithwick et al., 2012; Wu & Lithwick, 2013; Hadden & Lithwick, 2014, 2017). Tidal orbital decay is caused by gravitational interactions of a planet with its host star. These interactions raise a bulge on the surface of the star, which can lead to the transfer of angular momentum between the two bodies. Orbital decay only happens if the star is rotating more slowly than the planet is orbiting around the star in the case of spin-orbit alignment because the tidal bulge will be dragged behind the moving sub-planetary point on the stellar surface. Consequently, the planetary orbit shrinks, while the star spins up (Counselman, 1973; Rasio et al., 1996). There is always an offset between the position of the stellar bulge and the sub-planetary point due to the viscosity of the plasma, except if the orbital period of the planet and the rotation of the star are synchronised (see e.g. Hut 1981). Even outward migration of the planet is possible, if the star is rotating faster than the planet is orbiting. A measure of the efficiency of the dissipation of orbital kinetic energy due to friction within the star, in the case of tidal orbital decay, is given by the modified stellar tidal quality factor Q^{\prime}_{\star} (Goldreich & Soter, 1966). Theory suggests values ranging from 105 to 109 for stars, with smaller values indicating a higher dissipation efficiency (see e.g., Meibom & Mathieu 2005; Jackson et al. 2008; Ogilvie & Lin 2007; Penev & Sasselov 2011; Husnoo et al. 2012; Penev et al. 2012; Ogilvie 2014; Collier Cameron & Jardine 2018). Penev et al. (2018) treated Q^{\prime}_{\star} as being dependent on the tidal forcing period rather than being a constant for different stellar types, and found Q^{\prime}_{\star} in the range from 10^{5} to 10^{7} for orbital periods between 0.5 days and 2 days. Measurements of Q^{\prime}_{\star} from WASP-12 b and Kepler-1658 b give values of Q^{\prime}_{\star}=1.8\times 10^{5} (Yee et al., 2020) and Q^{\prime}_{\star}=2.5\times 10^{4} (Vissapragada et al., 2022), respectively, where the host star of the latter is a subgiant. Additionally, several lower limits for Q^{\prime}_{\star} were established in systems where tidal orbital decay could not be confirmed yet (see e.g., Maciejewski et al. 2020; Patra et al. 2020; Barros et al. 2022; Grunblatt et al. 2022; Ivshina & Winn 2022; Rosário et al. 2022; Harre et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2024). TOI-2109 is a fast-rotating (v\sin i=(81.2\pm 1.6) km s-1) F-type star, with a mass of M_{\star}=1.447^{+0.075}_{-0.078}\,M_{\odot} and a radius of R_{\star}=1.698^{+0.062}_{0.057} (Wong et al., 2021). It hosts an ultra-hot Jupiter, TOI-2109 b, in a tight P=0.672\,d orbit, making it the shortest orbital period hot Jupiter orbiting a Sun-like star, with a separation of less than 2.3 stellar radii from the center of its star (Wong et al., 2021). Its predicted orbital decay rate is one of the highest amongst all hot Jupiters (see Fig. 14 of Wong et al. 2021), hence making this planet a very interesting target for orbital decay studies. However, the fast rotation of the stellar host impacts the expected magnitude of the orbital decay signature due to the small difference of rotation period and orbital period, which, in combination with the shallower convective zones of these stars, might lead to less efficient tidal interactions (see e.g. Boué & Efroimsky 2019; Harre et al. 2023). Its equilibrium temperature is the second highest of all known exoplanets with T_{\mathrm{eq}}=3646\pm 88\,K, being slightly cooler than KELT-9 b with T_{\mathrm{eq}}=3921^{+182}_{-174} (Gaudi et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2022). Contrary to many other hot Jupiters orbiting hot stars, TOI-2109 b is aligned (\lambda=1.7^{\circ}\pm 1.7^{\circ}). Yet, the stellar effective temperature is not far off the Kraft break (Kraft, 1967) at T_{\mathrm{eff}}=6530^{+130}_{-120}\,K. Figure 1: Overview of hot Jupiters (red) with close-by companions (black), including TOI-2109 b. Sizes given to scale. We note that the WASP-47 system also contains a long-period companion that is not shown here. System parameters taken from Cañas et al. (2019); Wong et al. (2021); Hord et al. (2022); Korth et al. (2023); Maciejewski et al. (2023); Nascimbeni et al. (2023). CHEOPS (CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite) is an S-class mission of the European Space Agency (ESA), dedicated for photometric follow-up of transiting planets of bright stars (Benz et al., 2021). With its defocused 32 cm telescope, it delivers high-precision photometry, which is able to precisely constrain planetary radii (e.g. Benz et al. 2021; Deline et al. 2022). We observed TOI-2109 under the “Tidal decay (ID 0012)” and the “TIDES (ID 0063)” programmes, the first of which is dedicated to observing hot Jupiters for measurements of tidal orbital decay as part of the Guaranteed Time Observing (GTO) programme of CHEOPS (Barros et al., 2022), with the latter being part of the first extension of the CHEOPS mission. CHEOPS’ performance and its potential for the characterisation of ultra-hot Jupiters have been demonstrated in (Lendl et al., 2020). In this paper, we present new transit and phase curve observation of TOI-2109 b, taken with the CHEOPS space telescope, and analyse the apparent transit timing variations. In Sect. 2, we describe the observations that were used consecutively in our light curve analysis (Sect. 3), orbital decay analysis (Sect. 4), and TTV analysis (Sect. 5). The conclusions are presented in Sect. 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07788v1,Librations and obliquity of the largest moons of Uranus,"Following the discovery of several ocean worlds in the solar system, and the selection of Uranus as the highest priority objective by the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032, the five largest moons of Uranus (Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon) have been receiving renewed attention as they may also harbor a subsurface ocean. We assess how rotation measurements could help confirm the internal differentiation of the bodies and detect internal oceans if any. Because of the time-varying gravitational torque of Uranus on the flattened shape of its synchronous satellites, the latter librate with respect to their mean rotation and precess with a non zero obliquity. For a range of interior models with a rocky core surrounded by a hydrosphere, either solid or divided into an outer ice shell with a liquid ocean underneath, we compute their diurnal libration amplitude and obliquity. We find that if the Uranian satellites were two-layer solid bodies, libration measurement accuracies from around 0.25 m for Oberon to around 6 m for Miranda would rule out the possibility of homogeneous interiors. In combination with independent estimates of the mean moment of inertia (MOI), libration measurements could also be used to detect the presence of an ocean, the measurement precision required for this depending on the actual value of the libration amplitude. To compute the obliquity, we first build series for the orbital precession of all five satellites with a secular perturbations model. With the exception of Miranda, we show that due to the mutual gravitational interactions between the satellites, the obliquity of the large Uranian moons exhibits relatively large periodic variations around the mean value. We find that an obliquity measurement accuracy from around 1 m for Ariel to around 400 m for Oberon can rule out the homogeneous case. The presence of an internal global ocean could allow a resonant amplification of the obliquity, facilitating its detection. If no such resonance occurs, the obliquity would be almost indistinguishable from that expected for a solid body. The effect of tidal deformations on the rotation of the small to medium-sized Uranian moons is showed to be limited. Librations would be reduced by up to 10\% and obliquity increased by up to 15\% for Titania and Oberon, the effects being negligible for Miranda.","Named after characters of the English literature, Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon are the five largest moons of Uranus. They are small or medium-sized icy satellites about which we still have almost everything to learn. Discovered by William Herschel (Titania and Oberon, 1787), William Lassell (Ariel and Umbriel, 1851), and Gerard Kuiper (Miranda, 1948), they have only been visited by one space mission, during the flyby of Uranus by Voyager 2 in 1986. The last few decades have shown that water can exist in liquid state in the outer Solar System, beneath the surface of icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn (Nimmo and Pappalardo, 2016). The Galileo mission extensively studied the satellite system of Jupiter, discovering induced magnetic fields in the vicinity of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, indicating the existence of subsurface oceans (Khurana et al., 1998; Kivelson et al., 2002). Magnetic induction is just one of the multiple techniques for detecting these oceans. Observing the surface can be evocative, as in the case of Europa and its ‘icebergs’ (Carr et al., 1998). More recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the low-amplitude oscillations of auroral ovals on Ganymede indicate the presence of an underground ocean beneath a thick layer of ice (Saur et al., 2015). The Cassini mission has extended the range of techniques used to detect the subsurface oceans of icy satellites. The small Enceladus showed extraordinary activity at its anomalously warm south pole, with plumes of water vapor and ice particles interpreted as evidence of liquid water beneath the surface, in contact with an underlying rocky core (Porco et al., 2006; Spencer et al., 2006, 2009; Postberg et al., 2011). The shape, gravity field, and diurnal librations of Enceladus are consistent with a global water reservoir beneath an ice shell around 20 or 30 km thick (Park et al. (2024) and references therein). The gravity and shape of Dione can also be explained in terms of an ice shell overlying a global water ocean (Beuthe et al., 2016; Zannoni et al., 2020). The observed obliquity of Titan is about three times larger than expected for an entirely solid and rigid Titan (Baland et al. (2019) and references therein). The significant diurnal tidal deformations experienced by the satellite also testify to the presence of a global ocean inside Titan (Iess et al., 2012; Durante et al., 2019; Goossens et al., 2024), whereas a thick ice shell over a global ocean explains the electric field measurements by the Huygens probe (Béghin et al., 2012). The latest to join the club of icy satellites with an ocean may be the highly cratered Mimas. Its libration may be compatible with the presence of a liquid layer at depth (Tajeddine et al., 2014) and the evolution of its orbit suggests the presence of a very young ocean at a depth of 20-30 km below the surface (Lainey et al., 2024). Voyager, Galileo, and Cassini-Huygens were Flagship-class missions. Neptune, Uranus and their moons are still awaiting ambitious exploration missions. The Uranus Orbiter and Probe (UOP) has been prioritized as the next Flagship-class mission by the 2023-2033 Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2023). Among other things, the mission, during its 4-year tour, would aim to address important questions regarding the five largest Moons. What are their rock-to-ice mass ratios and internal structures? Which moons have internal oceans? The answers to these questions will also help constraining their formation and evolution. In this paper, we aim to define ranges for the rotational observables (libration and obliquity) of Uranus’s largest satellites that could be estimated, among other techniques, by landmark tracking from images obtained with the Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras (NAC and WAC) that will be part of the future UOP spacecraft’s payload. Optical data could be used jointly with the radiometric data from the radioscience experiment aboard the spacecraft to infer the satellites’ interior (Filice et al., 2024). Although not considered in this study, magnetic induction has also been proposed for investigating subsurface oceans within the largest moons of Uranus, e.g. Cochrane et al. (2021). The paper is organized as follows. In the Section 2, based on existing literature, we define a range of three-layer interiors (shell, ocean and core) for each satellite, assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. The interiors are constrained by the mass and radius and are characterized by the total mean moment of inertia (MOI) and degree-2 gravity coefficients, as well as by the density, dimension and flattenings of each layer. Previous studies did not explore the influence of a difference in density between the ocean and the ice shell. We briefly discuss how this might affect the interpretation of an estimated MOI and gravity coefficients in terms of hydrosphere thickness and/or global differentiation. In Section 3, we compute the amplitude of diurnal libration and the obliquity of the solid layers (shell and core) of the three-layer interiors defined in Section 2, assuming that the satellites are locked in a Cassini state. We discuss the precision required on rotational measurements so that these measurements can be interpreted in terms of interior properties and/or global differentiation. Concluding remarks are presented in Section 4, including a discussion about the similarities and differences between our libration results and the recent study by Hemingway and Nimmo (2024)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07738v1,Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Exoplanet Atmospheres: A Detectability Study,"In this paper, we explore the detectability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under diverse planetary conditions, aiming to identify promising targets for future observations of planetary atmospheres. Our primary goal is to determine the minimum detectable mass fractions of PAHs on each studied planet. We integrate the one-dimensional self consistent model petitCODE with petitRADTRANS, a radiative transfer model, to simulate the transmission spectra of these planets. Subsequently, we employ the PandExo noise simulator using the NIRSpec PRISM instrument aboard the JWST to assess the observability. Then, we conduct a Bayesian analysis through the MULTINEST code. Our findings illustrate that variations in C/O ratios and planet temperatures significantly influence the transmission spectra and the detectability of PAHs. Our results show that planets with [Fe/H]=0 and 1, C/O=0.55, and temperatures around 1200 K are the most promising for detecting PAHs, with detectable mass fractions as low as 10-7, or one thousandth of the ISM abundance level. For colder planets with lower metallicities and C/O ratios, as well as hotter planets with carbon-rich atmospheres, PAHs can be detected at abundances around 10-6. These results aid our strategy for selecting targets to study PAHs in the atmospheres of exoplanets.","Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are complex organic molecules predominantly found in star-forming regions, interstellar clouds, and around aging stars. These molecules are primarily composed of interconnected benzene rings. Exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light from nearby stars, PAHs become excited and release energy by emitting infrared light at wavelengths that are characteristic of their molecular structure (Léger et al., 1993; Allamandola et al., 1985). Their distinctive infrared features have been identified across a broad spectrum of astronomical environments, including planetary nebulae, protoplanetary nebulae, reflection nebulae, HII regions, circumstellar envelopes, and external galaxies, marking them as significant constituents within these systems (Hollenbach & Tielens, 1999). Photoelectric emission from PAHs is very efficient process to convert infrared radiation into gas heating and may have a substantial impact on atmospheric loss rates (Gorti et al., 2009; Mitani et al., 2020). These processes are critical in the thermochemical dynamics of gas atmospheres within newborn exoplanets and protoplanetary discs (Gorti et al., 2009; Ercolano et al., 2022). In addition, theoretical models postulate a crucial role for PAHs in the synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides, which are the fundamental building blocks of proteins and RNA, respectively (Bernstein et al., 2002; Ehrenfreund et al., 2006a, b; Rapacioli, M. et al., 2006; Ehrenfreund & Charnley, 2000; Wakelam & Herbst, 2008; Galliano et al., 2008). This synthesis underscores the potential association between PAHs and prebiotic chemistry, suggesting their involvement in biogenesis. Giese et al. (2022) found that PAHs did not react with ammonia or ammonia salts at temperatures up to 150°C. Yet, they noted that PAHs could undergo pyrolysis at higher temperatures or be activated using Fenton’s reagent, leading to the creation of functionalized aromatic compounds. PAHs have also been detected in our solar system, for example, in the nitrogen-rich atmosphere of Saturn’s moon Titan (López-Puertas et al., 2013; Dinelli et al., 2013). This suggests that PAHs might be present in the atmospheres of exoplanets as well. However, detecting these molecules in exoplanetary atmospheres has posed a considerable challenge due to technological limitations. The deployment of space-based observatories such as the James Webb Space Telescope111https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-spectrograph(JWST)(Gasman et al., 2022a; Beichman et al., 2014) and upcoming missions such as Twinkle222https://bssl.space/twinkle/(Edwards et al., 2019; Stotesbury et al., 2022) and Ariel333https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/ariel(Pascale et al., 2018; Tinetti et al., 2021), along with ground-based telescopes like the Extremely Large Telescope444https://elt.eso.org(ELT) (Houllé, M. et al., 2021), represents a significant improvement in our observational capabilities. Dubey et al. 2023 investigated ex-situ PAH formation in the thermalized atmospheres of irradiated hot-Jupiters around Sun-like stars. They concluded that planets with an effective temperature of around 1300 K, higher C/O ratios, and increased metallicity are crucial for facilitate PAH formation under thermalized conditions, with C/O exhibiting dominant influence. Building upon these findings, our study explores the detectability of PAHs under various planetary conditions through a detailed parameter space analysis. This analysis aims to identify conditions that are optimal for their detection. Using simulated observations from the Time Exposure Calculator for JWST (PanDExo) (Batalha et al., 2017) and petitRADTRANS (pRT) code (Mollière et al., 2019, 2020; Alei et al., 2022). Additionally, Bayesian Inference tools such as MultiNest (Feroz & Hobson, 2008; Feroz et al., 2009, 2019) and its Python interface called PyMultinest (Buchner et al., 2014) aid in refining our understanding of atmospheric composition and its implications for the habitability of exoplanets. The paper is organized into three sections: Section 2 details our approach to simulating JWST observations and the analytical process for data interpretation. Section 3 presents our findings on PAH detection and abundance in exoplanetary atmospheres, discusses the significance of these findings for exoplanetary science, and suggests directions for future research. Finally, our conclusions are presented in Section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07435v1,The Volatile Composition and Activity Evolution of Main-Belt Comet 358P/PANSTARRS,"We report the detection of water vapor associated with main-belt comet 358P/PANSTARRS on UT 2024 January 8-9 using the NIRSPEC instrument aboard JWST. We derive a water production rate of Q_{\rm H_{2}O}=(5.0\pm 0.2)\times 10^{25} molecules s-1, marking only the second direct detection of sublimation products of any kind from a main-belt comet, after 238P/Read. Similar to 238P, we find a remarkable absence of hypervolatile species, finding Q_{\rm CO_{2}}<7.6\times 10^{22} molecules s-1, corresponding to Q_{\rm CO_{2}}/Q_{\rm H_{2}O}<0.2%. Upper limits on CH3OH and CO emission are also estimated. Photometry from ground-based observations show that the dust coma brightened and faded slowly over \sim 250 days in 2023-2024, consistent with photometric behavior observed in 2012-2013, but also indicate a \sim 2.5\times decline in the dust production rate between these two periods. Dynamical dust modeling shows that the coma’s morphology as imaged by JWST’s NIRCAM instrument on 2023 November 22 can be reproduced by asymmetric dust emission from a nucleus with a mid-range obliquity (\varepsilon\sim 80^{\circ}) with a steady-state mass loss rate of \sim 0.8 kg s-1. Finally, we find similar Af\rho-to-gas ratios of \log_{10}(Af\rho/Q_{\rm H_{2}O})=-24.8\pm 0.2 for 358P and \log_{10}(Af\rho/Q_{\rm H_{2}O})=-24.4\pm 0.2 for 238P, suggesting that Af\rho could serve as an effective proxy for estimating water production rates in other active main-belt comets. The confirmation of water vapor outgassing in both main-belt comets observed by JWST to date reinforces the use of recurrent activity near perihelion as an indicator of sublimation-driven activity in active asteroids.","1.1 Background Active asteroids are small Solar system objects that have asteroid-like orbits (as parameterized by the Tisserand parameter, or T_{J}) but exhibit visible mass loss (Jewitt et al., 2015a; Jewitt & Hsieh, 2022). Meanwhile, main-belt comets (MBCs) are a subset of the active asteroids, encompassing objects whose mass loss is specifically driven by the sublimation of volatile ices (Hsieh & Jewitt, 2006; Snodgrass et al., 2017b). Until very recently, the sublimation-driven nature of MBC activity has been indirectly inferred from dust modeling demonstrating that the morphologies of active MBCs are consistent with sustained dust emission (e.g., Hsieh et al., 2009; Moreno et al., 2011; Licandro et al., 2013; Jewitt et al., 2014), and observations of recurring activity near perihelion with intervening periods of inactivity elsewhere in their orbits (e.g., Hsieh et al., 2004, 2009, 2018c). Both of these results are naturally explained by sublimation as the driver of activity and more difficult to explain as a consequence of other processes like rotational destabilization or impacts without the invocation of specifically contrived circumstances (Hsieh et al., 2012a; Jewitt et al., 2015a). For over 15 years after MBCs were first identified, numerous attempts were made to directly confirm the hypothesized sublimation-driven nature of MBC activity via spectroscopic searches for sublimation products associated with active MBCs (see Snodgrass et al., 2017b). Many of these searches used the largest telescopes in the world — the Very Large Telescope (VLT), the Gemini North and Gemini South observatories, the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), and the Keck I Observatory — to target emission from the CN B~{}^{2}\Sigma^{+}-X~{}^{2}\Sigma^{+} (0,0) band around 388.3 nm (e.g., Jewitt et al., 2009; Hsieh et al., 2012b; Licandro et al., 2011; Snodgrass et al., 2017b), which is commonly found and relatively easily detected in spectra of other comets (e.g., Rauer et al., 2003; A’Hearn et al., 1995). None of these efforts resulted in the direct detection of CN, although they did place upper limits on CN production rates on the order of Q_{\rm CN}\sim 10^{23} – 10^{24} molecules s-1, corresponding to water production rate limits on the order of Q_{\rm H_{2}O}\sim 10^{25} – 10^{27} molecules s-1, assuming similar Q_{\rm CN}/Q_{\rm H_{2}O} abundance ratios as have been found in previously measured comets (A’Hearn et al., 1995). Attempts to directly detect water vapor or the photodissociation products of water from MBCs using the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI) on the Herschel Space Telescope (targeting the 1_{10}-1_{01} ground state rotational line of H2O at 557 GHz; de Val-Borro et al., 2012; O’Rourke et al., 2013) and XSHOOTER on the VLT (targeting ultraviolet OH emission at 308 nm; Snodgrass et al., 2017a) were only able to set similar upper limits on water production rates. Direct evidence of sublimation from a MBC was finally obtained when JWST observations of 238P/Read (semimajor axis of a=3.166 au; eccentricity of e=0.252; inclination of i=1.264^{\circ}; T_{J}=3.153)111Orbit solution from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Small Body Database (SBDB; https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/) derived on 2024 May 30 on UT 2022 September 08 yielded a water vapor production rate of Q_{\rm H_{2}O}=(9.9\pm 1.0)\times 10^{24} molecules s-1, or Q_{\rm H_{2}O}=0.30\pm 0.03 kg s-1 (Kelley et al., 2023), where 238P’s orbital and observational geometric parameters at the time are listed in Table 1. In this paper, we report the second-ever detection by JWST of water vapor from a MBC, as well as results from additional analyses to characterize the contemporaneous production rates of dust and other hypervolatile species.

Optical imaging observations conducted between 2012 October and 2013 February showed photometric behavior that was judged to be qualitatively consistent with the action of a long-lasting dust emission driver such as sublimation (Hsieh et al., 2013b), an interpretation that was corroborated by an independent Monte Carlo dust modeling analysis (Moreno et al., 2013). Interestingly, the work by Moreno et al. (2013) showed that 358P’s morphology was best fit by anistropic dust emission from a mid-range obliquity (\varepsilon\sim 80^{\circ}) object, with preferential dust ejection at high latitudes. They specifically found that the object’s brightness and morphology evolution was most consistent with a model of sustained anisotropic dust emission starting about two months prior to perihelion and ending four months after perihelion, i.e., from about July 2012 when the object was at a true anomaly of \nu\sim 345^{\circ}, to January 2013 when the object was at \nu\sim 35^{\circ}). That analysis found a total ejected dust mass of \sim(8-25)\times 10^{6} kg, corresponding to an average dust production rate of {\dot{m}}\sim(0.5-1.7) kg s-1 (depending on the choice of maximum particle sizes from r_{\rm max}=1 cm to r_{\rm max}=10 cm), peaking around 30-40 days after perihelion. The observational confirmation by Hsieh et al. (2018a) that 358P exhibited recurrent activity near perihelion in 2017 strongly supported the conclusions of Hsieh et al. (2013b) and Moreno et al. (2013) that the activity of this object is driven by sublimation. In those 2017 observations, however, the object was seen to be active at \nu\sim 320^{\circ}, or about three months earlier than the activity onset point for the object estimated by Moreno et al. (2013) for its 2012-2013 active apparition. The inactive nucleus of the object was determined by Hsieh et al. (2023) to have a V-band absolute magnitude of H_{V}=20.2\pm 0.3 mag, corresponding to an effective radius of r_{N}=0.3\pm 0.1 km, assuming a spherical nucleus with an R-band albedo of p_{V}=0.05. Meanwhile, 10 hours of time-series observations with the VLT were inconclusive in terms of constraining a rotation period, though they marginally suggested a possible rotation period of \sim 8 hr (Agarwal & Mommert, 2018). Multiple searches for sublimation products using the methods described in Section 1.1 specifically targeting 358P have been made, all resulting in non-detections. Hsieh et al. (2013b) found an upper limit CN production rate of Q_{\rm CN}=1.5\times 10^{23} molecules s-1 (which was inferred to correspond to a H2O production rate of Q_{\rm H_{2}O}<5\times 10^{25} molecules s-1) from Keck Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer observations, while O’Rourke et al. (2013) found an upper limit H2O production rate of Q_{\rm H_{2}O}=7.63\times 10^{25} molecules s-1 from Herschel observations, and Snodgrass et al. (2017a) found an upper limit OH production rate of Q_{\rm OH}=6\times 10^{25} molecules s-1 (corresponding to an inferred H2O production rate of Q_{\rm H_{2}O}<9\times 10^{25} molecules s-1) from VLT XSHOOTER observations. Dynamical analyses by Hsieh et al. (2013b) indicated that 358P was unlikely to be a recently implanted interloper from the outer Solar system, and in fact, is dynamically linked to the \sim 155 Myr old Lixiaohua asteroid family. Notably, the Lixiaohua family is also associated with another MBC, 313P/Gibbs (Hsieh et al., 2015a, 2018b), where a spectroscopic study of a large sample of Lixiaohua family members led De Prá et al. (2020) to conclude that the available compositional evidence supports the classification of both 313P and 358P as “true” members of this family."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07394v1,The Mega-MUSCLES Treasury Survey: X-ray to infrared Spectral Energy Distributions of a representative sample of M dwarfs,"We present 5–1\times 10^{7} Å spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for twelve M dwarf stars covering spectral types M0–M8. Our SEDs are provided for community use as a sequel to the Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES) survey. The twelve stars include eight known exoplanet hosts and four stars chosen to fill out key parameter space in spectral type and rotation period. The SEDs are constructed from Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopy and XMM Newton, Chandra and/or Swift X-ray observations and completed with various model data, including \mathrm{Lyman}\,\alpha reconstructions, PHOENIX optical models, APEC coronal models and Differential Emission Measure models in the currently-unobservable Extreme Ultraviolet. We provide a complete overview of the Mega-MUSCLES program, including a description of the observations, models, and SED construction. The SEDs are available as MAST High-Level Science Products and we describe the various data products here. We also present ensemble measurements from our sample that are of particular relevance to exoplanet science, including the high-energy fluxes in the habitable zone and the FUV/NUV ratio. Combined with MUSCLES, Mega-MUSCLES provides SEDs covering a wide range of M dwarf spectral types and ages such that suitable proxies for any M dwarf planet host of interest may be found in our sample. However, we find that ultraviolet and X-ray fluxes can vary even between stars with similar parameters, such that observations of each exoplanet host star will remain the gold standard for interpreting exoplanet atmosphere observations.","M dwarf stars, with masses \approx 0.1-0.5 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}, have emerged as the premier targets for exoplanet discovery and characterization over the past two decades (Tarter et al., 2007), particularly for rocky planets with masses and radii comparable to that of Earth in orbits within the habitable zone around the host star. The focus on M dwarfs is partly due to their great abundance, representing over 70 % of stars (Henry et al., 2006), but mostly for observational considerations. The sensitivity of both of the dominant techniques for exoplanet discovery, the transit and radial velocity methods, scale dramatically and favourably with decreased stellar mass, such that planets with similar mass and radius to the Earth are much easier to find around M dwarfs than around larger stars. Additionally, the habitable zones of M dwarfs are much closer in compared to the habitable zones around larger stars due to their lower luminosity, so the orbital periods of planets there are of order days to weeks rather than years, requiring less time-on-target to detect and confirm. Short orbital periods, and a relatively small planet-to-star size ratio, also makes M dwarf planets favourable targets for atmospheric characterisation via transit spectroscopy. The importance of M dwarfs to exoplanet science has been highlighted by some of the most remarkable discoveries, such as the habitable zone planet orbiting Proxima Centauri (Anglada-Escudé et al., 2016) and the seven Earth-sized planets around TRAPPIST-1 (Gillon et al., 2016, 2017). The launch of JWST has enabled an increasing number of atmospheric observations of planets orbiting M dwarfs, ruling out thick atmospheres around several of the most accessible targets (Greene et al., 2023; Zieba et al., 2023; Lincowski et al., 2023; Moran et al., 2023). With the advent of the Rocky Worlds program (Redfield et al., 2024), continued JWST observations of planets around M dwarfs are guaranteed for years to come. When attempting to assess the characteristics and potential habitability of such planets, we must be cautious when comparing them with the Solar system (Rugheimer et al., 2015a; Rugheimer & Kaltenegger, 2018). The differences between M dwarfs and Sun-like stars are many. Their lower temperature means that the spectrum is shifted into the red, and the average M dwarf is much more active than more massive stars, both in terms of flare frequency and maximum flare strength relative to its luminosity (Loyd et al., 2018b; Froning et al., 2019), with the potential effects on their planets exacerbated by the close-in habitable zones (Buccino et al., 2007; Vida et al., 2017). Perhaps the starkest difference between M dwarfs and Sun-like stars are their high energy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Multiple observations have demonstrated that the X-ray fluxes of M dwarfs relative to their bolometric luminosities can be thousands of times higher than for Sun-like stars (Wheatley et al., 2017; Wright et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2023). Conversely, the red-ward shift of the photospheric spectrum results in relative near-ultraviolet flux ratios being lower than Sun-like stars by a similar factor. The X-ray and ultraviolet fluxes are key drivers of exoplanet atmospheric structure and chemistry. Photochemistry in the upper atmospheres of exoplanets (i.e., the layers that we can most readily observe) is governed by the incident ultraviolet spectrum, and in particular the strength of the \mathrm{Lyman}\,\alpha line and the ratio of FUV to NUV fluxes (Segura et al., 2005; Moses et al., 2013; Miguel et al., 2015; JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Team et al., 2023). X-ray and EUV radiation drives atmospheric escape, such that planets in extreme XUV environments may not retain atmospheres at all (Watson et al., 1981; Poppenhaeger et al., 2024; Van Looveren et al., 2024). A number of surveys have been pursued over the last several years to use HST and other facilities to obtain energetic spectra of M dwarf stars. Programs like Living with a Red Dwarf, HAZMAT, MUSCLES, and FUMES, plus observations focused on individual targets of interest, have greatly expanded the sample of M stars with observed ultraviolet spectra (Guinan et al., 2016; Loyd et al., 2021, 2018a; France et al., 2016; Youngblood et al., 2016; Loyd et al., 2016, 2018b; Bourrier et al., 2017; MacGregor et al., 2021; Waalkes et al., 2019; Diamond-Lowe et al., 2022; Pineda et al., 2021a; Feinstein et al., 2022; Rockcliffe et al., 2021). Ideally, a full X-ray through optical SED should be obtained for any M dwarf of interest, but such observations are often impractical for multiple reasons. Whilst the high energy emission from M dwarfs is a higher fraction of the bolometic flux relative to a larger star, it is still intrinsically faint, requiring large investments of limited space telescope observing time for even the closest M dwarfs. Accordingly, the MUSCLES Treasury Survey was conceived to provide complete SEDs for a representative sample of low mass stars, while also providing scaling relations for other surveys with more targets but less wavelength coverage (Youngblood et al., 2017). MUSCLES used HST in combination with X-ray facilities and optical photospheric model atmospheres to obtain 5 Å – 5.5 \mum spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for seven M dwarf and four K dwarf stars. High-level data products were delivered to MAST as a resource for the exoplanet modeling community as well as stellar astrophysicists to provide a uniform ultraviolet survey for the study of M dwarfs that includes reliable measurements of Ly\alpha and resolved stellar emission lines. The MUSCLES SEDs High Level Science Product archive111https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/muscles/ has been used in a number of theoretical studies to model the atmospheric properties of exoplanet atmospheres (Spake et al., 2018; Wunderlich et al., 2020; Kawashima et al., 2019), predict observable atmospheric signatures that can be detected with the JWST (Morley et al., 2017), and investigate the effects of stellar flares on planetary atmospheres and potential life (Miguel et al., 2015; Louca et al., 2023) . The original MUSCLES survey focused on stars with known exoplanets. Given the known nearby systems at the time, largely found by optical radial velocity searches, this resulted in a sample that was biased toward the higher mass end of the M dwarf sequence. Only threee MUSCLES targets, GJ 1214, GJ 1061 and Proxima Centauri, had masses below <0.3 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}. With the launch of JWST, the search for “Earth-like” planets is moving toward the low mass end of the stellar Main Sequence. Surveys including MEarth, TRAPPIST/SPECULOOS, and TESS are finding Earth-sized planets around stars with masses of \sim0.3 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} or below (Berta-Thompson et al., 2015; Dittmann et al., 2017; Winters et al., 2019; Pidhorodetska et al., 2021). It is targets like these, around low mass stars, that will be the subject of atmospheric characterization of rocky planets in the next decade or more (Kempton et al., 2018; Fortenbach & Dressing, 2020; Redfield et al., 2024). It was with this in mind that the Mega-MUSCLES Treasury Survey was conceived as the successor to MUSCLES. Mega-MUSCLES observed thirteen M dwarfs across a range of mass, age, and activity levels (Figure 1), with a particular focus on low mass M stars that are the likely first targets for atmospheric characterization of Earth-like planets. The sample list included observations for six more of the closest low-mass exoplanet host stars; for slow-rotating stars to 0.14 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} (to serve as proxies for future habitable planet hosts); for stars like GJ 1132 but with faster rotation periods (to track XUV evolution with age); for the 2nd (GJ 699 = Barnard’s Star) and 7th (GJ 729) closest star systems; and for the multiple rocky planet system, TRAPPIST-1. The target list included stars with no known exoplanets that filled out the phase space of M dwarf mass and rotation/activity. When combined with the existing observations, the complete Mega-MUSCLES library spans a range of stellar masses (0.14–0.8 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}), high to low X-ray luminosity fraction (an indicator of activity level), and planetary systems ranging from Jupiters to super-Neptunes to super-Earths. In this paper, we present an overview of the Mega-MUSCLES Treasury Survey. Several papers have already been published focusing on individual targets of interest (Froning et al., 2019; France et al., 2020; Wilson et al., 2021), describing the X-ray observations for both MUSCLES and Mega-MUSCLES in detail (Brown et al., 2023), using the observations to probe proxies of stellar coronal and chromospheric behavior (Linsky et al., 2020), and developing optical proxies for high energy emission (Melbourne et al., 2020). This paper will focus on summarizing the survey observing methods, SED generation, and analysis of the data as a population.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07303v1,Peering into the black box: forward-modeling the uncertainty budget of high-resolution spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres,"Ground-based high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS; R\gtrsim 15{,}000) is a powerful complement to space-based studies of exoplanet atmospheres. By resolving individual spectral lines, HRCCS can precisely measure chemical abundance ratios, directly constrain atmospheric dynamics, and robustly probe multidimensional physics. But the subtleties of HRCCS datasets—e.g., the lack of exoplanetary spectra visible by eye and the statistically complex process of telluric removal—can make interpreting them difficult. In this work, we seek to clarify the uncertainty budget of HRCCS with a forward-modeling approach. We present a HRCCS observation simulator, scope,111https://github.com/arjunsavel/scope that incorporates spectral contributions from the exoplanet, star, tellurics, and instrument. This tool allows us to control the underlying dataset, enabling controlled experimentation with complex HRCCS methods. Simulating a fiducial hot Jupiter dataset (WASP-77Ab emission with IGRINS), we first confirm via multiple tests that the commonly used principal components analysis does not bias the planetary signal when few components are used. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mildly varying tellurics and moderate wavelength solution errors induce only mild decreases in HRCCS detection significance. However, limiting-case, strongly varying tellurics can bias the retrieved velocities and gas abundances. Additionally, in the low-SNR limit, constraints on gas abundances become highly non-Gaussian. Our investigation of the uncertainties and potential biases inherent in HRCCS data analysis enables greater confidence in scientific results from this maturing method.","Exoplanet atmospheres offer insight into extreme regimes. When studying the atmospheres accessible with current instruments, we must confront the fundamental properties of gas in high-temperature, low-pressure environments (Showman & Guillot, 2002). Doing so pushes our understanding of atmospheric dynamics, microphysical processes, and gas-phase chemistry into new territory (e.g., Mbarek & Kempton, 2016; Powell et al., 2018; Tan & Komacek, 2019; Beltz et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2021). In the past decade, ground-based high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS; R\gtrsim 15,000; Birkby, 2018) has carved out a compelling niche as a probe of exoplanet atmospheres. This technique is unique in its ability to directly constrain exoplanetary winds (e.g., Snellen et al., 2010; Kempton & Rauscher, 2012; Showman et al., 2013), and by resolving tens of thousands of individual spectral lines, it has enabled precise constraints on chemical composition (e.g., Line et al., 2021; Gandhi et al., 2022; Maguire et al., 2022; Boucher et al., 2023). With clear evidence of three-dimensional physics and chemistry (Flowers et al., 2019; Beltz et al., 2020; Ehrenreich et al., 2020; Wardenier et al., 2021; Savel et al., 2021; Gandhi et al., 2022; Beltz et al., 2023; Nortmann et al., 2024) and the potential to unveil dozens of chemical species in the optical and near-infrared (e.g., Carleo et al., 2022; Kesseli et al., 2022; Prinoth et al., 2022), HRCCS datasets promise a strong complement to their lower-resolution counterparts, one that will endure even in the era of JWST atmospheric studies (Gardner et al., 2006; Greene et al., 2016; Brogi & Line, 2019). Complicating the high scientific potential of HRCCS are the subtleties in its analysis. Unlike in low-resolution studies, exoplanet spectra in general are not detected in each observed spectral channel with HRCCS, but are rather buried in the noise and not visible “by eye.” Therefore, the presence of the planetary signal in HRCCS must be inferred from cross-correlation functions (e.g., Snellen et al., 2010). This feature of HRCCS is accompanied by “black box”-like data processing. While the steps to this analysis are fundamentally deterministic and can be understood with forward modeling, the complexity of the underlying physical processes (namely tellurics) in turn requires complex statistical treatments. Further complicating matters is the axis of researcher choice. Previous studies have sought to shed light on the impact of these processing steps, comprehensively exploring the sensitivity of HRCCS results to analysis choices (de Kok et al., 2013; Cabot et al., 2019; Langeveld et al., 2021; Gully-Santiago & Morley, 2022; Meech et al., 2022; Brogi et al., 2023; Cheverall et al., 2023). Furthermore, studies often “inject” additional signal into data to check the responsivity of their dataset to true signal (e.g,. Gibson et al., 2022). Even so, it is difficult to exactly isolate in which circumstances the data, the analysis techniques, or some combination drives the behavior of the results. Taken together, these aspects have produced an opaque uncertainty budget for HRCCS. In this work, we seek to provide intuition for the less intuitive aspects of HRCCS data processing and analysis to better understand the HRCCS uncertainty budget. We do so with a forward-modeling approach, simulating HRCCS emission spectroscopy datasets and analyzing them as one would analyze real data. Our focus is threefold: on variable tellurics and their removal, on wavelength solution stability, and on the level of photon noise. All of these uncertainty sources are unexplored in HRCCS from the modeling perspective, and they are hypothesized to explain outstanding questions in HRCCS (e.g., the sub-unity scaling of the planetary spectrum found by van Sluijs et al., 2022). For this work, our model aims to mimic the HRCCS dataset of WASP-77Ab from Line et al. (2021) observed with the IGRINS spectrograph (Yuk et al., 2010; Park et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2017; Mace et al., 2018). We focus on this dataset because of its high quality, the availability of many telluric standard stars at this observatory, and the validation of this dataset’s analysis by recent JWST results (August et al., 2023). Though our work focuses on simulating emission spectra, our results have direct implications for transmission spectroscopy studies as well, and we will comment on them in detail. Section 2 describes the methods of this work, including our HRCCS data simulation pipeline—which we name scope—and our reduction of computational burden. Section 3 contains the results of our forward-modeling experiments. Section 4 discusses our results, including a list of known caveats. Finally, we conclude this work in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07377v1,Chemical Fingerprints of M Dwarfs: High-Resolution Spectroscopy on 31 M Dwarfs with SPIRou,"We extend the methodology introduced by Jahandar et al. (2024) to determine the effective temperature and chemical abundances of 31 slowly-rotating solar neighborhood M dwarfs (M1-M5) using high-resolution spectra from CFHT/SPIRou. This group includes 10 M dwarfs in binary systems with FGK primaries of known metallicity from optical measurements. By testing our T_{\rm eff} method on various synthetic models, we find a consistent inherent synthetic uncertainty of \sim10 K at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 100. Additionally, we find that our results align with interferometric measurements, showing a consistent residual of -29 \pm 31 K. Taking the inherent uncertainties into account, we infer the T_{\rm eff} values of our targets and find an excellent agreement with previous optical and NIR studies. Our high-resolution chemical analysis examines hundreds of absorption lines using \chi^{2} minimization using PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. We present elemental abundances for up to 10 different elements, including refractory elements such as Si, Mg, and Fe, which are important for modelling the interior structure of exoplanets. In binary systems, we find an average [Fe/H] of -0.15 \pm 0.08 for M dwarfs, marginally lower than the reported metallicity of -0.06 \pm 0.18 for the FGK primaries from Mann et al. (2013a). We also observe slightly sub-solar chemistry for various elements in our non-binary M dwarfs, most notably for O, C, and K abundances. In particular, we find an average metallicity of -0.11 \pm 0.16 lower but still consistent with the typical solar metallicity of FGK stars (e.g. [Fe/H] = 0.04 \pm 0.20 from Brewer et al. 2016). This study highlights significant discrepancies in various major M dwarf surveys likely related to differences in the methodologies employed.","M dwarfs, the most populous stellar type in our galaxy, play a pivotal role in astrophysical studies (Henry et al. 1994; Winters et al. 2019; Reylé et al. 2021). Their prevalence and unique properties have made them subjects of intense research in various fields, from galaxy evolution to exoplanet interior modeling. Moreover, M dwarfs are known to host exoplanets (e.g., Bonfils et al. 2013; Dressing & Charbonneau 2015; Mulders et al. 2015; Gaidos et al. 2016; Cloutier & Menou 2020; Hsu et al. 2020), making them vital in the study of different star systems and the search for potentially habitable planets. Accurate measurement of the chemical composition of M dwarfs is necessary to assess the habitability of planets orbiting them. Various studies have found a direct correlation between the metallicity of host stars and their exoplanets (Santos et al. 2004; Fischer & Valenti 2005; Bond et al. 2006; Guillot et al. 2006; Mulders et al. 2015). The importance of metallicity extends to the efficiency of giant planet formation, particularly for FGK dwarfs. FGK stars typically possess higher disk masses than M dwarfs, enabling them to form giant planets even with low metallicities. In contrast, M dwarfs require high metallicity to compensate for their lower disk masses to form giant planets (Neves et al. 2013). Furthermore, the chemical composition of a host star has implications for the composition of its planets (Gilli et al. 2006; Adibekyan et al. 2021). For instance, the relative abundances of refractory elements like Mg, Si, and Fe influence the chemical composition of the protoplanetary disk, more specifically the core-to-mantle mass ratio of rocky exoplanets (Brewer & Fischer 2016). A common method for characterizing M dwarf properties is high-resolution spectroscopy (Souto et al. 2017; Rajpurohit et al. 2018; Passegger et al. 2019; Marfil et al. 2021; Cristofari et al. 2022; Jahandar et al. 2024). However, the spectroscopic analysis of M dwarfs presents several challenges. In contrast to more massive stars like FGK dwarfs, whose spectra are typically dominated by atomic lines, the cooler temperatures of M dwarfs result in dense molecular bands. These bands, such as TiO, VO, and CaH, can overlap and obscure the atomic lines crucial for chemical analysis in the optical regime. In the near-infrared (NIR) regime, additional challenges arise with extensive bands from water vapor, OH bands and hydrides like FeH complicating the identification of atomic lines. The presence of multi-metal molecules like CO and CN adds to this complexity, especially when disentangling each atom’s individual contributions to the overall spectral signature. Nevertheless, as the flux of M dwarfs is predominantly in the NIR band, this wavelength regime has become a common focus for chemical spectroscopy on M dwarfs. M dwarfs in binary systems, particularly when paired with FGK primary stars, present a unique opportunity to better understand their chemical evolution. These binary systems are particularly attractive because they are believed to have formed together from the same molecular cloud, thus sharing similar initial chemical abundances. Due to their higher effective temperature (T_{\rm eff}), FGK stars are significantly easier to characterize than M dwarfs chemically. Therefore, if they share similar chemistry with their M dwarf companions, it provides a unique opportunity to calibrate spectroscopic methods, which are often subjected to various uncertainties and systematic effects (Blanco-Cuaresma 2019; Olander et al. 2021; Jahandar et al. 2024). In our previous work (Jahandar et al., 2024), we tackled the challenge of minimizing the impact of several caveats observed in synthetic NIR high-resolution atmosphere models used for stellar characterization of M dwarfs. Our mitigating strategies include a line selection and identifying flaws in these models, such as continuum mismatch, line shift and unresolved contamination. Recognizing and addressing these factors is crucial, as neglecting them can result in inaccurate estimates of a star’s fundamental characteristics such as its T_{\rm eff} and metallicity. Building upon the methodologies and insights established in Jahandar et al. (2024), this paper presents the chemical spectroscopy of 31 M dwarfs observed by the SPIRou instrument. This includes a high-resolution spectral analysis of hundreds of absorption lines and molecular bands in their spectra and the determination of the T_{\rm eff} and chemical abundances of 10 different elements. The paper is structured as follows. We describe the observations with SPIRou in Section 2. In Section 3, we outline our approach for determining T_{\rm eff} and the chemical abundances of our M dwarfs, presenting a fine-tuned line list of those spectral features commonly observed in different stars. In Section 4, we report the chemical abundances of up to 10 different elements for all our M dwarfs and compare them with previously reported values. Moreover, we discuss discrepancies in the molar ratio of refractory elements between this work and others. This analysis is followed by concluding remarks in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07227v1,The emergence of the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation in the MHD wind scenario,"Context. There is still much uncertainty around the mechanism that rules the accretion of proto-planetary disks. In the last years, Magnetohydrondynamic (MHD) wind-driven accretion has been proposed as a valid alternative to the more conventional viscous accretion. In particular, winds have been shown to reproduce the observed correlation between the mass of the disk M_{D} and the mass accretion rate onto the central star \dot{M}_{*}, but this has been done only for specific conditions. It is not clear whether this implies fine tuning or if it is a general result.Aims. We investigate under which conditions the observed correlation between the mass of the disk M_{D} and the mass accretion rate onto the central star \dot{M}_{*} can be obtained.Methods. We present mainly analytical calculations, supported by Monte-Carlo simulations. We also perform a comparison with the observed data to test our predictions.Results. We find that, in the absence of a correlation between the initial mass M_{0} and the initial accretion timescale t_{\mathrm{acc,0}}, the slope of the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation depends on the value of the spread of the initial conditions of masses and lifetimes of disks. Then, we clarify the conditions under which a disk population can be fitted with a single power-law. Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for the spread of \log\bigl{(}M_{D}/\dot{M}_{*}\bigr{)} valid when the spread of t_{\mathrm{acc}} is taken to be constant. In the presence of a correlation between M_{0} and t_{\mathrm{acc,0}}, we derive an analytical expression for the slope of the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation in the initial conditions of disks and at late times. In this new scenario, we clarify under which conditions the disk population can be fitted by a single power-law, and we provide empirical constraints on the parameters ruling the evolution of disks in our models.Conclusions. We conclude that MHD winds can predict the observed values of the slope and the spread of the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation under a broad range of initial conditions. This is a fundamental expansion of previous works on the MHD paradigm, exploring the establishment of this fundamental correlation beyond specific initial conditions.","Proto-planetary disks are the birth environment of planets. In the last decades, significant progress has been made in the field of sub-mm radio-astronomy, in particular thanks to the development of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observatory. Thanks to a transformational improvement in the capabilities of the new generation of telescopes, we now know that disks are sub-structured, showing gaps, spirals, kinks, and many more features (e.g., Andrews 2020). In addition to high resolution observations, the study of disk demographics also advanced significantly. In the last years, it was possible to collect global disk properties such as sub-mm fluxes (e.g., Mann et al. 2014, Ansdell et al. 2016, Barenfeld et al. 2016, Pascucci et al. 2016, Ansdell et al. 2017, Cox et al. 2017, Eisner et al. 2018, Cazzoletti et al. 2019, Cieza et al. 2019, Ansdell 2020), disk radii (e.g., Barenfeld et al. 2017, Ansdell et al. 2018, Sanchis et al. 2021), and mass accretion rates onto the central stars (e.g., Manara et al. 2015, Manara et al. 2017, Alcalá et al. 2017, Manara et al. 2020). This astonishing amount of new data allowed to start investigating the statistical distributions of disk properties, which make it possible to constrain evolutionary models (e.g., Manara et al. 2023 for a review). However, despite all the progress that has been made, we are still far from a paradigm that can completely describe the formation and evolution of disks (e.g., Morbidelli & Raymond 2016). Understanding how proto-planetary disks accrete material onto the central star and evolve is of cardinal importance for getting a standard model of planet formation and evolution. Two main physical scenarios have been proposed to explain accretion onto the central star: ”viscous” accretion (e.g., Shakura & Sunyaev 1973, Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974), which redistributes the angular momentum within the disk (e.g., Pringle 1981, Frank et al. 2002), and ”Magnetohydrodynamic wind-driven” (MHD wind-driven) accretion, where a vertical magnetic field launches a wind that extracts angular momentum from the disk (e.g., Blandford & Payne 1982, Ferreira 1997, Lesur 2021). Despite all the work put in developing these paradigms, there is still significant uncertainty on which is the best candidate in describing the evolution of proto-planetary disks, as their key predictions (e.g., the different time evolution of disk radii) are difficult to observe on a statistically-significant sample of observations. In this context, observations have found a correlation between the mass of the proto-planetary disk and the mass accretion rate onto the central star (e.g., Manara et al. 2016; from now on, the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation). In the viscous paradigm, the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation naturally arises with a slope close to unity, in agreement with observations (e.g., Lodato et al. 2017, Rosotti et al. 2017); on the other hand, it is still not clear which conditions can produce it in the MHD scenario. In particular, it is uncertain whether it would be a general feature of wind-driven populations, or specific initial conditions would be needed. Recently, 1D disk evolution models have been proposed to describe the effect of MHD disk-winds on the long term evolution of disks (Suzuki et al. 2016, Bai 2016, Tabone et al. 2022a). In particular, Tabone et al. (2022a) developed analytical solutions of global disk quantities (i.e., the surface density, the characteristic disk radius, the mass of the disk, and the mass accretion rate) for the MHD wind-driven scenario, and offered some insights about retrieving the correlation. In Tabone et al. (2022b), they showed that for a particular set of initial parameters, the MHD model can reproduce the observed correlation in the Lupus region, the spread around this trend, and the decline of the disk fraction. In particular, they qualitatively show that a linear relationship can be obtained assuming no correlation between disk mass and accretion timescale t_{\mathrm{acc},0}. Starting from the solutions of Tabone et al. (2022a), in this work we conduct an extensive analysis to discuss the universality of this result and whether it implies fine tuning. The scope of the present work is to go beyond the work of Tabone et al. (2022a) to quantify under which initial conditions it is possible to reproduce the observed M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation. In Sect. 2, we show the condition under which it is possible to observe the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation under the assumption that the initial accretion timescale t_{\mathrm{acc},0}111From Tabone et al. (2022a): the initial accretion time-scale is a generalization of the viscous time scale and corresponds to the time that would be required to accrete a fluid particle located initially at r_{c}(t=0)/2 to the inner region of the disk with an accretion velocity equal to its initial value. is not correlated with M_{0}. After that, we analytically derive the slope of the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation and its spread as function of the spread of the disk age t and t_{\mathrm{acc},0}. In Sect. 3, we relax the assumption of no correlation between M_{0} and t_{\mathrm{acc},0}: we introduce a correlation in the form M_{0}\propto t_{\mathrm{acc},0}^{\phi}, and we analytically derive the slope of the M_{D}-\dot{M}_{*} correlation in the initial lifetime conditions of the disks and at late times. Then, by adding a spread in M_{0}, we show that we can retrieve the observed value of the slope under a broad range of conditions. In Sect. 4, we show that the spread derived in Sect. 2 agrees with the observed spread of \log\bigl{(}M_{D}/\dot{M}_{*}\bigr{)}. Finally, we present and investigate the \phi-\sigma_{M_{0}} degeneracy. In Sect. 5 we summarize our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07026v1,Stellar occultations by Trans-Neptunian Objects,"Stellar occultations provide a powerful tool to explore objects of the outer solar system. The Gaia mission now provides milli-arcsec accuracy on the predictions of these events and makes possible observations that were previously unthinkable. Occultations return kilometric accuracies on the three-dimensional shape of bodies irrespective of their geocentric distances, with the potential of detecting topographic features along the limb. From the shape, accurate values of albedo can be derived, and if the mass is known, the bulk density is pinned down, thus constraining the internal structure and equilibrium state of the object. Occultations are also extremely sensitive to tenuous atmospheres, down to the nanobar level. They allowed the monitoring of Pluto’s and Triton’s atmospheres in the last three decades, constraining their seasonal evolution. They may unveil in the near future atmospheres around other remote bodies of the solar system. Since 2013, occultations have led to the surprising discovery of ring systems around the Centaur object Chariklo, the dwarf planet Haumea and the large trans-Neptunian object Quaoar, while revealing dense material around the Centaur Chiron. This suggests that rings are probably much more common features than previously thought. Meanwhile, they have raised new dynamical questions concerning the confining effect of resonances forced by irregular objects on ring particles. Serendipitous occultations by km-sized trans-Neptunian or Oort objects has the potential to provide the size distribution of a population that suffered few collisions until now, thus constraining the history of primordial planetesimals in the 1–100 km range.","Several techniques are used to explore the outer solar system, each with its own advantages and caveats. Among them, direct imaging reveals sizes, shapes, as well as surface and atmospheric features, while spectroscopy constrains compositions. For a limited list of objects, space missions return unique data at high resolution, and in some cases, in situ measurements. In that context, Earth-based stellar occultations111Occultations occur when a celestial body comes in front of another celestial body. This differs from eclipses, that occur when a body casts its shadow over another body, a topic not covered here. allow results that are impossible to obtain with any other techniques, thanks to their extremely high spatial resolution and high sensitivity to tenuous atmospheres. Various reviews on occultations are available, see for instance the papers by [52] and [53], mainly dedicated to asteroids, planets, large satellites and Pluto. A more recent review by [137] focuses on occultations by TNOs, while [172] provides details on the role of refraction in stellar occultations. Occultations have led to major discoveries in the solar system, among which are the narrow and dense rings of Uranus in 1977 [54, 116, 17], Neptune’s ring arcs in 1984 [91], Pluto’s atmosphere in 1985 [28] and 1988 [92, 55], Titan’s atmospheric super-rotation [93] and gravity waves [194], the drastic increase of the Pluto atmospheric pressure since 1988 [59, 175], the dense rings around the Centaur object Chariklo in 2013 [24], the trans-Neptunian dwarf planet Haumea in 2017 [135], the large TNO Quaoar in 2018-2022 [119, 143] and ephemeral dense material around the Centaur object Chiron [34, 56, 162, 185, 138]. Finally, an occultation revealed the binarity of the TNO 2014 WC510 [103]. We focus in this review on recent progresses made on Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), a topic that has greatly expanded in the past three decades. This review includes Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), a population that extends beyond Neptune up to some 50 au, and Oort cloud objects, that orbits much farther out, up to tens of thousands au. We will also consider the Trojans of Jupiter and the Centaurs objects that orbit between Jupiter and Neptune since both populations are thought to be TNOs that have been implanted in the giant planet region. The discovery of the first TNO (other than Pluto), (15760) Albion, dates back to 1992 [96]. Currently, the number of observed TNOs is around five thousand, with an estimated total of more than one hundred thousand bodies with sizes larger than 100 km [148]. The orbital distribution, sizes, topographic features, compositions, and surroundings (including satellites, atmospheres, and rings) of these many objects provide precious hints on how our solar system formed and evolved. Due to their remoteness, these bodies are difficult to study. They are both faint and angularly very small, thus requiring, in general, large telescopes to be observed. Contrarily to other techniques, the performances of occultations are essentially independent of the geocentric distances. They can be recorded by small telescopes and are accessible to a large community of amateur astronomers. As explained below, the ultimate resolving power of occultations is imposed by diffraction and apparent stellar diameters, resulting in spatial resolutions down to the kilometer level. This is several orders of magnitudes better than the resolving power of any Earth-based instruments, for objects orbit at distances greater than a few astronomical units. This said, occultations have until recently suffered from two main limitations. One was the difficulty to predict the events. In practice, detecting an occultation by a small remote body in the outer solar system was mainly a matter of luck. The other limitation was the high cost of the sensitive and high-speed cameras that are necessary to monitor occultations, thus limiting the widespread distribution of this equipment. These difficulties have now been overcome. Since 2018, the Gaia mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) has provided astrometric accuracies at the milli-arcsec (mas) level for the stars to be occulted. On the other hand, the prices of sensitive cameras have drastically dropped in the last decade, allowing a large community of professional and amateur astronomers to equip their telescopes and to participate in large-scale campaigns. The occultation technique provides key information concerning a very large sample of TNOs, Trojans, and Centaurs. In particular, it can provide • The size and shape of objects at kilometric accuracy • The topography and the transition between shape and topographic features • The accurate value of albedo and its connection with surface composition • The discovery of satellites down to contact binaries, that are impossible to image directly • The improved astrometry of the occulting body down to mas-accuracy level • The accurate bulk density, if the mass is known, e.g., through the motion of a satellite • The satellite/primary mass ratio from the barycentric wobble • The equilibrium status, in particular, whether the body is in hydrostatic equilibrium, homogeneous, differentiated, or with a more complex behavior • The detection of atmospheres down to the nanobar level, with their thermal structures and temporal evolutions • The discovery of rings, with the accurate determination of their orbits and optical depth profiles"
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06897v1,ASTERIA - Thermal Inertia Evaluation of asteroid Didymos,"Asteroid Didymos, recently targeted by the NASA DART mission, is also planned to be visited by the ESA Hera mission. The main goal of the DART mission was to impact Dimorphos, the small satellite of Didymos, which was accomplished in September 2022. This collision altered the Didymos-Dimorphos system, generating a notable quantity of ejecta that turned Dimorphos into an active asteroid, with some ejecta potentially settling on the surfaces of both components. This prompts the investigation into the extent of post-impact surface alterations on these bodies, compared to their original states. The purpose of this study is to independently evaluate the pre-impact thermal inertia of Didymos. We employed ASTERIA, an alternative to conventional thermophysical modeling, to estimate the surface thermal inertia of Didymos. The approach is based on a model-to-measurement comparison of the Yarkovsky effect-induced drift on the orbital semi-major axis. These results, alongside existing literature, enable an evaluation of the impact-induced alterations in Didymos’s thermal inertia. Our nominal estimate with a constant thermal inertia model stands at \Gamma=211_{-55}^{+81} J m-2 K-1 s-1/2, while assuming it varies with the heliocentric distance with an exponent of -0.75 thermal inertia of Didymos is found to be 258_{-63}^{+94} J m-2 K-1 s-1/2. Subsequent verification confirmed that this result is robust against variations in unknown physical parameters. The thermal inertia estimates for Didymos align statistically with values reported in the literature, derived from both pre- and post-impact data. The forthcoming Hera mission will provide an opportunity to further corroborate these findings. Additionally, our results support the hypothesis that the thermal inertia of near-Earth asteroids is generally lower than previously expected.","The near-Earth binary asteroid (65803) Didymos was recently the target of the NASA DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) mission (Cheng et al., 2018). The main aim of the mission, impacting Didymos’s accompanying body Dimorphos, was accomplished on 2022 September 26, 23:14 UTC. The impact altered the binary system’s orbital period from 11.92 hours to 11.37 hours, proving that kinetic impacts are a viable method of diverging an asteroid orbit and, therefore, can also be applied for planetary defence purposes (Daly et al., 2023; Thomas et al., 2023). For an overview of the achievements of the DART mission and related investigations we direct readers to a recent paper by (Chabot et al., 2024). Further enhancement of the ability to protect our planet crucially depends on how well we understand the consequences of the DART impact experiment. For instance, in the case of small objects such as Dimorphos, the impact likely occurred in the strength-dominated regime, where the physical properties of the surface play a significant role in the crater formation process (e.g. Benz and Asphaug, 1999). Thermal inertia gauges the resistance of a material to temperature changes and can indicate the particle size of regolith (e.g. Gundlach and Blum, 2013; Schorghofer et al., 2024), or the porosity of rocks and boulders (Grott et al., 2019; Sakatani et al., 2021). Therefore, it serves as a valuable property that characterizes small bodies surfaces. The impact on Dimorphos also generated ejecta, boosting the momentum by a factor of 3.6 \pm 0.2 (Cheng et al., 2023) and effectively transforming it into an artificial active asteroid (Graykowski et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). A part of the ejecta may or may not be deposited on Didymos (see, e.g. Rossi et al., 2022; Ferrari et al., 2022, and references therein). This raises the question of whether a significant deposit of material at the surface of Didymos has occurred, and if so, whether it changed the surface thermal inertia of Didymos. 1.1 Pre- and post-impact surface properties of Didymos What do we know about the pre- and post-impact Didymos’ surface properties? Physical properties of the Didymos system before and after the DART impact were studied by Lin et al. (2023), using photometric observations. The authors found variations in taxonomic classification from S-complex (pre-impact) to C- and back to S-complex (post-impact). These variations are likely caused by contamination from the ejecta. This implies that the properties of the ejecta from Dimorphos could be somewhat different from those of the material of Didymos surface. Therefore, accumulation of the ejecta on Didymos surface might change its properties. Gray et al. (2023) performed polarimetric observations of the Didymos-Dimorphos system, spanning a period from about one month before to almost four months after the impact. This allows the authors to determine the polarimetric behavior of the system in its original state (pre-impact) and its changes following the impact of the DART spacecraft (post-impact). Gray et al. found a drop in polarisation in the post-impact measurements. They explained this as being, at least partly, due to the ejection of smaller particles than those present at the surface before the impact. Moreno et al. (2023) analysed the ejecta dust properties and evolution by applying Monte Carlo models to ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope observations of the Didymos-Dimorphos system, taken after the impact. Among other results, Moreno et al. show that up to 1.5\times 10^{6} kg of material fell back on the surfaces of both Dimorphos and Didymos in the first 20 days following the impact. Some of this material may have settled permanently on the surface of both binary system components. Still, according to Polishook et al. (2023), near-infrared spectral observations of the Didymos system taken before the impact and after the ejecta dissipated show no signs of the spectral features changes. The authors suggested that both Didymos and Dimorphos are made of the same silicate material, and interpreted this as a support for a binary asteroid formation theory that includes the breaking up of a single body due to rotational fission. Polishook et al. also suggested that only a negligible amount of non-weathered material was ejected from Dimorphos subsurface, suggesting that Dimorphos originates from weathered material ejected from Didymos surface. The results described above significantly increase our understanding of the Didymos-Dimorphos system. Still, these findings also leave some uncertainties about which changes occurred on the surface of Didymos following the DART impact on Dimorphos and, if they happened, to what degree. Better data and more precise answers in this respect are expected from the forthcoming ESA Hera mission, which aims to characterise the DART impact outcome (Michel et al., 2022). 1.2 Pre- and post-impact surface thermal inertia of Didymos The post-impact thermal inertia of Didymos has been recently estimated by Rivkin et al. (2023), using data from the James Webb Space Telescope obtained after the impact. Based on mid- and near-infrared observations, the authors estimated the post-impact thermal inertia values at 260\pm 30 and 290\pm 50 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2, respectively. The pre-impact thermal inertia of Didymos has also been recently estimated by Rozitis et al. (2024). The authors applied the standard procedure for thermal inertia estimation, that is fitting thermal-infrared observations of a planetary body or surface with an appropriate thermophysical model (e.g. Delbo et al., 2015; Hung et al., 2022, and references therein). Using the mid-infrared observations obtained by ESO’s Very Large Telescope before the DART impact, Rozitis et al. estimated the pre-impact thermal inertia of Didymos to be 320\pm 70 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2. The statistical compatibility of the obtained pre- (Rozitis et al., 2024) and post-impact (Rivkin et al., 2023) thermal inertia values implies that Dimorphos’ ejecta likely had minimal impact on Didymos’ thermal inertia. Nonetheless, the slight shift towards higher pre-impact values warrants further investigation into potential effects on thermal properties caused by ejecta. In this letter, we contribute to the topic by taking advantage of an alternative method for asteroid thermal inertia estimation recently proposed by Novaković et al. (2024) to re-evaluate the pre-impact thermal inertia of Didymos. By combining these findings with available literature values, we aim to place additional constraints on a possible difference between the pre- and post-impact thermal inertia."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06777v1,Migration of bodies to the Earth from different distances from the Sun,"Migration of bodies under the gravitational influence of almost formed planets was studied, and probabilities of their collisions with the Earth and other terrestrial planets were calculated. Based on the probabilities, several conclusions on the accumulation of the terrestrial planets have been made. The outer layers of the Earth and Venus could accumulate similar planetesimals from different regions of the feeding zone of the terrestrial planets. The probabilities of collisions of bodies during their dynamical lifetimes with the Earth could be up to 0.001-0.01 for some initial semi-major axes between 3.2 and 3.6 AU, whereas such probabilities did not exceed 10^{-5} at initial semi-major axes between 12 and 40 AU. The total mass of water delivered to the Earth from beyond Jupiter’s orbit could exceed the mass of the Earth’s oceans. The zone of the outer asteroid belt could be one of the sources of the late-heavy bombardment. The bodies that came from the zone of Jupiter and Saturn typically collided with the Earth and the Moon with velocities from 23 to 26 km/s and from 20 to 23 km/s, respectively.","Migration processes played a great role in accumulation of planets and in delivery of water to the Earth and the terrestrial planets. The life on the Earth could not appear without water. However, collisions of bodies with the Earth can be dangerous for life and can kill some organisms, including people. The Earth’s ocean water and its D/H ratio could be the result of mixing water from several exogenous and endogenous sources with high and low D/H ratio. It was considered that bodies containing ices migrated to the Earth from the outer part of the Main asteroid belt ([O’Brien et al. (2014), O’Brien et al., 2014;] [Morbidelli et al. (2000), Morbidelli et al., 2000;] [Morbidelli et al. (2012), Morbidelli et al., 2012;] [Petit et al. (2001), Petit et al., 2001;] [Raymond et al. (2004), Raymond et al., 2004;] [Lunine et al. (2003), Lunine et al., 2003]) and from beyond Jupiter’s orbit ([Morbidelli et al. (2000), Morbidelli et al., 2000;] [Levison et al. (2001), Levison et al., 2001;] [Ipatov & Mather (2004), Ipatov & Mather, 2004;] [Ipatov & Mather (2006), Ipatov & Mather, 2006;] [Ipatov (2010), Ipatov, 2010;] [Marov & Ipatov (2018), Marov & Ipatov, 2018)]. The studies of the process of accumulation of the terrestrial planets were often (e.g,. [Chambers & Wetherill (1998), Chambers & Wetherill, 1998]; [Ipatov (1993), Ipatov, 1993]; [Chamber2013, Chambers, 2013]; [Raymond et al. (2009), Raymond et al., 2009]) based on computer simulations of the evolution of disks of gravitating bodies combined at their collisions. In ([Ipatov (1993), Ipatov, 1993]) initial planetesimals were divided into four groups depending on their semi-major axes. It was obtained that composition of the largest formed planets was similar and was close to the composition of the initial disk."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06705v1,Detection and Characterisation of Giant Planets with  Astrometry,"Astrometric observations with Gaia are expected to play a valuable role in future exoplanet surveys. With current data from Gaia’s third data release (DR3), we are sensitive to periods from less than 1 year to more than 4 years but, unlike radial velocity are not as restricted by the orbital inclination of a potential planet. The presence and potential properties of a companion affect the primary’s renormalised unit weight error (RUWE) making this a valuable quantity in the search for exoplanets. Using this value and the fitted astrometric tracks from Gaia, we use Bayesian inference to constrain the mass and orbital parameters of companions in known systems. Combining this with radial velocity measurements, we show it is possible to independently measure mass and inclination and suggest HD 66141 b is a possible brown dwarf with maximum mass 23.9{}^{+7.2}_{-6.4} MJ. We show how this method may be applied to directly imaged planets in the future, using \beta-Pictoris c as an example but note that the host star is bright and active, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions. We show how the next Gaia data release, which will include epoch astrometry, will allow us to accurately constrain orbital parameters from astrometric data alone, revolutionising future searches for exoplanets. Combining predicted observational limits on planet mass with theoretical distributions, we estimate the probability that a star with a given RUWE will host a detectable planet, which will be highly valuable in planning future surveys.","The majority of exoplanets have been discovered by indirect methods such as transit and radial velocity (Charbonneau et al., 1999; Mayor & Queloz, 1995). Recent advances in high-contrast imaging have allowed direct detection of young giant planets (Marois et al., 2008). Each method comes with its own challenges and limitations: while transit is limited to short periods, direct imaging is confined to outer planets on long periods. Radial velocity can detect planets on periods longer than the transit method but is only able to provide a lower limit on a planet’s mass, and is unable to determine orbital inclination (Latham et al., 1989). Astrometry is a technique for measuring precise stellar positions and can also be applied to searches for exoplanets. With enough precision, it is possible to observe the change in the on-sky position of a star due to the gravitational pull of an unseen companion. Launched in 1989, the Hipparcos spacecraft was the first mission dedicated to precision astrometry to produce a 3-D model of the local stellar neighbourhood (Perryman, 2010). Combined with radial velocity measurements, its astrometric observations were also able to constrain parameters of known exoplanets discovered through radial velocity (Zucker & Mazeh, 2001). Gaia, the successor to Hipparcos, released its third release (DR3) in 2022 (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2023) containing 34 months of astrometric observations with precision of the order 0.1 mas. Gaia’s prospects for the detection of exoplanets were recognised in the early stages of development (Bernstein & Bastian, 1995) and later expanded upon in Perryman et al. (2014). Most of the exoplanets detectable by astrometry have similar separations and periods as those detected through radial velocity. Gaia’s capabilities are limited for planets on wider orbits due to the long observation times required. However, recent studies have combined Gaia data with Hipparcos data from over 20 years earlier to look for discrepancies with the fitted astrometric tracks. These differing results can indicate the presence of a long period planet at different points along its orbit. There has been some success using this method to detect and characterise long-period planets (e.g. Carleo et al., 2024; Sozzetti et al., 2023) and has provided dynamical masses of planets previously detected through direct imaging (Snellen & Brown, 2018; Brandt et al., 2021). Astrometry has an advantage over radial velocity in that it is not as constrained by orbital inclination. Radial velocity is more sensitive to edge-on systems and is unable to detect face-on systems whereas astrometry is capable of detecting a system of any inclination. Additionally, unlike radial velocity, the astrometric signal increases with the semi-major axis of a planet which means, given enough of an observation window, astrometry is capable of detecting planets over a wider range of periods. This study uses data from Gaia’s DR3 to constrain masses and orbital parameters of planet candidates detected through other methods by simulating the expected astrometric signal and applying Bayesian inference. Since DR3 doesn’t contain individual epoch observations, this study relies on the renormalised unit weight error (RUWE) which is a measure of how poorly Gaia has fit the parallax and proper motion of the star. This error could be indicative of an unseen and unresolved companion (Belokurov et al., 2020). Previous studies have investigated Gaia’s sensitivity to a planet of given mass and period for a particular RUWE (e.g. Blanco-Pozo et al., 2023) and found DR3 astrometry alone is not sensitive enough to detect planets around sources with RUWE<1. This study focuses on sources with higher RUWE (>1.1) which are more likely to host detectable companions. The next sections show how the RUWE is calculated and presents the details of our analysis. Studies of systems detected by radial velocity and direct imaging are presented, placing better constraints on planet candidates. Finally, a study is presented showing how epoch data in DR4 (expected after 2025) will allow further detection and characterization of nearby exoplanets."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06452v1,"Detecting Secular Perturbations in  Planetary Systems Using 
Simultaneous Impact Parameter Variation Analysis (SIPVA)","Recovering impact parameter variations in multi-planet systems is an effective approach for detecting non-transiting planets and refining planetary mass estimates. Traditionally, two methodologies have been employed: the Individual Fit, which fits each transit independently to analyze impact parameter changes, and the Dynamical Fit, which simulates planetary dynamics to match transit light curves. We introduce a new fitting method, Simultaneous Impact Parameter Variation Analysis (SIPVA), which outperforms the Individual Fit and is computationally more efficient than the Dynamical Fit. SIPVA directly integrates a linear time-dependent model for impact parameters into the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm by fitting all transits simultaneously. We evaluate SIPVA and the Individual Fit on artificial systems with varying LLRs and find that SIPVA consistently outperforms the Individual Fit in recovery rates and accuracy. When applied to selected Kepler planetary candidates exhibiting significant transit duration variations (TDVs), SIPVA identifies significant impact parameter trends in 10 out of 16 planets. In contrast, the Individual Fit does so in only 4. We also employ probabilistic modeling to calculate the theoretical distribution of planets with significant impact parameter variations across all observed Kepler systems and compare the distribution of recovered candidates by the Individual Fit and Dynamical Fit from previous work with our theoretical distribution. Our findings offer an alternative framework for analyzing planetary transits, relying solely on Bayesian inference without requiring prior assumptions about the planetary system’s dynamical architecture.","Accurately estimating the mass and eccentricity of exoplanets remains a significant challenge in detecting and characterizing Kepler multi-planet systems. One common approach involves reproducing observational data through N-body simulations to determine planetary masses (Wisdom & Holman, 1991; Chambers, 1999; Doyle et al., 2011; Carter et al., 2012), which has contributed multiple measurements for Kepler systems. Despite advancements in numerical integrators (Rein & Liu, 2012; Rein & Spiegel, 2014; Rein & Tamayo, 2015; Rein et al., 2019a, b; Javaheri et al., 2023) and increased computational capabilities, this method is limited by the Kepler mission’s approximately four-year observational window, which is insufficient to capture the frequent yet subtle orbital parameter changes necessary for precise mass determination using N-body techniques. Transit Timing Variation (TTV) analysis is an effective method for estimating exoplanet masses (Agol et al., 2005; Grimm et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2023; Masuda et al., 2024). Several tools, including ttvim (Nesvorný & Beaugé, 2010), TTVFast (Deck et al., 2014), TTVFaster (Agol & Deck, 2016a), PhoDyMM (Jones et al., 2022), and PyDynamicaLC (Yoffe et al., 2021), facilitate efficient TTV analyses. In additional to mass, studies focusing on eccentricities have examined the fundamental TTV modes to higher orders (Lithwick et al., 2012; Agol & Deck, 2016b; Hadden & Lithwick, 2017). However, TTV analysis is challenged by mass and eccentricity degeneracies (Lithwick et al., 2012), complicating the precise determination of each individual parameter. Moreover, the limited number of transit observations for planets with shorter orbital periods reduces temporal resolution, making the detection and analysis of subtle TTV signals more difficult. Transit Duration Variation (TDV) analysis, especially when combined with TTV, can help overcome the mass-eccentricity degeneracy (Agol & Fabrycky, 2018). Recent studies have actively explored using TDVs to constrain exoplanetary parameters (Shahaf et al., 2021; Judkovsky et al., 2020). Physical evidence for secular changes in TDVs driven by variations in impact parameters resulting from mutual inclinations has been presented by Millholland et al. (2021). Consequently, analyzing impact parameter variations (TbVs) has emerged as an alternative approach. Using TbVs, Judkovsky et al. (2022a) analyzed 54 systems with 140 planets, achieving mass detections of more than 3\sigma for 102 planets, including 43 lighter than 5,M_{\oplus}. Their subsequent research, Judkovsky et al. (2024), estimates orbital parameters for 101 planets across 23 systems, with mass significances better than 3\sigma for 95 planets, including 46 without prior constraints. Recovering and precisely estimating the magnitude and direction of TDVs or TbVs is crucial before using them to constrain planetary parameters. Traditionally, two methodologies have been employed: the Individual Fit, which fits each transit independently to analyze TDVs (Holczer et al., 2016), and the Dynamical Fit, which simulates planetary dynamics to match transit light curves (Judkovsky et al., 2022a, b, 2024; Langford & Agol, 2024). However, the Dynamical Fit requires strong prior assumptions about planetary orbital configurations, including the number of planets, their masses, and gravitational interactions. This research presents a Bayesian inference approach with less assumptions, fitting each planet’s transits individually and independently of neighboring planets. Our method, the Simultaneous Impact Parameter Variation Analysis (SIPVA), directly incorporates a linear time-dependent model for impact parameters into the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm by fitting all transits simultaneously. SIPVA avoids modeling the full gravitational dynamics, reducing computational complexity and dependence on prior knowledge of the system’s architecture. We demonstrate that SIPVA outperforms the Individual Fit in recovery rate and accuracy, providing an alternative approach for analyzing planetary transits.

In Section 2, we present a theoretical calculation of the Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR) of TbV transit lightcurves between the Null Model (\mathcal{M}_{0}), which assumes no change in the impact parameter over time, and the Alternative Model (\mathcal{M}_{1}), which incorporates a changing impact parameter. In Section 3, we introduce our MCMC methodology for recovering impact parameter changes through both Individual Fits (Sections 3.2 and 3.3) and SIPVA after transit folding (Section 3.4). We also evaluate the performance of Individual Fits and SIPVA on various artificial systems with different LLRs (Section 3.5). Section 4 applies our fitting algorithms to the selected Kepler planetary system candidates from Millholland et al. (2021) that demonstrate significant TDV. Lastly, in Section 5, we develop a theoretical model to estimate the relative frequency of planets exhibiting significant impact parameter changes across all Kepler observations and compare our estimates with observations from Holczer et al. (2016) and Judkovsky et al. (2022a, 2024). Finally, in Section 6, we summarize our findings.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06157v1,The COBREX archival survey: improved constraints on the occurrence rate of wide-orbit substellar companions,"Context. Direct imaging (DI) campaigns are uniquely suited to probing the outer regions around young stars and looking for giant exoplanet and brown dwarf companions, hence providing key complementary information to radial velocity (RV) and transit searches for the purpose of demographic studies. However, the critical 5-20 au region, where most giant planets are thought to form, remains poorly explored, lying in-between RV and DI capabilities.Aims. Significant gains in detection performances can be attained at no instrumental cost by means of advanced post-processing techniques. In the context of the COBREX project, we have assembled the largest collection of archival DI observations to date in order to undertake a large and uniform re-analysis. In particular, this paper details the re-analysis of 400 stars from the GPIES survey operated at GPI@Gemini South.Methods. Following the pre-reduction of raw frames, GPI data cubes were processed by means of the PACO algorithm. Candidates were identified and vetted based on multi-epoch proper motion analysis – whenever possible – and by means of a suitable color-magnitude diagram. The conversion of detection limits into detectability maps allowed for an estimate of unbiased occurrence frequencies of giant planets and brown dwarfs.Results. Deeper detection limits were derived compared to the literature, with up to a twofold gain in minimum detectable mass compared to previous GPI-based publications. Although no new substellar companion was confirmed, we identified two interesting planet candidates awaiting follow-up observations. We derive an occurrence rate of 1.7_{-0.7}^{+0.9}\% for 5 M_{\textrm{Jup}} <m<13 M_{\textrm{Jup}} planets in 10\leavevmode\nobreak\ \text{au}<a<100\leavevmode\nobreak\ \text{au}, that raises to 2.2_{-0.8}^{+1.0}\% when including substellar objects up to 80 M_{\textrm{Jup}}. Our results are in line with the literature, but come with lower uncertainties thanks to the enhanced detection sensitivity. We confirm the finding, hinted at by previous studies, of a larger occurrence of giant planets around BA hosts compared to FGK stars; moreover, we tentatively observe a smaller occurrence of brown dwarf companions around BA stars, although larger samples are needed to shed light on this point.Conclusions. While waiting for the wealth of data expected from future instrument and facilities, valuable information can still be extracted from existing data. In this regard, a complete re-analysis of SPHERE and GPI data is expected to provide the most precise demographic constraints ever provided by imaging.","Bolstered by more than 5000 confirmed detections to date, the exoplanet field has become mature enough to accompany the still thriving detection-oriented endeavor with follow-up studies aimed at shedding light on key questions related to the origin, the prevalence, and the architecture of planetary systems. By unveiling statistical trends in the measured physical, orbital and star-related properties of the exoplanet population, exoplanet demographics seeks to connect theory and observation, in order to fully understanding the physical processes underlying planet formation (Biazzo et al. 2022). The census of known exoplanets currently spans about four magnitudes in mass and in semi-major axis111Empirically estimated based on the Extrasolar Planet Encyclopaedia: http://www.exoplanet.eu/.. No single detection method is adequate to probe such a large extent of the parameter space: it is through the combination of the different methods, each optimized for detection inside a specific niche, that the large-scale picture can be unveiled and reconstructed (see, e.g., Gratton et al. 2023, 2024). However, obtaining a complete and unbiased blend from heterogeneous ingredients is hindered by factors such as inconsistent detection criteria, completeness and false positive assessment, uncertainty quantification, neglect of underlying selection or observational biases (Gaudi et al. 2021). Whenever two different methods can be simultaneously employed, their complementarity allows better characterizing individual objects (see, e.g., Gandolfi et al. 2017; Bonnefoy et al. 2018; Bourrier et al. 2018; Lacedelli et al. 2021; Kuzuhara et al. 2022; Philipot et al. 2023, Lagrange et al. under review) and strengthening the statistical trends emerging in each of the methods (Rogers 2015; Santerne et al. 2016). In the cases where different techniques probe instead different separations within the same system, the joint analysis opens up exquisite dynamical and formation studies (see, e.g., Covino et al. 2013; Bryan et al. 2016; Zhu & Wu 2018). Radial velocity (RV) surveys have provided invaluable constraints on the physical and orbital properties of giant planets up to \sim 5 au (Wolthoff et al. 2022; Rosenthal et al. 2024). Yet, the reliability of RV trends for larger separations has been questioned (Lagrange et al. 2023), and the predicted yields for direct imaging (DI) surveys based on extrapolations of RV results have been shown to be too optimistic (see, e.g., Cumming et al. 2008; Dulz et al. 2020). On the other hand, direct imaging (DI) is mostly sensitive to young giant planets in wide (a\gtrsim 20 au) orbits, providing access to the scarcely studied outskirts of planetary systems. Starting from 2004 (Chauvin et al. 2004), direct imaging has discovered \sim 30 planets (M<13M_{\textrm{Jup}}) (Zurlo 2024), including iconic systems like the disk-enshrouded PDS 70 (Keppler et al. 2018), the \sim 20-Myr-old \beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2009), 51 Eridani (Macintosh et al. 2015), AF Leporis (Mesa et al. 2023; De Rosa et al. 2023; Franson et al. 2023), and the four-planet HR 8799 (Marois et al. 2008). These detections are the main outcome of large blind surveys targeting tens (e.g. MASSIVE, Lannier et al. 2016; SEEDS, Uyama et al. 2017; LEECH, Stone et al. 2018) or hundreds of stars (e.g. NICI-PCF, Liu et al. 2010; IDPS, Galicher et al. 2016; ISPY-NACO, Launhardt et al. 2020). The forefront of DI surveys, enabled by the exquisite performances of imagers and integral field spectrographs, coupled with extreme AO systems mounted on 8-m-class telescopes, is currently represented by the 400-star SHINE (Chauvin et al. 2017) and the 600-star GPIES (Nielsen et al. 2019) surveys. By constraining the overall frequency and the properties of wide-separation giant planets, DI studies are expected to enable a thorough comparison with concurrent formation models (see, e.g., Bowler 2016; Vigan et al. 2021); orbital properties, for instance, shed light upon their formation and dynamical evolution (Bowler et al. 2020); the dependence of frequency on stellar mass provides clues about the initial state of the disk and the formation mechanisms at play (Nielsen et al. 2019; Janson et al. 2021). However, despite years of extensive searches, it is still not clear whether the main formation channel for the observed wide-orbit population be core accretion (CA; Pollack et al. 1996; Mordasini et al. 2009), the bottom-up process responsible for the formation of planets in the Solar System, or rather a top-down star-like scenario like gravitational instability (GI; Boss 1997; Vorobyov 2013). While an interplay between the two scenarios is deemed to be favored by empirical parametric models (Reggiani et al. 2016; Vigan et al. 2021) and direct comparison with synthetic planet populations (Vigan et al. 2021) alike, understanding in an unambiguous way how each known companion was formed is still beyond reach. The large uncertainties still existing in the interpretation of the observed picture can be attributed, at least partially, to the fact that the critical 5-20 au region, where most giant planets are thought to form, remains poorly explored being exactly in-between current RV and DI capabilities. Under given observing conditions, the final performances attainable by a high-contrast imaging observation are dictated both by instrumental (e.g., the telescope, the science instrument, the performance of adaptive optics and coronagraphs) and post-processing components (the algorithms applied to science images to decrease the level of systematic and random noise) (Galicher & Mazoyer 2024). Depending on observing conditions, stellar brightness and angular separation, state-of-the-art instruments such as the Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research (SPHERE; Beuzit et al. 2019) and the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI; Macintosh et al. 2014) typically achieve raw planet-to-star contrasts as low as 10^{-3}-10^{-5} (Poyneer et al. 2016; Courtney-Barrer et al. 2023). On the instrumental side, 30-m-class telescopes and space-borne coronagraphic instruments are expected to bring about a major leap forward for the field in the next decade (see, e.g., Kasdin et al. 2020; Kasper et al. 2021), whereas upgrades of existing instruments such as SPHERE+ (Boccaletti et al. 2022) and GPI 2.0 (Chilcote et al. 2018) are going to represent the forefront in the medium term; on the reduction side, advanced post-processing algorithms have been already shown to increase the contrast by as much as two orders of magnitudes compared to pre-reduced data. Therefore, the developments of more powerful reduction techniques can greatly increase detection capabilities working on observations that already exist (see, e.g., Currie et al. 2023). In the framework of the COupling data and techniques for BReakthroughs in EXoplanetary systems exploration (COBREX) project, we collected more than a thousand archival SPHERE and GPI observations, assembling the largest exoplanetary direct imaging survey to date, with the aim of re-reducing them in a uniform and self-consistent way. The results of the full re-reduction of the SHINE survey are illustrated in Chomez et al. (2024). In this work, we present the re-reduction of 400 stars coming from GPIES. Despite being the largest DI observational campaign to date, just two new substellar objects were discovered during the survey: one planet (51 Eri b, Macintosh et al. 2015) and one brown dwarf (HR 2562 B, Konopacky et al. 2016). A statistical analysis of the first 300 stars was performed by Nielsen et al. (2019, hereafter N19). By combining the two surveys, it will be possible to obtain the tightest constraints to date on the occurrence of wide-orbit giant planets, hence providing an ideal test-bed to scrutinize planet formation models. This paper is organized as follows: after laying out the selection criteria for the sample and the corresponding observations (Section 2.2), and uniformly deriving the stellar parameters of interest (Section 2.3), we describe in detail the process of data reduction (Section 2.4). Section 3 presents the results of the analysis, namely companion candidates and completeness maps. The derived occurrence rates are presented and discussed in Section 3.4. A thorough comparison with the literature is the subject of Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize the results of this work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05962v1,Migration of bodies ejected from the Earth and the Moon,"This study analyzes the motion of bodies ejected from the Earth or the Moon. We studied the ejection of bodies from several points on the Earth’s surface, as well as from the most far point of the Moon from the Sun. Different velocities and angles of ejection of bodies were considered. The dynamical lifetimes of bodies reached a few hundred million years. Over the entire considered time interval, the values of the probability of a collision of a body ejected from the Earth with the Earth were approximately 0.3, 0.2, and 0.15–0.2 at an ejection velocity v_{ej} equaled to 11.5, 12, and 14 km/s, respectively. At v_{ej}\leq11.3 km/s, most of the ejected bodies fell back onto the Earth. The total number of bodies delivered to the Earth and Venus probably did not differ much. The probabilities of collisions of bodies with Mercury and Mars usually did not exceed 0.1 and 0.02, respectively. At v_{ej}\geq11.5 km/s, the probability of a collision of a body ejected from the Earth with the Moon was about 15–35 times less than that with the Earth, and it was about 0.01. The probability of a collision with the Earth for a body ejected from the Moon moving in its present orbit was about 0.3–0.32, 0.2–0.22, and 0.1–0.14 at v_{ej}=2.5 km/s, v_{ej}=5 km/s, and at 12\leqv_{ej}\leq16.4 km/s, respectively.","The terrestrial planets and the Moon were bombarded by impactors during their formation and at the stage of the Late-Heavy Bombardment. Some material could be ejected at such impacts. Earlier Gladman et al. (2005) and Reyes-Ruiz et al. (2012) studied the motion of bodies ejected from the Earth during time interval equal to 30 Kyr. Considered initial velocities were perpendicular to the surface of the Earth. According to (Shuvalov & Trubetskaya, (2011)), the values of an ejection angle i_{ej} are mainly between 20^{\circ} and 55^{\circ}, especially between 40^{\circ} and 50^{\circ}. More detailed introduction information on the item of the below paper can be found in (Ipatov (2024), Ipatov (2025))."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05954v1,Migration of bodies in the Proxima Centauri and Trappist 1 planetary systems,"The motion of planetesimals was studied in the Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST 1 exoplanetary systems. The size of the feeding zone of planet Proxima Centauri c is discussed. It was noted that after hundreds of Myrs, some planetesimals could still move in elliptical resonant orbits inside the feeding zone of this planet that had been mainly cleared from planetesimals. The probability of a collision of a planetesimal initially located in the feeding zone of planet c with inner planet b was obtained to be about 0.0002 and 0.001 at initial eccentricity of orbits of planetesimals equal to 0.02 or 0.15, respectively. A lot of icy material and volatiles could be delivered from the icy zone near the orbit of planet c to inner planets b and d. The inclinations of orbits of 80% of the planetesimals that moved between 500 or 1200 AU from the star did not exceed 10^{o}. It was obtained that several planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system accumulated planetesimals initially located at the same distance. Outer layers of neighbouring TRAPPIST-1 planets can include similar material.","1 Initial data for calculations of the motion of planetesimals in the Proxima Centauri planetary system The motion of planetesimals and other bodies in the Solar System was studied in many papers (see e.g. the review in (Marov, Ipatov, 2023)). Ipatov (2023a,b,c) studied the motion of planetesimals in the Proxima Centauri planetary system. In these calculations, the gravitational influence of the star (with a mass equal to 0.122 of the solar mass) and two planets: b (a_{b}=0.04857 AU, e_{b}=0.11, m_{b}=1.17m_{E}, m_{E} is the mass of the Earth) and c (a_{c}=1.489 AU, e_{c}=0.04, m_{c}=7m_{E}) was taken into account. Calculations with other values of m_{c} (0.7m_{E}, 3.5m_{E}, and 12m_{E}) were also made. The planetesimals were excluded from integration when they collided with the star or the planets or reached 1200 AU (the Hill radius of the star) from the star. The symplectic code from (Levison, Duncan, 1994) was used for integrations. In most calculations, the integration time step t_{s} equaled to 1 day. The obtained results were about the same for different considered t_{s} equaled to 0.2 day, or 0.5 day, or 2 days. The considered time interval usually exceeded 100 Myr. For some variants it reached 1000 Myr. The late gas-less stage of formation of planets was considered. Migration of planetesimals from the feeding zone of planet c was calculated. In each calculation variant, initial semi-major axes a_{o} of orbits of N_{o}=250 planetesimals were in the range from a_{min} to a_{min}+0.1 AU. In different variants, the values of a_{min} were in the range from 0.9 to 2.2 AU. Initial eccentricities e_{o} of orbits of planetesimals equaled to 0.02 or 0.15. Initial inclinations of orbits of the planetesimals were equal to e_{o}/2 rad. Not small considered eccentricities of planetesimals could be a result of the previous evolution of the disk of planetesimals and could be reached due to mutual gravitational influence of planetesimals."

Preference for Circular Orbits, Cloudy Atmospheres, and a Moderately Enhanced Metallicity","Direct imaging observations are biased towards wide-separation, massive companions that have degenerate formation histories. Although the majority of exoplanets are expected to form via core accretion, most directly imaged exoplanets have not been convincingly demonstrated to follow this formation pathway. We obtained new interferometric observations of the directly imaged giant planet AF Lep b with the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument. We present three epochs of \sim 50\,\mu\mathrm{as} relative astrometry and the K-band spectrum of the planet for the first time at a resolution of R=500. Using only these measurements, spanning less than two months, and the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations, we are able to significantly constrain the planet’s orbit; this bodes well for interferometric observations of planets discovered by Gaia DR4. Including all available measurements of the planet, we infer an effectively circular orbit (e<0.02,0.07,0.13 at 1,2,3\,\sigma) in spin-orbit alignment with the host, and a measure a dynamical mass of M_{\mathrm{p}}=3.75\pm 0.5\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}. Models of the spectrum of the planet show that it is metal rich ([M/H]=0.75\pm 0.25), with a C/O ratio encompassing the solar value. This ensemble of results show that the planet is consistent with core accretion formation.","1.1 Tracing the formation of gas giants with direct observations Gas giants play a central role in shaping the formation and evolution of planetary systems in general, and our own Solar System in particular (e.g. Levison & Agnor, 2003; Raymond et al., 2014; Childs et al., 2019; Horner et al., 2020b). Once they have formed, giant planets dominate the subsequent production and dynamical evolution of dust, planetesimals, and inner terrestrial planets, likely dictating the volatile content of terrestrial planets (e.g. Raymond, 2008; Raymond et al., 2012; Raymond & Izidoro, 2017; Sotiriadis et al., 2018; Bitsch et al., 2020; Horner et al., 2020a). It has even been suggested recently that the presence of outer giant planets is correlated with inner terrestrial planets (Rosenthal et al., 2022). As such, it is important to understand the formation and evolution of gas giants in order to better understand the occurrence of Earth-like planets and the emergence of life in the universe. Gas giants themselves are rich laboratories: they host complex moon systems (Morrison, 1982), bear dramatic storm systems and weather patterns (Marcus, 1993), are obscured by clouds of varying species (Helling, 2019), and have interiors with poorly constrained structure and composition whose investigation drives advancement in physics modeling and experimentation (Hubbard et al., 2002; Guillot, 2005). High-contrast imaging observations enabled by adaptive optics and coronagraphic instruments have resulted in the discovery of a growing number of directly imaged planets (M<13\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}) in wide orbits (a>10\,\mathrm{au}) around young ({<}100\,\mathrm{Myr}) pre-main sequence stars (for a review, see Currie et al., 2023). These objects appear much rarer than shorter separation gas giants (e.g. Nielsen et al., 2019; Vigan et al., 2021, and references therein) and their formation histories are often debated. Demographic studies from the larger sample of older radial velocity (RVs) gas giants have shown that, 1) the fraction of giant planets orbiting a star increases with stellar metallicity, tracing core accretion, as more solids are found in the planet forming disks of higher metallicity stars (Gonzalez, 1997; Santos et al., 2004; Fischer & Valenti, 2005; Mordasini et al., 2012) and 2) planets with masses below about 4\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}} are found orbiting metal rich host stars, whereas objects with masses above 4\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}} exhibit a much broader range of host-star metallicity (Santos et al., 2017; Schlaufman, 2018). The bulk of gas giants appear to orbit near their host star’s ice lines, \sim3–10 au around solar type stars (Fernandes et al., 2019; Wittenmyer et al., 2020; Fulton et al., 2021; Lagrange et al., 2023), albeit with a large scatter ranging from ultra hot Jupiters to planets with periods \gtrsim1000 years. Bulk density measurements from transiting planets with RV masses have elucidated a planetary mass vs planetary metallicity trend (Guillot et al., 2006; Miller & Fortney, 2011; Thorngren et al., 2016) that is explainable by core accretion (e.g. Hasegawa et al., 2018). At higher masses, planets are generally less metal rich because they have accreted a larger fraction of H/He gas (Thorngren & Fortney, 2019), though these samples are based on short period planets that are much closer to their stars than directly detected objects. Despite remaining open questions, core accretion formation is the predominant theory of planet formation for the sample of indirectly detected planets (e.g. Raymond & Morbidelli, 2022). Many objects in the current sample of directly imaged exoplanets are broadly consistent with formation in 1) the low probability, high mass tail of core accretion model distributions, and subsequent dynamical scattering outwards (e.g. Mordasini et al., 2009; Marleau et al., 2019; Emsenhuber et al., 2021a, b), 2) the low probability, low mass tail of molecular core fragmentation and early dynamical capture distributions (e.g. Chabrier, 2003; Padoan & Nordlund, 2004; Boyd & Whitworth, 2005; Bate, 2009, 2012), or perhaps 3) as instances of disk instability and fragmentation (e.g. Boss, 1997; Kratter et al., 2010; Forgan et al., 2018). There is growing consensus from dynamical studies tracing the eccentricity and obliquity distributions of these systems that directly imaged planets interior to \sim 50-100\,\mathrm{au} formed within a disk (e.g. Bowler et al., 2020, 2023; Sepulveda et al., 2024), but it is still unclear whether these objects formed via core accretion or disk fragmentation. The challenge for direct imaging is twofold, to push to observe planets that are representative of the bulk of the exoplanet population, and to disentangle the formation histories of known imaged planets. Direct observations, combined with model independent mass measurements, can then seek to expand on the observational trends to inform planet formation models with greater fidelity. 1.2 Accessing solar system scales with interferometry In addition to classical direct imaging using coronagraphic imaging, or molecular mapping via high-resolution cross correlation, optical interferometry has begun to provide direct observations of gas giant planets with the advent of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) GRAVITY instrument (GRAVITY Collaboration et al., 2017) and the ExoGRAVITY survey (Lacour et al., 2020). GRAVITY is a fiber fed instrument with dedicated fringe tracking. Informed by radial velocity observations and proper motion anomalies (Grandjean et al., 2019; Lagrange et al., 2020), GRAVITY has helped validate and reveal two newly directly detected planets within 10\,\mathrm{au}, \beta Pictoris c (2.7\,\mathrm{au}; Nowak et al., 2020) and HD 206893 c (3.5\,\mathrm{au}; Hinkley et al., 2023). With absolute astrometry from Gaia, GRAVITY has detected a handful of brown dwarf companions at very close separations (60-200\mathrm{mas}; Pourré et al., 2024; Winterhalder et al., 2024). It has also exquisitely characterized many known directly imaged giant planets and brown dwarf companions (GRAVITY Collaboration et al., 2019, 2020; Kammerer et al., 2021; Lacour et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a; Balmer et al., 2023; Blunt et al., 2023; Balmer et al., 2024; Nasedkin et al., 2024b). GRAVITY provides the most precise relative astrometry of directly detected planets yet measured, as well as K-band spectroscopy (in three modes, with R=50, 500, and 5000). The K-band emission of substellar objects is shaped by absorption from H2O, CO, and CH4. The capability to conduct spectroscopy at close separations has enabled the precise estimation of the atmospheric abundances of a number of directly imaged planets (Mollière et al., 2020). GRAVITY’s main limitation is its very small field of view (\sim 60\,\mathrm{mas}), which necessitates precise fiber pointing (and therefore some prior knowledge of the planet’s position) to ensure the planet’s emission is coupled into the science fiber (see Pourré et al., 2024, for the characterization of the contrast performance of the techniques used in this paper and previous work). The release of Gaia DR4 is expected to contain a list of astrometrically detected exoplanets111https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/release, which would provide prior knowledge of the positions of a large sample of planets that could be amenable to imaging with GRAVITY. Previous estimates of Gaia’s exoplanet detection capabilities have indicated that as many as 21,000 long period, giant exoplanets could be found over the mission’s lifetime (Perryman et al., 2014). GRAVITY is expected to uniquely detect and characterize a subset of these astrometric planet candidates in young moving groups (Winterhalder et al., 2024; Pourré et al., 2024). This would open a unique window into atmospheric characterization of giant planets near their snow lines. The question then becomes, ‘to what degree do we expect to understand the orbits, atmospheric composition, and fundamental properties of planets that can only be detected (in the near term) with Gaia and GRAVITY?’ 1.3 AF Leporis b Proper motion anomalies between Hipparcos and Gaia (Brandt, 2018; Kervella et al., 2019; Brandt, 2021; Kervella et al., 2022) have been leveraged to directly image new companions with a higher detection rate than blind surveys (e.g., Currie et al., 2020; Chilcote et al., 2021; Bonavita et al., 2022; Franson et al., 2023b; Currie et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). Most notably, after uninformative surveys the decades prior had returned non-detections (Biller et al., 2013; Stone et al., 2018; Nielsen et al., 2019; Launhardt et al., 2020), proper motion anomaly informed searches have uncovered a giant planet orbiting the young star AF Lep (HD 35850, HIP 25486, Gaia DR3 3009908378049913216) that has the lowest dynamically measured mass of any directly imaged exoplanet (De Rosa et al., 2023; Franson et al., 2023a; Mesa et al., 2023). The mass estimates for the planet at the time of discovery varied by about a Jupiter mass between datasets (4.3^{+2.9}_{-1.2}\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}, De Rosa et al., 2023), (3.2^{+0.7}_{-0.6}\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}, Franson et al., 2023a), (5.237^{+0.085}_{-0.10}\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}, Mesa et al., 2023), depending on the orbital coverage of the initial observations. The ensemble of discovery data was subsequently analyzed together, providing another estimate of the planet’s dynamical mass (2.8^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}, Zhang et al., 2023). The planet was recovered in archival observations dating back to 2011 using explainable machine learning assisted starlight subtraction, which significantly extended the baseline of the planet’s measured orbital motion, and constrained the orbit to low eccentricities (Bonse et al., 2024). Initial estimates for the temperature and spectral type of the planet varied anywhere between 700-1200\,\mathrm{K}, placing the planet along the low-surface gravity L-T transition, where spectral modeling is particularly challenging (Marley & Robinson, 2015). Nevertheless, by combining the suite of discovery spectrophotometry, two studies have indicated that the planet appears to have a temperature between 700-900\,\mathrm{K} and an atmosphere that is enriched in metals compared to the solar value (Zhang et al., 2023; Palma-Bifani et al., 2024). The planet was directly imaged at 4.4 µm using JWST/NIRCam coronagraphy, and the suppression of its flux at these wavelengths provided strong evidence that its atmosphere is in chemical disequilibrium (Franson et al., 2024). It has been suggested that the luminosity and dynamical mass of the planet are consistent with a delayed formation (Franson et al., 2023a; Zhang et al., 2023; Zhang, 2024, that is, formation a few Myr after the host star formation). The sensitivity of the planet’s dynamical mass estimate to the viewing geometry, as well as the relatively unconstrained methane abundance given the wavelength coverage of existing observations motivated our follow-up of this system with VLTI/GRAVITY. Here we present the results of our new interferometric observations of AF Lep b with VLTI/GRAVITY. Relative astrometry at \sim 50\,\mu\mathrm{as} precision near periastron constrains the low eccentricity of the planet’s orbit with a time baseline of only 2 months, and coupled with the archival recovery of the planet near apoastron, places a strong upper limit on the eccentricity. The system provides an example of the excellent orbital precision that could be expected for planets detected astrometrically by Gaia and directly confirmed by GRAVITY. The K-band spectrum of the planet shows prominent methane absorption features that constrain the temperature, composition, and chemical disequilibrium of the atmosphere. We discuss future improvements necessary to better characterize the planet’s atmosphere and bulk properties. We argue that the current ensemble of results are consistent with expectations from core accretion formation models. We conclude by looking forward to anticipated observations of Gaia discovered planets with VLTI/GRAVITY."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06330v1,"Simulating Solar Neighborhood Brown Dwarfs I:
The Luminosity Function Above and Below the Galactic Plane","Brown dwarfs form the key, yet poorly understood, link between stellar and planetary astrophysics. These objects offer unique tests of Galactic structure, but observational limitations have inhibited the large-scale analysis of these objects to date. Major upcoming sky surveys will reveal unprecedented numbers of brown dwarfs, among even greater numbers of stellar objects, enabling the statistical study of brown dwarfs. To extract the comparatively rare brown dwarfs from these massive datasets, we must understand how they will look in upcoming surveys. In this work, we construct a synthetic population of brown dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood to explore their evolutionary properties using Gaia-derived star formation histories alongside observational mass, metallicity, and age relationships. We apply the cloudless Sonora Bobcat, hybrid SM08, and gravity-dependent hybrid Sonora Diamondback evolutionary models to the sample. We present the simulated luminosity function and its evolution with distance from the Galactic Plane. Our simulation shows that brown dwarf population statistics are a function of height above/below the Galactic Plane and sample different age distributions. Interpreting the local sample requires combining evolutionary models, the initial mass function, the star formation history, and kinematic heating. Our models are a guide to how well height-dependent samples can test these scenarios. Sub-populations of brown dwarfs farther from the Plane are older and occupy a different region of brown dwarf parameter space than younger sub-populations closer to the Galactic Plane. Therefore, fully exploring population statistics both near and far from the Plane is critical to prepare for upcoming surveys.","The study of brown dwarfs, sub-stellar objects that lack the ability to fuse hydrogen, has been driven by large-scale digital sky surveys for the past 30 years. Originally theorized in 1962 (Kumar, 1962), brown dwarfs have been discovered through dedicated surveys with large facilities such as 2MASS (Kirkpatrick et al., 1999; Gizis et al., 2000), PAN-STARRS1 (Deacon et al., 2014; Best et al., 2018), WISE (Cushing et al., 2011; Kirkpatrick et al., 2011), DENIS (Delfosse et al., 1997), SDSS (Leggett et al., 2000), and UKIRT West et al. (2004), but also as foreground contaminants in extragalactic surveys (Hainline et al., 2024; Tee et al., 2023). We are entering an exciting time for brown dwarf science as the next generation of observation facilities become a reality and start to come online. Observatories such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Euclid, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope promise to drastically increase the discovery rate for brown dwarfs and propel the field forward. Brown dwarfs are cold, sub-stellar objects that extend beyond the main sequence through spectral types L (Martín et al., 1999; Kirkpatrick et al., 1999), T (Burgasser et al., 2002; Geballe et al., 2002), and Y (Delorme et al., 2008; Cushing et al., 2011). These objects have effective temperatures below \sim2400, 1300, and 600 K, respectively. As such, these objects are faint in wavelengths shorter than 1 \mum and present a challenge to observe. Furthermore, since brown dwarfs are not massive enough to fuse hydrogen in their cores, they perpetually cool and grow dimmer, only increasing the difficulty of their observation. Brown dwarfs are excellent probes for tracing Galactic evolution and structure (Burgasser, 2009). Their kinematics have been used to study their population distributions as well as mapping out the structure of the Milky Way’s thin disk (Faherty et al., 2009; Kirkpatrick et al., 2024). Furthermore, distant M-, L-, and T-type dwarfs can help measure thin disk structure and constrain the thick disk and halo scale heights (Aganze et al., 2022). Therefore, the ability to detect more distant brown dwarfs and understand their formation mechanisms with current and future surveys will play a key role in mapping the Milky Way and advancing such science cases. Accurately modeling the atmospheres of brown dwarfs is a complicated affair. While their interiors are well known to be fully convective, their atmospheres are complex, filled with molecular features and weather that depend on temperature and pressure evolution (Burrows et al., 2006). The warmer L-dwarfs are covered by cloudy atmospheres, but the observation of these clouds is inclination-dependent (Suárez et al., 2023). As brown dwarfs cool through the L-sequence and into the T-sequence, the clouds sediment and “rain out” minerals and metals leading to clear, cloudless atmospheres (Burrows et al., 2006). These T-dwarfs are further characterized by strong molecular features and the emergence of methane bands in their spectra. Finally, the coolest Y-dwarfs spectral energy peaks at \sim5 \mum and show large spectral absorption features from molecules like water, methane, ammonia, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide (Cushing et al., 2011). It appears increasingly likely that late-T and Y dwarf spectra can be described by a second parameter other than temperature, such as metallicity or surface gravity (Beiler et al., 2023). These diverse spectral types are not distinct classifications without overlap, but rather form an evolutionary sequence brown dwarfs undergo as they age and cool. The cooling mechanisms of brown dwarfs are an area of active research for future surveys. In order to prepare for next-generation surveys that will reveal these dim populations of brown dwarfs and enable the statistical analysis of their characteristics, we must understand their underlying distribution within the Galaxy. We turn to simulating the Solar Neighborhood population of brown dwarfs to predict the characteristics of brown dwarfs that future surveys will see. Previously, the creation of synthetic populations required assuming a birth-rate, star formation rate, and an underlying exponential distribution with height above the Galactic Plane (Ryan et al., 2022). We present a novel approach using recent Gaia results in conjunction with recent observational relations to build synthetic populations of brown dwarfs. This paper presents our simulation of Solar Neighborhood brown dwarfs. In Section 2 we build the synthetic population of brown dwarfs. We present the results of the simulation as parameter functions in Section 3. The implications of the results are discussed and compared to recent studies in Section 4. Our conclusions and future work are summarized in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06283v1,Magnetic interaction of stellar coronal mass ejections with close-in exoplanets: implication on planetary mass loss and Ly-\alpha transits,"Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) erupting from the host star are expected to have effects on the atmospheric erosion processes of the orbiting planets. For planets with a magnetosphere, the embedded magnetic field in the CMEs is thought to be the most important parameter to affect planetary mass loss. In this work, we investigate the effect of different magnetic field structures of stellar CMEs on the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter with a dipolar magnetosphere. We use a time-dependent 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) atmospheric escape model that self-consistently models the outflow from hot Jupiters magnetosphere and its interaction with stellar CMEs. For our study, we consider three configurations of magnetic field embedded in stellar CMEs – (a) northward B_{z} component, (b) southward B_{z} component, and (c) radial component. We find that both the CMEs with northward B_{z} component and southward B_{z} component increase the planetary mass-loss rate when the CME arrives from the stellar side, with the mass-loss rate remaining higher for the CME with northward B_{z} component until it arrives at the opposite side. The largest magnetopause is found for the CME with a southward B_{z} component when the dipole and the CME magnetic field have the same direction. We also find that during the passage of a CME, the planetary magnetosphere goes through three distinct changes - (1) compressed magnetosphere, (2) enlarged magnetosphere, and (3) relaxed magnetosphere for all three considered CME configurations. We compute synthetic Ly-\alpha transits at different times during the passage of the CMEs. The synthetic Ly-\alpha transit absorption generally increases when the CME is in interaction with the planet for all three magnetic configurations. The maximum Ly-\alpha absorption is found for the radial CME case when the magnetosphere is the most compressed.","Atmospheric escape from exoplanets is well observed in several discovered exoplanets, especially in the close-in exoplanets such as hot Jupiters and warm Neptunes (e.g., Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Lecavelier Des Etangs et al., 2010; Ehrenreich et al., 2015; Lavie et al., 2017). The upper atmosphere of these planets gets photoionized due to the intense radiation from their host stars leading to an escaping planetary outflow (e.g., Tian et al., 2005; Murray-Clay et al., 2009; Allan & Vidotto, 2019; Hazra et al., 2020). Continuous depletion of atmospheric material due to atmospheric escape over a long time is crucial for the sustainability and evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres (e.g., Kubyshkina et al., 2020). Also, atmospheric losses are important to understand the plausible cause of the existence of the Neptunian desert (e.g., Mazeh et al., 2016) and the radius valley (e.g., Fulton et al., 2017) in the present exoplanet demographic. A strong atmospheric mass-loss rate could even lead to the total loss of atmosphere(e.g., Lammer et al., 2007; Khodachenko et al., 2007). Therefore, for understanding the long-term evolution of the atmosphere, a more precise understanding of atmospheric escape and the corresponding mass-loss rate is necessary. Stellar radiation plays the key role in driving the planetary outflow from close-in exoplanets and once this radiation-driven planetary outflow starts to expand, it interacts with the stellar environment i.e., with the stellar wind, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and stellar magnetic field. Presently there are some numerical efforts to understand mass loss due to the interaction of planetary outflow with stellar outflow using 3D hydrodynamic simulations (Bisikalo et al., 2013; Villarreal D’Angelo et al., 2014, 2021; Tripathi et al., 2015; Carroll-Nellenback et al., 2017; McCann et al., 2019; Carolan et al., 2020; Hazra et al., 2022; MacLeod & Oklopčić, 2022). However, limited studies are using 3D MHD simulations to understand these aspects. The stellar and planetary magnetic fields play a key role (Khodachenko et al., 2015; Matsakos et al., 2015; Erkaev et al., 2017; Arakcheev et al., 2017; Daley-Yates & Stevens, 2018, 2019; Zhilkin et al., 2020) in the interaction between the outflowing planetary material with stellar outflow. On one hand, the planetary magnetic field can suppress the atmospheric escape and change the morphology of planetary outflow depending on the structure of the planetary magnetosphere and its strength (Trammell et al., 2014; Villarreal D’Angelo et al., 2018; Carolan et al., 2021b; Khodachenko et al., 2021; Ben-Jaffel et al., 2022). On the other hand, the stellar magnetic field reconnects with the planetary magnetic field and enhances the chance of planetary materials to leave the influence of planetary magnetosphere (Lanza, 2013; Owen & Adams, 2014; Egan et al., 2019; Ramstad & Barabash, 2021). The interplay between the stellar magnetic field and planetary magnetic field needs to be taken into account for a better understanding of the atmospheric escape from exoplanets (e.g., Carolan et al., 2021b). Stellar transient activities (e.g., flares, CMEs) are also very important in affecting exoplanetary atmospheres. There are several studies on the effect of solar flares and CMEs on the atmospheres of solar system planets (e.g., Ma et al., 2004; Manchester et al., 2004; Möstl et al., 2015; Falayi et al., 2018). A few theoretical studies also investigated the effect of flares and CMEs on the exoplanetary atmosphere, reporting that these stellar transients affect exoplanetary atmospheres greatly by changing the mass-loss rate (Kay et al., 2016; Chadney et al., 2017; Bisikalo et al., 2018; Cherenkov et al., 2017; Hazra et al., 2020; Hazra et al., 2022). A stellar flare enhances total X-ray and ultraviolet radiation received by the planet, potentially changing the atmospheric chemistry and ionization in the atmospheres of planets, which leads to more atmospheric escape (Hazra et al., 2020; Louca et al., 2022) than when the star is in its quiescent phase. Stellar CMEs enhance the stellar wind conditions, increasing the particle density and velocity of stellar wind as well as its embedded magnetic field, and hence, when a CME interacts with the planetary atmosphere, the planetary atmosphere gets disturbed significantly (Cherenkov et al., 2017; Hazra et al., 2022). Recently, Hazra et al. (2022) studied the effect of CMEs on the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HD189733b and found that CMEs are very effective in stripping the planetary atmospheric material, increasing mass-loss rate and enhancing the transit signature in the Ly-\alpha line. Similar observational enhancement of transit depth from visit to visit in Ly-\alpha and helium lines is also reported due to the interaction of CME (strong stellar wind case) with the planetary atmosphere (Rumenskikh et al., 2022). However, Odert et al. (2020) modeled the interaction of CME with the planetary atmosphere for the same system (HD189733b) without any significant difference in the Ly-\alpha transit. Cherenkov et al. (2017) also studied the effect of CMEs on hot Jupiters using a time-dependent simulation and reported an enhancement in the atmospheric mass-loss rate. Most of the previous studies used hydrodynamical (HD) simulation to capture the effect of CMEs on the exoplanetary atmospheres. However, close-in gas giants (e.g., hot Jupiter and warm Neptunes) possibly have magnetic fields (Cauley et al., 2019) and, because CMEs are highly magnetized plasma ejections from host stars, it is very important to consider the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) interaction between a CME and planetary magnetosphere. In this paper, we investigate the effects of different magnetic field configurations embedded in CMEs and on the atmospheric escape from a hot Jupiter. We assume a dipolar planetary magnetosphere and vary the orientation of the embedded magnetic field in CMEs to understand how different CME magnetic structures will affect the planetary magnetosphere and corresponding mass-loss rate. We also predict the transit absorption in the Ly-\alpha line during the passage of the different CMEs over the planetary atmosphere. The structure of the paper is as follows. In the next Section, we discuss our 3D radiative MHD model and present the result of the quiescent case scenario where only the stellar wind is interacting with the planetary magnetosphere. In Section 3, we explain different orientations of the magnetic field in CMEs and discuss their interaction with the planetary magnetosphere. The mass-loss rate for each considered case is also computed in this section. The synthetic Ly-\alpha transit calculations and plausible observation of these predicted transit spectra are presented in Section 4. Finally, we conclude our findings in Section 5"
