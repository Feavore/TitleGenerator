https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09985v1,Optical response of edge modes in time-reversal symmetric topological superconductors,"Topological superconductors and Majorana edge modes at their boundaries have been theoretically predicted. However, their experimental observation remains controversial. Recent theoretical studies suggest that chiral Majorana edge modes exhibit distinct spatially-resolved optical conductivity compared to chiral Dirac edge modes. In this work, we investigate the optical conductivity and spatially-resolved optical conductivity induced by Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes under time-reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry. We conduct numerical calculations and analytical calculations with edge effective theory for two-dimensional {\mathbb{Z}}_{2} topological insulators, strong topological superconductors, and topological crystalline superconductors. Our results show that even under time-reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes exhibit different optical responses.","Since the theoretical discovery of Majorana fermions in topological superconductors, their experimental realization has been awaited for the past decades. Representative examples of theoretical predictions include edge modes of one-dimensional p-wave superconductors [1] and two-dimensional p+{\mathrm{i}}p superconductors [2]. Indeed, enormous efforts have been made to realize these systems [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. One of the most difficult challenges is the detection of Majorana fermions. There exist a lot of proposals to solve this problem, such as zero-bias peaks in the differential conductance, the fractional Josephson effect, and the half-integer conductance plateau [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], and actual experiments have been conducted [19, 20, 21, 22]. However, results obtained using the existing methods are sometimes controversial due to the difficulty in distinguishing effects caused by Majorana fermions from those arising from other physical phenomena [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. Therefore, it is still important to develop new schemes to detect Majorana fermions. One of the promising routes for realizing topological superconductors is the proximity effect [29, 30]. For example, topological superconductivity has been proposed in hybrid systems composed of topological insulators and superconductors [31, 32]. Another proposal is the surface superconductivity proximity-induced by bulk superconductivity of topological materials [33, 34, 35]. In these cases, in addition to the difficulty of detecting Majorana fermions, it is crucial to distinguish between Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes, which originate from topological superconductors and insulators, respectively. Recently, Ref. [36] has theoretically proposed that the spatially-resolved optical conductivity, which measures the conductivity when light is applied to only part of the system, can distinguish between the Majorana edge mode in the p+{\mathrm{i}}p superconductor and the Dirac edge mode in a Chern insulator. Although both p+{\mathrm{i}}p superconductor and Chern insulator exhibit similar linear dispersions in their edge modes, the difference between Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes leads to distinct behaviors in the spatially-resolved optical conductivity. Topological superconductivity can coexist with time-reversal and/or crystalline symmetries. In such cases, unlike in p+{\mathrm{i}}p superconductors, the number of edge states is generally greater than one, which can potentially lead to more complex optical responses. For example, it is known that the lowest-energy optical excitation can occur in multiband superconducting systems. Since quantum spin Hall insulators do not exhibit optical excitations between edge states at the same momentum [37], the presence of such low-energy optical excitations in bulk-gapped superconductors may serve as a signature of Majorana edge modes. Even if such optical excitations do not occur, considering the success of spatially-resolved optical conductivity in p+{\mathrm{i}}p superconductors [36], it is reasonable to expect that spatially-resolved optical conductivity could also serve as a signature of Majorana edge modes in the presence of time-reversal and crystalline symmetries. However, the optical response of Majorana edge modes in superconducting systems with time-reversal and crystalline symmetries has not been fully investigated. To address this issue, in this work we study optical responses in various topological superconductors with time-reversal and crystalline symmetries [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. By combining symmetry analysis, numerical simulations, and analytical calculations, we compare the behavior of optical and spatially-resolved optical conductivities in systems with Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes. Our strategy is as follows. First, we diagnose whether or not low-energy optical excitations between edge modes with the same momentum can occur based on symmetry. If such optical excitations are allowed, the behavior is distinct from that in the two-dimensional {\mathbb{Z}}_{2} topological insulator [44, 45, 46, 47], as mentioned above. If such optical excitations are absent, we then examine the behavior of the spatially-resolved optical conductivity. We reveal that the spatially-resolved optical conductivity for topological superconductors generally depends on the energy of the incident photons in the low-energy regime, while that for \mathbb{Z}_{2} topological insulators does not depend. This finding suggests that optical conductivity and spatially-resolved optical conductivity could serve as valuable tools for the experimental observation of Majorana edge modes in a broader range of topological superconductors. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce our framework utilized throughout this paper. In Sec. III, we present the calculation results for the optical conductivity and spatially-resolved optical conductivity for the two dimensional {\mathbb{Z}}_{2} topological insulator, strong topological superconductor, and topological crystalline superconductor. The conclusion is provided in Sec. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09966v1,"Assessing the possible superconductivity in doped perovskite hydride KMgH3:
Effects of lattice anharmonicity and spin fluctuations","The superconducting properties of uniformly hole-doped perovskite hydride \ceKMgH3 with varying doping concentration and lattice parameter corresponding to different pressures were investigated from first principles. The superconducting transition temperature (\displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}}) was predicted from the density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT), where the effects of lattice anharmonicity and spin-fluctuation were considered and examined. Although lattice anharmonicity tends to suppress superconductivity around the edge of dynamical stability, where the phase is stabilized due to anharmonic effects, \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} is enhanced. In the hole-doped \ceKMgH3, substantial spin-fluctuation (SF) effects were discovered, which counters the phonon-mediated pairing and decreases \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}}. Such anomalously strong SF is evaluated for similar hydrides, where the hydrogen 1-\displaystyle s bands are isolated at the Fermi level, and its correlation with the electronics density of states was explored.","Hydrogen-rich compounds, along with metallic hydrogen, have long been predicted to be promising candidates for realizing high-temperature superconductivity[1, 2, 3]. The discovery of superconductivity in sulfur hydride under pressure in 2015[4] again stimulated the enthusiasm for hydride superconductors. However, hydride superconductors which exhibit high transition temperatures (\displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}}) almost inevitably require a high pressure (e.g., \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} \displaystyle\sim 203 K for \ceH3S under 200 GPa[4], \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} \displaystyle\sim 260 (250) K for \ceLaH10 under 200 (170) GPa[5, 6], \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} \displaystyle\sim 224 (220) K for \ceYH6 under 166 (183) GPa[7, 8]). Despite being a challenging task, searching for hydride superconductors that retain a moderate value of \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} at a much lower or even near ambient pressure is still tempting. So far, some predictions on ambient pressure hydride superconductors have been proposed, such as \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}}~{}\sim 54 K for metastable \ceAl4H, which adopts a perovskite-like crystal structure[9], and \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} between 45K to 80K for the family of \ceMg2XH6 compounds, where X = Rh, Ir, Pd or Pt[10]. The theory of conventional superconductors was first given by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer[11] (BCS theory), according to which the superconducting transition temperature \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} can be estimated from T_{\mathrm{c}}=\Theta_{D}{\text{exp}}\left(-\frac{1}{N\left(\epsilon_{\text{F}% }\right)V}\right), (1) where \displaystyle\Theta_{D}, \displaystyle N(\epsilon_{\text{F}}), and \displaystyle V denote the Debye temperature, electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level, and the pairing interaction, respectively. Based on the BCS theory, materials with larger DOS at the Fermi surface and stronger lattice vibrations are thought to possibly have a higher \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}}. So far, much effort has been put into the prediction of novel hydride superconductors, developing high-throughput screening or machine learning models for the prediction relying on the database composed of materials satisfying these two conditions[12, 13, 14, 15]. In this paper, we assess the possible superconductivity in hole-doped perovskite \ceKMgH3 (Fig. 1). Studies on superconducting perovskite hydrides were few, possibly due to the lack of stability in metallic perovskite hydrides. Yagyu et al. measured \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} of \ceAPdH3-x (A = Sr, Ba), only to find out they do not exceed 2K[16]. Cerqueira et al. predicted the \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} of \ceKCdH3, a metallic perovskite hydride at ambient pressure, to be 23.4K from the density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT)[17]. Figure 1: (a) Crystal structure of perovskite hydride \ceKMgH3. The blue, red, and yellow balls represent K, Mg, H atoms respectively. (b) Illustration of the Brillouin zone. Although \ceKMgH3 is a known compound[18], the superconductivity possibility of it brought by doping has not yet been explored. The parent compound \ceKMgH3 is an insulator, while its valence states are wholly formed by the hydrogen 1s orbitals. The hole doping is intriguing in that it should realize the metallic state strongly coupling to the hydrogen vibrations. Perovskite oxyhydrides \ceATiO2H (A=K, Rb, Cs), which also share similar valence features, have been predicted to show the hole-doping induced superconductivity that coexists with nonzero polarization[19]. Such kinds of oxyhydrides were also reported to have been synthesized[20, 21, 22, 23]. The undoped \ceKMgH3 already shows a excellent stability from ambient pressure to 100GPa, and its highest optical phonon branches can reach around 1,300 \displaystyle\text{cm}^{-1} at ambient pressure. Despite all the conditions favoring high \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}}, hydride superconductors may face some intrinsic drawbacks. Hydrides usually feature strong lattice vibrations, giving rise to large lattice anharmonicity[24, 25], which impact superconductivity[26, 27, 28, 29]. Errea et al. reported that electron-phonon coupling is reduced by approximately 30% in \ceH3S under pressure[28], while Sano et al. showed that anharmonicity reduces the \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} of \ceH3S under 250 GPa by 12%[26]. Errea et al. also claimed that for palladium hydrides, accounting for anharmonicity reduces the predicted \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} from 47 K 5 K, in better agreement with experimental values[27]. As a matter of fact, lattice anharmonicity in the \cePdH system has been extensively studied and is thought to be one of the reasons for the inverse isotope effect[30, 31, 32]. Nevertheless, apart from its influence on \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}}, anharmonicity is also known to possibly stabilize crystal structures. Errea et. al. suggested that lattice anharmonicity is the key to the phase stability of \displaystyle Fm\bar{3}m \ceLaH10 under pressures between 129 GPa to 214 GPa[33], and \displaystyle Im\bar{3}m \ceH3S at 155 GPa[34]. In addition, we raise the potential importance of spin fluctuation (SF) in the hydride metals. SF is considered to play against the phonon-mediated pairing between electrons, as the ferromagnetic correlation induced by the exchange coupling tends to destroy the Cooper pairs in the singlet state[35]. In some transition metals with anomalously high magnetic susceptibility, \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}}’s predicted from a phonon-mediated pairing mechanism are known to yield overestimated values, which are assumed to be a consequence of neglecting the SF effects in these metals[35, 36, 37]. Some of the authors of this paper have shown in their previous study within the SCDFT framework that in elementary superconductors, SF reduces \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}}[38, 39]. The \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} reduction was substantial in 3d systems like vanadium. According to the degree of the orbital radius, the hydride metals, formed by the extremely localized 1s orbital, are likely to suffer from strong SF. Nevertheless, the SF-induced reduction of \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} in hydride superconductors has rarely been investigated, and, to our knowledge, there appears to be no paper on this matter, as the effects are considered trivial. In this paper, we will show a quantitative examination of such effects on hydride superconductors in which the conduction bands are mainly isolated hydrogen bands using the hole-doped \ceKMgH3 as an example. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the stability and superconductivity of hole-doped \ceKMgH3 from first principles. By systematic examinations across different lattice parameters and doping levels, and taking into account the effects of lattice anharmonicity and SF in the meantime, we hope to find the optimal conditions for \displaystyle T_{\mathrm{c}} in this material , and to get a deeper understanding of hydride superconductors."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09925v1,Optimal coloring and strain-enhanced superconductivity in LiBC,"Boron-rich lithium borocarbides are promising candidates for phonon-mediated high-temperature superconductors due to their metallic \sigma-bonding electrons. Here, we use the cluster expansion method to identify energetically stable configurations (colorings) of \ceLi2B3C and \ceLi3B4C2, which are characterized by a distinctive pattern of alternating B-B and B-C zigzag chains. Surprisingly, the optimal configuration of \ceLi2B3C exhibits an extremely low superconducting transition temperature of T_{c}<0.03 K, which is attributed to the suppression of deformation potentials near the Fermi level caused by the specific electron filling of B-B zigzag chains. However, the \sigma-bonding electrons at the Fermi level are highly sensitive to external strain or pressure. Specifically, applying a -5% compressive uniaxial strain can significantly enhance the electron-phonon coupling and the Eliashberg spectral function, boosting up T_{c} to 37 K. This work not only presents a novel strategy for achieving phonon-mediated high-temperature superconductivity in \ceLi_nB_n+1C_n-1 compounds but also provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between electronic structure and superconducting interaction.","The allure of high-temperature superconductivity continues to fascinate the scientific community worldwide. The metallization of strong chemical bonding electrons is considered a pivotal factor in the formation of high-T_{c} superconducting pairings in copper oxides Bednorz and Müller (1986), \ceMgB2 Nagamatsu et al. (2001) and hydrogen-rich materials under ultrahigh pressure Drozdov et al. (2015). The search for new superconductors with high transition temperature (T_{c}) has attracted tremendous interest since the discovery of superconductivity. Inspired by the discovery of high-T_{c} superconductivity in cuprates and \ceMgB2, the metallization of \sigma-bonding electrons has been proposed as a universal guiding principle Gao et al. (2015a) for discovering high-temperature superconductors. This concept has been widely applied to numerous phonon-mediated superconductors An and Pickett (2001); Gao et al. (2015b); Deng et al. (2003, 2005); Lee and Pickett (2004); Drozdov et al. (2015); Peng et al. (2017); Gu et al. (2021); Geng et al. (2023, 2024). A \sigma-bond is the strongest covalent bond formed by the direct overlap of two atomic orbitals, each housing a single electron. In contrast, a \sigma-antibonding state typically corresponds to a repulsive interaction in a diatomic molecule. However, in solid materials, \sigma-antibonding states can also play a crucial role by contributing to the attractive interaction that binds electrons together, as highlighted in Ref. Zhang et al. (2023). Electronic bands originating from hybridized \sigma-bonding or \sigma-antibonding orbitals are often situated far below or above the Fermi level. As discussed in Refs. Gao et al. (2015a); Zhang et al. (2023), there are a number of ways to metalize \sigma-hybrized electrons. One way of inducing metallization involves the application of external pressure, as demonstrated in the hydrogen-rich high-T_{c} superconductor, SH3, under ultra-high pressure Drozdov et al. (2015). This external pressure, combined with the chemical forces exerted on hydrogen atoms by neighbouring atoms, can stabilize crystal structures. It can also alter the electron filling factor, raising the Fermi level crossing the bands formed by the antibonding-\sigma electrons. An alternative approach is through the exploitation of the crystal field effect, as exemplified by magnesium diboride \ceMgB2 Kortus et al. (2001); An and Pickett (2001); Xi (2008); Gao et al. (2015a). In \ceMgB2, the crystal structure consists of alternating layers of magnesium atoms arranged in a triangular lattice and boron atoms in a honeycomb lattice. The crystal field effect induces a strong attraction between the \ceMg^2+ ions and the \pi electrons in the boron layers, lowering the energy of the bands associated with the hybridized \pi orbitals. This interaction elevates the energy of the \sigma-hybridized boron orbitals, bringing them into intersection with the Fermi level. A more general and straightforward strategy is to manipulate the Fermi level by doping. Copper-oxide high-T_{c} superconductors are typical examples of this type. The superconductivity in magnesium diboride \ceMgB2 has spurred interest in exploring other superconductors that exhibit metallic \sigma-bonding electrons Rosner et al. (2002); Dewhurst et al. (2003); Miao et al. (2013); Bazhirov et al. (2014); Gao et al. (2015b); Li et al. (2018); Quan and Pickett (2020); Liu et al. (2024); Yu et al. (2024); Pickett (2006, 2017). Lithium borocarbide LiBC, isoelectronic with \ceMgB2, has garnered significant attention in this context Rosner et al. (2002); Dewhurst et al. (2003). While pure LiBC is a band insulator Fogg et al. (2003a); Karimov et al. (2004), theoretical studies suggest that introducing lithium deficiencies to create hole doping in \ceLi_1-xBC could lead to superconductivity at relatively high critical temperatures Rosner et al. (2002); Dewhurst et al. (2003). However, experimental attempts to synthesize \ceLi_1-xBC with finite lithium deficiencies have not been successful in stabilizing the expected crystal structure Bharathi et al. (2002); Fogg et al. (2003a, b); Souptel et al. (2003); Zhao et al. (2003); Nakamori and Orimo (2004); Fogg et al. (2006), prohibiting the expected metallization of the \sigma-bonding electrons Fogg et al. (2006). To mitigate the lattice instability caused by Li deficiencies, Gao et al. suggested partially substituting C atoms with B atoms in LiBC Miao et al. (2013); Gao et al. (2015a). Through first-principles calculations, they identified two potential superconducting compounds within the \ceLi_nB_n+1C_n-1 series, \ceLi2B3C (n=2) and \ceLi3B4C2 (n=3), which were predicted to exhibit critical transition temperatures exceeding 50 K Gao et al. (2015b). Later on, similar proposals were made by several other groups Miao et al. (2013); Bazhirov et al. (2014); Li et al. (2018). However, determining the optimal configuration of boron and carbon atoms in \ceLi_nB_n+1C_n-1, known as the ”coloring problem” Burdett et al. (1985); Miller (1998), remains a challenge. Gao et al. Gao et al. (2015b) and Bazhirov et al. Bazhirov et al. (2014) investigated the electronic properties of these compounds using hypothetical crystal structures. Other studies Miao et al. (2013); Li et al. (2018) model the substitution effect by employing the virtual crystal approximation. In this work, we employ the cluster expansion method in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) to identify energetically stable configurations, also known as optimal colorings, of \ceLi2B3C and \ceLi3B4C2 Sanchez et al. (1984); De Fontaine (1994); Zunger (1994). Notably, these derived structures deviate significantly from previously proposed configurations with same chemical stoichiometries Gao et al. (2015b), particularly in their atomic arrangements. Our optimal B-C layer configurations are composed of alternating B-B and B-C zigzag chains, whose electronic structures and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) properties differ from the previous calculations. To further investigate these properties, we calculate the electron-phonon coupling properties using the Wannier interpolation technique Giustino et al. (2007); Poncé et al. (2016); Lee et al. (2023) and find that the critical temperature (T_{c}) of \ceLi2B3C is unexpectedly low, less than 0.03 K. However, when compressive uniaxial strain (-5%) is applied, the electronic structure of \ceLi2B3C is significantly modified, dramatically increasing T_{c} by over four orders of magnitude to approximately 37 K. This remarkable result provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between electronic structure and phonon-mediated superconductivity. This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we optimize the lattice structures of \ceLi_nB_n+1C_n-1 and compare them to previously reported configurations. Sec. III focuses on the analysis of electronic structures. In Sec. IV, we investigate phonon-mediated superconductivity and evaluate the deformation potential. Sec. V explores the impact of strain on both phonon-mediated superconductivity and electronic structures. Finally, we present our discussion and conclusions in Sec. VI. For clarity, we abbreviate the previously proposed \ceLi2B3C/\ceLi3B4C2 structures from Gao, Lu, and Xiang’s work Gao et al. (2015b) as \ceLi2B3C/\ceLi3B4C2 (GLX), while the configurations proposed in this study are denoted as \ceLi2B3C/\ceLi3B4C2 (TW)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09793v1,Large critical fields in superconducting TiIrO from spin-orbit coupling,"The recently synthesized \eta-carbide-type superconductors exhibit large critical fields. A notable example is Ti4Ir2O, for which the upper critical field strongly violates the Pauli paramagnetic limit, behavior that is unusual for cubic materials that preserve inversion symmetry. Here, by combining density functional theory (DFT) and analytic modeling, we provide an explanation for this enhanced Pauli limiting field. We show that the nonsymmorphic Fd\overline{3}m symmetry implies that the electronic states near the X points exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which leads to a vanishing effective g-factor and enables the enhanced Pauli limiting field. Furthermore, our DFT results reveal a Van Hove singularity (VHS) peak near the X points, accounting for \sim65% of the total density of states (DOS), occurring near the chemical potential. We propose that the strong SOC and enhanced DOS in the vicinity of the X points provide the origin of the observed enhanced critical field. This leads to a prediction that the magnetic field will lead to a strongly momentum-dependent gap suppression. The gap due to electronic states away from (near to) the X points will be rapidly (slowly) suppressed by fields.","References Okuno et al. [2004] K. Okuno, A. Shikov, and N.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10335v1,Topological vortices in planar S-TI-S Josephson junctions,"We discuss the Josephson vortices in planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) junctions, where the TI section is narrow and long. We are motivated by recent experiments, especially by those in junctions of Corbino ring geometry, where non-zero critical current was observed at low temperatures even if a non-zero phase winding number (fluxoid) was enforced in the ring by the perpendicular magnetic field. In this paper we focus on the “atomic” limit in which the low-energy bound states of different vortices do not overlap. In this limit we can associate the non-vanishing critical current with the irregularities (disorder) in the junction’s width. We also discuss the microwave spectroscopy of the Josephson vortices in the atomic limit and observe particularly simple selection rules for the allowed transitions.","The Majorana zero modes in artificial topological superconductors Kitaev (2001) have been in focus of both academic and industrial research for the last two decades. The leading proposals allowing for experimental realization are the 1-D semiconducting wires proximitized by regular superconductors Oreg et al. (2010); Lutchyn et al. (2010), the extended planar (2-D) Josephson junctions on the surface of a 3-D topological insulatorFu and Kane (2008, 2009)(Fu & Kane proposal) and the chains of magnetic adatoms on superconducting surfaces Nadj-Perge et al. (2013). All these systems have by now been studied experimentally (see, e.g., Ref. Aghaee et al., 2023 (and many earlier works) for 1-D wires, Ref. Yue et al., 2024 for the planar Josephson junctions and Ref. Nadj-Perge et al., 2014 for the chains of adatoms). This paper is dedicated to the study of the planar (Fu & Kane) platform and is motivated by the recent spark in the associated experimental activity Zhang et al. (2022); Yue et al. (2024); Park et al. (2024). Whereas Ref. Yue et al., 2024 addresses the Fraunhofer pattern in a long Josephson junction with open ends, in Refs. Zhang et al., 2022; Park et al., 2024 long Josephson junctions of Corbino geometry were investigated. We focus here on the Corbino geometry as it allows to avoid the complications related to the boundary conditions at the open ends. Indeed, in the Josephson junctions with the open ends one measures Yue et al. (2024) the standard Fraunhofer pattern since arbitrary magnetic flux is allowed in the junction. The simplest approach of integrating the local current-phase relation over the length of the junction might be a good first approximation, but might also miss the subtle effects related to the boundary conditions at the open ends, i.a., the 1-D Majorana modes having to hybridize there with the continuum of modes. The Corbino geometry avoids all these complications but, on the other hand, is subject to flux (fluxoid) quantization. Thus one cannot measure the full Fraunhofer pattern, but only the discrete points corresponding to the integer number of flux quanta, where naively the Josephson current should vanish. We aim at elucidating the recently observed Zhang et al. (2022); Park et al. (2024) non-vanishing Josephson currents in circular Corbino junctions when a non-zero number of flux quanta (fluxoids) are trapped in the ring. These should be closely related to the lifting of the zero nodes of the Fraunhofer pattern in the open-end junctions Yue et al. (2024). The fact that these Josephson currents emerge only at temperatures much lower than the superconducting gap, induced in the TI, leads us to believe that they are related to the low-energy Andreev states in the Josephson vortices (a.k.a. Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) statesCaroli et al. (1964)). To explain this phenomenon we examine the atomic limit of the Josephson vortex lattice created by an external magnetic field in the TI part of the junction Grosfeld and Stern (2011); Potter and Fu (2013); Hegde et al. (2020); Backens et al. (2022). We observe that irregularities (disorder) in, e.g., the width of the junction can explain the presence of the observed Josephson currents, as conjectured in Ref. Zhang et al., 2022. Moreover, our simple estimates reproduce correctly the magnitude of the current observed in the experiment Park et al. (2024). We also study the current profiles associated with the individual CdGM states and show how these are modified by the disorder. Finally, we investigate the microwave spectroscopy of the low-energy Andreev (CdGM) states. We predict very peculiar selection rules for the allowed transitions, characteristic for the Josephson vortices in long topological Josephson junctions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09907v1,Density-wave like behavior in a new Kagome material CeRuSi,"Kagome materials with inherent geometric frustration can produce many interesting physical properties, such as flat bands, quantum spin liquid, chiral magnetism, superconductivity and density-wave orders. Sometimes, the localized 4f electrons from Ce atoms coupled with other conduction electrons would also give rise to the flat bands near the Fermi level, and results in the formation of heavy fermion. Thus, it is highly probable that kagome material incorporating Ce element will display nontrivial physical properties. In this study, we present a new Kagome material belonging to the trinary Laves phase, Ce2Ru3Si, in which kagome plane is formed by Ru atoms. Electrical transport and specific heat measurements reveal a density-wave like transition. A Curie-Weiss behavior is observed in low-temperature region. Meanwhile we also find a relatively large specific coefficient \gamma_{n}(0). The calculated Wilson ratio R_{\mathrm{W}}\propto{\chi(0)/\gamma_{n}} is approximately 3.1, indicating a moderate electron correlation effect. Chemical doping of Ir at the Ru site rapidly suppresses this density-wave like transition, while Mo doping leads to a gradual decrease in transition temperature. Theoretical calculation indicates both the Ce-4f and Ru-4d electronic bands cross the Fermi level, forming a Mexican-hat-shape Fermi surface close to the Fermi energy, potentially accounting for the observed density-wave like transition. Our findings provide an useful platform for investigating how hybridization between 4f and 4d electrons influences the electronic transport, and the relationship between the density-wave transition and kagome structure.","The kagome lattice consists of interwoven triangles and hexagons, which inherently leads to geometric frustration[1, 2]. The band structure of the ideal kagome lattice exhibits the Dirac point, van Hove singularity (vHS), and flat band[3, 4, 5], with the latter two having a high density of states and large effective mass which may lead to strong electron correlations. With strong interaction between charged particles, an instability of Fermi surface may be induced, leading to various quantum phenomenon, such as superconductivity, charge density wave (CDW), pair density wave (PDW), and complex magnetism[6]. In contrast, the Dirac point with linear dispersion may results in various topological states[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Thus, the system with a kagome structure provides fertile ground for studying the interplay between magnetism, electron correlation, superconductivity and topology. In recent years, a new prototype structure based on kagome lattice was discovered, namely AV3Sb5 (A = K, Cs, Rb)[12], leading to extensive research on interplay and competition between various phases such as superconductivity, CDW, PDW, nematic and stripe order[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. With replacing V by Cr in this structure, a new kagome material CsCr3Sb5 was found to exhibit strong electron correlation, noteworthy that a flat band exists near the Fermi level; under high pressure, the density-wave transition in this sample was suppressed and unconventional superconductivity was observed[21]. Additionally, the CDW also has been discovered in antiferromagnetic ordered kagome phase FeGe[22], etc.. Compared to 3d elements like V, Cr, Fe, the element Ru possesses 4d electrons, and exhibits relatively weaker electron correlation but quite often shows magnetic feature, which may lead to other novel phenomena. With Ru atoms forming a kagome net, LaRu3Si2 possesses the highest superconducting transition temperature (T_{\mathrm{c}}) of 7.8 K among other compounds with the same structure, RT_{3}Si2 and RT_{3}B2 (R = rare earth metal, T = transition metal), highlighting the significant role of Ru’s 4d electrons in forming the superconductivity[23]. Very recently, charge order above room temperature in La(Ru1-xFex)3Si2 was also discovered[24]. Additionally, superconductor CeRu2 with C15 Laves phase, in which superconductivity may strongly intertwined with magnetism, features a Ru-kagome plane oriented perpendicular to the [111] direction[25, 26]. Despite incorporating rare-earth element Ce into the lattice, contrary to predictions, its 4f electrons are not localized; instead, they hybridize with conduction electrons leading to an intermediate valence state for Ce ions[27]. This hybridization involving 4f electrons can give rise to various correlated electronic phenomena such as heavy fermion, mixed-valence system, and unconventional superconductivity[28, 29]. The Laves phase is characterized by three predominant structural types, the hexagonal C14 type (MgZn2-type), the cubic C15 type (MgCu2-type), and the hexagonal C36 type (MgNi2-type)[30, 31]. Traditional Lave phase includes binary compounds with common formula of AB_{2}, however if substituting non-kagome-transition-metal element with non-metallic element Si will generate trinary Lave phase, such as Sc2Ir4-xSix, Mg2Ni3Si, and superconductor Mg2Ir3Si[32, 33]. In this study, we present a new Ru-based kagome material with the hexagonal structure: Ce2Ru3Si. Transport measurements reveal a shoulder-like behavior in the temperature dependent resistivity curve, indicative of a potential density-wave like transition; this finding is corroborated by specific heat measurements. Meanwhile, the magnetization curve basically obeys the Curie-Weiss law, and no obvious anomaly is observed. This discrepancy may be attributed to an enhanced delocalization degree of the 4f-electrons due to their hybridization with conduction electrons. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both the 4f-electron bands from Ce ions and the 4d-electron bands from Ru ions cross the Fermi level; notably, the 4d band from Ru forms a Mexican-hat-shaped band near the Fermi level, which gives rise to a vHS."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09664v1,Enhanced Kohn-Luttinger topological superconductivity in bands with nontrivial geometry,"We study the effect of the electron wavefunction on Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity. The role of the wavefunction is encoded in a complex form factor describing the topology and geometry of the bands. We show that the electron wavefunction significantly impacts the superconducting transition temperature and superconducting order parameter. We illustrate this using the lowest Landau level form factor and find exponential enhancement of T_{c} for the resulting topological superconductor. We find that the ideal band geometry, which favors a fractional Chern insulator in the flat band limit, has an optimal T_{c}. Finally, we apply this understanding to a model relevant to rhombohedral graphene multilayers and unravel the importance of the band geometry for achieving robust superconductivity.","References Peotta and Törmä [2015] S.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09196v1,Coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior and level spacing statistics in a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor,"Motivated by recent studies of the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian [K. Swaminathan et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043215 (2023)], we introduce the on-site/bond singlet (OBS) model, a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor, in order to better understand the quasiparticle localization and interesting coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior present in the former model. The OBS model is the sum of terms that have direct counterparts in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian, each of which is parameterized by a coupling constant. Exact diagonalization reveals that the energy spectrum and non-equilibrium dynamics of the OBS model are essentially the same as that of the dice lattice for some values of the coupling constants. The quasiparticle localization and breaking of ergodicity manifest in a striking manner in the level spacing distribution. Its near Poissonian form provides evidence for the existence of local integrals of motion and establishes the OBS model as a non-trivial integrable generalization of the projected Creutz ladder Hamiltonian. These results show that level spacing statistics is a promising tool to study quasiparticle excitations in flat band superconductors.","The groundbreaking discovery of superconductivity in magic angle-twisted bilayer graphene [1] has been an important milestone in unveiling the origin of unconventional superconductivity. In unconventional superconductors, the attractive force that holds Cooper pairs together does not appear to originate from the electron-phonon interaction. Rather, it may be mediated by other bosonic modes of purely electronic origin such as spin excitations [2]. In many unconventional superconductors including twisted bilayer graphene, superconducting domes in the temperature-density phase diagram arise when doping away from commensurate values of the electron density, where insulating phases characterized by various forms of broken symmetries reside. This is the case of copper and iron-based superconductors [3, 4, 5] and also of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene in which the nature of the symmetry breaking in the correlated insulating phases is currently under intense investigation [6, 7, 8]. Twisted bilayer graphene and related moiré materials offer exciting possibilities since their properties can be tuned even in-situ in ways that are not possible with bulk superconductors such as copper and iron-based ones [9, 10, 11]. For instance, it is possible to easily change the electron density by electrostatic gating without the need for doping, which inevitably introduces disorder [12, 13, 14]. Thus, using a single sample it is possible to explore the entire phase diagram. Another way to tune the electronic properties, which has proven crucial for twisted bilayer graphene, is the possibility of carefully controlling the relative twist angle between the two graphene sheets. Depending on the angle, the reconstruction of the electronic band structure can be very pronounced with almost flat bands forming near the Fermi level. It is precisely at the magic angle, at which the relevant bands have minimal bandwidth, that superconductivity emerges together with a wide variety of other correlated phases. Remarkably, the ratio between superconducting critical temperature and Fermi energy in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene is among the highest in known superconducting materials, even if the critical temperature is small in absolute sense (\sim 1.7\,\mathrm{K}) [1]. Therefore, twisted bilayer graphene represents the first experimental validation of the general idea of increasing the critical temperature of the superconducting transition by means of band structure engineering, more specifically by realizing flat bands [15, 16, 17, 10, 18] characterized by nontrivial geometrical and topological properties. Indeed, only if the quantum metric of the flat band is nonzero, long range phase coherence can be established and the ensuing superconducting phase is robust against thermal fluctuations [19, 20, 10]. Figure 1: (a) Initial state \ket{\psi(0)}=\hat{d}^{\dagger}_{6\uparrow}\hat{d}^{\dagger}_{9\uparrow}\hat{d% }^{\dagger}_{9\downarrow}\hat{d}^{\dagger}_{12\uparrow}\ket{\emptyset} with an on-site pair on site l=6 and two unpaired particles on sites l=3 and 12 (N_{\uparrow},N_{\downarrow}=3,1) in a chain of length L=12 with periodic boundary conditions. The size of the circles denotes the particle density and the color denotes the spin density on a scale from white S_{z}=0 to red S_{z}=+1/2. (b) Time-averaged asymptotic density obtained from the time evolution with the Hamiltonian \mathcal{\hat{H}}_{\lambda_{2},\lambda_{3}} of the on-site/bond singlet (OBS) model (8) with \lambda_{2}=\lambda_{3}=0. The on-site pair is trapped in between the localized particles and the spin density is frozen. (c) Same as b, but for \lambda_{2}=0 and \lambda_{3}=1. The evolution dynamics is non-ergodic as the asymptotic particle and spin density distributions retain memory of the positions of the unpaired particles. (d) Same as b and c but for \lambda_{2}=\lambda_{3}=1. In this case the asymptotics particle and spin density distributions are almost uniform, an indication of ergodic behavior. Whereas the general idea of using flat bands for increasing the critical temperature is very promising, there are considerable obstacles on the way to make it practical. One of the most serious ones is the theoretical challenge posed by the class of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, which naturally includes materials with quasi-flat bands in the band structure. A typical approach for simplifying the many-body problem is to reduce the Hilbert space size by projecting the full Hamiltonian on a subset of relevant bands, some of which may be flat [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. This is a technique used extensively in the context of the fractional quantum Hall effect for instance [28, 29, 30, 31]. When projecting onto a flat band or a group of degenerate flat bands, the result consists of a Hamiltonian that departs substantially from the Hubbard model paradigm since it contains many different interaction terms (product of four field operators). Particularly important for the transport properties and superconductivity in the flat band limit are terms of the form \hat{d}_{i\uparrow}^{\dagger}\hat{d}_{i\downarrow}^{\dagger}\hat{d}_{j% \downarrow}\hat{d}_{j\uparrow}, where i and j label different electronic orbitals, that enable the correlated hopping of a whole Cooper pair at once [22, 23]. These terms are ignored in a Hubbard-like model, where the only interaction term is strictly local, but they are important if the flat band Wannier functions have a large spatial spread. In general the projected Hamiltonian, that is the Hamiltonian obtained by projecting a given interaction term, including a Hubbard interaction, onto a flat band of a multiorbital lattice model is a complicated object, which is difficult to tackle with available analytical and numerical methods. A possible way out is to study simple idealized models first and then proceed to tackle more realistic and complicated ones. In two dimensions, one of the simplest lattices with flat bands is the dice lattice [32, 33]. Due to the compact nature of the Wannier functions in the dice lattice, the number of terms obtained after the projection on the two lowest flat bands is limited. Moreover, for attractive interactions, the ground state of the projected Hamiltonian is given exactly by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) wave function [23, 25, 34], that is the wave function describing the superconducting state at the mean-field level. The ground state is also stable against thermal fluctuations since the quantum metric is nonzero [35]. Contrary to the ground state, very little is known regarding the nature of the excited states in the dice lattice and in general in flat band superconductors, in particular an outstanding question is whether the quasiparticle excitations are localized [25, 36]. Recent results obtained with exact diagonalization have provided evidence that the dice lattice is an instance of a localized superconductor, that is a superconductor in which the quasiparticle excitations are localized, at least at the level of the projected Hamiltonian. The concept of localized superconductor was introduced originally in the context of strongly disordered materials [37, 38], while the results of Ref. 25 refer to the disorder-free dice lattice. Localization in the latter case is purely a consequence of the band flatness. As shown in Ref. 25, by simulating the exact out of equilibrium dynamics of three and four particles, quasiparticle localization manifests as a weak form of ergodicity breaking, since Cooper pairs are free to propagate and thermalize rapidly, while quasiparticles with nonzero spin diffuse very slowly and retain memory of the initial state for very long times and possibly indefinitely. The breaking of ergodicity and thermalization in closed quantum systems has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years [39, 40, 41], after the idea of many-body localization was put forward as a theoretical concept [42, 43, 44, 45, 46] and subsequently realized with ultracold gases in optical lattices [47, 48, 49]. The fundamental characterization of many-body localization is as a form of emergent integrability, in which the dynamics is frozen and particles remain localized due to an extensive number of local integrals of motion (LIOMs) that appear for strong enough disorder [50, 51, 52, 45, 53]. A form of weak ergodicity breaking called Hilbert space fragmentation can also be the result of the presence of an extensive number of LIOMs since these break up the Hilbert space in many disconnected sectors within which the dynamics is fully ergodic [54, 55]. Hilbert space fragmentation is probably the best way to characterize the non-ergodic quasiparticle dynamics observed in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian. It is highly desirable, but generally very difficult, to be able to produce explicitly an extensive number of LIOMs for a many-body Hamiltonian [56, 57]. By doing so, the Hilbert space dimension can be dramatically reduced and it becomes feasible to numerically simulate large systems. As shown in Ref. 25, in the case of one term in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian the LIOMs are known explicitly and take the same form as the ones of the Creutz ladder and other one-dimensional lattice models with flat bands [24, 58]. More specifically, the conserved quantities are the parities of the occupation numbers of all lattice sites. This means that particles can move around only if they form on-site pairs with zero total spin, while single unpaired particles carrying a nonzero spin are immobile. As a consequence, the spin density distribution is frozen. On the other hand, the remaining terms in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian do not respect this strong dynamical constraint as evidenced by the slowly diffusive spin dynamics. However, this does not rule out that LIOMs with a somewhat more complicated structure may be present and could be at the root of the weak ergodicity breaking observed in the case of the dice lattice. Given that it is very hard to construct explicity the LIOMs of a generic many-body Hamiltonian, if they exist, we resort here to a powerful method for establishing the integrability of a quantum system, namely level spacing statistics [59, 60, 61, 62, 63]. Moreover, rather than tackling directly the projected Hamiltonian of the two-dimensional dice lattice, here we introduce a new model, called the on-site/bond singlet (OBS) model, which is designed to capture as faithfully as possible the symmetries and the dynamics of the dice lattice, but at the same time it is much easier to analyze being one-dimensional and also integrable for some parameters values. The Hamiltonian of the OBS model is introduced in Sec. II, its discrete symmetries are discussed in Sec. II.1, while in Sec. II.2 the considerations that have lead us to conceive this model are presented by relating it to other lattice models, in particular the dice lattice. Indeed, the Hamiltonian of the OBS model \mathcal{\hat{H}}_{\lambda_{2},\lambda_{3}} (8) is parameterized by two coupling constants \lambda_{2} and \lambda_{3}, that multiply terms with direct counterparts in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian [25]. In Sec. III, the same analysis of Ref. 25 is repeated in the case of the OBS model. In particular, it shown in Sec. III.1 that for \lambda_{2}=0 the pattern of degenerate and quasidegenerate states in the OBS model is remarkably similar to that of the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian. The asymptotic particle and spin density distributions obtained under time evolution with the OBS model are illustrated in Fig. 1 and further discussed in Sec. III.2. Depending of the value of the parameters, qualitatively different behaviors are obtained. For \lambda_{2}=\lambda_{3}=0 (Fig. 1b) the propagating on-site pair remains trapped between two localized unpaired particles, which act as impenetrable barriers. This is a direct consequence of the LIOMs imposing the constraint that the parity of the particle number on each site is conserved. For \lambda_{3}\neq 0 and \lambda_{2}=0 (Fig. 1c) the two-particle bound state can propagate throughout the whole chain and the spin density is nonzero also away from the initial positions of the two unpaired particles. However, the dynamics is clearly non-ergodic since both the particle and spin densities are inhomogeneous and retain memory of the initial positions of the unpaired particles. This inhomogeneity disappears for \lambda_{2}\neq 0 since the particle and spin density are almost uniform and compatible with a rapidly thermalizing dynamics (Fig. 1d). In Sec. IV the scattering problem consisting of a two-body bound state impinging on a single unpaired particle is solved in the case \lambda_{2}=0 and the results are used to explain several features of the energy spectrum and the out of equilibrium dynamics of the OBS model. In Sec. V, the level spacing statistics of the OBS model is investigated. The main finding is that the level spacing distribution for \lambda_{2}=0 and arbitrary values of \lambda_{3} is essentially identical to that of the special case \mathcal{\hat{H}}_{0,0}, in which an extensive number of LIOMs is known explicitly. On the other hand, for \lambda_{2}\neq 0 the level spacing distribution closely matches the prediction of random matrix theory. In view of these results, it is possible to conclude that for \lambda_{2}=0 the OBS model is integrable and the partial breaking of ergodicity in the out of equilibrium dynamics is the manifestation of an extensive number of LIOMs obtained by continuously deforming the known LIOMs for \lambda_{3}=0. Finally, in Sec. VI the main results of the present work are summarized and the perspectives for future applications of level spacing statistics to the study of quasiparticle localization and weak ergodicity breaking in lattice models with flat bands are discussed."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08980v1,Orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in 2H-NbS flakes,"Symmetry breaking in a layered superconductor with Ising spin-orbit coupling has offered an opportunity to realize unconventional superconductivity. To be more specific, orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, exhibiting layer-dependent finite-momentum pairing, may emerge in transition metal dichalcogenides materials (TMDC) in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Orbital FFLO state can be more robust against the magnetic field than the conventional superconducting state with zero-momentum pairing . This feature renders its potential in field-resilient superconducting functionality. Although, orbital FFLO state has been reported in NbSe2 and MoS2, it is not yet clear if orbital FFLO state can be a general feature of TMDC superconductor. Here, we report the observation of orbital FFLO state in 2H-NbS2 flakes and its dependence on the thickness of flake. We conclude that the relatively weak interlayer coupling is instrumental in stabilizing orbital FFLO state at higher temperature with respect to the critical temperature and lower magnetic field with respect to paramagnetic limit in NbS2 in comparison to its NbSe2 counterpart.","References Hou et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08969v1,Theory of anomalous Hall effect from screened vortex charge in a phase disordered superconductor,"Motivated by recent experiments showing evidence for chiral superconductivity in an anomalous Hall phase of tetralayer graphene, we study the relation between the normal state anomalous Hall conductivity and that in the phase disordered state above the critical temperature of the superconductor. By a numerical calculation of superconductivity in an anomalous Hall metal, we find that a difference in vortex and antivortex charge is determined by the Fermi surface Berry phase. Combining this with the vortex dynamics in a back-ground supercurrent leads to a Hall response in the phase disordered state of the superconductor that is close to the normal state anomalous Hall response. However, using a gauge-invariant superconducting response framework, we find that while vortex charge is screened by interactions, the screening charge, after a time-delay, reappears in the longitudinal current. Thus, the dc Hall conductivity in this phase, instead of matching the screened vortex charge, matches the ac Hall conductance in the superconducting and normal phase, which are similar.","Multilayer graphene has recently shown evidence of a number of novel phases that can be tuned by gate voltage, magnetic field, temperature and displacement field. These phases include several superconducting phases in twisted systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and also in non-twisted systems [12, 13, 14] some of which are spin triplet. More interestingly, a recent experiment [15] has provided evidence of chiral superconductivity in an anomalous Hall metal phase, which is quite close to systems that have shown quantum anomalous Hall as well as fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases [16]. The occurrence of superconductivity in close proximity to correlated phases has led to many theoretical proposals for the mechanism of superconductivity, some based on strong correlation [17, 18] and others based on the proximity to correlated topological states [19, 20] . Figure 1: Schematic for the origin of anomalous Hall in a 2D superconductor above the BKT transition i.e. so-called phase disordered state. The local supercurrent applies a Magnus force [21] on the vortex-antivortex pair (red and blue discs) in opposite directions. This leads to diffusive motion of the vortices along \pm\hat{x} [22]. The motion of the vortices corresponds to an electric field along y, which is the origin of dissipative transport in the phase disordered state. The difference in vortex-anti-vortex charge \Delta Q_{v}=Q_{-}-Q_{+} that we will numerically show to be related to the normal state anomalous Hall coefficient lead to a Hall current (green arrow) orthogonal to the electric field. We find that many-body screening as well as the far-field phase winding of vortices (shown as the crescents of moving charge) conspire to match the measured dc Hall conductance from vortices to the bulk ac Hall conductance. The peculiar characteristics of the superconducting state such as the pair density wave-character [18], chiral nature [19] as well as the Berry curvature of the band are likely to lead to interesting phenomelogical aspects that are quite independent from the origin of the superconductivity. In fact, quantum geometry, which is a generalization of Berry curvature, has already been shown to have a significant modification of the superfluid stiffness [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30] even in the absence of Berry curvature. Berry curvature of a band leads to more interesting behavior in the form of anomalous Hall conductance [31, 32, 33] in the normal state. This leads to the natural question about how such an anomalous Hall conductance would manifest in a chiral superconducting phase. In fact, chiral superconductivity by itself has been suggested to support an ac Hall response [34, 35]. This chiral response has been conjectured to have a number of interesting consequences such as fractional charge and angular momentum of vortices [36]. However, a gauge invariant treatment of screening effects by the background condensate leads to an effective Chern-Simons theory where the chiral conductivity from purely chiral superconductivity at low wave-vectors is suppressed [37, 38]. The evidence for chiral superconductivity in a purely two dimensional anomalous Hall metal phase [19], where screening effects are reduced and phase disordered superconductivity is seen, motivates us to revisit the question of chiral response and vortex properties of such phases. In this work, we will study the effect of anomalous Hall conductivity in the normal state on the phase disordered state in the superconductor above the Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition [21]. As shown in Fig. 1, the difference in charge densities in the cores of vortices and anti-vortices can lead to an anomalous Hall contribution to the current. We argue that such a contribution can arise from a gauge invariant effective action of a superconductor [39] that includes a Hall response and numerically check that such a contribution indeed appears in a simple model. We then show using the gauge-invariant response that while the vortex charge is screened by many-body interactions, the dynamical screening cloud (crescents in Fig. 1) combine so that the vortex generated dc Hall conductivity is the same as the ac Hall response."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09429v1,"AI-driven inverse design of materials: Past, present and future","The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, particularly such as the one based density functional theory, as well as high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.","Advanced materials form a cornerstone of our modern information society, acting as a key catalyst for technological progress and industrial expansion, advancing at an unprecedented rate [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Their utilization extends across diverse industries such as aerospace, biomedical engineering, energy storage, and information technology, which are all poised to benefit significantly from the integration of innovative materials that can surmount existing constraints [7]. Undoubtedly, the evolution of novel materials is crucial for fostering technological breakthroughs, invigorating economic prosperity, and elevating the standard of living. Generally, materials science is a major scientific discipline dedicated to the study of advanced functional materials. The search for advanced materials through inverse design of materials is an important research field within materials science. Inverse design of materials essentially involves creating an optimization space based on the desired performance attributes of materials. This process strives to establish a high-dimensional, nonlinear mapping from material properties to structural configurations, while adhering to physical constraints. The development of inverse design of materials has garnered widespread attention in academic works and can be categorized into four major paradigms: \bullet Experiment-driven paradigm. The experimental-driven paradigm is the original method of material discovery, and these methods have played a crucial role in propelling the field of materials science forward. For example, Madame Curie used experiments to discover the new elements radium and polonium, Onnes discovered the superconductivity phenomenon in mercury [8], and the discovery of the high-temperature superconducting material MgB2 [9]. However, this experimental-driven paradigm heavily relies on trial-and-error experimentation, individual expertise, and phenomenological scientific theories. Moreover, these methods are characterized by iterative cycles of experiments and observations to determine the properties and behaviors of materials, which is not only time-consuming and resource-intensive but also leads to extended research cycles and increased costs. In materials research, a heavy dependence on personal experience is also common. Although experienced researchers can guide experimental design with their intuition and prior knowledge, this method is limited in terms of reproducibility and scalability. The quantification and transfer of personal experience often face challenges, hindering the process of knowledge accumulation and dissemination [10]. Additionally, personal biases and misunderstandings may arise due to individual backgrounds and cognitive limitations [2]. \bullet Theory-driven paradigm. The theory-driven paradigm emphasizes the key role of theoretical insights and computational models in materials science. This paradigm is characterized by the widespread use of molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamic models to understand and predict material behavior. These developments have, to a certain extent, simplified material research and enhanced the efficiency of investigations into new materials. There are some very famous materials and states of matter that were first predicted by theory and then verified experimentally, and these discoveries have extremely high scientific significance, even winning Nobel Prizes. In 1930, British physicist Paul Dirac derived the existence of “antimatter” from his quantum mechanical equations, suggesting that for every particle there is a corresponding antiparticle [11]. Dirac’s equations first predicted the existence of the positron, the antiparticle of the electron. In 1932, Carl Anderson discovered the positron in cosmic rays, confirming Dirac’s prediction [12]. Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936 for this discovery, and Dirac also received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 for his contributions to quantum mechanics, including the theoretical prediction of antimatter. John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer proposed the BCS theory, which explained the cause of superconductivity—the pairing of electrons to form Cooper pairs, leading to zero electrical resistance [13, 14, 15]. Although the BCS theory itself did not directly predict new materials, it became the foundation for research into low-temperature superconductivity. Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972 for their work. In 2005, Charles Kane and Eugene Mele predicted the existence of the quantum spin Hall effect through topological quantum theory, a phenomenon where edge state conduction occurs without an external magnetic field. This concept laid the foundation for topological insulators. In 2007, scientists first realized the quantum spin Hall effect in HgTe quantum wells, verifying the accuracy of the theory. These classic predictions demonstrate the powerful predictive ability of theoretical physics in the exploration of new materials and phenomena, and also promote the development of experimental physics. Many such theoretical breakthroughs ultimately won the Nobel Prize for experimental verification, marking significant advances in physics. Nevertheless, these theoretical frameworks often require complex mathematical models that are demanding in terms of computational resources and expertise. Their applicability may be limited, especially when it comes to material systems that exhibit multi-scale phenomena and complex interactions. \bullet Computation-driven paradigm. Established on the groundwork of theoretical progress, the computation-driven paradigm has risen alongside the surge in computational power and data accessibility. This paradigm leverages computational models to simulate material behaviors and inform the design process. The application of density functional theory (DFT) [16, 17, 18] and computational chemistry tools like Hartree-Fock theory has revolutionized our ability to predict and optimize material properties. The DFT has played a crucial role in investigating the electronic structure of graphene. It was through the DFT that the zero-band gap structure of graphene was uncovered, a feature that is essential for its electronic properties and holds significant potential for its application in electronic devices [19]. Furthermore, the Hartree-Fock method has been extensively applied in calculating molecular orbitals, such as in studies of water molecules, offering vital insights into their geometric and electronic characteristics [20]. The potency of these methods is clear in their capacity to manage complex systems that were once difficult to dissect. However, reliance on computational models introduces challenges, as the accuracy of predictions heavily relies on model quality and available computational resources. Additionally, high-throughput screening (HTP) and combinatorial screening have become significant methodologies for exploring new materials and systems. This approach greatly expedites the discovery and development of novel materials, particularly in drug discovery, catalyst design, and energy storage material development, where it allows for the parallel assessment of vast compound libraries to identify potential new materials [3]. Despite HTP’s achievements in materials science, challenges remain, including substantial resource requirements for physical or computational experiments, constraints by existing material libraries, and insufficient consideration of intricate relationships between material properties [21]. \bullet AI-driven paradigm. With the dawn of the big data era, materials science has transitioned into an AI-driven paradigm. Artificial Intelligence (AI) marks a significant shift within the engineering field, heralding an era defined by enhanced intelligence and automation. Both the widely utilized auto-regressive models based on the Transformer architecture [22] and the robust diffusion models [23, 24] have made substantial contributions to the advancement of inverse design of materials [25, 26, 27, 28]. The capacity of AI to discern patterns and formulate predictions from data has sparked notable transformations in materials science. By examining vast experimental data and computational simulation outcomes, AI models reveal intricate correlations between material properties and their underlying crystal structures [29, 30]. Furthermore, a recent survey [25] has integrated inverse design methodologies with machine learning models to forecast the mechanical properties of materials, including elastic modulus and yield strength, thus expediting the discovery and development of innovative materials. These data-driven strategies not only bolster the precision of predictions but also considerably shorten material development cycles. Consequently, “machine learning materials discovery” is garnering escalating research interest (See Figure 1 (a)). In parallel, the exponential growth of the total known materials over time highlights the accelerated pace of material discovery processes, with significant contributions from Google’s GNoME [31] and Meta’s OMat24 [32]. Figure 1: Trends in publications and citations in the field of “Machine Learning Materials Discovery” from 2019 to 2024. The left panel (a) illustrates the growth in the number of publications (represented by blue bars) alongside the total citations (depicted by the red line with markers), reflecting a significant increase in both metrics over the past few years. The right panel (b) presents the variation in the total known materials over time on a logarithmic scale, highlighting the acceleration of material discovery processes facilitated by GNoME [31] of Google and OMat24 [32] of Meta. This figure underscores the rapid development within the field of machine learning materials discovery Figure 2: Materials Science Research Paradigms This figure illustrates the evolution of research paradigms in materials science, emphasizing key milestones across various approaches. It highlights the increasing role of artificial intelligence in driving future materials discovery, with AI becoming the dominant force in shaping the field. The experiment-driven paradigm is exemplified by Marie Curie’s Nobel Prize-winning discovery of radium and polonium. The theory-driven paradigm is represented by Dirac’s equation, which predicted the existence of the positron, as well as the quantum spin Hall effect. The computation-driven paradigm is demonstrated through DFT calculations applied to materials such as MgB2, hydride superconductors, and graphene. Finally, the AI-driven paradigm showcases recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, including AlphaFold2, GPT-4, and AI-accelerated materials discovery, signaling the frontier of research in the field. As discussed before, AI-driven methods are not a new technical concept for inverse design of functional materials, but has evolved with the advance of AI over the decades. The experiment-driven and theory-driven paradigms mainly aim to discover new functional materials based on heavily trial-and-error experiments or theoretical models, while latest AI-driven methods concentrate on constructing the hidden mappings between material functions and crystal structures. From conventional experiment methods to data-driven methods, it is an important leap in using modern advanced computational methods to design target functional materials. In Figure 2, we delineate the evolution of materials science discoveries alongside the progression of time and technological advancements. Initially, the confirmation of new materials was primarily achieved through experimentation (such as Madame Curie’s discovery of new elements), which entailed substantial costs and numerous trials. Subsequently, theoretical paradigms were introduced, predicting physical properties that were later experimentally verified (for instance, the prediction and validation of semiconductors). With the advancement of computer technology and the enhancement of computational ability, high-throughput computational methods have become a significant avenue for the discovery of new materials. Ultimately, as the latest generation of technology, AI methods can efficiently generate and screen new functional materials by elucidating the hidden correlations between crystal structures and properties, thereby accelerating the discovery of new materials. In summary, throughout this evolutionary process, technological progress has enabled us to employ more sophisticated methods to expedite the discovery of new functional materials. In the existing literature, the inverse design of materials has been extensively discussed and surveyed [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. However, current surveys often focus on specific machine learning algorithms or particular types of materials, leading to a lack of systematic integration of diverse methodologies and a broad range of material systems. Many existing surveys predominantly concentrate on specific categories of materials or application scenarios, such as topological insulators or high-entropy alloys [33, 34], thereby failing to provide a comprehensive examination of AI-driven inverse design of materials. Specifically, there is a significant absence of comparative and analytical studies across different researches about AI-driven inverse design of materials, which hinders a holistic understanding of the advantages, disadvantages, and applicable contexts of various methodologies. These limitations pose challenges for readers attempting to fully grasp the overarching landscape of AI-driven inverse design of materials, particularly with respect to the dynamic evolution of new methods and their applications. Faced with both opportunities and challenges, it needs more attention on the research and development of AI-driven inverse design of materials. In order to provide a basic understanding of this research filed, this survey aims to address the gaps in the current body of research by comprehensively examining previous studies from two perspectives: the discovery of functional materials based on AI methods and the development of AI methods in materials science. We systematically analyze the latest advancements in AI technologies within the domain of inverse design of materials. We conduct an exhaustive survey of the literature to synthesize the pivotal discoveries, AI methods, and procedural methods in the inverse design of functional materials. We are also aware of several relative survey articles on inverse design of materials [35, 36]. The reference [36] provides an overview of the importance and utilization of graph neural networks (GNNs) within the realms of chemistry and materials science. GNNs can directly process the graphical representations of molecules and materials, thereby capturing the essential information required to characterize these materials. The review further outlines the fundamental principles of GNNs, including commonly used datasets and architectures, and emphasizes their critical role throughout the materials development. Another reference [35] systematically explores the research advancements of geometric GNNs in the applications of materials discovery and drug discovery. It emphasizes the significance of geometric graphs in scientific fields, particularly their ability to capture geometric features such as the three dimensional coordinates of nodes. The survey further defines geometric graphs and compares them with traditional graphs, elucidating their distinct characteristics. Additionally, it summarizes existing models, including invariant GNNs and equivariant GNNs. Our survey presents the latest advancements in functional materials accelerated by machine learning techniques, with particular emphasis on the robust representational capabilities of geometric GNNs. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of advanced generative models and large language models, highlighting their pivotal roles in driving materials discovery. In the end, we have gathered standard datasets and benchmarks that are crucial for material discovery, in order to advance the methods of AI-driven inverse design of materials. “All great achievements take time.”–The inverse design of materials has undergone a long development to achieve the latest successes. Our goal is to delve into the historical progression of material directional design, with a particular focus on the innovative approaches to material discovery that have arisen in the era of artificial intelligence. This survey will shed light on the critical issues inherent in inverse design of materials. Subsequently, we discuss the specific classes of materials that are currently at the forefront of materials science (including superconducting materials, magnetic materials and so on), and detail the AI technologies. We have also compiled a comprehensive overview of the evolution of AI technologies within the materials domain. It is our aspiration that the contributions presented in this paper will propel the field of AI-driven inverse design of materials to new heights of advancement. In what follows, we will introduce the the recent applications of AI-driven method in expediting the inverse design of functional materials in Section 2. We then elaborate on the development history of AI technology in the field of materials science in Section 4. Finally, we will briefly discuss a series of open problems and promising directions in the future in Section 4 and conclude in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08942v1,Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality in superfluid vortex reconnections,"The minimum separation between reconnecting vortices in fluids and superfluids obeys a universal scaling law with respect to time. The pre-reconnection and the post-reconnection prefactors of this scaling law are different, a property related to irreversibility and to energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms. In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and post-reconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behaviour independent of the small-scale regularising dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.","Introduction.— Reconnections are the fundamental events that change the topology of the field lines in fluids and plasmas during their time evolution. Reconnections thus determine important physical properties, such as mixing and inter-scale energy transfer in fluids [1], or solar flares and tokamak instabilities in plasmas [2]. The nature of reconnections is more clearly studied if the field lines are concentrated in well-separated filamentary structures: vortices in fluids and magnetic flux tubes in plasmas. In superfluid helium this concentration is extreme, providing an ideal context: superfluid vorticity is confined to vortex lines of atomic thickness (approximately a_{0}\approx 10^{-10}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm m); a further simplification is that, unlike what happens in ordinary fluids, the circulation of a superfluid vortex is constrained to the quantized value \kappa=h/m=9.97\times 10^{-8}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm m^{2}/s, where m is the mass of one helium atom and h is Planck’s constant. It was in this superfluid context that it was theoretically and experimentally recognized [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] that reconnections share a universal property irrespective of the initial condition: the minimum distance between reconnecting vortices, \delta^{\pm}, scales with time, t, according to the form \delta^{\pm}(t)=A^{\pm}(\kappa|t-t_{0}|)^{1/2}, (1) where t_{0} is the reconnection time, and the dimensionless prefactors A^{-} and A^{+} refer respectively to before (t<t_{0}) and after (t>t_{0}) the reconnection. The same scaling law was then found for reconnections in ordinary viscous fluids [9]. In the case of a pure superfluid at temperature T=0\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm K, theoretical work based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) has shown that A^{+}>A^{-}, that is, after the reconnection, vortex lines move away from each others faster than in the initial approach; this result has been related to irreversibility [10, 11]. Indeed, a geometrical constraint imposes [11] that a piece of vortex length needs to be “deleted” during the reconnection process. In the GP model, this loss is possible by the emission of a rarefaction pulse created immediately after the reconnection [12, 6] which removes some of the kinetic energy and momentum of the vortex configuration. This vortex energy loss depends on the ratio A^{+}/A^{-}, which in turns defines the approaching angle of collision between the vortices, together with other several geometrical quantities [7, 11]. The temporal asymmetry A^{+}>A^{-} can be thus interpreted as a non-trivial manifestation of irreversibility, as it originates from an ideal hydrodynamic process independent of the small-scale regularisation mechanism of the fluid. Indeed, in classical fluid vortex reconnections, although the definition of A^{+} is more delicate as circulation is not necessarily conserved, the same asymmetry A^{+}>A^{-} was reported [9]. Instead of the generation of rarefaction pulses, like in the case of T=0 superfluids, close to the reconnection, the classical fluid creates a series of thin secondary structures that can be then efficiently dissipated by viscous dissipation. The case of superfluid helium at non-zero temperatures is more intriguing. Most experiments are performed at T>1\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm K, a regime in which in addition to quantum vortices, thermal excitations constitute a viscous liquid called the normal fluid. The normal fluid can steal energy from filaments and dissipate it by viscous effects, opening in that way more routes towards irreversibility. Modern visualisation techniques rely on hydrogen/deuterium tracer particles to decorate superfluid vortices [13, 4, 14, 15]. Numerous studies have provided insight into the post-reconnection dynamics and the prefactor A^{+}, but much less is known about A^{-} from experiments due to the challenges of visualising vortices approaching a reconnection. The aim of this Letter is to investigate the role played by the normal fluid in the reconnection dynamics. In particular, given the temperature dependence of the normal fluid’s properties, we study experimentally and numerically the temperature dependence of the prefactors A^{+} and A^{-} and numerically investigate the energy injected in the normal fluid. To achieve this aim we need a more powerful model than the GPE to account not only for the dynamics of the superfluid vortices, but also for the dynamics of the normal fluid. We show that at non-zero temperatures Eq. (1) and the relation A^{+}>A^{-} hold true, in agreement with experiments, revealing, for the first time, a temperature dependence of A^{+}/A^{-}. In addition, we show that a vortex reconnection represents an unusual kind of punctuated energy injection into the normal fluid which acts alongside the well-known (continual) friction. When applied to superfluid turbulence, this last result implies that, if the vortex line density (hence the frequency of reconnections) is large enough, vortex reconnections can maintain the normal fluid in a perturbed state."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08539v1,Evolution of Electronic Correlations in the Ruddlesden-Popper Nickelates,"We report on optical studies of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Lan+1NinO3n+1 with n=2 (La3Ni2O7), n=3 (La4Ni3O10) and n=\infty (LaNiO3). As the number of the NiO6 octahedra layers n grows, the ratio of the kinetic energy determined from the experimental optical conductivity and that from band theory K_{\text{exp}}/K_{\text{band}} increases, suggesting a reduction of electronic correlations. While the strong electronic correlations in the bilayer La3Ni2O7 place it on the verge of the Mott insulating phase, the trilayer La4Ni3O10 and infinite-layer LaNiO3 exhibit moderate electronic correlations, falling into the regime of correlated metals. The evolution of the electronic correlations in Lan+1NinO3n+1 is likely to be dominated by the Ni-d_{z^{2}} orbital. Our results provide important information for understanding the superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.","References Anisimov et al. (1999) V. I. Anisimov, D. Bukhvalov, and T. M.

This simple model enables the computation of the temperature dependence of 2r(T)/N, where N is the total number of conduction electrons and r(T) is the number of Cooper pairs at temperature T. Analyzing 2r(T)/N across various superconductors may provide significant insights into the mechanisms behind high-temperature superconductivity, especially regarding coherence in Cooper pairs.","References (1) N.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08142v1,Evidence for Atomic-Scale Inhomogeneity in Superconducting Cuprate NMR,"In 1990, the Millis, Monien, and Pines (MMP) model and its improvement, the Zha, Barzykin, and Pines (ZBP) model in 1996, emerged as a realistic explanation of the cuprate NMR. These two models assume a single electronic component, translational symmetry, and that the electrons simultaneously have aspects of localized antiferromagnetic (AF) spins and delocalized Cu d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} band states. NMR experiments were routinely fit to these models in the 1990s and early 2000s until they finally failed as NMR experiments developed further. It appears that cuprate theorists have given up on explaining the NMR and the NMR data is forgotten. Here, we assume a two-component model of electrons where the electrons reside in two regions, one metallic with delocalized band states, and the other antiferromagnetic with localized spins. This model breaks translational symmetry. We show that the normal state spin relaxation for the planar Cu, O, and Y atoms in \mathrm{YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}} and their Knight shifts are explained by this two-component model. The temperature dependence of the Cu spin relaxation rate anisotropy in the superconducting state is also explained qualitatively.","I Model for Atomic-Scale Inhomogeneity in Cuprates We assume a planar Cu is inside the metallic region or the AF region with probabilities p_{M} and p_{AF} such that p_{M}+p_{AF}=1. (1) In prior work, we assumed a four-Cu-site plaquette in the metal region was formed for each planar doped hole [18, 19]. Hence, for dopings up to \sim 0.19, this assumption led to p_{M}=4x where x is the hole doping per planar Cu in the CuO2 planes. For the purposes of this paper, an easy way to approximately relate p_{M} to doping x is to assume p_{M}=0 when x=0 (a pure AF parent compound) and p_{M}=1 (a pure metal) when the T_{c} dome ends at x\approx 0.25. Our relation p_{M}=4x linearly interpolates between these two endpoints. Hence, at optimal doping of x=0.16, p_{M}=0.64 and p_{AF}=0.36. These values for p_{M} and p_{AF} are used for the remainder of this paper. The two-dimensional site percolation threshold is \approx 0.59. Therefore, the metallic region percolates through the CuO2 plane and the AF region does not. The AF region is comprised of disconnected islands of antiferromagnetism. The three-dimensional site percolation threshold for a cubic lattice is \approx 0.31. Hence, the AF region percolates in 3D. However, the inter-layer AF coupling between unit cells is very small and this coupling normal to the CuO2 plane direction can be neglected. Hence, the AF regions are essentially 2D. Figure 1 shows a schematic of a doped \mathrm{CuO_{2}} plane with p_{M}=0.64. In this paper, we consider optimal doping only because pseudogap effects are small. Our prior papers proposed that the pseudogap is due to isolated 4-site Cu plaquettes [18, 19]. Here, we do not model the pseudogap. Figure 1: Schematic diagram of a randomly doped 15\times 15 lattice in a single \mathrm{CuO_{2}} plane with the probability of a Cu site being metallic equal to p_{M}=0.64. The O atoms in the \mathrm{CuO_{2}} plane are not shown. The black “M” represents a metallic Cu atom and the blue “AF” represents an AF Cu atom with a localized spin in the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital. Delocalized electronic band states exist inside the metallic region. The dotted black line shows the boundary between the metallic and AF regions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08192v1,Accurate Electron-phonon Interactions from Advanced Density Functional Theory,"Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is key for understanding many properties of materials such as superconductivity and electric resistivity. Although first principles density-functional-theory (DFT) based EPC calculations are used widely, their efficacy is limited by the accuracy and efficiency of the underlying exchange-correlation functionals. These limitations become exacerbated in complex d- and f-electron materials, where beyond-DFT approaches and empirical corrections, such as the Hubbard U, are commonly invoked. Here, using the examples of CoO and NiO, we show how the efficient r2SCAN density functional correctly captures strong EPC effects in transition-metal oxides without requiring the introduction of empirical parameters. We also demonstrate the ability of r2SCAN to accurately model phonon-mediated superconducting properties of the main group compounds (e.g., MgB2), with improved electronic bands and phonon dispersions over those of traditional density functionals. Our study provides a pathway for extending the scope of accurate first principles modeling of electron-phonon interactions to encompass complex d-electron materials.","References Giustino (2017) F.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07657v1,Skin-topological effect in two-dimensional nonreciprocal topological superconductor,"We investigate the interplay between non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and topological properties in two-dimensional topological superconductor. Two kinds of non-Hermiticity are considered. The first is the spin-independent non-reciprocal hopping, which respects particle-hole symmetry (PHS) and dictates the bulk as well as topological edge modes localize at opposite corners, manifested as the Z_{2} NHSE protected by PHS. The direction of the localization can be conveniently characterized by the sign of the winding numbers. The other is the spin-dependent non-reciprocal hopping, where the NHSE is protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS). The Kramers doublets are localized at opposite corners, namely the TRS protected Z_{2} NHSE. When apply an external magnetic field, its internal symmetry changes from the symplectic class into the orthogonal class, eliminating the NHSE for the states in the spectrum continuum. For the zero energy states which are isolated, the NHSE still has its effects despite the orthogonality. For the spin-independent case, edge states can be effectively tuned by the direction of Zeeman field, where at certain directions the zero-energy edge state can be free of NHSE and uniformly distributed. Our work paves the way for the study of the interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity in superconducting systems.","I INTRODUCTION Topological superconductors have been extensively studied due to their topologically protected majorana zero modes(MZMs) and have made remarkable progress both theoretically and experimentally [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. An important feature in topological superconductors is the “bulk-boundary correspondence(BBC)”, that is, the generation of MZMs is protected by the bulk topology. With the further study of topological superconductors, the higher-order topological superconductors have emerged [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Its main characteristics are reflected in a new BBC: a D-dimensional nth-order topological superconductor with a (d-n) -dimensional gapless boundary state(n\geq 2). In higher-order topological superconductors, topological properties are not only reflected in the bulk, but also at the boundaries [24]. For example, for a two-dimensional second-order topological superconductor, when the topological properties of adjacent edges are not equivalent, MZMs appear at the intersection of these two edges, i.e., majorana corner modes(MCMs) [13, 14, 15]. Recently, the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems have attracted much attention in condensed matter physics. The non-Hermitian system has non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) without Hermitian counterpart, and the non-Hermitian term breaks the traditional BBC, causing the energy spectrum under periodic boundary conditions (PBC) very different from that under open boundary conditions (OBC)[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. In two-dimensional or higher dimensional systems, the interaction between non-Hermitian and topological properties can give rise to many new phenomena. As an important example, hybrid skin-topological states become possible when topological edge states and NHSE are localized in different directions. The hybrid skin-topology effects have been implemented in non-reciprocal hopping systems [36, 37, 38, 39] and gain-loss systems [40]. In addition, there are higher-order NHSEs, which are characterized by NHSE realized in topological edge modes rather than the bulk [37, 38, 39, 41]. As mentioned before, the higher order topological superconductors have been relatively well studied mainly in the Hermitian cases due to its own physical significance and the potential applications in quantum computation. However, its interactions with the ubiquitous present non-Hermiticity have been rarely studied up to now. In this paper, we analyze the topological properties and NHSE in two-dimensional p\pm ip topological superconductor systems with two different kinds of nonreciprocal hoppings. The first is the spin-independent nonreciprocal hopping, meaning the nonreciprocal hopping of spin-up and spin-down are the same; the second type is the spin-dependent nonreciprocal hopping, in which the nonreciprocal hopping of spin-up and spin-down occur in opposite ways. When spin-independent nonreciprocal hopping is introduced, the NHSE protected by PHS localizes the bulk eigenstates at two opposite corners of the system. The localization direction of NHSE can be predicted by the sign of winding number. The particles and holes have winding numbers with opposite signs, corresponds to Z_{2} NHSE protected by PHS[42]. At the same time, the topological edge states will also be affected by the Z_{2} skin effect, localizing the edge states at opposite corners, namely the “Z_{2} skin-topological effect”. When the Zeeman field is added, edge states will appear as the angle of the Zeeman field changes. In this case, the edge states with zero energy are uniformly distributed on the edge, while the edge states with non-zero energy are localized in the corner by Z_{2} NHSE. When spin-dependent non-reciprocal hopping is introduced, the NHSE protected by the TRS also localizes the topological edge states at opposite corners. When the Z_{2} skin-topological mode appears at one corner, its Kramers partner is localized at the opposite corner. However, this NHSE is strongly suppressed by adding the Zeeman field term, the system changes from the symplectic class into the orthogonal class. As the Zeeman field increases, a topological phase transition occurs, leading to the disappearance of NHSE. This work is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the Hamiltonians of two nonreciprocal hopping models. In Sec.III, we study the behavior of skin effect and edge states for different models. In Sec.III.1, we study spin-independent nonreciprocal hopping model, both bulk states and edge states are affected by Z_{2} skin effect, which protects PHS. In Sec. III.2, we focus on the spin-dependent nonreciprocal hopping model, and the edge states are influenced by the Z_{2} skin effect which is protected by the TRS. If we add Zeeman field, the skin effect is strongly suppressed. We give a brief summary in Sec. IV.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07624v1,Ising superconductivity in the bulk incommensurate layered material \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right),"Exploiting the spin-valley degree of freedom of electrons in materials is a promising avenue for energy-efficient information storage and quantum computing. A key challenge in utilizing spin-valley polarization is the realization of spin-valley locking in bulk systems. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the noncentrosymmetric bulk misfit compound \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right), showing a strong spin-valley locking. Our investigation reveals Ising superconductivity with a transition temperature of 3.14 K, closely matching that of a monolayer of TaS2. Notably, the absence of charge density wave (CDW) signatures in transport measurements suggests that the PbS layers primarily act as spacers between the dichalcogenide monolayers.This is further supported by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which shows negligible interlayer coupling, a lack of dispersion along the k_{\perp} direction and significant charge transfer from the PbS to the TaS2 layers. Spin resolved ARPES shows strong spin-valley locking of the electronic bands.Muon spin rotation experiments conducted in the vortex phase reveal an isotropic superconducting gap. However, the temperature dependence of the upper critical field and low-temperature specific heat measurements suggest the possibility of multigap superconductivity.These findings underscore the potential of misfit compounds as robust platforms for both realizing and utilizing spin-valley locking in bulk materials, as well as exploring proximity effects in two-dimensional structures.","I INTRODUCTION Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have garnered renewed attention in recent years owing to the emergent topological phases and unusual superconductivity [1, 2]. In addition, leveraging the energy valleys in the band structures of TMDC materials offers a unique opportunity to harness the spin and valley degrees of freedom for valleytronics applications [3]. Apart from the structural varieties, these materials offer great flexibility in terms of tuning the electronic properties easily by different means, such as doping, intercalation, gating, and heterostructure designing[4, 5, 6, 7]. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in designing heterostructured materials with electronic responses different from their constituent layers[8, 9]. The synergy between different material platforms holds immense potential to host novel correlated phases of matter, challenging the conventional understanding and opening the door to new physics and diverse technological applications.[10, 11, 12]. However, realizing high-quality, scalable systems remains a roadblock for further experimentation. The difficulty in obtaining clean interfaces and the tedious process of device fabrication are among the major challenges in this domain [13, 14]. Many of these challenges related to synthesizing heterostructures can be circumvented by studying naturally grown heterostructures, such as misfit materials. Misfit materials hold a general formula of \left(\rm{MX}\right)_{1+x}\left(\rm{TX}_{2}\right)_{n} with stacking of monochalcogenide \left(\rm{MX}\right) and dichalcogenide \left(\rm{TX}_{2}\right) layers[15, 16]. The monochalcogenide layers crystallize into distorted NaCl-type structures, while the dichalcogenide layers consist of T atoms coordinated in a trigonal prismatic arrangement. Due to the fundamentally different symmetry and periodicity of the sublattice, the crystal structure is incommensurate along one of the in-plane crystallographic axes and remains commensurate along the other two axes [17]. Although the sub-lattices are incommensurate, causing a continuous change in the coordination number of the interface atoms, the crystals show high stability with perfect stacking perpendicular to the layers [18, 19]. Furthermore, the incommensurability prevents the formation of any strong interlayer bonding. This structure can also be considered an intercalation of monochalcogenide layers between the weakly bonded TMDC layers. The monochalcogenide spacer layer thus reduces or completely decouples the TMDC monolayers and protects them. This method enables the achievement of a 2D nature in bulk van der Waals materials, providing robust stability. Similar to the intercalation of foreign atoms or molecules, recent reports show a substantial charge transfer between the layers, which helps stabilize the complex structure[16, 20]. However, the spacer layer’s impact on the TMDC layer’s electronic structure, and vice versa, along with the tailored electronic structure of misfit materials, has been less explored. Furthermore, the nature of superconductivity and the superconducting pairing mechanism in misfit compounds remains underinvestigated. Here, we have synthesized the misfit material \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right), consisting of alternating layers of monochalcogenide \rm{PbS} and monolayer \rm{1H-TaS}_{2}. \left(\rm{PbS}\right) is a semiconductor with a direct band gap, while \rm{2H-TaS}_{2} is a superconductor below 0.8~{}\rm{K} [21, 22]. The compound \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right) is particularly intriguing due to its structural similarity to \rm{4Hb-TaS}_{2}, which consists of alternating layers of \rm{1H-TaS}_{2} and strongly correlated \rm{1T-TaS}_{2}. Notably, \rm{4Hb-TaS}_{2} has exhibited signs of topological surface superconductivity with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS). While various measurements suggest the presence of non-trivial superconductivity in this material, the exact underlying mechanism remains unknown [23, 24, 25, 26]. Our measurements have shown superconductivity in \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right) at 3.14~{}\rm{K} with a possible two-gap nature. Our transport and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data show the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity with strong spin-valley locking. The electronic band structure at the Fermi level is dominated by the TMDC layer, which has a large charge transfer from mono-chalcogenide to the dichalcogenide layer."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07427v1,Diverse Manifestations of Electron-Phonon Coupling in a Kagome Superconductor,"Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments on a kagome metal CsV3Sb5 revealed distinct multimodal dispersion kinks and nodeless superconducting gaps across multiple electron bands. The prominent photoemission kinks suggest a definitive coupling between electrons and certain collective modes, yet the precise nature of this interaction and its connection to superconductivity remain to be established. Here, employing the state-of-the-art ab initio many-body perturbation theory computation, we present direct evidence that electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling induces the multimodal photoemission kinks in CsV3Sb5, and profoundly, drives the nodeless s-wave superconductivity, showcasing the diverse manifestations of the e-ph coupling. Our calculations well capture the experimentally measured kinks and their fine structures, and reveal that vibrations from different atomic species dictate the multimodal behavior. Results from anisotropic GW-Eliashberg equations predict a phonon-mediated superconductivity with nodeless s-wave gaps, in excellent agreement with various ARPES and scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements. Despite of the universal origin from the e-ph coupling, the contributions of several characteristic phonon vibrations vary in different phenomena, highlighting a versatile role of e-ph coupling in shaping the low-energy excitations of kagome metals.","References Ortiz et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07338v1,Topological versus conventional superconductivity in a Weyl semimetal: A microscopic approach,"Starting from a microscopic model for the particle-particle interactions in a Weyl semimetal, we analyzed the possibility for conventional as well as monopole Cooper pairing between quasiparticle excitations at the same (intra-nodal) or opposite (inter-nodal) Weyl nodes. We derived a coupled system of self-consistent BCS-like equations, where the angular dependence of the pairings is directly determined from the microscopic interaction symmetries. We studied the competition between conventional and monopole superconducting phases, thus obtaining explicitly the phase diagrams from the microscopic interaction model parameters. We determined the critical temperatures for both phases, and the low temperature critical behavior, including the specific heat, that we suggest as possible experimental probe for topological quantum criticality in Weyl semimetals.","Topological semimetals are characterized by the presence of nodal points connecting the valence and conduction bands, thus leading to a variety of emerging low-energy quasiparticle excitations [1, 2, 3, 4]. In Weyl semimetals (WSMs), due to the presence of pairs of gapless nodal points with nearly linear dispersion, those quasiparticles are pseudorelativistic Weyl fermions [5, 4], experimentally detected in compounds from the transition metal monopnictide family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs and NbP) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Each Weyl node is a monopolar source of Berry curvature, and hence they are protected from being gapped since their monopole charge \mathcal{C}=\pm 1 (chirality) is a topological invariant [5, 4]. This implies that in Weyl fermions, the projection of spin over their momentum direction is preserved, a condition referred to as “spin-momentum locking”. Some remarkable properties related to the existence of Weyl nodes in the bulk band structure are the presence of Fermi arcs, the chiral anomaly, and the chiral magnetic effect [5, 4]. Therefore, considerable effort has been devoted to the study of the electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of WSMs [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], including the effects of different scattering mechanisms, such as electron–phonon, localized impurities and strain [17]. The unique features of the band structure and its corresponding quasiparticle excitations in WSMs suggest the potential existence of diverse pairing states [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Among them, the monopole superconductor (MSC), recently proposed as a pairing state between the two Fermi surfaces (FSs) enclosing the Weyl points in a doped WSM [21, 22], involves the superposition of the Berry phases of the individual, single-particle states, thus determining the Berry phase of the emerging Cooper pair. Therefore, the resulting chirality, i.e. the vorticity of the pair, will be characterized by the combination of those of the individual Weyl nodes. As it was showed in [21], for spherically symmetric Fermi surfaces, the pairing will be defined by monopole harmonic functions in contrast to the spherical harmonics in usual superconductivity. In order to experimentally detect those non-trivial vorticity effects, magneto-transport measurements can be applied to discriminate chiral versus non-chiral pairing states. This mechanism has been investigated by some of us [23] in the context of the competition between the monopole pairing, characterized by the monopole harmonic functions \mathcal{Y}_{q,j,m}(\theta,\varphi), with conventional spherical harmonic states Y_{j,m}(\theta,\varphi). In this previous work, within a mean-field BCS theory, we showed that the monopole and a conventional spherical harmonic phase may coexist with one another [23], while exclusion of one phase in favor of the other arises when the \theta-dependent form factors of the monopole harmonic \mathcal{Y}_{|q|,j,|m|}(\theta,\varphi) and the spherical harmonic Y_{j,m}(\theta,\varphi) are proportional to each other. We called this mechanism “topological repulsion” [23]. In this work, we expanded the analysis in Ref. [23] by introducing a generic microscopic model for the two-particle interaction potential [20], to self-consistently derive the angular dependence of the BCS order parameters involved in the inter-nodal and intra-nodal pairings leading to the MSC and conventional spherical harmonic (SHSC) superconducting phases, respectively. From this more detailed, microscopic perspective, we revisited the phase diagram predicted by a BCS mean-field theory [23], thus determining the corresponding critical temperatures for the MSC and SHSC in terms of the microscopic interaction potential parameters and its underlying symmetries. We calculated explicitly the specific heat, and showed how the temperature behavior of this material dependent thermal property can provide a signature of the presence of such phases, as well as a direct experimental probe for their critical temperatures. We also investigated the competition between those phases, particularly concerning the topological repulsion mechanism suggested in our previous work [23]. In contrast with this previous work, where disorder effects were included as an asymmetry in the nodal chemical potentials, here we assume a uniform chemical potential. Finally, we provide some explicit examples for different angular dependence’s of the pairing, as inherited by the underlying microscopic interaction potential symmetries."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07292v1,High-temperature superconductivity from kinetic energy,"In this work, we demonstrate a kinetic superconductor in a simple lattice model with only one term: the nearest neighbor hopping t. The hopping is projected into a constrained Hilbert space, in the same spirit as the usual t-J model with J=0, where kinetic magnetism has been proposed. The ground state in our model is demonstrated as a superconductor from density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation on the cylinder with L_{y} up to 8. Both the pairing gap and the phase stiffness increase with the doping x, which is in contrast to high Tc cuprates where the pairing gap decreases with doping. We show that the pairing gap, measured from the spin gap or charge 1e gap, can be above 1.5t. Our model can be realized in the double Kondo lattice model relevant to the bilayer nickelate system in the limit of infinite inter-layer spin coupling J_{\perp}/t\rightarrow+\infty, with an inter-layer repulsion V scaling alongside J_{\perp} to offset the net attraction. In the double Kondo model, there is no fundamental constraint on J_{\perp}/t, allowing the reachable upper bound of T_{c}/t to be a large number at the order of 0.5. We also argue that the kinetic superconductor discovered in this work can smoothly connect to the more realistic regime with J_{\perp}\sim t, though the pairing gap may be reduced to the order of 0.1t instead of t. Given that t\sim 10^{3}K in typical solid state systems, the material realization of the model may be promising to achieve a T_{c} at the order of hundreds Kelvin. We propose to search for bilayer material with a reduced z-axis lattice constant to closely approach our ideal model.","Searching for a new mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity is one of the most important problems in condensed matter physics. In the familiar high Tc cuprate materials, the pairing exists only at small doping away from the Mott insulatorLee et al. (2006). As a consequence, the critical temperature (T_{c}) is limited by the phase stiffness \rho_{s} which is proportional to the doping level xNelson and Kosterlitz (1977); Emery and Kivelson (1995). It is tempting to expect a larger T_{c} if the optimal doping is larger. However, the pairing usually competes with the kinetic energy and thus the pairing gap decreases with the doping x. The opposite trend of the phase stiffness and the pairing gap over the doping leads to a small optimal doping level x_{p}\approx 0.2Lee et al. (2006). In this work, we ask whether it is possible to make both the pairing gap and the phase stiffness increase with the doping x to achieve a larger optimal doping and thus higher T_{c}. Because the kinetic energy increases with x, this requires an unprecedented mechanism in which kinetic energy assists pairing. To our best knowledge, kinetic driven superconductor has never been unambiguously established even at the theoretical level. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of kinetic superconductivity in an ideal model with only a nearest neighbor hopping. The model can be reached in the strong coupling limit of the double Kondo lattice modelYang et al. (2024a). The double Kondo lattice model can be realized in a tetra-layer optical lattice simulatorYang et al. (2024a) and was also proposedOh and Zhang (2023); Yang et al. (2024a, b) to describe the recently discovered bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 systemSun et al. (2023). In the double Kondo model, we have mobile electrons in the two outer-layers, while the inner two layers host only spin moments coupled together by a large antiferromagnetic inter-layer spin-spin coupling J_{\perp} (see Fig. 1). Then the mobile electron in the outer layer couples to the local moments from the inner layer through a Kondo coupling J_{K}. The Kondo coupling can share the large J_{\perp} to the outer two layers. As a result, the mobile electrons in the top and bottom layers have an effective strong antiferromagnetic inter-layer spin coupling \tilde{J}_{\perp}, despite that there is no inter-layer hopping t_{\perp}. In the bilayer nickelate, the outer-layer and inner-layer are represented by the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} and the d_{z^{2}} orbitals and the Kondo coupling is from the on-site Hund’s coupling J_{H}, so J_{K}=-2J_{H}<0. In either case, the effective J_{\perp} coupling is not generated directly from the hopping term of the active orbitals, so there is separate charge conservation within each layer of itinerant electrons. In the context of the bilayer nickelate, the importance of the inter-layer J_{\perp} of the d_{z^{2}} orbital has been studied in Ref.Luo et al. (2023); Zhang et al. (2023); Sakakibara et al. (2024); Tian et al. (2024); Qin and Yang (2023); Yang et al. (2023a); Zhan et al. (2024); Chen et al. (2024a); Yang et al. (2023b); Gu et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023); Shen et al. (2023); Kakoi et al. (2024). Ref.Oh and Zhang (2023); Yang et al. (2024b); Lu et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024); Lu et al. (2023); Lange et al. (2024); Qu et al. (2024) further consider an effective J_{\perp} coupling also for the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital, shared by the Hund’s coupling. One may naturally imagine that pairing is dominated by the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital only. However, we emphasize that the bilayer nickelate is not simply described by a bilayer one-orbital model. Instead, electrons from the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital and the spin moments from the d_{z^{2}} orbital are intertwined together. In the limit of large Hund’s coupling J_{H}, one can reduce to a bilayer type II t-J modelZhang and Vishwanath (2020); Zhang and Zhu (2021), but the d_{z^{2}} orbital is still alive. When J_{\perp} is finite, the bilayer type II t-J model and the bilayer one-orbital t-J model are quantitatively quite differentYang et al. (2024a, b). There is no fundamental limit on the ratio J_{K}/t and J_{\perp}/t where t denotes the intra-layer hopping. We will focus on the strong coupling limit |J_{K}|\gg t,J_{\perp}\gg t in this work. Note that we need J_{\perp}>0, but allow J_{K} to be either positive or negative. In the strong coupling limit, we reach a much simpler model, the ESD modelYang et al. (2024b), which contains empty (E), singly occupied (S) and doubly occupied (D) states at each super-site combining the two layers. We also introduce an inter-layer repulsion V and fix the ratio V/J_{\perp} in a specific value to exactly offset the attraction from the J_{\perp} term. In this limit, we only need to project the nearest neighbor hopping t into the ESD Hilbert space. The spirit is akin to the familiar t-J model with J=0. In the t-J model with J=0, ferromagnetism or anti-ferromagnetism can arise from the hopping term and the mechanism has been dubbed as kinetic magnetismNagaoka (1966). We will show that in our model the ground state is a superconductor in a large doping range based on density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation. For small hole doping level x such as x=\frac{1}{8}, we can obtain convincing power-law pair-pair correlations with a small exponent for L_{y} as large as 8. The x=0 and x=1 limits represent two trivial insulators which can be viewed as two different vacuums. We find that the pairing gap and the phase stiffness follow tx away from x=0 (or t(1-x) away from x=1), the ‘Fermi energy’ in the free fermion model. We show that the pairing gap can reach above 1.5\ t and the critical temperature T_{c} may be as large as 0.5\ t.

(2015), we do not find any signature of stripe orders or other translation-symmetry-breaking orders in our model. This indicates the absence of competing orders. The model unambiguously demonstrates proof of the existence of kinetic superconductor and also provides a mechanism towards very high T_{c} which can scale with the Fermi energy. The pairing mechanism here is clearly beyond any mean field theory given that there is no interaction term for mean field decoupling at the first place in our model. We will offer some intuitions on why the electrons can pair up to minimize the kinetic energy. We provide analytical treatments of the two-electron problem and a special limit with layer-opposite Zeeman field. In these special cases we can really demonstrate pairing in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. For the general case, we do not have an exact analytical solution, but we show that a generalized slave boson theory is in qualitative agreement with the DMRG results. In our model, we have two different carriers, the doublon \ket{d} and the holon \ket{h} states with charges +1 and -1 respectively. The x=0 and x=1 limits correspond to a product of \ket{d} state and a product of \ket{h} state respectively. The normal states close to x=0 and x=1 are two different Fermi liquids (FL), one of which violates the conventional Luttinger theorem of the Fermi volume by half of the Brillouin zone per flavorOshikawa (2000); Yang et al. (2024b). Interestingly the model can be adjusted to have a particle-hole symmetry relating these two FLs at x=0.5. As a consequence a symmetric FL is simply forbidden at x=0.5 and the superconductor can not be viewed as a descendant of a Fermi liquid. This challenges the conventional theoretical frameworks of superconductivity. We offer a variational wavefunction based on our generalized slave-boson theory at the doping x=0.5 to demonstrate the possibility of superconductivity without the need for a Fermi liquid normal state. Although the model is achieved at the limit J_{\perp}/t\gg 1, we show that the superconductor can survive to the more realistic regime with J_{\perp}\sim t. We also demonstrate that the superconductor is robust when increasing V so that there is a net repulsive interaction. Therefore, we believe that it is promising to realize the mechanism in a real material, such as in a bilayer nickelate system similar to the recently studied La3Ni2O7. Because the theoretical upper bound of T_{c} in this class of model is at the order of 0.5\ t, it may not be unimaginable to achieve a T_{c} at least at the order of 0.1\ t by enhancing J_{\perp} in real systems, for example through reducing the z-axis lattice constant. Given that t is typically thousands Kelvin in solid state systems, the model may offer a plausible route toward room-temperature superconductivity. The rest of the paper is organized in the following way. In Sec.II, we introduce the double Kondo lattice model and the ESD model in the strong coupling limit. In Sec.III, we show DMRG evidence for superconductivity in the ESD model with only the hopping term. Sec.IV provides an exact solution to the two-electron and two-hole problems of the ESD model in the 2D limit. In Sec.V, we analytically study a special limit with a strong layer-opposite Zeeman field in the ESD model by mapping the problem to the familiar spin-1/2 free fermion model with additional attractive interaction. In Sec.VI, we show that a slave boson mean field theory captures the phase diagram in qualitative agreement with our DMRG results. In Sec.VII, we demonstrate that the superconductor survives to the realistic regime of J_{\perp}/t for two full models with large negative J_{K} and large positive J_{K}. We emphasize that the bilayer nickelate is described by a bilayer type II t-J model instead of a simple bilayer one-orbital model. In Sec. VIII, we provide some insights on the pairing mechanism and propose a route to experimentally search for a bilayer nickelate system with a reduced z-axis lattice constant to closely approach our ideal model. We summarize our results and conclude the paper in Sec.IX."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06932v1,Octupolar Weyl Superconductivity from Electron-electron Interaction,"Unconventional superconductivity arising from electron-electron interaction can manifest exotic symmetry and topological properties. We investigate the superconducting pairing symmetry problem based on the 3D cubic O_{h} symmetry with both weak- and strong-coupling approaches. The dominant pairing symmetries belong to the two-dimensional E_{g} representation at low and intermediate doping levels, and the complex mixing gap function of the d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}+id_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-type is energetically favored in the ground state. Cooper pairs with such a symmetry do not possess orbital angular momentum (OAM) moments, which is different from other time-reversal symmetry breaking pairings such as p_{x}+ip_{y} (e.g 3He-A) and d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}+id_{xy} under the planar hexagonal symmetry. Instead, they develop the octupolar O_{xyz} component of OAM, which results in 8 nodal points along the body diagonal directions exhibiting an alternating distribution of monopole charges \pm 1. This leads to an intriguing 3D Weyl topological SC, which accommodates nontrivial surface states of Majorana arcs. Our results appeal for material realizations and experimental tests in optical lattices.","Introduction The seeking for topological superconductor (TSC) has caught enduring interests, partly due to its relation to topological quantum computation [1, 2, 3]. Much of the focus has been on fully gapped TSCs [4, 5], including the p-wave Kitaev chain [6] and two-dimensional (2D) chiral superconductors of (p_{x}+ip_{y}) and (d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}+id_{xy}) symmetries [7, 8, 9, 10]. A comprehensive classification of gapped TSCs has been developed, within the ten-fold Altland-Zirnbauer classification [11, 12, 13], which categorizes these systems based on their symmetry and dimensionality. In three dimensions (3D), there exists a particular type of TSC exhibiting point gap nodes, i.e., the Weyl TSC [14], which is a superconducting analogy to the Weyl semimetal [15, 16]. The concepts of Weyl points are extended to Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors [14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. The Weyl TSCs not only inherit the non-trivial topological characteristics of Weyl semimetals but also exhibit unique superconducting properties, including gapless surface Majorana modes. Typically the Weyl semimetal or the Weyl TSC except the 3He-A phase appears in complicated compounds with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which is a single-particle band effect from relativistic Dirac equation [30, 31]. On the other front, unconventional superconductivity (SC) from many-body interactions is of considerable interests, particularly due to its connection to the high-T_{c} SC in cuprates [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. The Hubbard model [38] is well-known as the simplest lattice model for interacting electrons only with the onsite interaction energy U, and plays an important role in the study of strong correlation physics [39, 40]. In 2D, this model exhibits the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at half-filling in the square lattice[41, 42, 43, 44]. Upon doping whether it could yield the d-wave SC [45, 46, 47] is still under intensive debates in numerical simulations [40]. The 3D Hubbard model has been successfully simulated in optical lattices [48], leading to the observation of the AFM order consistent with previous numerical simulations [49, 50, 51, 52, 53]. This success offers a new platform for studying interaction effects, allowing for precise control over the interaction strength and the temperature to explore various quantum phases [54, 55, 56]. Particularly, this opens avenues for investigating the emergence of SC in doped systems, where long-range AFM order can be suppressed, leading to the formation of superconducting phases mediated by residual short-range AFM fluctuations. It is interesting to investigate what types of exotic SCs are allowed by different 3D point groups, with a focus on the topological aspect. In this article, we explore the pairing nature from interactions according to the cubic symmetry point group O_{h}. The plain Hubbard model in the 3D cubic lattice is taken as a prototype. Weak-coupling analysis is employed as well as the strong-coupling approach, consistently yielding that the doubly-degenerate (d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}},d_{x^{2}-y^{2}})-wave pairing is dominant at low and intermediate doping levels. Ginzburg-Landau (G-L) analysis combined with numerical calculations show that the d+id complex gap function with the octupolar O_{xyz} component of orbital angular momentum (OAM) is energetically favored. This gap function exhibits 8 nodes exhibiting the alternating pattern of monopole charges \pm 1 determined by the octupolar symmetries. This is a octupolar Weyl TSC hosting nontrivial surface states of topologically protected Fermi arcs. Our result does not depend on a particular model, but is general for systems with the cubic symmetries under repulsive interactions. It opens a door for studying exotic quantum states in 3D from electron-electron interactions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06758v1,Edge supercurrent in Josephson junctions based on topological materials,"The interplay between novel topological states and superconductivity has garnered substantial interest due to its potential for topological quantum computing. The Josephson effect serves as a useful probe for edge superconductivity in these hybrid topological materials. In Josephson junctions based on topological materials, supercurrents exhibit unique quantum interference patterns, including the conventional Fraunhofer oscillations, the \Phi_{0}-periodic oscillation, and the 2\Phi_{0}-periodic oscillation in response to the external magnetic field (\Phi_{0}=h/2e is the flux quantum, h the Planck constant, and e the electron charge). These interference patterns stem from varied Andreev reflection mechanisms and the associated current density profiles. This review seeks to comprehensively examine the theoretical and experimental advancements in understanding the quantum interference patterns of edge supercurrents in Josephson junctions based on quantum spin Hall, quantum Hall, and quantum anomalous Hall systems.","Figure 1: (a) When the central region is filled with bulk carriers, LARs uniformly occur at the interfaces between the SC and the central region. Consequently, the Josephson critical current I_{c} oscillates with the external magnetic field, resulting in a Fraunhofer pattern. (b) In the QSH-based JJs, LARs occur at the single helical edge states. The resulting edge-dominated supercurrents exhibit a \Phi_{0}-periodic oscillation. (c) In the QH-based and QAH-based JJs, edge supercurrents arise from CARs instead of LARs. This leads to a 2\Phi_{0}-periodic oscillation. The schematic diagrams illustrate (d) LARs in the conventional JJs, (e) LARs at the helical edge states in the QSH-based JJs, and (f) CARs at the chiral edge states in the QH-based and QAH-based JJs. The orange (green) lines represent the electrons (holes), respectively. The research on topological materials is at the forefront of condensed matter physics, contributing both to fundamental science and potential technological breakthroughs. The quantum Hall effect (QHE), first discovered by Klitzing ref1 ; ref2 ; ref3 in 1980, exemplifies the manifestation of topological phenomena in condensed matter physics. The QHE is distinguished by chiral edge states, where electrons propagate unidirectionally along the sample’s edges while the bulk remains insulating. This effect occurs in a two-dimensional electron gas under a strong magnetic field at low temperatures, leading to quantized Hall resistance plateaus at h/ne^{2} (n is an integer), where h is Planck’s constant and e is the elementary charge ref1 ; ref4 . The quantized Hall resistance can be understood through topological invariants known as Chern or Thouless–Kohmoto–Nightingale–Nijs (TKNN) numbers ref4 ; CN2 . The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) represents a variant of the QHE that does not require an external magnetic field, yet still supports chiral edge states ref5 ; ref6 . The QAHE was theoretically predicted by Haldane ref7 in 1988 for a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice without a magnetic field and experimentally observed in Cr-doped (\mathrm{Bi},\mathrm{Sb})_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{3} thin films in 2013 ref8 . Since then, QAHE has been observed in various materials, including Cr-doped \rm{(Bi,Sb)_{2}Te_{3}} films QAH11 ; QAH12 ; QAH13 ; QAH14 ; QAH15 ; QAH16 ; QAH17 ; QAH18 ; QAH19 , V-doped \rm{(Bi,Sb)_{2}Te_{3}} films QAH4 ; QAH12 ; QAH21 ; QAH22 ; QAH23 ; QAH24 , \rm{MnBi_{2}Te_{4}} QAH5 ; QAH31 ; QAH32 , and recently moiré superlattice systems QAH6 ; QAH7 ; QAH8 . Both QHE and QAHE break time-reversal symmetry, whereas the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) preserves it. The QSHE is characterized by metallic helical edge states protected by a bulk gap QSH1 ; QSH2 ; QSH11 ; QSH22 ; QSH3 ; QSH4 . The helical edge states mean that electrons with opposite spins counter-propagate along the edges of the material. This can be regarded as two copies of QAHE with opposite Chern numbers. Experimentally, QSHE has been observed in HgTe/CdTe quantum wells QSH5 , InAs/GaSb double quantum wells QSH6 , and monolayer \rm{WTe}_{2} QSH7 ; QSH8 . Remarkably, the interplay between superconductivity and QSHE/QHE/QAHE has attracted considerable attention for its potential to realize topological superconductors (TSCs) capable of hosting Majorana fermions MF1 ; QSH22 ; FJE1 . Majorana fermions, which are exotic quasiparticles that are their own antiparticles, exhibit non-Abelian statistics and are promising candidates for topological quantum computing TQC1 ; TQC2 ; TQC3 ; TQC4 ; TQC5 ; TQC6 ; TQC7 ; TQC8 ; TQC9 . Their nonlocal nature confers resistance to local perturbations, providing a robust platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Consequently, the study of TSCs is not only of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics but also essential for the advancement of next-generation quantum technologies. Establishing the presence of edge superconductivity is a critical step toward demonstrating topological superconductivity in these systems, and the Josephson effect serves as a key tool for probing this edge superconductivity. The Josephson effect, discovered by Josephson in 1962 JJ1 , arises when two superconductors (SC) are separated by a central region that can be an insulator, normal metal, semiconductor, or a narrow superconductor. This configuration, known as a Josephson junction (JJ), permits the tunneling of Cooper pairs across the central region. The hallmark of the Josephson effect is the Josephson current, a supercurrent flowing through the junction driven by the superconducting phase difference without any applied voltage, known as the DC Josephson effect. The generation of this supercurrent is facilitated by Andreev reflections, where an electron converts into a hole at the interfaces between the SC and central region, concurrently creating a Cooper pair in the superconducting region AR . In the conventional SC-normal metal-SC (SNS) JJs, local Andreev reflections (LARs) occur uniformly within the central region (see Fig. 1(d)), which means an electron is retroreflected into a hole, leading to bulk supercurrent oscillations in response to an external magnetic field. As shown in Fig. 1(a), these oscillations produce a quantum interference pattern known as the Fraunhofer pattern. The Fraunhofer pattern is characterized by a central lobe with a width of 2\Phi_{0} and decaying side lobes. Here, \Phi_{0}=h/2e is the flux quantum, h the Planck constant, and e the electron charge. Recently, the combination of the JJs and topological materials has garnered significant attention due to the novel quantum phenomena and potential applications in quantum computing. When the central region exhibits QSHE, the junction is referred to as a QSH-based JJ. Unlike traditional JJs, bulk supercurrent is prohibited due to the presence of a bulk gap. Instead, edge supercurrent, carried by helical edge states, can also sustain even when the chemical potential resides within the bulk gap. In this regime, LARs can occur at a single helical edge (see Fig. 1(e)). Thus, the edge supercurrent oscillates with the magnetic field resulting in a “SQUID-like” quantum interference pattern characterized by a \Phi_{0} periodicity depicted in Fig. 1(b) . Figure 2: (a) Differential resistance ({\rm d}V/{\rm d}I) is measured with the top voltage gate V_{tg}=1.05 V, exhibiting the Fraunhofer pattern. (b) The nearly flat distribution of the supercurrent density indicates the bulk-dominated regime. (c) Differential resistance {\rm d}V/{\rm d}I is measured with the top voltage gate V_{tg}=-0.425 V, showing a “SQUID-like” sinusoidal pattern. (d) The sharp peaks of the supercurrent density indicate the edge-dominated regime. Reprinted from Ref. 67. On the other hand, when the chemical potential lies within the bulk gap, an incident electron from one chiral edge is transformed into an outgoing hole along the opposite edge after encountering the interface between the SC and central region through the crossed or nonlocal Andreev reflections (CARs) in both QH-based and QAH-based JJs CAR1 ; CAR2 ; f2 ; f4 ; f8 . Similarly, the hole is then reflected as an electron along the other interface. The entire process forms a loop, as depicted in Fig. 1(f), which is analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations AB1 . In AB oscillations, electrons traveling along different paths enclose a magnetic flux \Phi, causing resistance to oscillate with the magnetic flux exhibiting a periodicity of 2\Phi_{0} AB2 . Consequently, the critical Josephson current I_{c} in response to the external magnetic flux \Phi has two distinct features f1 ; f2 ; f3 ; f31 ; f4 ; f5 ; f6 ; f7 ; f8 ; f9 : (a) The periodicity of the quantum interference pattern is 2\Phi_{0}. (b) The minima of the oscillation is non-zero. In this review, we focus on the quantum interference patterns in response to the external magnetic field in QSH-based, QH-based, and QAH-based JJs related to the different Andreev reflections. We begin by outlining the experimental and theoretical progress in QSH-based JJs in Sec. II.1 and Sec. II.2, respectively. Then, we discuss the experimental and theoretical research in QH-based JJs in Sec. III.1 and Sec. III.2, respectively. Following this, we introduce the theoretical developments in QAH-based JJs in Sec. IV. Finally, we conclude the review with a discussion on the possible future directions in Sec. V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06734v1,Cocktail effect on superconductivity in hexagonal high-entropy alloys,"We report the study of the cocktail effect on superconductivity in high-entropy alloys (HEAs), using hexagonal close-packed HEAs as a prototype system. Compared with the compositional averages of the constituent elements, the superconducting transition temperature T_{\rm c} is enhanced by from a factor of \sim2 to over one order of magnitude. This T_{\rm c} enhancement correlates with the reduction in the Debye temperature, underlining the importance of phonon softening in triggering the cocktail effect. Furthermore, we show that the T_{\rm c} in these HEAs is governed by the average phonon frequency and electron-phonon coupling strength, the latter of which scales linearly with the inverse HEA molecular weight and is progressively weakened with increasing mixing entropy. Our study paves the way toward quantitative understanding of the superconductivity in HEAs.","Over the past decade, a new class of compositionally complex alloys developed based on the entropy concept, the high-entropy alloys (HEAs), have attracted much attention ref1 ; ref2 ; ref3 ; ref4 . These emerging alloys are made up of four or more principle elements with equimolar or nearly equimolar ratios. This chemical complexity leads to enhanced mixing entropy, which overcomes the enthalpies of compound formation. As a consequence, HEAs exist in a single solid-solution phase and are often regarded as metallic glasses on an ordered lattice. Compared with traditional alloys based on one or two principle elements, HEAs often exhibit superior mechanical and physical properties, such as high hardness ref5 , high thermal stability ref6 , excellent corrosion resistance ref7 , complex magnetism ref8 , and robust superconductivity against disorder ref9 .

Especially, the cocktail effect means that the elements that make up the HEAs work in synergy with each other to enable better performance than the compositional average. This has indeed been demonstrated for the mechanical, catalytic, electrochemical and hydrogen storage properties ref10 ; ref11 . In contrast, the cocktail effect on the physical properties has been poorly explored. Hexagonal close-packed structure is one of the prototype structures for HEAs ref12 . Although the hexagonal HEAs accounts for only \sim1% of the total HEAs, those based on 4d/5d elements are known for their proneness to become a superconductor. So far, nearly thirty different superconducting compositions have been found in this family ref13 ; ref14 ; ref15 ; ref16 ; ref17 ; ref18 ; ref19 ; ref20 , and their T_{\rm c} varies by one order of magnitude up to \sim8.3 K, as listed in Table 1. Notably, quite a few of these HEAs, such as Mo-Ru-Rh-Pd ref13 , Mo-Re-Ru-Rh ref14 , Mo-Re-Ru-Pd-Pt ref17 , and Mo-W-Re-Ru-Pd ref20 , have T_{\rm c} values much higher than those of the corresponding constituent elements. This clearly violates the rule of mixtures and signifies enhanced superconducting pairing induced by the elemental makeup. In this regard, the elucidation of its mechanism not only helps to better understand the cocktail effect and but also may provide clues to achieve a higher T_{\rm c}. However, to our knowledge, no such study has been reported to date. Figure 1: (a, b) VEC dependencies of \delta and \Delta\chi, respectively, for the hexagonal HEA superconductors. In panel (a), the horizontal dashed line denotes the threshold for the formation of single-phase HEAs. (c) \delta versus \Delta\chi plot of the hexagonal compositionally complex alloy superconductors. The data for rare-earth hexagonal HEAs, typical intermetallics, and metallic glasses are also included for comparison. The regions corresponding to different phases are highlighted in different colors. Here we address this issue by comparing the experimental T_{\rm c}, Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma, and Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D} values with the compositionally averaged counterparts \overline{T}_{\rm c}, \overline{\gamma} and \overline{\Theta}_{\rm D}. It is found that, with varying valence electron concentration (VEC), the increase in T_{\rm c}/\overline{T}_{\rm c} is concomitant with the decrease in \Theta_{\rm D}/\overline{\Theta}_{\rm D}. The \lambda_{\rm ep} dependence of T_{\rm c} and its affecting factors are examined, and the implications of these results are discussed."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06673v1,Thermoelectric effect in a superconductor with Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces,"We study theoretically the thermoelectric effect in a superconducting state having the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces which stays in a thin superconducting layer between a conventional superconductor and an insulator. The thermoelectric coefficients calculated based on the linear response theory show the remarkable anisotropy in real space, which are explained well by the anisotropic shape of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surface in momentum space. Our results indicate a way to check the existence of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces in a stable superconducting state because the anisotropy is controlled by the direction of an applied magnetic field.","In a superconductor belonging to unconventional symmetry class such as d-wave and p-wave, a Bogoliubov quasiparticle at zero energy (Fermi level) exists only at nodes of the pair potential. This conclusion is valid when the superconducting states are described effectively by the 2\times 2 Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian. When an electron has internal degrees of freedom, such as spin and sublattice, the size of the BdG Hamiltonian becomes as large as 4\times 4 or more. A Bogoliubov quasiparticle in such superconducting states can form Fermi surfaces called Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces (BFSs) [1, 2, 3]. Therefore, multiband superconductors, j=3/2 superconductors, and usual s=1/2 superconductors with spin-dependent potentials can have the BFSs in their superconducting states [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The residual finite density of states (DOS) at zero energy is a direct consequence of the BFSs, which modifies the specific heat and the tunnel spectra [6, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Measurements of the specific heat and the magnetic properties at low temperatures has suggested the existence of the BFSs in FeSe1-xSx [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. However, it is difficult to confirm the existence of the BFSs only by thermodynamic properties because the residual density of states is derived also from random impurities. The instability of the BFSs has been pointed out by a numerical simulation for j=3/2 superconductors [5, 24]. The instability is partially derived from a fact that quasiparticles on the BFSs coexist with odd-frequency Cooper pairs. [25, 26, 27] A possibility of an odd-frequency superconductivity has been discussed as a result of Cooper pairing of two quasiparticles on the BFSs [28]. In order to establish the physics of quasiparticles on the BFSs, it is necessary to clarify phenomena specific to quasiparticles on the BFSs. In what follows, we address these issues. In this paper, we theoretically discuss the thermoelectric effect due to the quasiparticle on the BFSs. The electric current \bm{j} flows in the presence of the spatial gradient of a temperature \nabla T. In the relation \bm{j}=-\alpha\nabla T, the thermoelectric coefficient \alpha represets the strength of the effect. The thermoelectric coefficient in a uniform of superconductor \alpha_{\mathrm{S}} has been formulated in terms of the solutions of the transport equation [29, 30] and the quasiclassical Green’s functions [31]. The expression at low temperatures \alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\approx\alpha_{\mathrm{N}}\,\exp(-\Delta/T) suggests that the thermoelectric coefficient of a conventional superconductor is exponentially smaller than that in the normal state \alpha_{\mathrm{N}}. The results can be explained well by the absence of the DOS around zero energy due to the pair potential \Delta. We discuss the effects of a quasiparticle on the BFSs on the thermoelectric effect in a stable superconducting state at a semiconductor thin film as illustrated in Fig. 1. The BFSs appear at the film in the presence of both spin-orbit interactions (SOI) and strong magnetic fields [7, 32]. The thermoelectric coefficient is calculated based on the linear response theory by using the Keldysh Green’s function method. The calculated results show that the thermoelectric effect is anisotropic in real space, which reflects the anisotropic shape of the BFSs in momentum space. Moreover, the thermoelectric coefficient in the presence of the BFSs can be larger than its normal state value. The enhancement in the thermoelectric effect is explained by the shift of the gapped DOS due to a magnetic field. We conclude that the existence of the BFSs can be directly confirmed by the anisotropy of the thermoelectric coefficient. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we explain why a complicated junction structure is necessary to observe the thermoelectric effect by focusing on the instability of superconducting states having BFSs. In Sec. III, the calculated results of the DOS and those of the thermoelectric coefficients are presented. We discuss the meaning of the obtained results in Sec. IV. The conclusion is given in Sec. V. The expression of the thermoelectric coefficient is derived based on the linear response theory in Appendix A."

High-Temperature Superconducting Cuprates","Spin fluctuations have been proposed as a key mechanism for mediating superconductivity, particularly in high-temperature superconducting cuprates, where conventional electron-phonon interactions alone cannot account for the observed critical temperatures. Traditionally, their role has been analyzed through tight–binding based model Hamiltonians. In this work we present a method that combines density functional theory with a momentum- and frequency-dependent pairing interaction derived from the Fluctuation Exchange (FLEX) type Random Phase Approximation (FLEX-RPA) to compute Eliashberg spectral functions \alpha^{2}F(\omega) which are central to spin fluctuation theory of superconductivity. We apply our numerical procedure to study a series of cuprates where our extracted material specific \alpha^{2}F(\omega) are found to exhibit remarkable similarities characterized by a sharp peak in the vicinity of 40–60 meV and their rapid decay at higher frequencies. Our exact diagonalization of a linearized BCS gap equation extracts superconducting energy gap functions for realistic Fermi surfaces of the cuprates and predicts their symmetry to be d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} in all studied systems. Via a variation of on–site Coulomb repulsion U for the copper d–electrons we show that that the range of the experimental values of T_{c} can be reproduced in this approach but is extremely sensitive to the proximity of the spin density wave instability. These data highlight challenges in building first–principle theories of high temperature superconductivity but offer new insights beyond previous treatments, such as the confirmation of the usability of approximate BCS–like T_{c} equations, together with the evaluations of the material specific coupling constant \lambda without reliance on tight–binding approximations of their electronic structures.","Strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations have long been considered a potential mechanism for unconventional superconductivity, following early theoretical proposalsVarma (1986); Scalapino (1986). Shortly after these foundational papers the first high–temperature superconductor was discoveredSC_Discover (1987). In spin fluctuation theory, the interaction vertex is commonly modeled using the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), which serves as a simplified representation of the true interaction vertex. Despite its simplicity, the RPA approach provides good qualitative results, particularly in capturing the divergent behavior as the spin density wave (SDW) is approached, an essential feature of many unconventional superconductors. The RPA vertex also naturally takes into account Fermi surface nesting, a phenomenon frequently observed in these systemsUnconventional_review (2002). As a result, spin fluctuations have remained a popular candidate for explaining superconductivity and have been applied extensively in the theoretical analysis of various unconventional superconductors. These materials include cupratescu_flex1 (1988, 1991, 2005, 2004), nickelatesni_flex1 (2020, 2024), ruthenatesru_flex1 (1997, 2000), cobaltatesco_flex1 (2005), ironatesfe_flex1 (2008, 2010, 2009, 2004), and heavy fermionhf_flex1 (2004, 2008) systems. At a given level of doping, theoretical methods typically aim to predict the onset of superconductivity, characterized by the transition temperature T_{c}, as well as the symmetry of the resulting superconducting gap function. Most approaches utilize simple tight–binding models with a limited number of orbitals and band structures, found using the Local Density ApproximationLDA_review (1983) (LDA), which serve as an input to the Hubbard model Hamiltonian. The latter is subsequently solved by an available many–body technique, such, for example, as the Fluctuational Exchange Approximation (FLEX) FLEX . FLEX is a diagrammatic method that includes RPA diagrams given by the particle–hole ladders and bubbles as well as particle–particle ladder diagrams. It is however known that in the vicinity of the SDW instability the most divergent terms are due to the particle–hole laddersParamagnons ; BerkSchrieffer , and the contribution from the particle–particle ladders can be neglectedMuller . Although a lot of past studies of spin fluctuational superconductivity utilized RPA and FLEXFLEX-Review , the extension of this technique has been proposed recently by combining them with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) FLEX+DMFT (2015). It has resulted in reproducing doping dependence of the T_{c} in the simulation of the two–dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice relevant to the cuprates. More accurate Quantum Monte Carlo simulations provide further ways to improve this approachMaier ; Maier2 , and realistic electronic structures can be incorporated via the use of theories such as LDA+ULDA+U and LDA+DMFTLDA+DMFT by utilizing the method of projectors. Our own recent combination of the LDA with FLEX and RPALDA+FLEX (LDA+FLEX) has allowed us to extend these methodologies to incorporate \mathbf{k}– and \omega dependence of the electronic self–energy by evaluating dynamical spin and charge susceptibilities in a restricted Hilbert space given by correlated orbitals. With a further extension of this method to compute the FLEX interaction vertices for the Cooper pairsLDA_FLEX1 (2018), the description of unconventional superconductors in a realistic material framework became possible. Our most recent applications to HgBa2CuO4LDA_FLEX1 (2018) recovered the known d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} symmetry of the order parameter here, and predicted various competing pairing states in a recently discovered superconducting nickelate La3Ni2O7 LDA_FLEX2 and in vanadium kagome metal CsV3Sb5LDA_FLEX3 . Estimates of the transition temperature T_{c} represent an additional challenge. In electron–phonon superconductors, it is typically calculated using Bardeen-Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theoryBCS_theory (1957) where the central quantity to determine is the coupling constant of the interaction \lambda, from which the T_{c} can be found via the McMillan equationMcMillan_1968 (1968). Although this approach is straightforward, these estimates exhibiting exponential sensitivity to the errors in \lambda and uncertainties in the treatment of the Coulomb pseudopotential \mu^{\ast} usually serve to obtain the correct order of magnitude for the T_{c}. More rigorous Eliashberg theory of superconductivity requiring the input of the spectral function \alpha^{2}F\left(\omega\right) and the evaluation of the screened Coulomb interaction can be utilized to improve the accuracy of these estimatesGross , but in a semiquantitative way, the McMillan theory is known to suffice in many cases. There are good reasons for the successes of the BCS approach, in particular, because in the electron–phonon superconductors the \alpha^{2}F\left(\omega\right) is limited by the Debye frequency \omega_{D} which is small comparing to the typical energies of the electronic states. For unconventional superconductors, technically, the Coulomb interaction vertex as, for example, given by FLEX, does not provide such a small parameter, therefore, many model calculations based on diagonalizing the BCS–type equations in case of spin fluctuationsFLEX-Review necessitate additional assumptions. To overcome this difficulty, the Eliashberg equation can be solved directly on the imaginary Matsubara axis and predict the T_{c} directlyArita2000 ; FLEX-Review , but the methodology hides the transparency of the BCS approach which has allowed to guide the discoveries of many conventional superconductors by searching for the materials with large \lambda. Here, we provide new insights to the superconductivity of single– and double–layer cupratesHg-Supra (1993, , , 1986, , , , ) by calculating their spin fluctuational spectral functions \alpha^{2}F(\omega) for a given pairing symmetry on the basis of frequency– and momentum–resolved FLEX–RPA pairing interaction and by utilizing their realistic LDA based electronic energy bands and wave functions. We first exactly diagonalize the linearized BCS gap equation and extract the highest eigenstate and the eigenvector as a function of the Fermi momentum set on a realistic Fermi surface of the material. We find the corresponding superconducting gap functions to be of d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} symmetry in all studied cuprates for a wide range of on–site Coulomb repulsions U and dopings that we scan during our simulations. We further utilize the Kramers–Kronig relations for the frequency dependence of the FLEX vertex, and its averaging over the eigenvectors provides a frequency resolution for each eigenstate. This gives rise to the definition of the spectral functions \alpha^{2}F(\omega) whose inverse frequency moments correspond to the eigenvalues of the BCS gap equation. Our calculated material specific \alpha^{2}F(\omega) are found to exhibit remarkable similarities characterized by a sharp peak in the vicinity of 40–60 meV which has been known to exist from a wealth of experimental data in cuprates such, e.g., imaginary spin susceptibility accessible via the neutron scattering experimentINS , the existence of a 40 meV resonance visible in the superconducting state40meV , as well as the kinks in the one–electron spectra seen at this energy range in angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) experimentSF_3 . We also find that \alpha^{2}F(\omega) decays rapidly at higher frequencies which justifies the use of the BCS–type treatment in the cuprates. The maximum eigenvalue \lambda_{\max\text{ }}deduced from this procedure represents a spin fluctuational coupling constant similar to the electron–phonon (e–p) \lambda_{e-p}. We find it to be particularly large when the system is close to SDW, which in this theory appears for a particular value of U=U_{SDW}, that corresponds to the divergent static spin susceptibility at some wavevector. To allow evaluation of the T_{c} via the McMillan theory, we calculate the normal state self–energy and extract the electronic mass enhancement m^{\ast}/m_{LDA}=1+\lambda_{sf}. The mass enhancement is also large in the vicinity of SDW. However, the evaluated renormalized coupling constant \lambda_{eff}=\lambda_{\max\text{ }}/(1+\lambda_{sf}) that determines the BCS T_{c} was found to be modest unless we tune U to be within a few percent of U_{SDW}. Several numerical approaches to find U were proposed and applied to the cuprates in the past, such as constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA)cRPA_1 (2018, 2022), or fitting U to reproduce some experiments, but such a great sensitivity to the proximity to U_{SDW} rules out the applicability of these methods here. As the oldest and most extensively studied family of unconventional superconductors, cuprates provide a wealth of published mass enhancement data that can be extracted from ARPES, quantum oscillation and specific heat experiments. This data offer additional comparisons with the values of \lambda_{sf} that we calculate in the hope to find further constrains for the material specific U that is needed to predict the T_{c}. However, when comparing experimental data with theoretical predictions, different experimental techniques require specific considerations. For example, ARPES measures a two–dimensional spectral function, from which the Fermi velocity v_{F}^{\ast} can be extracted. Quantum oscillation studies use magnetic fields to induce oscillations around the Fermi surface. The frequency of these oscillations provides a measurement of the effective mass m^{\ast}. Specific heat measurements give the electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma^{\ast} found from all bands. Many of these experiments are surveyed in our work but the spread in the deduced values of \lambda_{sf}, while being well within our theoretical predictions, does not offer further tuning of the constrains on the best determination of U. The results presented here highlight challenges in building first–principle theories of high–temperature superconductivity but still offer new insights that go beyond previous treatments, such as the calculations of \alpha^{2}F’s, the confirmation of the usability of approximate BCS–like T_{c} equations, and the evaluation of the material specific coupling constant \lambda without reliance on the tight–binding approximations of their electronic structures. This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we survey our LDA+FLEX method and describe the numerical procedure to calculate the spin fluctuational spectral functions \alpha^{2}F(\omega). In Section III we report our results on the calculated behavior of superconducting energy gaps, \alpha^{2}F(\omega), the coupling constants \lambda_{\max} and the mass enhancement parameters \lambda_{sf} for a series of single– and double–layer high–T_{c} cuprates. In Section IV we analyze available experimental data on the electronic mass renormalization deduced from ARPESVishik (2014); Birgeneau (1994); Peets (2007); ARPES-MASS2 (2007); Uchida (2003); Raffy (2005); Follath (2006); Muller (1988); Vishik (2009); Bi_overdoped (2016); Berger (2006); Shen (1999), quantum oscillationsHarrison (2019); Greven (2013, 2016); Carrington (2010); Wilson (2009); Crooker (2021); Proust (2008); Taillefer (2007); Klein (2018) and measured values of the specific heatKlein (2020); Tallon (1994); Hussey (2003); Klein_2019 (1988).

In this work, we analyzed published data on QPTs in three one-dimensional arrays and two two-dimensional arrays using a recently developed phenomenological model of QPTs. The model is based on the insight that the scaled experimental data depend in a universal way on two characteristic length scales of the system: the microscopic length scale L_{0} from which the renormalization group flow starts, and the dephasing length, L_{\varphi}(T) as given by the distance travelled by system-specific elementary excitations over the Planckian time. Our analysis reveals that the data for all five arrays (both 1D and 2D) can be quantitatively and self-consistently explained within the framework of interacting superconducting plasmons. In this picture, L_{\varphi}=v_{p}\hbar/k_{B}T, and L_{0}\approx\Lambda, where v_{p} is the speed of the plasmons and \Lambda is the Coulomb screening length of the Cooper pairs. We also observe that, in 1D arrays, the transition is significantly shifted towards the insulating side compared to the predictions of the sine-Gordon model. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences with recent microwave studies of extremely long JJ chains, as well as with the pair-breaking QPT observed in superconducting nanowires and films.","References [1] M.T.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07201v1,Fractionalized superconductivity from Majorana glue in the Kitaev–Kondo lattice,"Superconductivity usually emerges from a metallic normal state which follows the Fermi-liquid paradigm. If, in contrast, the normal state is a fractionalized non-Fermi liquid, then pairing may either eliminate fractionalization via a Higgs-type mechanism leading to a conventional superconducting state, or pairing can occur in the presence of fractionalization. Here we discuss a simple model for the latter case: Using a combination of perturbation theory and functional renormalization group, we show that the Kitaev–Kondo lattice model displays a fractionalized superconducting phase at weak Kondo coupling. This phase is characterized by Cooper pairing of conventional electronic quasiparticles, coexisting with a spin-liquid background and topological order. Depending on the sign of the Kitaev coupling, we find the pairing to be either of chiral d-wave or p-wave type for extended doping regions around the van-Hove filling. We discuss applications and extensions.","Transition to conventional superconductivity.— Given the results of Refs. 17, 18, the SC∗ phase established in this paper will transit into a non-fractionalized superconducting phase upon increasing J_{\rm K}. The T=0 SC∗–SC transition is a confinement transition; it can be either of first order or continuous. In the latter case, the simplest theory is that of the condensation of a bosonic field corresponding to Kondo screening [3, 4]. Given the \mathbb{Z}_{2} nature of the spin liquid’s gauge field, this quantum phase transition is of Ising type [15]. Since the normal-state Fermi surface reconstructs at the parent FL∗–FL transition, the fermiology of the two superconducting states (Chern numbers etc.) can be expected to be different. Interestingly, the \mathbb{Z}_{2} confinement transition is only well defined at T=0 in two space dimensions, such that the continuous SC∗–SC transition becomes a crossover between two quasi-long-range-ordered states at finite T. A more detailed study of this transition is left for future work; some of its signatures have been considered in Ref. 15. Summary.— We have shown that the Kitaev–Kondo lattice admits a fractionalized superconducting phase SC∗, where BCS-type superconductivity of conduction electrons coexists with a spin-liquid background and an emergent gauge structure. This phase is separated from a more conventional (heavy-fermion) superconductor by a confinement transition driven by Kondo screening (or the breakdown thereof); this transition is hence the superconducting version of the FL∗–FL transition discussed in the context of Kondo-breakdown quantum criticality. The pairing of SC∗ is driven by the magnetic excitations of the Kitaev spin liquid, i.e., by Majorana glue. Our FRG analysis has revealed the pairing symmetry to be topologically non-trivial and of chiral spin-singlet (chiral spin-triplet) type for AFM (FM) Kitaev interactions, for band fillings away from but near van-Hove filling. Our arguments for an SC∗ phase straightforwardly extend to other Kitaev spin liquids; in three-dimensional systems [44] where true superconductivity exists at finite T the \mathbb{Z}_{2} confinement transition can be expected to persist at finite T as well. More broadly, we have established a new pairing mechanism – the fluctuations of a fractionalized spin liquid – leading to topological superconductivity. Future theory work should establish such pairing beyond the perturbative limit. Experimentally, studying hetero-systems comprised of frustrated local moments and conduction electrons appears most promising to identify the phases proposed here. Note added.— While completing this work, we became aware of Ref. 45 which also studies the emergence of weak-coupling superconductivity in the FM Kitaev–Kondo lattice. Their results are broadly consistent with ours, however, they only consider small dopings near half filling, related to the phase we find at fillings below the van-Hove singularity, with Chern number 2 instead of 4. A very different type of fractionalized superconductor appears in Ref. 46: This has fractional charges and spinor order, but no deconfined gauge field. Acknowledgements.We would like to thank L.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07119v1,The two-dimensional Rashba-Holstein model,"In this work, we investigate the impact of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) on the formation of charge-density wave (CDW) and superconducting (SC) phases in the Holstein model on a half-filled square lattice. Using unbiased finite-temperature Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we go beyond mean-field approaches to determine the ground state order parameter as a function of RSOC and phonon frequency. Our results reveal that the Rashba metal is unstable due to particle-hole instabilities, favoring the emergence of a CDW phase for any RSOC value. In the limit of a pure Rashba hopping, the model exhibits a distinct behavior with the appearance of four Weyl cones at half-filling, where quantum phase transitions are expected to occur at strong interactions. Indeed, a quantum phase transition, belonging to the Gross-Neveu Ising universality class between a semi-metal and CDW emerges at finite phonon frequency dependent coupling \lambda_{c}. In the antiadiabatic limit we observe an enhance symmetry in the IR that unifies SC and CDW orders. These results advance our understanding of competing CDW and SC phases in systems with spin-orbit coupling, providing insights that may help clarify the behavior of related materials.","The interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) remains an open issue in condensed matter physics. Even for the single-excitation case, the leading effects of the competition between the energy gained from coupling with phonons (and its quasiparticle formation) and the electronic dispersion from the SOC are subtle, with the effective polaron+ mass depending on both EPC and SOC Cappelluti et al. (2007); Covaci and Berciu (2009); Li et al. (2010, 2011). This delicate balance could have direct implications for the development of novel devices, particularly in the field of spintronics Žutić et al. (2004). The degree of complexity is quite increased in the many-electron case, due to the inclusion of electronic correlations. As strong electron-electron interactions introduce many-body effects that may lead to long-range ordered phases, the SOC changes the Hamiltonian’s symmetries and, consequently, the electrons’ dynamics. This fundamental change could lead to unpredictable physical responses or new phases of matter Pesin and Balents (2010). Some iridates or pyrochlores materials are prototypes for such interplay, as they are Mott insulators and also exhibit strong SOC effects. Indeed, these compounds show a myriad of phases, from Weyl semimetals and topological insulators, to spin liquid phases Witczak-Krempa et al. (2014); Rau et al. (2016). However, while the interplay between SOC and direct (Coulomb) electron-electron has been vastly scrutinized in the literature Riera (2013); Laubach et al. (2014); Sun et al. (2017); Kennedy et al. (2022); Kawano and Hotta (2023); Beyer et al. (2023); Gastiasoro et al. (2023); Beyer et al. (2023), the leading effects of SOC on indirect interactions, such as the EPC, and vice versa, are much less clear. This interplay can be explored in some transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as 2H-TaSe2 and 2H-TaS2, which exhibit significant EPC and SOC effects Liu et al. (2016); Manzeli et al. (2017); Zhang et al. (2024a). In the former, both in bulk and single-layer forms, the charge-density wave (CDW) phase in the ground state appears to be barely affected by SOC, with the wavevector of this phase remaining almost unchanged, whether SOC is present or not Ge and Liu (2012). In contrast, in 2H-TaS2, SOC has a pronounced impact on the EPC strength, suppressing EPC matrix elements. This suppression of EPC by SOC is essential for accurately explaining the superconducting critical temperatures observed in this material Lian et al. (2022). Another interesting example is the Pb crystal, which is a conventional (strong coupling) superconductor. For this material, the EPC strength, calculated from Eliashberg functions, is drastically affected by the inclusion of SOC, which is essential to replicate the experimentally observed superconducting (SC) properties Heid et al. (2010). Finally, the interplay between charge order and SOC remains a subject of ongoing debate even for 1D systems, such as in atomic wire arrays on semiconductor surfaces Snijders and Weitering (2010), or in the quasi-1D material (TaSe4)2I. The latter, in particular, is considered as a Weyl semimetal Shi et al. (2021), exhibiting Rashba-like band splittings, but also undergoes a CDW phase transition at T_{\rm CDW}=263 K Zhang et al. (2020). From a theoretical perspective, the Holstein model captures the essential features of systems where EPC plays a central role Holstein (1959). This model describes local (dispersionless) harmonic oscillators at each site of the lattice, which couple locally to the electronic density, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). The Holstein model has been extensively studied in the literature, exhibiting a competition between CDW and SC phases that depends on finely tuned external parameters or the lattice geometry Li et al. (2015); Costa et al. (2018); Dee et al. (2019); Zhang et al. (2019); Chen et al. (2019); Cohen-Stead et al. (2019); Dee et al. (2020); Bradley et al. (2021); Xiao et al. (2021); Costa et al. (2021); Araújo et al. (2022); Weber and Freericks (2022); Sousa-Júnior et al. (2023). However, to the best of our knowledge, the many-body problem of interacting electron-phonon coupled electrons in the presence of SOC has only recently been explored, particularly within the context of the Holstein Hamiltonian. Indeed, Ref. Fontenele et al., 2024 investigates the impact of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) on the stability of the CDW phase within a mean-field approximation, while Ref. Zhang et al., 2024b employs an unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approach to explore the emergence of an induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) when the EPC is spin-dependent, both in the half-filled square lattice. The antiadiabatic limit has also been analyzed in Refs. Tang et al., 2014; Rosenberg et al., 2017; Song et al., 2024 using QMC methods, as further discussed below.

(b) Illustration of spin splitting due to Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a 2D electron gas, producing spin textures with opposite chiralities.

(f) Same as in panel (d), but in the pure Rashba hopping limit where t/\alpha=0. Motivated by these experimental and theoretical results, we further investigate how a RSOC affects a system with strong EPC, analyzing it both for the adiabatic and antiadiabatic limits. To this end, we employ unbiased finite-temperature QMC methods Blankenbecler et al. (1981); Hirsch (1983, 1985); Scalettar et al. (1989), examining the charge and pairing correlations of the two-dimensional Rashba-Holstein model at the half-filling of the square lattice. As our main result, we provide finite temperature and ground state phase diagrams. This article is organized as follows: in the next section we present the model and its symmetry properties, as well as the methodology; in section III, we present and discuss the our results, leaving our conclusions and further remarks to section IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07068v1,Majorana modes in quantum dots coupled via a floating superconducting island,"Majorana modes can be engineered in arrays where quantum dots (QDs) are coupled via grounded superconductors, effectively realizing an artificial Kitaev chain. Minimal Kitaev chains, composed by two QDs, can host fully-localized Majorana modes at discrete points in parameter space, known as Majorana sweet spots. Here, we extend previous works by theoretically investigating a setup with two QDs coupled via a floating superconducting island. We study the effects of the charging energy of the island and the properties of the resulting minimal Kitaev chain. We initially employ a minimal perturbative model, valid in the weak QD-island coupling regime, to derive analytic expressions for the Majorana sweet spots and the splitting of the ground state degeneracy as a function of tunable physical parameters. The conclusions from this perturbative approximation are then benchmarked using a microscopic model that explicitly describes the internal degrees of freedom of the island. Our work shows the existence of Majorana sweet spots, even when the island is not tuned at a charge-degeneracy point. In contrast to the Kitaev chains in grounded superconductors, these sweet spots involve a degeneracy between states with a well-defined number of particles.","Electrostatic interactions constitute a key aspect in the engineering of a large variety of quantum devices, including quantum dots (QDs), single-electron transistors and Cooper-pair boxes. The effects of charging energy have played a crucial role also in the design of many hybrid semiconductor-superconductor systems (see, for instance, the recent reviews [1, 2, 3]) and provide important tools for the study of subgap states in nanodevices fabricated with the goal of realizing topological superconductors [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Among the hybrid systems, artificial Kitaev chains, composed by QDs coupled via superconductors, have emerged as a promising platform to realize Majorana modes [19, 20, 21, 22], eventually reaching the topological regime from a bottom-up approach [23, 24]. In their minimal form, these chains are composed by two QDs coupled via a short grounded superconducting segment that mediates crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) and elastic cotunneling (COT) [19, 20]. These minimal Kitaev chains feature the so-called poor man’s Majorana modes (PMMs) at isolated sweet spots in parameter space where CAR and COT amplitudes are equal. Experiments in QDs coupled via grounded superconductors have demonstrated the onset of zero-energy states with transport and spectral properties compatible with the PMM interpretation in two [25, 26, 27] and three QD Kitaev chains [28, 29]. The main strategy to realize PMMs in these experiments relies on Andreev subgap states in the central superconductor, that dominate the coupling between the QDs. By controlling the energy of these states, it is possible to tune the relative amplitude of CAR and COT, which, in turn, allows for reaching the Majorana sweet spot [22, 30, 31, 32]. The high level of tunability reached makes artificial Kitaev chains a promising alternative to demonstrate the properties of Majorana modes, like Majorana fusion and braiding [33, 34, 35], and their applications, including qubits based on fermion parity [34, 36, 37]. In this work, we analyze the low-energy properties of two QDs coupled via a floating superconductor. We examine the role of the charging energy of this superconducting island and show that the system features sweet spots with Majorana modes well localized in the QDs, both at and away from the charge-degeneracy point. We first present a perturbative model based on the effective CAR and COT coupling between spin-polarized QDs, Sec. II. Within this minimal model, the effect of the island charging energy is similar to that of an inter-QD charging energy considered in Refs. [38, 39]. The predictions of the perturbative model are benchmarked in Sec. III by using a microscopic model that includes spin and Coulomb interactions of the QDs and explicitly describes the central island, based on the recently developed surrogate model [40, 41]. In the appendices we derive analytic expressions for the energy renormalization of the QDs and amplitudes of CAR and COT processes, and we further analyse the effects of charging energy and multiple subgap states in the floating superconductor. Our analysis is complementary to the recent investigations of electrostatic interactions in the QDs, which have shown their beneficial effect to improve the quality of PMMs [30, 38, 39] and their role to determine triple degeneracies in the energy spectra of these systems [42]. The effects of the charging energy have also been analyzed in superconducting nanowires aimed at more traditional realizations of Majorana modes. The interplay of electrostatic interactions with superconductivity in these systems has been at the core of many theoretical proposals concerning Majorana-mediated teleportation [43], topological qubits [44, 45], the initialization of topological systems [46, 47], Majorana fusion [48, 49], and braiding [50, 51, 52]. This work points to the emergence of PMMs in interacting systems that display the potential of reproducing these devices and phenomena in tunable hybrid QD–superconductor platforms. Such setups will open the door for the realization of qubits based on PMMs and the observation of unique Majorana properties, including Majorana teleportation and the topological Kondo effect [53].

Both the QD energy levels (\varepsilon_{\nu}) and the charge offset n_{g} on the superconductor can be controlled with gate electrodes (gold)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06127v1,"Dynamic manifestation of exception points in a non-Hermitian
continuous model with an imaginary periodic potential","Exceptional points (EPs) are distinct characteristics of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. In this study, we focus on EPs in continuous systems rather than discrete non-Hermitian systems, which are commonly investigated in both the experimental and theoretical studies. The non-Hermiticity of the system stems from the local imaginary potential, which can be effectively achieved through particle loss in recent quantum simulation setups. Leveraging the discrete Fourier transform, the dynamics of EPs within the low-energy sector can be well modeled by a Stark ladder system under the influence of a non-Hermitian tilted potential. To illustrate this, we systematically investigate continuous systems with finite imaginary potential wells and demonstrate the distinctive EP dynamics across different orders. Our investigation sheds light on EP behaviors, potentially catalyzing further exploration of EP phenomena across a variety of quantum simulation setups.","The establishment of quantum mechanics is based on the Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian operator, which ensures the reality of the eigenvalues and the orthogonality of the eigenvectors. However, this mathematical framework is typically used to analyze closed systems that conserve energy and probability. In 1998, the pioneering work Bender1 by Bender demonstrated that a class of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with parity-time reversal symmetry can possess a fully real spectrum. Subsequently, Ali Ali illustrated that pseudo-Hermitian operators are crucial for realizing the reality of the spectrum. Recently, non-Hermitian systems have been simulated in various physical systems, spanning from atomic Bloch ; LLH1 ; LQ ; LLH2 to photonic FL ; PM ; OSK ; ZXY ; LAD platforms. Despite their ability to exhibit real spectra, these systems are not closed, allowing for energy and particle exchange with the environment. Disruption of the balance between the system and its environment leads to the emergence of a complex spectrum. Within this process, a critical region must exist where typical dynamic behavior is altered, accompanied by the appearance of an EP KT ; HWD1 . Furthermore, the development of non-Hermitian topological phases BEJ has introduced a new dimension to traditional condensed matter physics and quantum optics, reshaping our understanding of matter BEJ ; LS1 ; EGR ; MMA ; PM2 ; AY ; ZSM ; WH ; FC .

The motion of electrons in a lattice under an electric field is often elucidated by the Stark ladder model, involving a linear potential. This model is feasible in a tilted optical lattices DMB ; WSR , showcasing intriguing phenomena like Bloch oscillations BF ; Longhi2 , Zener tunneling ZC ; Longhi3 , and many-body Stark localization SM ; MW . Recent research has explored the Stark ladder model influenced by dissipative imaginary linear potentials, broadening the horizons of conventional Stark ladder model investigations CS . When addressing problems in continuous quantum systems, it is necessary to discretize the system to a moderate extent to facilitate computation by computers. The Fourier grid Hamiitonian (FGH) method maps the kinetic and potential energy components of the Hamiltonian onto grid points in coordinate space. Through Fourier transformations, it ultimately yields a sum of cosine functions for each matrix element of the Hamiltonian in coordinate space M1989 . It has proved a remarkably easy and robust method for computing the vibrational motion of one-dimensional systems KB1992 ; PRL2018 . Systems processed with the FGH method more closely approximate real physical systems and thus have significant reference value for experiments. However, the application of the FGH method to the treatment of non-Hermitian quantum systems remains unexplored. In this study, we expand the FGH method to encompass non-Hermitian continuous systems influenced by tilted imaginary potentials. Within the low-energy sector, dynamics are effectively modulated by a non-Hermitian tight-binding system, enabling the identification of EPs. We observe distinct orders of EPs within continuous systems featuring various wells. Notably, a two-order EP, termed a scale-free EP, remains unchanged with increasing system size. The different EP orders exhibit unique dynamic behaviors discernible through the growth of the total Dirac probability, following a power law linked to the EP order index. Our findings offer valuable insights into the EP dynamics of non-Hermitian continuous systems. Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we expand the FGH method to non-Hermitian continuous systems. In Sec. III, we describe the coalescing states of effective tight-binding Hamiltonian by the discretization of continuous system. In Sec. IV, we demonstrate the existence of scale-free behavior of EPs in the effective Hamiltonian. In Sec. V, we discuss the different dynamical behaviors of EPs, including EP2 and EP3. A summary is given in Sec. VI."
