https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09227v1,Euler’s original derivation of elastica equation,"Euler derived the differential equations of elastica by the variational method in 1744, but his original derivation has never been properly interpreted or explained in terms of modern mathematics. We elucidate Euler’s original derivation of elastica and show that Euler used Noether’s theorem concerning the translational symmetry of elastica, although Noether published her theorem in 1918. It is also shown that his equation is essentially the static modified KdV equation which is obtained by the isometric and isoenergy conditions, known as the Goldstein-Petrich scheme.","Euler derived the differential equations of the elastica by the variational method and classified the moduli of elasticae in 1744 [E2]. However, his original derivation has never been properly interpreted or explained in terms of modern mathematics. Bolza reviewed Euler’s elastica for the review of Gauss’s elastica [Bo2] but he did not mention it explicitly. Since Euler’s derivation is not difficult to follow, anyone can trace it. However, its mathematical or physical meaning is not clear. In other words, no one gave any particular comment, without formulae, on what Euler did and how he did his derivation as far as we know. Even Truesdell gave a only short comment on his derivation in [T1], “since Pdp=dZ-Qdq, another is easy, yielding \alpha\sqrt{1+p2}+\beta p+\gamma=Z-Qq.” This equation is the same as (2.10) in this paper, which is essential in Euler’s derivation. Further, D’Antonio, Levien, and Bistafa gave excellent reviews of Euler’s derivation respectively, but did not give any particular interpretation on (2.10) from a mathematical point of view (2.10) [DA, Le, Bi]. As recently, Dittrich explained Euler’s elastica from a viewpoint of modern theoretical physics using the quantities appearing in Euler’s derivation, his explanation is proper and nice as theory of elastica but does not correspond to Euler’s derivation directly [Di]. In fact, Euler’s formula is different from the well-known equation of elastica [Lo], i.e. the static sine-Gordon equation or the nonlinear pendulum equation, \frac{d^{2}\varphi}{ds^{2}}=a\sin\varphi, (1.1) where \varphi is the tangential angle and s is the arclength of elastica, which was obtained by Lagrange and Gauss [La2, Gau] (See Appendix). The derivation of (1.1) is very simple; it can be obtained by a straightforward way. Thus in most of essays of elastica [T2, Lo], (1.1) appears as a governing equation of elastica. Dittrich also showed the relation between (1.1) and the quantities appearing in Euler’s derivation [Di]. As mentioned in [BG, LS, M1], the elastica also obeys the static modified KdV (SMKdV) equation, a\frac{d\varphi}{ds}+\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{d\varphi}{ds}\right]^{3}+\frac{d^{% 3}\varphi}{ds^{3}}=0, (1.2) although the derivation of the SMKdV equation is, a little bit, complicated (see Appendix). Euler’s original equation should be regarded as the SMKdV equation (1.2) instead of (1.1) by setting d\varphi/ds proportional to x. Thus, his derivation is also complicated. Further, Euler’s derivation should be interpreted from a modern viewpoint since the SMKdV equation is very natural from a modern mathematical viewpoint, and his derivation is associated with the recent discovery based on the Goldstein-Petrich scheme [GP, MP] (see Appendix). In this paper, we elucidate Euler’s original derivation of elastica, and show that Euler used Noether’s theorem related to the translational symmetry of the elastica, and derived the SMKdV equation rather than the static sine-Gordon equation (1.1), although Noether published her theorem in 1918 [N]. It is noted that when we consider the generalization of elastica, or the excited states of the Euler-Bernoulli energy functional, the SMKdV equation (1.1) is more natural than the static sine-Gordon equation (1.1), due to the symmetry [MP]. The modern derivation of the SMKdV equation as the governing equation of elastica is based on the non-strain condition with translational symmetry that Euler focused on. Goldstein and Petrich found a simple but deep representation of the non-stretching condition [GP], and using it, we can find the SMKdV equation satisfying the translational symmetry. This view existed in Euler’s original derivation. Further, recently we show that the symmetry is also related to the shapes of supercoiled DNAs [M3]. Thus, in this stage, it is very important to elucidate what Euler did in his derivation of the elastica. Then we must say that Euler revealed the essence of elastica. The contents are as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the explanation of Euler’s deviation of his elastica equation. The mathematical significance of his derivation is discussed in Section 3. We include Appendix where we show Lagrange’s equation of elastica and Gauss’s derivation. We also show that the elastica obeys the SMKdV equation."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08853v1,Rational solutions of Painlevé V from Hankel determinants and their asymptotics,"In this paper we analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the poles of certain rational solutions of the fifth Painlevé equation. These solutions are constructed by relating the corresponding tau function with a Hankel determinant of a certain sequence of moments. This approach was also used by one of the authors and collaborators in the study of the rational solutions of the second Painlevé equation. More specifically we study the roots of the corresponding polynomial tau function, whose location corresponds to the poles of the associated rational solution. We show that, upon suitable rescaling, the roots fill a well-defined region bounded by analytic arcs when the degree of the polynomial tau function tends to infinity. Moreover we provide an approximate location of these roots within the region in terms of suitable quantization conditions.","The six Painlevé equations were classified by Painlevé and his student Gambier [36, 18] more than a century ago. This was a result of the search for second order ODEs in the complex plane whose solutions, roughly speaking, have the property that all movable singularities are isolated poles. This property has now become known, and referred to, as the Painlevé property. While this might have remained a purely mathematical investigation, it was much later recognized that these equations have significant applications in mathematical physics, with the resurgence in the late ’70s with the works connecting with Ising model and conformal field theory [32, 33]. Another momentous resurgence happened in the ’90s when Tracy and Widom [39] used a special second Painlevé transcendent (the Hastings-McLeod solution [20]) to describe the fluctuations of the larges eigenvalue of a large random Hermitean matrix. Amongst special solutions of the Painlevé equation the rational ones attract a natural interest; the literature is extensive and seems to start with [42] who discussed rational solution of the second Painlevé equation and defined a special sequence of polynomials that are now called Vorob’ev-Yablonskii after their discoverers (it appears that Yablonskii defined them slightly earlier but the reference is difficult to find [43]). Rational solutions also appear in semiclassical limits of integrable PDEs; in the one–dimensional sine–Gordon equation near a separatrix, for example, one finds that a suitable scaling of the solution is expressible in terms of a rational solution of the second Painlevé equation [9]. Rational solutions exist for all but the first Painlevé equation: although there does not seem to be a full and complete classification in all six cases, for particular cases either the full classification of rational solutions exist or there are constructions of special families of rational solutions (for the Painlevé II [42, 43, 24], for the Painlevé III,V, VI [31, 30, 40] Painlevé IV [35] The literature that investigates the asymptotic behaviour of the rational solutions, and the pole distribution thereof, is more recent, probably due to the interest spurred by numerical investigations and the appearance of well defined patterns; for the zeros of Okamoto polynomials (which are poles of rational solutions of PIV) see [34], for the zeros of Vorobev–Yablonskii polynomials and Painlevé II see [10, 11, 2], for the second Painlevé hierarchy see [1]. The approach to asymptotic analysis relies on the formulation of an associated Riemann–Hilbert problem, namely, a boundary value problem for a piecewise analytic matrix valued function matrix. Within this framework there are two logical distinct approaches that can be used. We can categorize them under the following banners: 1. the isomonodromic approach; 2. the orthogonal polynomial (OP) approach. The isomonodromic approach relies on the general fact that any Painlevé equation appears as the compatibility between a 2\times 2 system of ODEs with rational coefficient in the complex plane and an additional PDE in an auxiliary parameter [21]. The different solutions are parametrized by (generalized) monodromy data of the ODE, which is the starting point for the Riemann–Hilbert analysis. Typically the degree of the rational solution appears explicitly as one of the parameters in the monodromy data, and can be used as large parameter in the asymptotics. This is the philosophy behind the works [10, 11]. The second approach was used, possibly for the first time, in [2] and then also applied to the generalized Vorob’ev–Yablonski polynomials in [1]. It is also the approach we follow in this paper. The main connection between OPs and equations of Painlevé type was established in [3], where it was shown that Hankel determinants built out of the moments of “semiclassical” moment functionals are always isomonodromic tau functions in the sense of Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno [21]. It was a remark (Rem 5.3 in [3]) that special choices of semiclassical moment functionals lead automatically to tau functions of Painlevé equations (all, except possibly for Painlevé I). In genereal, however, these solutions correspond to transcendental solutions like, for example, the solutions of PII constructed out of detereminants of derivatives of Airy functions, see [23]. It is possible to further restrict the setup of orthogonal polynomials in such a way that the moments of the moment functional become polynomials in a parameter, which then guarantees that the Hankel determinant (automatically an isomonodromic tau function) is a polynomial tau function of an equation of Painlevé type. This is what works ”behind the scenes” in [2]. The advantage of this reformulation in terms of associated Orthogonal Polynomials is that there is a solid and well developed framework for studying their large degree asymptotics, with an extensive literature that starts with the seminal work of Deift et al. [15]. Before going into any further detail let us discuss the known literature and results about the rational solutions of the fifth Painlevé equation. Rational solutions of PV. The fifth Painlevé equation is the following nonlinear, second order ODE in the complex domain for the unknown function y(t) \displaystyle y^{\prime\prime}=\left(\frac{1}{2y}+\frac{1}{y-1}\right)(y^{% \prime})^{2}-\frac{y^{\prime}}{t}+\frac{(y-1)^{2}}{t^{2}}\left(\alpha y+\frac{% \beta}{y}\right)+\frac{\gamma y}{t}+\frac{\delta y(y+1)}{y-1}, (1.1) where \alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\in{\mathbb{C}} are parameters: we shall refer to (1.1) as P_{5}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta). The equation admits certain symmetries that change the value of the parameters; if y(t) is a solution of P_{5}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta) then 1. y(-t) is a solution of P_{5}(\alpha,\beta,-\gamma,\delta); 2. \frac{1}{y(t)} is a solution of P_{5}(-\beta,-\alpha,-\gamma,\delta); 3. y(\lambda t) is a solution of P_{5}(\alpha,\beta,\lambda\gamma,\lambda^{2}\delta), for any \lambda\in{\mathbb{C}}^{\times}. Using the above symmetries the analysis is reduced to only two families; the family where \delta=0 (which is called “degenerate” and can be reduced to Painlevé III) and the case \delta\neq 0 which, by virtue of the last of the above symmetries, is customarily set to \delta=-\frac{1}{2}. The classification of rational solution is contained in [25] where the authors show that rational solutions exist only if the parameters satisfy certain relations. More precisely (paraphrasing and condensing their results) Theorem 1.1 ([25], Thm. 1.1, Thm. 1.2) The equation P_{5}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,-\frac{1}{2}) (1.1) admits rational solutions if and only if there are integers k,m\in{\mathbb{Z}} such that (I) \alpha=\frac{1}{2}(\gamma+k)^{2};\ \ \beta=-\frac{m^{2}}{2}, k+m odd, and \alpha\neq 0 when |k|<m; (II) \alpha=\frac{1}{2}m^{2};\ \ \beta=-\frac{(\gamma+k)^{2}}{2}, k+m odd, and \beta\neq 0 when |k|<m; (III) \beta=-\frac{1}{2}(\alpha_{1}+m)^{2},\gamma=k with \alpha_{1}^{2}=2\alpha so that m\geq 0 and k+m even; (IV) \alpha=\frac{k^{2}}{4},\ \beta=-\frac{m^{2}}{8},\ \ \gamma\not\in\mathbb{Z} where k,m>0 and k,m both odd. In cases (I) and (II) the solution is unique if \gamma\not\in{\mathbb{Z}} and there are at most two rational solutions otherwise. Observe that the cases (I) and (II) of the above result are really the same family up to the application of the symmetry y(t)\leftrightarrow\frac{1}{y(-t)} which transforms solution of P_{5}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,-\frac{1}{2}) into solutions of P_{5}(-\alpha,-\beta,\gamma,-\frac{1}{2}). In the recent [13] the authors construct the rational solutions corresponding to the case (II) of [25] above (which is case (i) in Thm. 4.1 of [13]). More precisely they construct the tau functions \tau^{(\mu)}_{m,n}:=\det\left[\left(t\frac{{\mathrm{d}}}{{\mathrm{d}}t}\right)% ^{j+k}L^{(n+\mu)}_{m+n}(t)\right]_{j,k=0}^{n-1} (1.2) where L^{(\alpha)}_{n}(t) are the associated Laguerre polynomials (see DLMF: 18.5.12) L^{(\alpha)}_{n}\left(t\right)=\sum_{\ell=0}^{n}\frac{{\left(\alpha+\ell+1% \right)_{n-\ell}}}{(n-\ell)!\;\ell!}(-x)^{\ell}=\frac{{\left(\alpha+1\right)_{% n}}}{n!}{{}_{1}F_{1}}\left({-n\atop\alpha+1};t\right). (1.3) Then their result implies that (1.2) is the tau function of P_{5}\left(\frac{m^{2}}{2},-\frac{(m+2n+1+\mu)^{2}}{2},\mu,-\frac{1}{2}\right). Many interesting properties are discussed but no description of the asymptotic behaviour for large degree is undertaken. Results. In the present paper we will provide an alternative description for the same tau function; more precisely we construct the tau function for case (I) in Thm. 1.1 corresponding to the parameters \alpha=3N+{\boldsymbol{K}}-1,\ \ m=N+{\boldsymbol{K}},\ \ \gamma={\boldsymbol{% \rho}},\ \ \ N\in{\mathbb{N}},\ \ {\boldsymbol{K}}\in{\mathbb{Z}},\ \ {% \boldsymbol{\rho}}\in{\mathbb{C}}, (1.4) which corresponds to the parameters \mu,n,m of [13] as follows m=N+{{\boldsymbol{K}}},\ \ n=N-1,\ \ \ \mu=1-2N-{{\boldsymbol{K}}}+{{% \boldsymbol{\rho}}}. (1.5) To construct this \tau-function we consider the following sequence of moments depending on the parameters {\boldsymbol{K}}\in{\mathbb{Z}}, {\boldsymbol{\rho}}\in{\mathbb{C}} \mu_{j}(t):=\oint_{|z|=1}z^{j}z^{{\boldsymbol{K}}}\left(1-\frac{1}{z}\right)^{% {\boldsymbol{\rho}}}{\rm e}^{\frac{t}{z}}{\mathrm{d}}z,\ \ \ \ \ j=0,1,2,\dots. (1.6) We interpret the \mu_{j}’s as the moments of the complex measure {\mathrm{d}}\mu(z)=z^{{\boldsymbol{K}}}\left(1-\frac{1}{z}\right)^{{% \boldsymbol{\rho}}}{\rm e}^{\frac{t}{z}}{\mathrm{d}}z on |z|=1. Observe that \mu_{j}(t) are polynomials in t, and can also be obtained from a generating function \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\mu_{j}(t)\frac{s^{j}}{j!}=\oint_{|z|=1}z^{{\boldsymbol{K}}% }\left(1-\frac{1}{z}\right)^{{\boldsymbol{\rho}}}{\rm e}^{\frac{t}{z}+sz}{% \mathrm{d}}z (1.7) or also (by replacing z=\frac{1}{w} in the definition of moments (1.6) and then interpreting them as residues) F(s;t):=-2i\pi s^{-{\boldsymbol{K}}-1}\left(1-s\right)^{{\boldsymbol{\rho}}}{% \rm e}^{st}=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\mu_{j}(t)\frac{s^{j}}{j!} (1.8) The map that associates to any polynomial p(z) the value \mathcal{M}[p]:=\oint_{|z|=1}p(z){\mathrm{d}}\mu(z) is an example of semiclassical moment functional [27, 28, 29, 37] and thus fits naturally in the general theory of [3] which guarantees that the Hankel determinant \tau_{n}(t;{\boldsymbol{K}},{\boldsymbol{\rho}}):=\det\left[\mu_{a+b-2}(t)% \right]_{a,b=1}^{n}, (1.9) is a tau function of an equation of Painlevé type. The matching with PV is explained in Section 2.2. More explicitly, from the identification it will follow that it satisfies the \sigma–form of the PV equation ([22], App. C) in the following way: let us define the quantities \displaystyle H_{{}_{V}} \displaystyle:=\frac{{\mathrm{d}}}{{\mathrm{d}}t}\ln\tau_{n}(t;{\boldsymbol{K}% },{\boldsymbol{\rho}})+\frac{\boldsymbol{\rho}}{2} (1.10) \displaystyle\sigma(t) \displaystyle:=tH_{V}+\frac{t}{2}(\theta_{0}+\theta_{\infty})+\frac{(\theta_{0% }+\theta_{\infty})^{2}-\theta_{1}^{2}}{4} (1.11) \displaystyle\theta_{0} \displaystyle:=2n+{{\boldsymbol{K}}};\qquad\theta_{1}:=-{{\boldsymbol{\rho}}};% \qquad\theta_{\infty}:={{\boldsymbol{\rho}}}-{{\boldsymbol{K}}}. (1.12) Then the \sigma–form of PV is the following ODE for \sigma defined in (1.11) \displaystyle\left(t\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}\sigma}{{\mathrm{d}}t^{2}}\right)^{2}= \displaystyle\left(\sigma-t\frac{{\mathrm{d}}\sigma}{{\mathrm{d}}t}+2\left(% \frac{{\mathrm{d}}\sigma}{{\mathrm{d}}t}\right)^{2}-(\theta_{\infty}+2\theta_{% 0})\frac{{\mathrm{d}}\sigma}{{\mathrm{d}}t}\right)^{2}+ \displaystyle-4\left(\frac{{\mathrm{d}}\sigma}{{\mathrm{d}}t}\right)\left(% \frac{{\mathrm{d}}\sigma}{{\mathrm{d}}t}-\frac{\theta_{0}-\theta_{1}+\theta_{% \infty}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{{\mathrm{d}}\sigma}{{\mathrm{d}}t}-\theta_{0}% \right)\left(\frac{{\mathrm{d}}\sigma}{{\mathrm{d}}t}-\frac{\theta_{0}+\theta_% {1}+\theta_{\infty}}{2}\right) (1.13) In the second part of the paper we exploit the connection between \tau_{n}(t) and Hankel determinants to describe the asymptotic location of its zeros as n\to\infty. More precisely we describe the asymptotic behaviour of the zeros of the polynomials P_{n}(s):=\tau_{n}(ns;{\boldsymbol{K}},{\boldsymbol{\rho}}),\ \ \ {\boldsymbol% {K}}\in{\mathbb{Z}},\ \ {\boldsymbol{\rho}}\not\in{\mathbb{Z}},\ \ \ n\to\infty, (1.14) in the s–plane (these zeroes are the same as the zeroes of \tau_{n} but homothetically rescaled by a factor 1/n). We observe that we do not consider a double–scaling limit where the either one of the parameters {\boldsymbol{K}}, {\boldsymbol{\rho}} or both are proportional to n as n\to\infty. While the general setup is conducive to such an analysis, the details of the construction of the g–function would have to be changed significantly and this is deferred to a future publication. The logic of the analysis is parallel to the one employed in [2, 1] and the main goal is to explain the emerging shape which clearly appears, see Fig. 1 n=15,\ {\boldsymbol{\rho}}=\frac{1}{100} n=16,\ {\boldsymbol{\rho}}=\frac{3}{100}+\frac{13i}{100} n=16,\ {\boldsymbol{\rho}}=\frac{101}{100}+\frac{33i}{100} n=17,\ {\boldsymbol{\rho}}=\frac{101}{100} n=26,\ {\boldsymbol{\rho}}=\frac{101}{100} n=40,\ {\boldsymbol{\rho}}=\frac{3}{100} Figure 1: The zeros of several instances of polynomial tau functions (all for {\boldsymbol{K}}=0). In the figure an almond-shaped region, which we call “Eye of the Tiger” (EoT), will be shown to be the asymptotic region where all zeros of P_{n}(s) (1.14) lie. The boundary of the region (marked in black) is determined by the implicit equation in the s–plane 2\ln\left|\frac{2i}{s}+i\sqrt{\frac{4}{s^{2}}+1}\right|-2\mathrm{Re}\,\left(% \sqrt{1+\frac{s^{2}}{4}}\right)=0 (1.15) which follows from (4.20), (4.26) below. Within the EoT the zeros of P_{n}(s) (1.14) arrange themselves in a semi-regular lattice. We give a description of this lattice in terms of a “quantization condition” described in Section 5.2.4, in particular (5.2.1) (for \mathrm{Re}\,(s)>0) or (5.2.2) (for \mathrm{Re}\,(s)<0). The two quantization conditions (5.2.1), (5.2.2) determine an asymptotic grid (shown in Fig. 2 in green and blue thin lines) at whose vertices the zeroes are approximately located. We do not estimate rigorously the rate of convergence, but the numerical evidence is quite striking even for relatively small values of n."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08787v1,Stability analysis of breathers for coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations,We investigate the spectral stability of non-degenerate vector soliton solutions and the nonlinear stability of breather solutions for the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) equations. The non-degenerate vector solitons are spectrally stable despite the linearized operator admits either embedded or isolated eigenvalues of negative Krein signature. The nonlinear stability of breathers is obtained by the Lyapunov method with the help of the squared eigenfunctions due to integrability of the CNLS equations.,"1 Introduction In this work, we study the spectral stability of the non-degenerate vector soliton solutions and the nonlinear stability of breather solutions in the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) equations [8, 39, 50] on the real line (also known as Manakov system): \begin{split}{\rm i}q_{1,t}+\frac{1}{2}q_{1,xx}+(|q_{1}|^{2}+|q_{2}|^{2})q_{1}% &=0,\\ {\rm i}q_{2,t}+\frac{1}{2}q_{2,xx}+(|q_{1}|^{2}+|q_{2}|^{2})q_{2}&=0,\end{split} (1) where (q_{1},q_{2})=(q_{1}(x,t),q_{2}(x,t)) are complex-valued functions and (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}. The initial-value problem for the CNLS equations (1) is globally well-posed in Sobolev space H^{k}(\mathbb{R}) for k\in\mathbb{N}, see [11]. The CNLS equations (1) have important applications in Bose-Einstein condensates [47] and birefringent fibers [2]. The nonlinear terms in CNLS equations (1) couple two components to describe self-phase and cross-phase modulation phenomenon. As an extension of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS), the CNLS equations (1) can be used to study the dynamics of vector solitons [1]. As an example of integrable equations, the CNLS equations (1) admit Lax pair [39, 56], bi-Hamiltonian structure [60], and an infinite set of conservation laws [60]. The Lax representation is a powerful tool to analyze the properties of equations. The Lax pair for CNLS equations (1) is \begin{split}\mathbf{\Phi}_{x}(\lambda;x,t)=\mathbf{U}(\lambda,\mathbf{q})% \mathbf{\Phi}(\lambda;x,t),\quad\mathbf{\Phi}_{t}(\lambda;x,t)=\mathbf{V}(% \lambda,\mathbf{q})\mathbf{\Phi}(\lambda;x,t)\end{split} (2) where \mathbf{U}(\lambda;x,t)={\rm i}\lambda\sigma_{3}+{\rm i}\mathbf{Q},\quad% \mathbf{V}(\lambda;x,t)={\rm i}\lambda^{2}\sigma_{3}+{\rm i}\lambda\mathbf{Q}-% \frac{1}{2}({\rm i}\sigma_{3}\mathbf{Q}^{2}-\sigma_{3}\mathbf{Q}_{x}), (3) with \displaystyle\mathbf{Q}(x,t)=\begin{pmatrix}0&\mathbf{r}^{T}\\ \mathbf{q}&0\end{pmatrix},\,\,\,\,\sigma_{3}=\mathrm{diag}(1,-1,-1),\quad% \mathbf{q}=(q_{1},q_{2})^{T},\quad\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{q}^{*}, and the complex spectral parameter \lambda. The CNLS equations (1) have the zero curvature representation \mathbf{U}_{t}-\mathbf{V}_{x}+[\mathbf{U},\mathbf{V}]=0, where [\mathbf{U},\mathbf{V}]\equiv\mathbf{U}\mathbf{V}-\mathbf{V}\mathbf{U} is the commutator. The Lax pair (2)–(3) can be derived from the 3\times 3 system [1, 60]. The infinite set of conservation laws can be obtained by trace formula in the inverse scattering transform for integrable equations with Hamiltonian structure [15, 30]. In particular, we will use the following conserved quantities of the CNLS equations (1): \displaystyle H_{0}(\mathbf{q}) \displaystyle=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left|\mathbf{q}\right|^{2}\mathrm{d% }x, (4) \displaystyle H_{1}(\mathbf{q}) \displaystyle=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}{\rm i}\mathbf{q}^{\dagger}\mathbf{q% }_{x}\mathrm{d}x, (5) \displaystyle H_{2}(\mathbf{q}) \displaystyle=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left(|\mathbf{q}_{x}|^{2}-\left|% \mathbf{q}\right|^{4}\right)\mathrm{d}x, (6) \displaystyle H_{3}(\mathbf{q}) \displaystyle=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}{\rm i}\left(\mathbf{q}_{x}^{\dagger% }\mathbf{q}_{xx}+3|\mathbf{q}|^{2}\mathbf{q}^{\dagger}_{x}\mathbf{q}\right)% \mathrm{d}x, (7) \displaystyle H_{4}(\mathbf{q}) \displaystyle=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left(|\mathbf{q}_{xx}|^{2}-4\left|% \mathbf{q}^{\dagger}\mathbf{q}_{x}\right|^{2}-\left(\mathbf{q}^{\dagger}% \mathbf{q}_{x}\right)^{2}-\left(\mathbf{q}_{x}^{\dagger}\mathbf{q}\right)^{2}-% 4\left|\mathbf{q}\right|^{2}\left|\mathbf{q}_{x}\right|^{2}+2\left|\mathbf{q}% \right|^{6}\right)\mathrm{d}x. (8) We note that H_{0}(\mathbf{q})=H_{0}^{(1)}(q_{1})+H_{0}^{(2)}(q_{2}), where H_{0}^{(j)}(q_{j})=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}|q_{j}|^{2}\mathrm{d}x, j=1,2 are independent conserved quantities. Another relevant observation is that the values of H_{1}(\mathbf{q}) and H_{3}(\mathbf{q}) are real due to integration by parts. Various solutions to the CNLS equations (1) have been derived through different methods. The degenerate vector solitons with the single-humped profiles were initially obtained through the inverse scattering method [39]. Bright and dark solitons had been discovered using Hirota bilinear method [48, 52]. The non-degenerate vector solitons with the double-humped profiles were derived by using the Hirota bilinear method in [53]. The asymptotic behavior and collision dynamics of non-degenerate solitons have been investigated in [49]. Furthermore, the Darboux transformation can be used to construct non-degenerate vector solitons and breather solutions [37, 47]. This paper focuses on investigating the stability of non-degenerate vector soliton and breather solutions from [47] in the time evolution of the CNLS equations (1). The stability analysis is a fundamental problem of mathematical physics, which is particularly important for applications of solitons and breathers in physics. 1.1 Review on stability results for CNLS equations The history of the nonlinear stability of solitary waves takes place from the first study on the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation by using the Lyapunov method in [7]. Regarding the NLS equation, nonlinear stability of ground states was obtained by utilizing concentration compactness principle in [10, 12] and [58]. Furthermore, the Lyapunov method was extended to a general class of Hamiltonian nonlinear evolution equations in [21, 22], with more results concerning the spectral stability in [20]. The Lyapunov method incorporates coercivity of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional in the proof of nonlinear stability of the orbit of solitary waves. This approach has been used in many works, see recent papers in [6, 29, 31, 32]. For the particular case of the CNLS equations (1) and their nonintegrable extensions, spectral stability of degenerate vector solitons with the single-humped profiles was obtained in [40]. The proofs of their nonlinear stability and instability was developed in [34, 35]. Variational characterizations of such vector solitons was developed in [43, 13, 41, 42]. The stability analysis of more general vector solitons which include multi-humped profiles in one component and the single-humped profiles in another component was developed in [45, 46]. Finally, bifurcations and stability of such vector solitons was developed recently in [59]. A difficulty in the nonlinear stability analysis of solitary waves with the multi-humped profiles by using the Lyapunov method arises due to a high number of negative eigenvalues of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional and a low number of symmetries that characterize its kernel [27]. In this work, we consider the double-humped profiles of the nondegenerate vector solitons and breather profiles and use integrability of the CNLS equations (1) to obtain the squared eigenfunctions of the Lax pair, see [14, 55]. The squared eigenfunctions satisfy the linearized operators which solve the spectral stability problem and contribute to the nonlinear stability analysis. The closure relation [19, 61, 28] provides tools to prove the completeness of squared eigenfunctions in the spectrum of the linearized operator and to compute the inner product between the squared eigenfunctions and adjoint squared eigenfunctions. It also allows us to relate the spectrum of the linearized operator with the spectrum of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional [26, 45, 23]. For the nonlinear stability analysis, we also use an additional tool that exists due to integrability of the CNLS equations (1). The same non-degenerate vector solitons can be characterized variationally with several Lyapunov functions due to the existence of the higher-order conserved quantities. This tool was pioneered in the proof of nonlinear stability of multi-solitons in [25, 38] and applied to studies of nonlinear stability of breathers in [4, 5], Dirac solitons in [44], and periodic waves and black solitons in [17, 18]. Further results on the linear and nonlinear stability of multi-solitons were found recently in [33, 57]. This approach is also useful to characterize linear transverse stability of solitary and periodic waves even if the higher-order conserved quantities do not form coercive Lyapunov functionals, see [24]. Here we will extend this tool to the CNLS equations (1). 1.2 Main result Recall the Galilean transformation for CNLS equations (1) given by T(a)\mathbf{q}(x,t)={\rm e}^{-2{\rm i}a(x+at)}\mathbf{q}(x+2at,t). (9) If \mathbf{q} is a solution of (1), so is T(a)\mathbf{q} for any a\in\mathbb{R}. Without loss of generality, one can consider the standing waves with zero speed and obtain traveling waves with nonzero speed by using (9). Consequently, we will consider the non-degenerate vector solitons in the form of the standing waves: \mathbf{q}(x,t)=\begin{pmatrix}{\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{1}^{2}t}&0\\ 0&{\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{2}^{2}t}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}u_{1}(x)\\ u_{2}(x)\end{pmatrix}, (10) where u_{1}(x),u_{2}(x):\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{C} represent spatial profiles of the two components with parameters b_{1},b_{2}>0 satisfying b_{1}\neq b_{2}. Without loss of generality, we assume 0<b_{2}<b_{1}. The exact expression for the non-degenerate vector solitons exist in the form, see [47], \displaystyle u_{1}(x;b_{1},b_{2},c_{11},c_{22}) \displaystyle=\frac{4b_{1}c_{11}}{M_{non}(x)}\left(|c_{22}|^{2}{\rm e}^{2b_{2}% x}+\frac{b_{1}-b_{2}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}{\rm e}^{-2b_{2}x}\right), (11) \displaystyle u_{2}(x;b_{1},b_{2},c_{11},c_{22}) \displaystyle=\frac{4b_{2}c_{22}}{M_{non}(x)}\left(|c_{11}|^{2}{\rm e}^{2b_{1}% x}+\frac{b_{2}-b_{1}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}{\rm e}^{-2b_{1}x}\right), (12) where M_{non}(x)=\frac{(b_{1}-b_{2})^{2}}{(b_{1}+b_{2})^{2}}{\rm e}^{-2(b_{1}+b_{2})% x}+|c_{11}|^{2}{\rm e}^{2(b_{1}-b_{2})x}+|c_{22}|^{2}{\rm e}^{-2(b_{1}-b_{2})x% }+|c_{11}c_{22}|^{2}{\rm e}^{2(b_{1}+b_{2})x} and c_{11},c_{22}\in\mathbb{C} are arbitrary parameters. The CNLS equations (1) are invariant under the four-parameter group of translations: S(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},x_{0},t_{0})\mathbf{q}(x,t)=\begin{pmatrix}{\rm e}^{{% \rm i}\theta_{1}}&0\\ 0&{\rm e}^{{\rm i}\theta_{2}}\end{pmatrix}\mathbf{q}(x+x_{0},t+t_{0}). (13) If \mathbf{q} is a solution of (1), so is S(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},x_{0},t_{0})\mathbf{q} for any \theta_{1},\theta_{2},x_{0},t_{0}\in\mathbb{R}. Without loss of generality, one can take c_{11}, c_{22} as real parameters by defining \theta_{1} and \theta_{2} in the transformation (13). Furthermore, if we parameterize c_{ii}=\sqrt{\frac{b_{1}-b_{2}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}}{\rm e}^{-2b_{i}\tau_{i}},\quad% \tau_{i}\in\mathbb{R}, the non-degenerate vector solitons in the form (15) reduce to the equivalent form found in [3, 54]: \begin{split}u_{1}=\frac{2b_{1}\sqrt{b_{1}^{2}-b_{2}^{2}}\ \mathrm{cosh}(2b_{2% }(x-\tau_{2}))}{b_{1}\mathrm{cosh}(2b_{1}(x-\tau_{1}))\mathrm{cosh}(2b_{2}(x-% \tau_{2}))-b_{2}\mathrm{sinh}(2b_{1}(x-\tau_{1}))\mathrm{sinh}(2b_{2}(x-\tau_{% 2}))},\\ u_{2}=\frac{2b_{2}\sqrt{b_{1}^{2}-b_{2}^{2}}\ \mathrm{sinh}(2b_{1}(x-\tau_{1})% )}{b_{1}\mathrm{cosh}(2b_{1}(x-\tau_{1}))\mathrm{cosh}(2b_{2}(x-\tau_{2}))-b_{% 2}\mathrm{sinh}(2b_{1}(x-\tau_{1}))\mathrm{sinh}(2b_{2}(x-\tau_{2}))}.\end{split} Only one parameter from \tau_{1}, \tau_{2} can be set to zero by the translational symmetry (13), the other parameter determines the profile of the non-degenerate vector soliton. The spatial profile of u_{1} is positive, whereas the spatial profile of u_{2} has a single zero at x=\tau_{1}. Figure 1 displays profiles |u_{1}| and |u_{2}| of some non-degenerate vector soliton solutions. The positive profile u_{1} can be either single-humped or double-humped. The single-zero profile u_{2} is always a superposition of two solitons of opposite polarity, hence |u_{2}| is always double-humped. Figure 1. Examples of the non-degenerate vector soliton solutions (11)–(12) with (a) b_{1}=2, b_{2}=2.002, c_{11}=c_{22}=1, (b) b_{1}=2, b_{2}=2.2, c_{11}=c_{22}=1, and (c) b_{1}=3, b_{2}=1, c_{11}=c_{22}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}. The solid blue line represents |u_{1}|, while the dashed red line represents |u_{2}|. Remark 1. The CNLS equations (1) are also invariant under the two-parameter group of rotations: R(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2})\mathbf{q}(x,t)=\begin{pmatrix}\cos(\alpha_{1})&\sin(% \alpha_{1})\\ -\sin(\alpha_{1})&\cos(\alpha_{1})\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\cos(\alpha_{2})% &{\rm i}\sin(\alpha_{2})\\ {\rm i}\sin(\alpha_{2})&\cos(\alpha_{2})\end{pmatrix}\mathbf{q}(x,t). (14) If \mathbf{q} is a solution of (1), so is R(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2})\mathbf{q} for any \alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}\in\mathbb{R}. The non-degenerate vector solitons (10) are written in the form with zero rotational parameters \alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}. For notational clarity, we define \mathbf{q}^{[2]}_{non}(x,t;a,b_{1},b_{2};c_{11},c_{22}):=T(a)\begin{pmatrix}{% \rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{1}^{2}t}u_{1}(x;b_{1},b_{2},c_{11},c_{22})\\ {\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{2}^{2}t}u_{2}(x;b_{1},b_{2},c_{11},c_{22})\end{pmatrix}, (15) where T(a) is given by (9) and the spatial profiles are given by (11) and (12). The spectral stability of the standing waves (10) is examined by considering the perturbative solution in the separable form \mathbf{q}=\mathbf{q}^{[2]}_{non}+\varepsilon T(a)\begin{pmatrix}{\rm e}^{2{% \rm i}b_{1}^{2}t}&0\\ 0&{\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{2}^{2}t}\end{pmatrix}\left(\mathbf{p}_{1}(x){\rm e}^{% \Omega t}+\mathbf{p}_{2}^{*}(x){\rm e}^{\Omega^{*}t}\right) (16) where \varepsilon is a small perturbation, \mathbf{p}_{1},\mathbf{p}_{2}\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}), and \Omega\in\mathbb{C}. Substituting (16) into (1) and linearizing at the order of \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon) yields the spectral problem for the linearized operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1}\mathbf{P}=\Omega\mathbf{P}, (17) where \mathbf{P}:=(\mathbf{p}_{1}^{T},\mathbf{p}_{2}^{T})^{T} and the expressions for \mathcal{J} and \mathcal{L}_{1} can be found in Section 3. In Hilbert space L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}), \mathcal{J} is skew-adjoint and \mathcal{L}_{1} is self-adjoint. The self-adjoint operator \mathcal{L}_{1} is related to the first variational characterization of the non-degenerate vector solitons \mathcal{I}_{1}:=H_{2}-4aH_{1}+4(a^{2}+b_{1}^{2})H_{0}^{(1)}+4(a^{2}+b_{2}^{2}% )H_{0}^{(2)}, (18) where H_{0}=H_{0}^{(1)}+H_{0}^{(2)}, H_{1}, and H_{2} are given by (4), (5), and (6). Euler–Lagrange equations for \mathcal{I}_{1} with fixed parameters a\in\mathbb{R}, b_{1},b_{2}>0 are given by \begin{split}2{\rm i}aq_{1,x}+\frac{1}{2}q_{1,xx}+(|q_{1}|^{2}+|q_{2}|^{2})q_{% 1}&=2(a^{2}+b_{1}^{2})q_{1},\\ 2{\rm i}aq_{2,x}+\frac{1}{2}q_{2,xx}+(|q_{1}|^{2}+|q_{2}|^{2})q_{2}&=2(a^{2}+b% _{2}^{2})q_{2},\end{split} (19) which are satisfied by \mathbf{q}=\mathbf{q}^{[2]}_{non}(\cdot,t;a,b_{1},b_{2};c_{11},c_{22}) for every t\in\mathbb{R}, c_{11},c_{22}\in\mathbb{C}. Adding a perturbation \mathbf{p} to \mathbf{q}^{[2]}_{non} in \mathcal{I}_{1} and expanding it near \mathbf{q}^{[2]}_{non} yields \mathcal{I}_{1}(\mathbf{q}^{[2]}_{non}+\mathbf{p})=\mathcal{I}_{1}(\mathbf{q}^% {[2]}_{non})+(\mathcal{L}_{1}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P})+\mathcal{O}(\|\mathbf{p}\|% _{H^{1}}^{3}), (20) with the same self-adjoint operator \mathcal{L}_{1} in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}) and with \mathbf{P}:=(\mathbf{p}^{T},\mathbf{p}^{\dagger})^{T}. The method of squared eigenfunctions allows us to construct all solutions of the spectral problem (17). Denote the stability spectrum \sigma_{s}(\mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1})=\{\Omega\in\mathbb{C}:\quad\mathbf{P}% \in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4})\}. The following theorem gives the spectral stability of the non-degenerate vector solitons by using the squared eigenfunctions. Theorem 1. The non-degenerate vector solitons \mathbf{q}_{non}^{[2]} for the CNLS equations (1) are spectrally stable, as indicated by \sigma_{s}(\mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1})\subset{\rm i}\mathbb{R}. If \frac{b_{1}}{b_{2}}\leq\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} or \frac{b_{1}}{b_{2}}\geq\sqrt{2}, there exist embedded eigenvalues of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1} that are limit points of the essential spectrum of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1}. For \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}<\frac{b_{1}}{b_{2}}<\sqrt{2}, the closure of the essential spectrum has no intersection with the point spectrum. Remark 2. The result of Theorem 1 agrees with the theory based on the dimension of the negative subspace \mathcal{N}_{1}:=\{\mathbf{P}\in H^{1}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}):\quad(% \mathcal{L}_{1}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P})<0\}, see [46, Section 3]. Eigenfunctions for embedded eigenvalues were found explicitly, see equation (36) in [46], and these eigenfunctions attain the negative values of (\mathcal{L}_{1}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P}). If \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}<\frac{b_{1}}{b_{2}}<\sqrt{2}, the same eigenvalues with negative values of (\mathcal{L}_{1}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P}) are isolated from the essential spectrum of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1}. Such eigenvalues on i\mathbb{R} with negative values of (\mathcal{L}_{1}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P}) are referred to as eigenvalues of negative Krein signature. It is natural to ask whether the non-degenerate vector solitons remain stable under nonlinear perturbation in H^{1}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}). However, the nonlinear orbital stability theory from [21, 22] does not hold for such vector solitons with multi-humped profiles because the negative subspace of \mathcal{N}_{1} restricted at the tangent space of fixed H_{0}^{(1)}, H_{0}^{(2)}, and H_{1} is two-dimensional, see equation (41) in [46]. As a result, we provide a second variational characterization of the non-degenerate vector solitons by using the higher-order conserved quantities H_{3} and H_{4} in (6) and (7). However, the second characterization does not distinguish between the non-degenerate vector solitons and the breather solutions, to which they are particular cases [51]. The nonlinear orbit of the breather solutions is constructed by using the scattering parameters in the Darboux transformation as in the following definition. Definition 1. Fix the scattering parameters (c_{11},c_{21},c_{12},c_{22})\in\mathbb{C}^{4} and the spectral parameters a\in\mathbb{R}, b_{1},b_{2}>0 such that b_{1}\neq b_{2}. The breather solutions of CNLS equations (1) are given by \mathbf{q}^{[2]}(x,t;a,b_{1},b_{2};c_{11},c_{22},c_{12},c_{21}):=4T(a)\frac{N(% x,t)}{M(x,t)}, (21) where \displaystyle N(x,t) \displaystyle:=\left[{\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{1}^{2}t}b_{1}\left(|\mathbf{c}_{2}|^{% 2}{\rm e}^{2b_{2}x}+\frac{b_{1}-b_{2}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}{\rm e}^{-2b_{2}x}\right)-{% \rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{2}^{2}t}\frac{2b_{1}b_{2}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}\mathbf{c}_{1}^{{% \dagger}}\mathbf{c}_{2}{\rm e}^{2b_{1}x}\right]\mathbf{c}_{1} \displaystyle\qquad+\left[{\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{2}^{2}t}b_{2}\left(|\mathbf{c}_{% 1}|^{2}{\rm e}^{2b_{1}x}+\frac{b_{2}-b_{1}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}{\rm e}^{-2b_{1}x}% \right)-{\rm e}^{2{\rm i}b_{1}^{2}t}\frac{2b_{1}b_{2}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}\mathbf{c}_% {2}^{{\dagger}}\mathbf{c}_{1}{\rm e}^{2b_{2}x}\right]\mathbf{c}_{2}, and \displaystyle M(x,t) \displaystyle:=\frac{(b_{1}-b_{2})^{2}}{(b_{1}+b_{2})^{2}}{\rm e}^{-2(b_{1}+b_% {2})x}+|\mathbf{c}_{1}|^{2}{\rm e}^{2(b_{1}-b_{2})x}+|\mathbf{c}_{2}|^{2}{\rm e% }^{-2(b_{1}-b_{2})x} \displaystyle\qquad+\left(|\mathbf{c}_{1}|^{2}|\mathbf{c}_{2}|^{2}-\frac{4b_{1% }b_{2}}{(b_{1}+b_{2})^{2}}\mathbf{c}_{1}^{\dagger}\mathbf{c}_{2}\mathbf{c}_{2}% ^{\dagger}\mathbf{c}_{1}\right){\rm e}^{2(b_{1}+b_{2})x}-\frac{8b_{1}b_{2}}{(b% _{1}+b_{2})^{2}}\mathrm{Re}\left(\mathbf{c}_{1}^{{\dagger}}\mathbf{c}_{2}{\rm e% }^{2{\rm i}(-b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2})t}\right), for \mathbf{c}_{i}=(c_{1i},c_{2i})^{T}, i=1,2. Non-degenerate vector soliton solutions (15) are given by the breather solutions (21) with c_{12}=c_{21}=0. Figure 2. Examples of the breather solutions (21) with a=0, b_{1}=3, b_{2}=1, c_{11}=c_{22}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, and (a1, a2) c_{12}=c_{21}=0, (b1, b2) c_{12}=c_{21}=0.1, (c1, c2) c_{12}=c_{21}=0.5, (d1, d2) c_{12}=0.5, c_{21}=1. Top (bottom) panels show the norm of the first (second) component. Examples of the profiles of breather solutions of Definition 1 are shown in Figure 2. Panels (a1,a2) display the time-independent dynamics of a non-degenerate vector soliton since c_{12}=c_{21}=0, where other panels display the time-periodic dynamics of the breather solutions with different nonzero values of c_{12}, c_{21}. The following theorem presents the main result of this paper on the nonlinear stability of the breather solutions of Definition 1. Theorem 2. The breather solutions (21) are nonlinearly stable in the following sense. For any initial condition \mathbf{u}_{0}\in H^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}), denote the global solution of the CNLS equations (1) by \mathbf{u}. Given any positive constant \epsilon>0, there exist \delta>0 such that if \|\mathbf{u}_{0}-\mathbf{q}^{[2]}(\cdot,0;a,b_{1},b_{2};c_{11}(0),c_{22}(0),c_% {12}(0),c_{21}(0))\|_{H^{2}}<\delta, for some breather solutions \mathbf{q}^{[2]} with parameters a\in\mathbb{R}, b_{1},b_{2}>0 such that b_{1}\neq b_{2}, and c_{ij}(0)\in\mathbb{C}, 1\leq i,j\leq 2, then there exist c_{ij}(t)\in C^{1}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}),1\leq i,j\leq 2 such that \|\mathbf{u}(\cdot,t)-\mathbf{q}^{[2]}(\cdot,t;a,b_{1},b_{2};c_{11}(t),c_{22}(% t),c_{12}(t),c_{21}(t))\|_{H^{2}}<\epsilon for any t\in\mathbb{R}. The rate of change of c_{ij}(t) are controlled by \sum_{i,j}|\partial_{t}c_{ij}(t)|\leq C\epsilon (22) for all t\in\mathbb{R} and some constant C. Remark 3. Compared to the standard applications of the Lyapunov method, it is not sufficient to use the translation and phase symmetries (13) of the CNLS equations (1), as well as the rotational symmetry (14), for the proof of the nonlinear stability of the non-degenerate vector solitons because the second variation of the corresponding Lyapunov functional is not coercive in the tangent plane related to these symmetries. The choice of the scattering parameters c_{11},c_{22},c_{12},c_{21}, which can be viewed as generalizations of symmetries in the Darboux transformation [31], addresses this issue. When the four complex-valued scattering parameters are perturbed, the non-degenerate vector solitons are not only translated according to the symmetries (13) and (14) but also transform into more general breather solutions. Therefore, it is natural to consider the nonlinear stability of the set of breather solutions. Evidences that breather solutions rather than the non-degenerate vector solitons are more appropriate objects in the construction of the nonlinearly stable orbits can be seen from various soliton interaction scenarios in a related complex short-pulse equation [9, 16]. 1.3 Main steps of the proof The CNLS equations (1) are given by the second flow of the Hamiltonian equations \mathbf{q}_{t}=\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{J}\frac{\delta H_{2}}{\delta\mathbf{q}}, (23) where \mathcal{J}=-{\rm i} is a skew-adjoint operator. The Hamiltonian formulation (23) is used in the construction of the first variational characterization of the non-degenerate vector solitons, as in (18). However, since this is not sufficient for the proof of their nonlinear stability, we proceed with the second variational characterization, which extends to the entire family of breather solutions of Definition 1. We define the following Lyapunov functional \displaystyle\mathcal{I}_{2} \displaystyle:=H_{4}-8aH_{3}+4(6a^{2}+b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2})H_{2}-16a(2a^{2}+b_{% 1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2})H_{1} \displaystyle\qquad+16(a^{2}+b_{1}^{2})(a^{2}+b_{2}^{2})H_{0}. (24) We show in Appendix A from the trace formula that \mathbf{q}^{[2]}(x,t;a,b_{1},b_{2};c_{11},c_{22},c_{12},c_{21}) is a critical point of \mathcal{I}_{2}. For the solution \mathbf{u}=\mathbf{u}(x,t) in Theorem 2, the continuity and conservation of the Lyapunov functional lead to \mathcal{I}_{2}(\mathbf{u}(\cdot,t))-\mathcal{I}_{2}(\mathbf{q}^{[2]}(\cdot,t)% )=\mathcal{I}_{2}(\mathbf{u}_{0})-\mathcal{I}_{2}(\mathbf{q}^{[2]}(\cdot,0))% \leq C\|\mathbf{u}_{0}-\mathbf{q}^{[2]}(\cdot,0)\|_{H^{2}}, for some C>0. On the other hand, for the perturbation \mathbf{p} added to \mathbf{q}^{[2]}, we can expand \mathcal{I}_{2} near \mathbf{q}^{[2]} and obtain \mathcal{I}_{2}(\mathbf{q}^{[2]}+\mathbf{p})=\mathcal{I}_{2}(\mathbf{q}^{[2]})% +\langle\mathcal{L}_{2}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P}\rangle_{L^{2}}+\mathcal{O}(\|% \mathbf{p}\|_{H^{2}}^{3}), (25) defined by a self-adjoint operator \mathcal{L}_{2} in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}) acting on \mathbf{P}:=(\mathbf{p}^{T},\mathbf{p}^{\dagger})^{T}. If \mathcal{L}_{2} were coercive in H^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}), then we could obtain the stability of the non-degenerate vector solitons. However, this is not the case. The self-adjoint operator \mathcal{L}_{2} admits a nontrivial kernel of dimension eight and a negative subspace of dimension two. Introducing the nonlinear orbit is a method to overcome this difficulty and obtain coercivity at the tangent plane defined by appropriate orthogonality conditions. To characterize the spectrum of \mathcal{L}_{2}, it suffices to study eigenfunctions of the operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2}. Using the higher flow in Hamiltonian equations, the spectrum of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2} can be determined by the method of squared eigenfunctions. The closure relation can then be used to calculate the inner product (\mathcal{L}_{2}\cdot,\cdot) through these squared eigenfunctions. This approach allows us to determine the number of negative eigenvalues and the kernel of \mathcal{L}_{2}. The spectrum of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2} is very similar to the spectrum of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1} in Theorem 1 but includes no additional eigenvalues on i\mathbb{R} (neither isolated nor embedded), see Theorem 3 in Section 4. Similarly, the spectrum of \mathcal{L}_{2} contains two negative eigenvalues, see Theorem 4, compared to the spectrum of \mathcal{L}_{1} which contains four negative eigenvalues, see Remark 9. The main difficulty in the proof of nonlinear stability of breather solutions lies in evaluating the inner product (\mathcal{L}_{2}\cdot,\cdot) on the subspace \mathrm{gKer}(\mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2})\backslash\mathrm{Ker}(\mathcal{J}% \mathcal{L}_{2}) in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}), which corresponds to the zero eigenvalue of \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2} with high algebraic multiplicity. By defining the skew-symmetric differential form \omega(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{f})=(\mathbf{h}^{\dagger}\mathcal{J}\mathbf{f})% \mathrm{d}x,\quad\mathbf{f}\in\mathrm{Ker}(\mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2}),\,\,% \mathbf{h}\in\mathrm{gKer}(\mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2})\backslash\mathrm{Ker}(% \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2}) (26) and transforming the inner product (\mathcal{L}_{2}\cdot,\cdot) to the integral of the differential form \omega(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{f}), we transform the corresponding inner product (\mathcal{L}_{2}\cdot,\cdot) into the inner product between squared eigenfunctions and adjoint squared eigenfunctions. We present a new method to calculate the inner product between squared eigenfunctions and adjoint squared eigenfunctions, which relies on the properties of integrability rather than on the explicit expressions for eigenfunctions. In our approach, the inner product between squared eigenfunctions and adjoint squared eigenfunctions can be determined by analyzing the behavior of squared eigenfunction matrices at infinity. The connection arises from the symmetry of the potential in the Lax pair (2) and the differential equations satisfied by the squared eigenfunction matrices. The kernel \mathrm{Ker}(\mathcal{L}_{2}) can be obtained through derivatives of the four complex scattering parameters (c_{11},c_{12},c_{21},c_{22}) in the orbit of breather solutions (21). Moreover, functions corresponding to the negative subspace \mathcal{N}_{2}:=\{\mathbf{P}\in H^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}):\quad(% \mathcal{L}_{2}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{P})<0\} can be derived from variations of conserved quantities that are linear combinations of conservation laws. By considering modulation and constructing the reduced Hamiltonian [21, 22], we derive the nonlinear stability result of Theorem 2. 1.4 Notations Let us consider the real Hilbert space \mathrm{X}=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}u_{1}&u_{2}&u_{1}^{*}&u_{2}^{*}\end{pmatrix}^% {T}:\quad u_{1},u_{2}\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C})\right\}\subset L^{2}(% \mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}), equipped with the inner product (\mathbf{f},\mathbf{g})=\mathrm{Re}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\mathbf{f}^{\dagger}% \mathbf{g}\mathrm{d}x. The decomposition for real Hilbert space L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4})=\mathrm{X}\oplus{\rm i}\mathrm{X} holds. Notation \cdot^{*} represents the complex conjugate and \cdot^{\dagger} represents the operator adjoint or conjugate and transpose for matrices. For example, ({\rm i}\partial_{x})^{*}=(-{\rm i})\partial_{x}\quad\mbox{\rm and}\quad({\rm i% }\partial_{x})^{\dagger}=(-\partial_{x})(-{\rm i})={\rm i}\partial_{x}. Then we can view any vector \mathbf{u}\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}) in the space \mathrm{X} through the bijection \iota(\mathbf{u})=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{u}\\ \mathbf{u}^{*}\end{pmatrix}\in\mathrm{X}. The bijection \iota is also an isomorphism between the Hilbert space L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}) and \mathrm{X} since (\iota(\mathbf{u}),\iota(\mathbf{v}))=2(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}). Then any operator \mathcal{A} acting on L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}) can naturally be extended on \mathrm{X}: \mathcal{A}^{\prime}\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{u}\\ \mathbf{u}^{*}\end{pmatrix}=\iota\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{u})=\begin{pmatrix}% \mathcal{A}\mathbf{u}\\ (\mathcal{A}\mathbf{u})^{*}\end{pmatrix}. For a functional \mathcal{K}(\mathbf{q}) on L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}), the first variation \frac{\delta\mathcal{K}}{\delta\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{q}) is given by \left(\mathbf{v},\frac{\delta\mathcal{K}}{\delta\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{q})\right)% =\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\frac{\mathcal{K}(\mathbf{q}+\epsilon\mathbf{v})-\mathcal% {K}(\mathbf{q})}{\epsilon} for \mathbf{v}\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}). The second variation is given by \frac{\delta^{2}\mathcal{K}}{\delta^{2}\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{q})[\mathbf{v}]=% \lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\frac{\frac{\delta\mathcal{K}}{\delta\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{q% }+\epsilon\mathbf{v})-\frac{\delta\mathcal{K}}{\delta\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{q})}{% \epsilon}. In the following, we abuse the notation \mathcal{A} to represent \mathcal{A}^{\prime} without ambiguity and sometimes we mean \mathbf{u} be \iota(\mathbf{u}) in \mathrm{X}. The reason why we consider \mathrm{X} instead of L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{2}) is that it makes the expression and calculation of functions more convenient compared to the separation of the real and imaginary parts of functions. The functions in \mathrm{X} can be obtained by the functions (\mathbf{q}^{T},\mathbf{r}^{T})^{T}\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}) with symmetries \mathbf{r}=\mathbf{q}^{*} which are the symmetries of potentials in the Lax pair (2). Hence it is natural to consider the space \mathrm{X} in the dynamics of the CNLS equations (1). It is important to note that both the space \mathrm{X} and L^{2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{4}) can be interpreted as complex linear spaces. When we examine the eigenspace of an operator, we consider complex linear combinations of eigenfunctions. 1.5 Main contributions Our main contributions can be listed as follows. • The spectral stability for non-degenerate vector solitons is obtained by using the method of squared eigenfunctions. The spectral problem of the linearized operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1} is solved by squared eigenfunctions and the spectrum of the linearized operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1} is obtained with the dimension of the negative subspace \mathcal{N}_{1}. The non-degenerate vector solitons are spectrally stable. In addition, the linearized operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1} admits either embedded or isolated eigenvalues of negative Krein signature. • We connect the inner product (\mathcal{L}_{2}\cdot,\cdot) for eigenfunctions in the generalized kernel of the operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2} with the integral in the skew-symmetric differential form. This integral can be computed from the squared eigenfunction matrix due to integrability of the CNLS equations (1). The dimension of the negative subspace \mathcal{N}_{2} is calculated. Our method can be readily extended to the studies of stability of solitons or breathers in other integrable equations by using the integrability tools. • The nonlinear stability of the breather solutions in the CNLS equations (1) is derived for the first time. The nonlinear stability of the non-degenerate vector solitons with the spectral parameters a,b_{1},b_{2} holds when they are included in the orbit of the breather solutions of Definition 1 given by the scattering parameters c_{11},c_{22},c_{12},c_{21} in the relevant Darboux transformation. 1.6 Outline This paper is organized as follows. • In Section 2, we construct the non-degenerate vector soliton and breather solution by using Darboux transformation. We also introduce squared eigenfunctions and the squared eigenfunction matrix. The Lyapunov functional and the properties of its second variation are analyzed. • In Section 3, we investigate the spectral stability of non-degenerate vector soliton solutions. The proof of Theorem 1 relies on analyzing the spectrum of the linearized operator \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{1} constructed by using squared eigenfunctions. • In Section 4, we construct the squared eigenfunctions in higher flow to prove that the squared eigenfunctions satisfy the spectral problem for \mathcal{J}\mathcal{L}_{2}. Subsequently, the closure relation induces the spectrum of \mathcal{L}_{2}. • In Section 5, we prove the nonlinear stability of breather solutions in Theorem 2."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07333v1,Several Examples of Application of the Simple Equations Method (SEsM) for Obtaining Exact Solutions of Nonlinear PDEs,We apply the Simple Equations Method (SEsM) for obtaining exact solutions of nonlinear differential equations. We discuss several examples with goal to illustrate the results from the use of derivatives of composite functions in the algorithm of SEsM. The discussed examples contain derivatives of functions which are composite functions of solutions of two simple equations.,"The complex systems are in the most cases non-linear ones [1]- [16]. Thus, large efforts are focused on the study of the effects of this nonlinearity. Such effects are studied by the methods of the time series analysis and by models based on differential or difference equations [17] - [31]. Usually, the model equations are nonlinear partial differential or difference equations. Thus, the exact and approximate analytical solutions od such equation are of great interest. The methodology for obtaining such solutions is in development since several decades. At the beginning, researchers tried to transform the nonlinearity of the studied equation and even to remove it by means of appropriate transformation. One example is the Hopf-Cole transformation [32], [33]. It transforms the nonlinear Burgers equation to the linear heat equation. Following this way, one arrived at the Method of Inverse Scattering Transform [34] - [36] the method of Hirota [37], [38]. Another line of research connected to the use of transformations is [39]. Below, we discuss and apply the SEsM (Simple Equations Method) [40] -[42]. This method is a result of another branch of research on the methodology. Kudryashov and then Kudryashov and Loguinova developed the Method of Simplest Equation (MSE) [43],[44] . This method is based on determination of singularity order n of the solved nonlinear partial differential equation and searching of particular solution of this equation as series containing powers of solutions of a simpler equation called simplest equation. The SEsM methodology has a long story until its recent formulation which was given in [45] - [48]. SEsM was proposed by Vitanov after many years of research which started almost 35 years ago [49] - [53]. Then, in 2009 [54], [55] and in 2010, Vitanov and co-authors used the ordinary differential equation of Bernoulli as simplest equation [56] and applied the simplest version of of SEsM called Modified Method of Simplest Equation (MMSE) to ecology and population dynamics [57]. MMSE used a balance equation [58], [59] to determine the kind of the simplest equation and truncation of the series of solutions of the simplest equation. MMSE is equivalent of the MSE mentioned above. Up to 2018 the contributions to the methodology and its application have been connected to the MMSE [60] - [64]. This research was based on single simplest equation and one balance equation. The construction of the solution of the solved equation was chosen to be as power series containing powers of the solutions of the simplest equation. Recently Vitanov extended the capacity of the methodology by inclusion of the possibility of use of more than one simplest equation. This version is called SEsM - Simple Equations Method as the used simple equations are more simple than the solved nonlinear partial differential equation but these simple equations in fact can be quite complicated. We note that a variant of SEsM based on two simple equations was applied in [66] and the first description of the methodology was made in [45] and then in [46] - [48]. For more applications of specific cases of the methodology see [67],[68]. In this article we will show several examples of application of SEsM. We illustrate the use of composite function which is a function of two simple functions. Each simple functions can be a function of two independent variables. The structure of the article is as follows. We describe SEsM in Sect 2. In Sect. 3, we supply the information needed for the use of derivatives of composite functions in SEsM. Several examples are shown in Sect. 4 and Sect. 5 presents some concluding remarks."
