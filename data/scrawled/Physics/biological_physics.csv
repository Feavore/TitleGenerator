https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09456v1,A trade-off between hydrodynamic performance and morphological bias limits the evolution of symmetric lattice animal wings,"Bristled and membranous insect wings have co-evolved despite apparently serving the same functionality. We emulate flight physics using an automated free-fall experiment to better understand how and why several distinct wing forms may have developed. Biomimetic two-dimensional lattice animals were laser cut from a continuous sheet of paper, and their descent in a settling tank was tracked using a camera. Data from 31 generic symmetric polyominos (1,692 experiments) reveal that morphology impacts the drag coefficient C_{D} and hence flight efficiency. Some polyominos rapidly sediment while others remain suspended for longer. Positioning the search for an optimal shape within an evolutionary context, we relinquished control of the automated setup to a genetic algorithm. Hereditary information passes between generations in proportion to fitness and is augmented by rare mutations. High-performing morphologies are observed, but experimental repeats do not re-evolve the same shapes. Adaptation rates also differ if the selective pressure is reversed from suspension to sedimentation. Our data (50,086 experiments) reveal several physical sources of indeterminism in the simulated natural selection process, including fluid flow variability and morphological entropy. This provides experimental support for the idea that the lack of convergence in insect wing shape may partly reflect the competition between fitness and entropy, making it nearly impossible to achieve unique optimal forms.","Natural selection drives the evolution of form and function of living organisms to fit their environment constrained by cost [1]. Unveiling the sources of predictability, or the lack thereof, in evolution is thus a fundamental biophysical problem. Sometimes, populations can respond as expected to ecological changes or challenges in a process known as convergent evolution [2]. Other times, emerging traits appear to be non-deterministic, but physically well-defined examples of this are rare. Insect wing morphology may serve as a basic example of evolutionary variability, where distinct wing geometries can be observed in extant species occupying similar environments [3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8]. A specific example is the case of porous (bristled) and solid (membranous) wings in small flying insects (Fig 1A) [5, 9, 7]. Most insect wings are solid and impermeable to air [10]. During flight, fluid flows around the cuticular membrane strengthened by longitudinal and transverse veins. In contrast, some air can leak through bristled wings, comprising rake-like appendages attached to a slender rod [5, 4, 11]. However, the quantitative reason why bristled and membraneous insect wings co-exist remains unclear. Recent work (see e.g., Lee and Kim [12]) has demonstrated that the leakiness of bristled wings reduces its aerodynamic performance compared to the solid wing [12]. However, the bristled wing is also lighter. Per unit mass, permeable wings can, therefore, sometimes yield an evolutionary advantage [8, 6, 7, 5, 13, 4, 5, 12, 9]. To our knowledge, however, the precise balance between performance and shape, has not been explored in an evolutionary and statistical context. This letter positions morphology and performance in a synthetic evolutionary framework. Artificial wings settling under gravity provide a model of parachuting flight [14], while evolution is mimicked by a genetic algorithm [15, 16, 17, 15]. We introduce polyomino wings to avoid the limitations associated with pre-defined morphologies [6, 12, 11]. We begin by introducing the experimental methodology. Subsequent sections lay out the results. Finally, the the implications for shape evolution are discussed. Figure 1: Lattice animals and experimental setup.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09216v1,A Differentiable Model of Nucleic Acid Dynamics,"Developing physics-based models for molecular simulation requires fitting many unknown parameters to experimental datasets of diverse properties. Fitting such diverse data is typically carried out piecemeal, resulting in a “zoo” of disconnected but highly related models. Here, we leverage recently developed methods for computing low-variance gradient estimates with automatic differentiation to facilitate the extensible, reproducible, and transparent fitting of the physics-based DNA model oxDNA. We demonstrate simultaneous fitting to structural, mechanical, and thermodynamic data using a variety of techniques, including enhanced sampling, external forcing, cluster-move Monte Carlo schemes, and micro- and millisecond timescales, and fit oxDNA to a range of target properties, such as twist-stretch couplings and duplex melting temperatures. We also demonstrate how gradients can serve as an efficient means of sensitivity analysis through which we uncover the surprising importance of the cross-stacking interaction in oxDNA. Though grounded in oxDNA, this work provides a framework for extensible, community-driven force field development more generally that will yield rapidly improved models and subsequent physical insights for systems ranging from RNA to protein to their interactions with inorganic materials.","Physics-based molecular simulations using coarse-grained potentials are a cornerstone of in silica biophysical modeling. When sufficiently accurate, they provide a unique way to study a biophysical system beyond available experimental data [1]. Such models have provided deep insights ranging from viral assembly [2, 3, 4, 5] to protein folding [6, 7, 8] to chromosomal organization [9, 10]. Recent successes in experimental nucleic acid nanotechnology [11, 12, 13] combined with the comparative simplicity of DNA and RNA relative to proteins renders DNA/RNA modeling an attractive and active area of research. Yet, while recent years have seen extraordinary progress in the accuracy of large scale machine learning (ML) models, from large language models [14, 15] to protein structure prediction [16], the accuracy of coarse-grained potentials has stagnated. The machine learning examples clearly demonstrate that increased model accuracy unlocks enormous value. Recently, Donoho hypothesized [17] that frictionless reproducibility, the ease of reproducing and iteratively improving models, is the major factor leading to dramatic ML model improvement. Within ML, model parameters are almost universally fit via gradient-based optimization, datasets are clearly partitioned into train, validation, and test subsets, objective functions are clearly-defined, and trained models and fitting procedures are often publicly available via popular open-source tools such as GitHub and Hugging Face. These standardized and transparent fitting procedures enable rapid technological innovation. Here, we demonstrate how this paradigm can be applied to fitting coarse-grained, physics-based potentials. We apply differentiable programming, the backbone of machine learning algorithms whereby gradients are computed via automatic differentiation (AD), to an exemplar of coarse-grained molecular modeling: nucleic acid force field development. Despite resounding successes for particular coarse-grained DNA and RNA models [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], both types of force field development are plagued by suboptimal parameter fitting methods that are often opaque and hard to reproduce. Force field parameters are typically the result of heroic fitting procedures with significant hand-design [24, 18, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Even force fields that have been fit through comparatively more principled approaches such as Iterative Boltzmann Inversion [31, 24], maximum likelihood methods [32], or Newton Inversion [33] often use piecemeal approaches to parameter optimization: each type of interaction (e.g. hydrogen bonding, excluded volume, stacking, etc) is treated individually – often with differing parameterization schemes – without simultaneous optimization of all parameter types. As such, existing models cannot be easily adapted to model new effects (e.g. non-canonical base-pairing, electrostatics) or new experimental data. Often, entirely new models are invented to treat experimental inconsistencies without knowing whether this is truly required given the initial model parameterization. A case in point is the recent MADna model of Assenza and Pérez [24], developed to model mechanical properties that are poorly captured by existing models (e.g. oxDNA, 3SPN). Rather than fine-tuning an existing, otherwise successful DNA model, Assenza and Pérez were required to develop an entirely new model. Indeed, expanded parameterizations of DNA/RNA models often appear years after the original model release [34, 35, 36, 37, 38], attesting to the difficulty and laboriousness of refining models where parameterization is nontransparent and unsystematic. The ultimate result is a fragmented “zoo” of models that each require months or years of trial-and-error parameter fitting despite attempting to represent similar datasets. Figure 1: The formulation of force field parameter fitting as an optimization problem akin to neural network training. The choice of functional form is analogous to fixing a neural network architecture, where geometric parameters control the relative positions of beads in a rigid body and Hamiltonian parameters describe the interactions between these beads. The objective function is formulated as a function of ground truth data, typically derived from experiment, and is evaluated by means of forward simulations. The oxDNA model was originally fit to three classes of experimental data: structural (e.g. helical pitch and diameter), mechanical (e.g. persistence length L_{ps}), and thermodynamic (e.g. melting temperatures T_{m}). The depiction of the oxDNA architecture is adapted from Ref. [39]. Here, we focus on solving these issues within oxDNA, a coarse-grained model with a physics-based and interpretable potential energy function. The model has enjoyed extensive validation against experiment [40] and is therefore widely employed in the DNA nanotechnology community for both (i) deriving in silica biophysical insights in systems such as nanotweezers and gels [41, 42, 43], and (ii) complementing experimental studies in subjects ranging from strand displacement [44, 45] to DNA origami [46, 47]. By focusing on an experimentally-relevant model with a relatively complex and expressive energy function, we are forced to confront the three main issues of traditional differentiable MD. First, computing the gradient through long unrolled simulations imposes a significant memory overhead as well as numerical instabilities [48, 49]. Second, many fundamental algorithms in molecular simulation are not end-to-end differentiable (e.g. cluster-move Monte Carlo schemes). Third, decades of research have been dedicated to optimizing MD algorithms to increase the accessible timescales, but many of these optimizations are lost upon reimplementation in an automatic differentiation framework. We surmount these technical challenges using a novel method for stochastic gradient estimation [50, 51], making it possible to use gradient-descent to fit force field parameters to the three classes of experimental data to which oxDNA was originally fit: structural, mechanical, and thermodynamic. Each class of data poses a unique set of challenges that are not present in toy models previously studied with differentiable MD. For example, calculation of mechanical properties, such as persistence length or stretch modulus, typically requires micro- and millisecond-scale simulations to sample many uncorrelated states, line-fitting procedures to infer summary statistics, and the application of external forces and torques. Similarly, melting temperature calculations require particularly complex simulations, involving enhanced sampling, cluster-move Monte Carlo algorithms, and temperature extrapolation. Our approach allows us to combine the methods developed for each individual class of data to fit parameters to single objective functions that jointly target structural, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties, allowing for the first time a systematic, simultaneous parameter optimization for different loss functions and for different interaction terms in the potential energy function. We also demonstrate how the calculated gradients can be adapted for sensitivity analyses, enabling the rapid derivation of physical insights. Our results not only agree with existing literature, but also reveal new insights. As an example, we find cross-stacking interaction parameters are much more influential than naively expected. We hope that this work serves as a launching point for what we believe will be paradigm shift in extensible, collaborative, community-driven force field development. We make all code for the parameter optimizations presented in this work available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rkruegs123/jax-dna.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09615v1,Noise-driven odd elastic waves in living chiral active matter,"Chiral active matter is predicted to exhibit odd elasticity, with nontraditional elastic response arising from a combination of chirality, being out of equilibrium, and the presence of nonreciprocal interactions. One of the resulting phenomena is the possible occurrence of odd elastic waves in overdamped systems, although its experimental realization still remains elusive. Here we show that in overdamped active systems, noise is required to generate persistent elastic waves. In the chiral crystalline phase of active matter, such as that found recently in populations of swimming starfish embryos, the noise arises from self-driving of active particles and their mutual collisions, a key factor that has been missing in previous studies. We identify the criterion for the occurrence of noise-driven odd elastic waves, and postulate the corresponding phase diagram for the general chiral active crystals. Our results can be used to predict the experimental conditions for achieving a transition to self-sustained elastic waves in overdamped active systems.","References Toner et al. [2005] J. Toner, Y.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09599v1,Effect of Parametric Variation of Chordae Tendineae Structure on Simulated Atrioventricular Valve Closure,"Purpose: Many approaches have been used to model chordae tendineae geometries in finite element simulations of atrioventricular heart valves. Unfortunately, current “functional” chordae tendineae geometries lack fidelity (e.g., branching) that would be helpful when informing clinical decisions. The objectives of this work are (i) to improve synthetic chordae tendineae geometry fidelity to consider branching and (ii) to define how the chordae tendineae geometry affects finite element simulations of valve closure.Methods: In this work, we develop an open-source method to construct synthetic chordae tendineae geometries in the SlicerHeart Extension of 3D Slicer. The generated geometries are then used in FEBio finite element simulations of atrioventricular valve function to evaluate how variations in chordae tendineae geometry influence valve behavior. Effects are evaluated using functional and mechanical metrics.Results: Our findings demonstrated that altering the chordae tendineae geometry of a stereotypical mitral valve led to changes in clinically relevant valve metrics (regurgitant orifice area, contact area, and billowing volume) and valve mechanics (first principal strains). Specifically, cross sectional area had the most influence over valve closure metrics, followed by chordae tendineae density, length, radius and branches. We then used this information to showcase the flexibility of our new workflow by altering the chordae tendineae geometry of two additional geometries (mitral valve with annular dilation and tricuspid valve) to improve finite element predictions.Conclusion: This study presents a flexible, open-source method for generating synthetic chordae tendineae with realistic branching structures. Further, we establish relationships between the chordae tendineae geometry and valve functional/mechanical metrics. This research contribution helps enrich our open-source workflow and brings the finite element simulations closer to use in a patient-specific clinical setting.","Atrioventricular valve (AVV) disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in both the developing and developed world. Mitral valve (MVR) and tricuspid valve regurgitation (TVR) are thought to affect 5 million [1] and 1.6 million [2] people in the U.S., respectively. A healthy MV and TV will adequately control the flow of blood between the atria and ventricles on the left and right sides of the heart, respectively. Consequently, failure of these AVVs can result in inefficient blood circulation leading to end-organ dysfunction (e.g., liver, lung, kidney), or death. MVR is associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure and stroke and is the most prevalent form of AVV failure [3, 4]. The TV, while previously described as the “forgotten valve”, has increasingly been the subject of important investigations [5] as part of an effort to better treat TV dysfunction. AVV failure is similarly devastating to both children and adults with congenital heart disease, and in particular to single ventricle patients [6, 7]. Figure 1: Unloaded mitral valve with key anatomical features. The core anatomy of an AVV consists of leaflets, a ring-shaped annulus attaching the leaflets to the heart wall, and chordae tendineae (CDT) that anchor the leaflets to the papillary muscles (PM) in the ventricle wall (Fig. 1). Morphological changes or failure of any of these components can lead to an incompetent valve that allows blood to flow backward from the ventricle to the atrium during ventricular contraction, leading to atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR) [8, 9]. Based on etiology, the factors of AVVR have been categorized as either primary (e.g., direct) or secondary (e.g., indirect) in terms of its effects on the AVV [4, 3, 10]. Myxomatous valve degeneration is an example of primary AVVR that is characterized by elongated CDT and prolapsing leaflets stemming from decreased stiffness of both CDT and leaflet tissue [11, 12]. In contrast, ischemic cardiomyopathy is an example of secondary AVVR related to left ventricular dilation and remodeling [3, 13, 14]. In both primary and secondary AVVR cases, impaired CDT can contribute to valve dysfunction and failure given the essential role they play in normal AVV function [15, 16]. In primary AVVR, CDT rupture can result in leaflet prolapse. While in secondary cases, elevated chordal tension in the setting of ventricular dilation, or ischemia-related alterations to the ventricle, can lead to CDT restriction of leaflet motion and reduction in leaflet contact (coaptation). Congenitally abnormal CDT structures in children, such as those seen in parachute or arcade AVV [17, 18], play a deleterious role in valve function. Consequently, chordal tension and direction plays a significant part in the successful repair of complex congenital heart disease with valvular abnormalities such as complete atrioventricular canal and hypoplastic left heart syndrome [19, 15, 6, 20, 21, 22]. Given the essential role of CDT in valve function, significant effort has been made to develop therapies directed at replacing or altering chordal geometry to achieve improved AVV function. These interventions are dependent on CDT mechanics, especially as related to their physical classification. Specifically, CDT classified as “primary” are inserted within leaflet free edge and prevent leaflet prolapse during ventricular contraction. Secondary CDT, embedded in leaflet body, support the mechanical interaction between AVV and ventricle, with additional stability within the leaflet basal area provided by tertiary CDT [23, 24, 25, 26]. Thus, precise assessment of insertion location, and optimal chordal length, is necessary to understand valve function and to achieve desired therapeutic outcomes. This includes surgical interventions such as: neochordae reconstruction where artificial primary CDT are created to restore function to a prolapsing valve [16]; and PM relocation where CDT-to-leaflet insertion vectors are modified to improve valve function [27, 21, 22, 28, 29]). In this context, realistic representation and fidelity of CDT topology is also critical to emerging computational simulations of AVV function [30]. Notably, finite element (FE) and other multi-physics simulations of AVV function are uniquely positioned to investigate mechanisms of valve dysfunction. In addition, when combined with patient-specific three-dimensional (3D) images (e.g., 3D echocardiography, computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), these computational techniques have the potential to inform iterative preoperative optimization of valve repair “in silico” [30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. However, while advances in 3D imaging provide a reliable and non-invasive means of determining valve leaflet structure [35, 36, 37, 38, 15, 39], modern clinical imaging cannot yet reliably resolve CDT geometry at their individual chordal insertions with the accuracy and fidelity of “ground truth” geometries achieved from ex vivo and pathological specimens [30, 40]. As a result, significant effort has gone into creating image-informed [41, 42, 27, 43] or functionally equivalent [40] CDT topology for the computational simulation of valve function. Most relevant to the present work, Khalighi et al. [40] demonstrated that CDT geometries could be simplified to random insertions of CDT-like structures without branching. These functionally equivalent CDT topologies provided similar predictions as CDT geometries created from high-fidelity ex vivo images of ovine hearts. Although the simplified CDT geometries could predict valve behavior, they do not have realistic features (i.e., branching) necessary to model CDT-related pathology or interventions (e.g., chordal rupture or neochordae). As such, others have created FE models with various implementations of branching CDT geometries [34, 33, 44]. However, the sensitivity of FE simulations of valve function to variations in chordal branching patterns and distributions remains unknown. Furthermore, there is not an existing procedural method for the precise parametric and reproducible creation of specific chordal branching patterns, geometries and density. The objectives of this work are thus to (i) define how CDT geometry affects FE predictions of AVV closure and (ii) to compare FE simulation results of the more realistic branched CDT geometries to simpler non-branching CDT geometries previously used by ourselves [45, 32] and others [40]. In order to achieve this analysis we created a novel open-source module in SlicerHeart to procedurally generate chordal branching geometries [39]. We then employed this framework to quantify how variation of five CDT parameters influenced clinically relevant metrics of valve closure metrics in three realistic atrioventricular valve models."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09092v1,Pheromone-Guided Navigation of Potential Mates: A Distinct Exploration Strategy,"Animals, especially insects, navigate their environments using complex strategies that integrate responses to chemical signals such as pheromones. The relative importance an insect places on foraging, finding a mate or other tasks can significantly influence its movement patterns. This study uncovers the distinct exploration strategies that emerge when these priorities vary. A new model is introduced that explicitly treats a pair of insects and their response to each other’s pheromones. The strategy results in dynamics that exhibit characteristic anomalous scaling in displacement and non-Gaussian distributions of position; specifically, compressed exponential distributions for the number of encounters and the total duration of encounters. Our model not only elucidates these emergent behaviours but also provides insight into optimizing encounter frequencies. These strategies can be inverted to design pheromone-based traps for luring target species to specific areas for removal. The model is also applicable more broadly to pairs of agents that both respond to the paths traced by themselves and each other.","Animal exploration strategies often deviate from simple random movement [1, 2]. This complexity arises particularly in species relying on chemical signals (semiochemicals) such as pheromones for communication and navigation [3, 4]. Traditional random walk models have proven valuable for studying such processes, yet increasing evidence reveals the need for more sophisticated approaches to capture the nontrivial dynamics observed in nature [5]. Recent efforts have focused on deviations from classical diffusion processes, compelling the development of models that accommodate these complexities [6, 7]. One such complexity arises in systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion, where the mean squared displacement (MSD) scales nonlinearly with time—a phenomenon ubiquitous in physical, financial, artificial, and biological systems [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In biological contexts, this behaviour often stems from memory effects or interactions with evolving environments. Insects, for example, modify their environment by laying down pheromone trails, which subsequently influence not only their own movements but also those of others in their vicinity [16, 17, 18]. This phenomenon extends to living cells that alter their surroundings by depositing biochemical signals or mechanically remodelling the extracellular matrix [19, 20, 21], as well as large animals that mark their territories [22, 23]. These feedback loops, reminiscent of self-organizing systems, lead to emergent behaviours that deviate sharply from classical diffusion models. Non-Markovian random walks, in which movement decisions depend on the walker’s history, provide a framework for understanding these anomalous behaviours [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. One established approach for modelling such memory-driven dynamics is the true self-avoiding walk (TSAW), introduced by Amit, Parisi, and Peliti [24]. In the TSAW, movement (transition) probabilities, p, depend on the visitation history of each site: p\propto e^{-\beta h_{i}}, (1) where h_{i} represents the number of times site i has been visited, and \beta is a constant analogous to inverse temperature, controlling the strength of self-avoidance. The TSAW extends the concept of the self-avoiding walk (SAW) [34, 35] that is well-known for modelling the behaviour of flexible chain polymers. Despite its name, the SAW is more accurately described as a ‘self-terminating’ walk, where revisiting a site terminates the walk. In contrast, the TSAW employs a ‘softer’ self-avoidance, where the walker tries to avoid retracing its steps. Within the TSAW model, when self-interaction is repulsive (\beta>0), the time dependence of the MSD, R^{2}, as a function of time exhibits distinct scaling laws in different dimensions, d, at large times [24, 36, 37, 30, 33, 38]: R^{2}\sim\begin{cases}t^{4/3}\quad&d=1\\ t(\ln t)^{1/2}\quad&d=2\\ t\quad&d\geq 3.\end{cases} (2) In contrast, introducing an attractive self-interaction (\beta<0) dramatically restricts the walker’s movement. This leads to repetitive oscillations between two sites for any dimension d, resulting in a constant MSD at large times [30, 38]: R^{2}\to C, where C is a constant depending on d and \beta. Introducing a saturation limit for h_{i} (e.g., h_{i}=0 for unvisited site i, and h_{i}=1 if visited) transforms the self-attractive case, preventing walker trapping. This modified model, known as the self-attracting true random walk (SATW) or one-step reinforced random walk, [39, 30, 29, 40, 41, 42, 38], exhibits a diverging MSD at large times: R^{2}\sim\begin{cases}t\quad&d=1\\ t^{2/3}\quad&d=2\\ t\quad&d=3,|\beta|<|\beta_{c}|\\ t^{1/2}\quad&d=3,|\beta|>|\beta_{c}|\\ \end{cases} (3) Here, \beta_{c} marks a critical value in three dimensions, signifying the transition to a subdiffusive regime. Natural environments present intricate scenarios, particularly when multiple interacting individuals are involved [43, 44]. For example, the trade-off between food exploration and mate-seeking plays a significant role in shaping insect movement. Insects rely on multiple semiochemicals, such as trail and sex pheromones, to guide their movements and interactions, resulting in complex, correlated behaviour. Foraging insects avoid revisiting previously explored locations due to diminishing chances of finding food, while the presence of sex pheromones draws them toward areas marked by potential mates. This dynamic interaction between food foraging and mate-seeking leads to a collective mode of exploration, particularly in species that deposit different types of semiochemicals [4, 18]. When these behaviours are coupled, they give rise to novel collective dynamics characterized by emergent scaling relations that define new universality classes. As far as we are aware, the study of such active systems, where food-foraging and mate-seeking are intertwined, remains largely unexplored. This research represents an exciting frontier in understanding collective dynamics."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08512v1,"From noisy cell size control to population growth: 
when variability can be beneficial","Single-cell experiments revealed substantial variability in generation times, growth rates but also in birth and division sizes between genetically identical cells. Understanding how these fluctuations determine the fitness of the population, i.e. its growth rate, is necessary in any quantitative theory of evolution. Here, we develop a biologically-relevant model which accounts for the stochasticity in single-cell growth rates, birth sizes and division sizes. We derive expressions for the population growth rate and for the mean birth size in the population in terms of the single-cell fluctuations. Allowing division sizes to fluctuate reveals how the mechanism of cell size control (timer, sizer, adder) influences population growth. Surprisingly, we find that fluctuations in single-cell growth rates can be beneficial for population growth when slow-growing cells tend to divide at smaller sizes than fast-growing cells. Our framework is not limited to exponentially-growing cells like Escherichia coli, and we derive similar expressions for cells with linear and bi-linear growth laws, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, respectively.","In good conditions with an adequate supply of resources, the number N of cells in a population grows exponentially in the long time limit, N\sim e^{\lambda t}, where the population growth rate \lambda, or Malthus parameter, is a proxy for population fitness. It is well understood that this fitness depends on the environmental conditions, such as temperature and nutrients for instance [1, 2, 3]. However, recent single-cell experiments revealed a high degree of phenotypic variability between individual cells of isogenic populations, for example in generation times (time from cell birth to division) and single-cell growth rates, even in steady environments [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The dependence of the population growth rate on this inter-cellular variability is starting to be investigated [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] but is yet to be fully understood. In a seminal article, Powell showed that variability in generation times increases the population growth rate for age-regulated populations [16], a control mechanism today called timer [17]. However, the timer mechanism does not account for the observed mother-daughter correlations in generation times [12], and also does not lead to a steady size distribution for exponentially-growing cells [18, 19]. Steady-state size distributions are reached when cell size is controlled instead of cell age. Mechanisms of cell size control include the sizer strategy, where cells divide when reaching a critical size, and the adder strategy where cells divide after growing by a critical added size since birth [17]. Moreover, these mechanisms produce the expected negative mother-daughter correlations in generation times, since, intuitively, a cell with a large generation time tends to divide big and thus to give birth to a big daughter cell, which in turn takes a short time to reach its target division size [7, 12]. Experiments showed that many organisms indeed follow these phenomenological size control strategies [17], with an ubiquity of near-adder mechanisms in bacteria such as Escherichia coli [6, 7, 8], Caulobacter crescentus [6], Bacillus subtilis [7]; budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [20]; Mycobacterium smegmatis [21]; archaeal cell Halobacterium salinarum [22] and in a variety of mammalian cells [23], while a near-sizer strategy characterizes the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe [24]. Recent re-examination of the impact of single-cell variability on population growth, for size-regulated populations of exponentially-growing cells, showed that population fitness is primarily set by the statistics of single-cell growth rates rather than generation times [10, 12]. Indeed, in the absence of fluctuations in single-cell growth rates, the population grows at the same rate as its individual cells independently of the presence of other sources of noise. This is a consequence of cell size control and can be understood intuitively as follows. Cell size grows as s(t)=s_{b}e^{\alpha t} with s_{b} the size at birth and \alpha the single-cell growth rate, therefore the total population volume V(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{N(t)}s_{i}(t) grows as V(t)=V_{0}e^{\alpha t} when \dot{s}_{i}=\alpha s_{i} with the same \alpha for all cells i. Since cell size is regulated, the average cell size in a population snapshot, V/N\sim e^{(\alpha-\lambda)t}, must converge, which implies \lambda=\alpha. On the other hand, population fitness is lowered by uncorrelated fluctuations in single-cell growth rates, because slow-growing cells have larger than average generation times and are thus more likely to appear in population snapshots, thus biasing the instantaneous growth rate of the total population volume towards low values [10, 12]. In these works, only the fluctuations in the single-cell growth rates have been investigated, and the mechanism of cell size control was considered infinitely precise such that all cells are born with size s_{b}=1 and divide with size s_{d}=2. Single-cell data nonetheless indicate that cell size control is a noisy process, where cells born with the same size can divide at different sizes, and where the two cells born from a division can be born with different birth sizes [5, 6, 7, 8, 22, 21]. The roles of cell size control and of noises in cell size for population growth thus remain to be studied. In this article, we propose an approach to investigate how population growth depends on fluctuations at the single-cell level, namely in growth rates, in cell size control and in size partitioning upon division. We start by computing the corrections to the population growth rate coming from noise in cell size control and in size partitioning for exponentially-growing cells, thus generalizing the result from [10, 12]. Those corrections are of second order, as they are conditioned on the presence of noise in single-cell growth rates, and depend explicitly on the mechanism of cell size control. Our approach is not limited to exponentially-growing cells, and we derive similar expressions for other biologically-relevant growth laws such as linear growth, recently observed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis [25] and the bi-linear growth pattern of fission yeast S. Pombe [26]. In these cases, corrections due to noise in cell size control and in size partitioning are of first order and independent of the presence of noise in single-cell growth rates. Finally, our analysis of data from [7] for E. coli in different conditions indicates that the mechanism of cell size control itself depends on the single-cell growth rate for exponentially-growing cells. In this case, we show that, unlike what was observed in [10, 12], uncorrelated fluctuations in single-cell growth rates can be beneficial for population growth."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08012v1,Non-equilibrium phase transitions in hybrid Voronoi models of cell colonies,"Eukaryotic cells are characterized by a stiff nucleus whose effect in modeling the collective behavior of cell aggregates is usually underestimated. However, increasing experimental evidence links nuclear modifications with phenotypic transition, like the one between epithelial and mesenchymal states. In this work, we explore the effect of short-range repulsive forces in the non-equilibrium dynamics of the self-propelled Voronoi model. We show that the competition between steric repulsions (representing nuclear/cellular compressibility) and Vertex interactions (mimicking cell-cell adhesion/interaction and cytoskeleton organization) generate a variety of non-equilibrium phase transitions from Motility-Induced Phase Separation to mesenchymal-like phases up to disordered confluent configurations. Notably, we found that tuning the nucleus’s effective size/compressibility provides an additional way to cross the boundary between the different possible phases in line with experimental observations.","Biological tissues are collections of cells at high packing fractions. Each cell is a complex non-equilibrium machine; on top of that, cells are also deformable objects whose shape can fluctuate because of the interaction with the surrounding environment. Various models incorporate some of those minimal ingredients for capturing the collective behavior of cells in confluent monolayers alert2020physical ; trepat2018mesoscale ; camley2017physical ; barton2017active . Depending on the biological situation of interest, different coarse-graining descriptions of cells might be very effective.

This is important for understanding biological processes during morphogenesis Miotto2023 or cancer invasion sunyer2016collective ; Friedl17 ; Miotto2021 . In its complexity, a single cell is characterized by different structures that are hierarchically arranged: in the spirit of coarse-graining only the leading degrees of freedom are necessary for describing cell collectives, most of the attempts in modeling the single cell neglect such a complexity. For instance, within phase fields and Voronoi-like models, cell shape fluctuations can be included as a leading ingredient necessary for modeling the cell aggregate more realistically. Such fluctuations have been found to act as a driving force for jamming/unjamming transition Park15 ; Arora2024 . In particular, elongated cells characterized by a high shape factor, i.e., the ratio between the typical cell perimeter divided by the square root of the cell area, tend to aggregate into a liquid phase where cells continuously rearrange bi2015density . Highly symmetric cells, characterized by a smaller shape factor, undergo a rigidity transition similar to the jamming phase or, in some cases, a glass-like transition Bi2016 ; Sadhukhan2024 . Many experimental studies provide evidence for the importance of non-equilibrium glass-like or jamming-like transition in confluent monolayers Park15 ; Malinverno17 ; kang2021novel ; Arora2024 . Indeed, development, wound repair, and cancer metastasis are fundamental biological processes in which epithelial cells, typically non-migratory, can become highly mobile and rearrange over time and length scales much larger than the typical time and length scales of the single cell. From a biological point of view, the transition from a sedentary to a migratory state in epithelial layers was thought to rely on EMT or partial EMT (pEMT) in many contexts. During EMT/pEMT, cells lose their apicobasal polarity and epithelial markers, while acquiring front-to-back polarity and mesenchymal markers, allowing them to detach from neighboring cells and the surrounding matrix, adopting a migratory behavior. The unjamming transition has been identified as a distinct migratory mechanism where collective epithelial migration may take place without EMT Mitchel2020 . While cells can change their shape, allowing for adapting to growth in different conditions and moving across barriers Saito2024 , the presence of a stiff nucleus poses limits to their degree of deformability. In this framework, arises the question of what the effect of such stiff nucleus on cell collective behavior is (see for instance the reviews CaleroCuenca2018 ; Boutillon2024 ). Registering migration speed and cell/nucleus shapes, Wolf et al. Wolf2013 , identified deformability of the nucleus as one of the first-order rate-limiting physicochemical determinants of cell migration. Grosser et al. Grosser2021 compared spheroids of cancerous and noncancerous cell lines via bulk experiments and/or single live-cell tracking, finding that cancerous cells populations are fluidized by active cells moving through the tissue with the degree of tissue fluidity correlating with elongated cell and nucleus shapes. They speculate that individual cell and nucleus shape may serve as a marker for metastatic potential. Despite increasing evidence of the mechanical importance of the cell nucleus, models explicitly accounting for its effect are still rare Chojowski2024 . What is the effect of combining a stiff nucleus with a deformable shape in collective cell behaviors remains an open question. Here, we introduce a hybrid Voronoi model that takes into account short-range excluded volume forces mimicking the presence of the stiff cell nucleus. Our hybrid Voronoi model allows us to describe cells in both mesenchymal and epithelial phases. Indeed, by varying the relative strength between Vertex and excluded volume forces we interpolate from a pure particle-based model to a confluent model. Note that our approach counts a few control parameters for controlling different ingredients as typical shape elongation, cell motility, and nuclei stiffness. In contrast, other approaches require the fine-tuning of many parameters and is quite expensive from the numerical point of view alert2020physical . In the following, after introducing the model, we show that the system undergoes several non-equilibrium phase transitions from the so-called Motility-Induced Phase Separation (MIPS) Tailleur08 , to standard active liquid, to Voronoi (confluent) liquid, and disordered solid by tuning the strength of the Vertex interaction. Next, we change the packing fraction of the system showing that this brings a reach phase diagram where cells can arrange in Gas-like or Phase-separates without attractive forces at low packing fraction (as in the case of Mesenchymal cells). By increasing the strength of Voronoi the system becomes confluent. However, the structural property of the monolayer changes dramatically with the pacing fraction.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07141v1,"Cell bulging and extrusion
in a three-dimensional bubbly vertex model
for curved epithelial sheets","Cell extrusion is an essential mechanism for controlling cell density in epithelial tissues. Another essential element of epithelia is curvature, which is required to achieve complex shapes, like in the lung or intestine. Here we introduce a three-dimensional bubbly vertex model to study the interplay between extrusion and curvature. We find a generic cellular bulging instability at topological defects which is much stronger than for standard vertex models. To clarify the underlying mechanism, we analytically calculate the energy landscape for a single bulging cell in a mean field tissue. We find that extrusion is energetically preferred at topological defects due to a redistribution of Gaussian curvature into the defect. We show that it can be driven both by a decrease in apico-basal tension or by contractile line tensions. We also show that extrusion can be suppressed by luminal pressure and interfacial bending rigidity, allowing for additional control of this important process. Our theory suggests that epithelial curvature naturally leads to cell bulging and extrusion because the interfacial curvature of individual cells at the defects strongly amplifies buckling effected by tissue-scale topological defects in elastic sheets.","Epithelial tissues are close-packed and sealed cell layers that form the barriers between different compartments in the body, for example in the lung or the intestine. In order to regulate their cell density, they have to achieve a balance between cell division and cell death. Recently it has become clear that both processes are strongly connected to mechanics: cells divide more if they are stretched by neighboring cells at low cell density, and they stop dividing and die if the epithelium becomes too crowded [1, 2, 3]. In order to make sure that dying cells leave the tissue without disrupting its barrier function, they are expelled by extrusion, which means they are squeezed out of the epithelium without the generation of any voids [4, 5]. Extrusion is especially prominent in the intestine, where the epithelium renews itself every 3-5 days [6]. Here cells proliferate in the crypt regions and then move in a constant stream to the tip of villi, where they are extruded [7]. The exact mechanisms of extrusion are not clear, but one important element seems to be the presence of specialized actin structures on the lateral and basal sides [3]. For flat model epithelia, it has been shown that cell extrusion occurs preferentially at topological defects in the nematic orientation field of the cells [8, 9, 10]. In general, cells in non-stratified epithelia tend to have hexagonal order, because this is the close-packed optimum in two dimensions, similar to the situation in sphere packings and foams. Hexagonal order is also dominant in curved epithelial sheets [11, 12, 13, 14]. However, now some pentagonal defects are required to generate curvature [12]. Due to Euler’s polyhedron theorem, 12 pentagonal defects are required to achieve the topology of a sphere, with the possibility of additional pentagonal-heptagonal pairs. Thus topological defects occur naturally in curved epithelia, while in flat cell layers, they arise rather a in stochastic manner from the movement of cells. Because epithelia are often curved due to their biological function, for example in the crypts and villi of the intestine, the question arises if they might use the naturally occurring topological defects to promote cell extrusion. While previous theoretical models have addressed such extrusion in a flat configuration focusing on fluid-like epithelia [15] or neglecting the three-dimensional nature of the problem [16], the coupling of curvature, defects, and shape instabilities has hardly been addressed before. Defects in such a setting have been linked to extrusion in flat epithelia on a substrate in phase field models of tissues [15] and to shape instabilities in vertex models [17], but the underlying mechanisms and their relation to curvature have not been addressed yet. Recently, we have reported on a morphological instability at topological disclination defects in curved hexagonal epithelia in the three-dimensional vertex model (VM) [18]. This buckling instability arises because spherical epithelia are effectively elastic shells, similar to viral capsids [19, 20] or buckyballs [21], for which such an instability is known since the pioneering work by Seung and Nelson [22]. However, the standard VM does not consider that cells might adapt their own interfacial curvature to their mechanical environment, which must be the first step toward bulging and extrusion. Here we investigate this aspect by using the bubbly vertex model (BVM). In contrast to the normal VM, which describes multicellular systems with flat interfaces, in the BVM the interfaces are curved [23, 24, 25]. Such interfacial curvature leverages the three-dimensional nature of the cellular system and allows for different mechanisms than the usual VM-approach to epithelia. Here we show that the BVM for curved epithelial sheets naturally explains why and how cells can extrude preferentially at topological defects. We start in Section II by showing with computer simulations that the curved interfaces in the BVM strongly amplify the buckling at defects in curved sheets if compared to the standard VM with flat interfaces. To understand the underlying instability theoretically, we consider the representative case of a shell with icosahedral symmetry in which interfacial curvature leads to a significant lowering of a previously described icosahedral buckling threshold [18, 19, 22]. In Section III we develop a continuum description of a defect cell in a mean field tissue, which allows us to analytically understand the underlying instability. We find that the possibility of curved interfaces results in a local decrease of the saddle splay modulus, thus leading to localization of Gaussian curvature in the defect. This analytical model captures the numerical shapes of icosahedral vertex model shells. Generalizing it in Section IV to shells without such strong symmetry properties, allows us to generally formulate a model for cell extrusion at pentagonal and hexagonal cells in a curved epithelial sheet. We find that both lowering the apico-basal surface tension and a supracellular actin ring may initiate bulging, while only the former allows for a transition of a partially extruded geometry toward full extrusion. Our model predicts a lower energy barrier for extrusion at topological (pentagonal) defects. Further, we show that this tendency can be reduced by increasing luminal pressure or rigidifying cellular interfaces. We close in Section V with a discussion of our results, including the relation to experimental observations."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07110v1,Hierarchical genotype networks and incipient ecological speciation in Q\beta phage quasispecies,"Understanding how viral mutant spectra organize and explore genotype space is essential for unraveling the mechanisms driving evolution at the finest scale. Here we use deep-sequencing data of an amplicon in the A2 protein of the RNA bacteriophage Q\beta to reconstruct genotype networks with tens of thousands of different haplotypes. The study of populations evolved under different temperature regimes uncovers generic topological features conditioned by fundamental structural motifs of genotype networks—tetrahedrons, triangles, and squares—that govern their local architecture. Mutant swarms display a hierarchical structure where sequences cluster around a highly connected and abundant sequence core that sustains population diversity. The immediate neighborhood of this core is comprehensively sampled, with no signs of selection, while a few mutations away sampling becomes dynamical and sparse, showing signs of purifying selection. By aggregating genotype networks from populations adapted to different temperatures, we capture the early stages of evolutionary divergence, with overlapping populations that remain connected through short mutational paths. Even at the time scale of these experiments, evolutionary pathways might be multiple, preventing the backward reconstruction of unique trajectories once mutations have been fixed. This analysis provides a detailed view of the local, fine-scale processes shaping viral quasispecies evolution and underscores the usefulness of genotype networks as an enlightening visualization of the organization of mutant swarms.","Results Empirical data and genotype network reconstruction Figure 1 depicts a summary of the experiments and protocols carried out to reconstruct genotype networks for evolved populations of the Q\beta phage. This phage has a short RNA genome (4217 nt) that encodes four proteins, Figure 1A. It infects the bacterium Escherichia coli using as receptor the conjugative F pilus. Its optimal replication temperature is 37∘C, although it can easily adapt to replicate at 30∘C and 43∘C [42, 36, 43, 44]. For this study, the phage was evolved at three different (30∘C, 37∘C, 43∘C), yet constant each, temperatures starting with a common ancestral population (see Materials and Methods and Fig. 1B). The evolution temperatures were chosen according to the lab’s previous experience [42, 36, 43, 44] and taking into account that two of them impose strong selective pressures on the virus. At 30∘C, all host metabolic processes are slowed down and, at 43∘C, the heat shock response is fully activated in E. coli. The fragment from 1060 to 1331 was deep-sequenced in populations at passage 60. Nucleotides from positions 1060 to 1320 code for a fragment of the A2 maturation-lysis protein, 1321 to 1323 correspond to a termination codon and 1324 to 1331 are non-coding positions. The curation of the raw data consisted of removing low-quality sequences not aligned to the reference genome and sequences with insertion and deletion events. This process resulted in high-quality sequences of equal length that were later collapsed into unique sequences while keeping a record of their abundance (see Materials and Methods and Figure 1C, D). Figure 1: Schematic of evolution experiments, data processing and network reconstruction. A. The Q\beta phage has a linear, single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity with a length of 4217 nucleotides. It is composed of four proteins: a maturation-lysis protein (A2), a capsid protein (CP), a read-through protein (A1), and an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (Replicase). A computational model of the icosahedral capsid is shown. B. Three replicates of an ancestral population pre-adapted to 37∘C for two passages, P^{0}_{37} have been propagated for 60 passages at three different temperatures (see details in Materials and Methods). C. A lineage of the three replicas evolved in each condition was deep sequenced. A fragment with a length of 271 nt belonging to the A2 protein and a small non-coding region was selected. D. Sequencing yielded single-genome fragments (raw data) that were curated through a devoted pipeline, eventually returning populations with about 2-3\times 10^{5} high-quality, equal length, aligned reads. We observed differences in the consensus sequence of each evolved population. Each set was scanned for repeated sequences through an abundance count algorithm. E. Individual and aggregated genotype networks were reconstructed. Each sequence corresponds to a node of the network, with size proportional to the logarithm of the abundance of the sequence; two nodes are connected through a link if they differ in a single point mutation. After data curation, we were left with three sets of unique sequences (one for each experimental condition) and their abundances. In the remaining of this paper we only refer to these selected subsets, subsequently used to reconstruct one genotype network for each condition. The three networks for each evolved population are noted G(T), with T=30,37,43 labeling the temperature. The aggregated network is noted G\equiv\cup_{T}G(T). Each node in a genotype network corresponds to a specific sequence in the final sets; two nodes are connected if they differ in a single nucleotide, Figure 1E. Table 1 summarizes the size of each of the final sets, showing the total number s(T) of sequences in the curated sets, the number N(T) of different sequences at each temperature and the total number of links N^{L}(T). These networks are the largest connected component of the set of sequences in the curated sets. A small fraction of genotypes (below 0,3% in all cases) not connected through observed genotypes to the connected component are not included in the analysis. Finally, in our representation of genotype networks we depict each node with a size proportional to the logarithm of the abundance \ln s_{i} of that sequence i (i.e., the number of times that the corresponding sequence was found in our curated datasets, \sum_{i}s(i)=s(T) for sequences in each of the experiments). As it will be shown, node size directly affects the structure of reconstructed networks. For later convenience, we define the root sequence as the most abundant sequence in each population.

The ensemble of sequences at distance d=1 (d2) and d=2 (d3) form simple motifs that, within each level, are disconnected. For genotype networks to be connected, mutants at various distances from the root need to be included. (e-h) Genotype network motifs are exhaustively explored near the root in Q\beta populations; averages at each distance are performed over the ensemble represented in (d1) and over the two remaning populations: blue lines correspond to T=30^{\circ}C, green to T=37^{\circ}C and red to T=43^{\circ}C. (e) Number of unique sequences identified at distance d from the root. (f) Fraction of sequence space explored as a function of distance. (g) Total abundance of sequences sampled at each distance from the root. (h) Ratio of non-silent versus silent mutation fraction at each distance. Violin plots represent the density of dN/dS values at each distance in G(43). Violin plots for G(30) and G(37) are similar, but here omitted for clarity (see Appendix D). Basic building blocks (structural motifs) of genotype networks can be derived from the mathematical properties of sequence spaces. Take the root sequence as reference and focus on one of its nucleotides. All possible mutations on that site, while holding the rest of the sequence unchanged, results in A-1 mutant sequences at distance d=1 from the root, where A is the size of the alphabet (A=4 for RNA or DNA sequences). These mutants are connected to the root and are also at distance d=1 from each other, thus also mutually connected. This generates a clique or simplex of A=4 elements, with the topology of a tetrahedron (Fig. 2a). The same reasoning is valid about any other nucleotide in the root, thus we have a tetrahedron associated to each site along the sequence. All those tetrahedrons share a node, the root, so that the genotype network at distance 1 looks like a necklace of strung-together 4-cliques (Fig. 2b): for simplicity, only the mutated nucleotide is shown in the illustration, but each of those mutations is found in a full sequence that shares the composition at all other sites with the root sequence. The tetrahedron simplex is the main motif of genotype graphs. Larger-scale network structures are built by combining tetrahedrons (or parts thereof) around each new sequence. The root acts as a backbone holding together the tetrahedron necklace. If the root is removed, each 4-element simplex is reduced to a 3-node clique, forming a second elementary motif: the triangle. These triangles contain all the sequences at distance d=1 (of which there are 3L different ones). In the absence of the root, they are disconnected from each other, revealing that the set of mutants at distance d=1 is massively fragmented. The same is true about the set with all sequences at distance d=2. The triangle motif somehow acts as a generator of diversity at fixed distances from the root (see Appendix A). Genotype networks become connected through links between sequences at two different distances from the root. If we focus on mutations in two nucleotide positions, while holding the rest unchanged, we obtain pathways that diverge from the root and meet at the vertex of another set of strung-together tetrahedrons (Fig. 2c). These pathways conform a square, the third relevant motif. Squares involve two changes in distance from the reference sequence, but they result in the integration of the fragmented subsets: While triangle motifs generate all sequence diversity at fixed distances, the resulting subspaces are fragmented; square motifs link them and make them mutually accessible. Q\beta quasispecies perform exhaustive local searches in sequence space There are 4^{271}\sim 10^{163} different sequences of length L=271. The total number of virus particles on Earth is estimated at 10^{31} [45], while natural quasiespecies rarely exceed 10^{12} viral genomes within a host. Therefore, natural populations may only sample a tiny fraction of the total sequence space; an even smaller amount (of order 10^{6} sequences) is available to study through deep sequencing methods. Since viral genomes in a natural quasispecies are connected through replication and mutation processes, they typically cluster in sequence space. Our dataset reveals, for each final population, a highly abundant, different sequence (coinciding in the three experiments with the consensus sequence of each population): one or more mutations have been fixed along adaptation to different temperatures. Tetrahedrons, triangles, and squares constitute an abstract scaffolding that underlies every network built from DNA or RNA sequences. This does not imply that all motifs have to appear in empirical networks, as these might be undersampled. As triangles and squares are composed along increasing distances from the root sequence, the connected network of related mutants builds up. Though its basic topology results from the fundamental building blocks described in the previous section, a non-trivial, hierarchical structure emerges as the quasispecies explores nearby mutants (Fig. 2d1 and Figure S1). Figure 2d shows how fragmented groups of genotypes at each distance from the root (Fig. 2d2-3) are held together by paths linking sequences across different levels in the hierarchy. For sequences of length L and an alphabet of A letters the number S(d) of different sequences at a distance d from the root follows \displaystyle S(d) \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{(A-1)^{d}L!}{(L-d)!\>d!}\,, (1) with an asymptotic behavior S(d)\sim L^{d} for sufficiently large distances, but far from the length considered, L\gg d\gg 1. A comparison with our empirical data allows to estimate the genotype space covering of the populations. Close to the root, coverage is almost complete, and decreases as distance increases: we have found around 95\% of all mutants at distance d=1 in either population. At d=2, S(2)=329\>265 for L=271. Of these, 5\>013 (1.5%), 4\>677 (1.4\%), and 4\>394 (1.3\%) are found in our experiments at 30, 37, and 43^{\circ}C respectively. Though empirical sequence diversity peaks at distances d=2 or d=3 from the root (Fig. 2e), the fraction of sequence space explored decays monotonically, and near to exponentially fast with d (Fig. 2f). The decay in total sequence abundance with distance (Fig. 2g) suggests that mutation plays a role analogous to diffusion in this high-dimensional space. The population is anchored around the root, which could be interpreted as a sequence of high replicative ability (or high fitness, in this context): its copies abundantly cover the neighborhood at distance d=1 and, through a cascade-like process, also cover fractions of mutants at higher distances, with a substantial decrease in abundance as the number of mutations increases. Since the number of different sequences grows exponentially fast as d increases, the abundance per node decreases rapidly, and the exhaustive exploration of mutant sequences results severely suppressed a few mutants away from the root: low abundance should correlate with low degree. Figures S4-S6 (Appendix E) represent full networks of G(T) centered at the root and with nodes occupying concentric circles at each distance, thus highlighting their hierarchical structure and qualitatively illustrating the description above. This hierarchical structure is robust and independent of the temperature at which each population has evolved. In particular, there are no obvious signatures of an underlying fitness landscape affecting network structure or preference for certain sequences. In order to quantify the strength and mode of selection in the quasispecies, we have measured the fraction of non-synonymous versus synonymous mutations q(i|d)=dN(i|d)/dS(i|d) in the coding fragment of every sequence, in all three populations. With this notation, we explicitly indicate the distance d at which sequence i is found. First, the set of possible non-synonymous N(i|d) and synonymous S(i|d) mutations for each sequence i has been found. Next, we have counted how many non-synonymous \tilde{N}(i|d) and synonymous \tilde{S}(i|d) mutations are observed in the set of nearest neighbors of sequence i in each sampled population, to obtain q(i|d)=\frac{dN(i|d)}{dS(i|d)}=\frac{\tilde{N}(i|d)/N(i|d)}{\tilde{S}(i|d)/S(i% |d)}\,. (2) Figure 3h summarizes the obtained results by showing the average ratio \bar{q}_{d}=\sum_{i|d}q(i|d) at each distance d to the root for the three populations, and the density of q(i|d) values in G(43). For the root sequence, with d=0, \bar{q}_{0}\simeq 1, so its nearest neighbors cover almost all possible mutations, regardless their selective value. No dispersion is shown for d=0, since only the root sequence is included. At d=1, we observe that an average value q_{1}\lesssim 1 accompanies the massive coverage of neighboring sequences, as shown by the high dispersion of the distribution of q(i|1) values. In Appendix D, violin plots are shown in full, as well as the the distributions corresponding to populations at 30 and 37^{\circ}C, Figure S3. As d increases, the average value \bar{q}_{d} decreases towards 0, with an accompanying diminishing dispersion in q(i|d) values, which progressively cluster around 0. These results highlight once more the deep correlation between high sequence abundance and exploration of nearby mutants. We interpret that the fitness landscape shows up through purifying selection only at low sequence abundance, limiting in turn the number of deleterious mutants sampled. Altogether, the exploration of variants is restricted to the nearest neighborhood of highly abundant sequences due to the dilution caused by random mutation in the high-dimensional spaces where quasispecies evolve. Topological properties are conditioned by the hierarchical structure of Q\beta genotype networks Figure 3: Macroscopic structure of quasispecies’s genotype networks. (a) Degree frequency of genotype networks at 30^{\circ}C (blue triangles), 37^{\circ}C (green crosses), and 43^{\circ}C (red squares). A dashed vertical line marks maximum degree k_{M}=3L (also in panels b and e). (b) Scatter plot of sequence abundance versus degree. (c,d) Number of triangles \triangle_{i} as a function of the degree k of the sequence in linear (c) and logarithmic (d) axes. The polygon enclosed by thin continuous lines is defined by maximum \triangle_{M} and minimum \triangle_{m} values of \triangle_{i}; the thick continuous line is the expected value \triangle_{\rm rnd} for a random distribution of links, with standard deviation shown as shadings (\sigma_{\triangle}, dark grey, and 2\sigma_{\triangle}, light grey). (e) Network assortativity: average neighbor degree k_{nn}(i) of a sequence’s neighbors as a function of sequence degree k_{i}. The left-most part of this plot corresponds to undersampled, peripheral nodes with very low degree, while the right-most part of the plot is dominated by nodes with degree close to saturation, k_{i}\simeq 3L. Only the central part of the plot is statistically representative. The three genotype networks reconstructed from each of our experiments display quantitatively identical topological features, despite the different evolutionary history of each population and variations among consensus sequences. Their structural similarity is revealed through an analysis from a complex networks viewpoint [46]. In this section, we present and discuss three main topological quantities: the degree distribution, the abundance of triangles (related to the clustering coefficient) and the assortativity of reconstructed genotype networks. Degree. The degree k_{i} of a node i is defined as the number of links a node has. In our case, it corresponds to the number of sequences in the 1-mutant neighborhood present in the population sample. A histogram of the abundance of nodes with each degree yields a clear signature of a hierarchical organization in the reconstructed networks. Figure 3a shows that all degree-frequency histograms H(k) are well fit by a power-law function of the form H(k)\propto k^{-\alpha} in the interval 2\leq k\leq 2L (see also Table 1). Nodes with degree k=1 are typically undersampled because of their low abundance, while we find an over abundance of nodes with degree close to the maximum possible, k_{M}=3L. In these populations, the abundance of a sequence in the sample and the number of neighbors it has (its degree) are positively correlated (Figure 3b): more abundant sequences typically produce more progeny and, under unfaithful replication, populate its immediate neighborhood with higher frequency. The hierarchical structure of these networks also implies that highly abundant sequences (the root and the set of its nearest neighbors, plus some isolated variants at higher distances) have degree higher than average, while the majority of peripheral sequences (d\geq 4) are rare and have typically below-average degrees. Actually, the average degree is similar in all three networks, but this value is not representative of a typical node. This is the rule for quantities with power-law-like probability distributions, where the fat tail has a large impact on the average, thus affected by a large standard deviation (see Table 1). Triangles and clustering. The local clustering coefficient is a broadly-used measure of the degree of connectivity among neighboring nodes. It is defined as the ratio between the number of triangles formed between a given node and its nearest neighbors and the total number of possible triangles, typically assuming that all nearest neighbors can be mutually connected. But this is not the case in sequence spaces, where a large fraction of triangles cannot be formed, as described above (see Fig. 2b). A more informative quantity of clustering is the absolute number of triangles \triangle_{i} in the 1-mutant neighborhood of a sequence i (i.e. the numerator in the definition of local clustering coefficient above). Figures 3c and d display \triangle_{i} as a function of the degree k_{i} of each sequence. The hierarchical structure of quasispecies networks and the nature of the compounding basic motifs have direct consequences in the number of triangles that can be formed. Consider a specific nucleotide in a given sequence, which can contribute at most a basic tetrahedron motif if the three possible mutations at that site are found in the sample (Fig. 2a). If none or only one of the sequences with a mutation at this site are present, this site contributes no triangles to the reference sequence; if two of the mutated sequences are found, then one triangle is formed, and if all three mutations are present, three triangles are formed (the complete tetrahedron). The maximum \triangle_{M} and minimum \triangle_{m} number of triangles, defined as the sum of triangles contributed by all sites in a sequence of degree k, define a polygon represented in Fig. 3c, d. If mutations are randomly distributed along a sequence, the expected number of triangles is \triangle_{\rm rnd}=k^{2}/(3L) (thick solid line). The derivation of these functions, as well as the standard deviation \sigma_{\triangle} with respect to the random case is included in Appendix C. Figures 3c and 3d show how measured values of \triangle_{i} compare to \triangle_{M}, \triangle_{\rm rnd} and \triangle_{m}. For degrees k\gtrsim L, the empirical value agrees with the random expectation, \triangle_{i}(k\geq L)\in\{\triangle_{\rm rnd}-\sigma_{\triangle},\triangle_{% \rm rnd}+\sigma_{\triangle}\}; one standard deviation corresponds to the dark-grey shadow in Fig. 3c, and two standard deviations to the light-grey shadow. However, the number of triangles significantly deviates from random expectations at lower values of the degree, especially for k\lesssim 60, with an asymmetric trend to show many more triangles than expected. Note that cases close to \triangle_{M} or even at this value (there are instances for k=3 and k=6) entail that mutations preferentially cluster in a few sites of the sequence, while most other sites do not accept any mutation. These deviations from random expectations show a strong preference to mutate in silent positions, avoiding changes in sites that may affect fitness. This is consistent with measures of the \frac{dN}{dS} ratio: purifying selection becomes more prominent in low-abundance, low-degree sequences. Assortativity. Assortativity quantifies how similar two nodes are with respect to a certain property, in this case node degree. The average neighbor degree, k_{nn}(i)={\frac{1}{k_{i}}}\sum_{j=1}^{k_{i}}k_{j} measures the average degree of the nearest neighbors of node i. Figure 3e represents k_{nn}(i) as a function of k for the three networks studied, showing an inverse dependence between both quantities in the representative region of k values; k_{nn}(i)\propto k^{-\beta}, with \beta>0 is a decreasing function of k. An additional measure is the assortativity coefficient -1\leq r\leq 1 (Tab. 1) (aka the Pearson correlation coefficient of degree between pairs of linked nodes), which measures the correlation between nodes of different degree [47]. Both quantities show that Q\beta genotype networks are highly disassortative (see Table 1), as the neighbors of sequences with high degree preferentially connect to low-degree mutants, while a Pearson coefficient r\simeq-1 corresponds to networks that are near complete disassortativity. The aggregated genotype network uncovers incipient speciation Figure 4: Visualizing all three genotype networks together. The color of nodes is weighted proportionally to the sum of the logarithm of the abundances in each network, see Appendix B for details. Pure blue, green or red color correspond to nodes only found in G(30), G(37) or G(43), respectively. Nodes with mixed colors are found in two or more populations. Yellow circles signal the wild-type ancestral sequence, as labeled, and white circles highlight the root sequence of each adapting quasispecies, with labels R30, R37 and R43. a. Spring layout representation of all sequences in the aggregated network G. b. All sequences in a triangle representation. Each experimental condition is mapped in a different vertex. Sequences exclusive of a given environment are collapsed in the corresponding vertex; sequences along edges are found in the two environmental conditions linked by this edge; sequences in the interior of the triangle have been found in all three environments. c. Spring layout representation of top 100 most abundant nodes. d. Top 100 most abundant nodes in triangle representation. Each individual genotype network corresponds to a quasispecies adapting to a specific experimental condition. Though the three networks are indistinguishable regarding their topological properties, they are centered at different positions in sequence space, since they have fixed at least one mutation in their root sequence with respect to the wild type (see Table 1), and roots are two or three mutations away from each other. These networks are all part of a larger network, and jointly cover a larger fraction of the genotype space available to Q\beta quasispecies. By examining the aggregated set of sequences in all three experiments, we get a hint of how this larger space is connected and explored by viral populations in response to environmental changes. In Figure 4 two different representations of the complete network G, Fig. 4a, b, and a subset of its most abundant nodes Fig. 4c, d, illustrate its overall architecture. In all four plots, the wild type sequence and the root sequences of G(30), G(37) and G(43) (labeled R30, R37 and R43, respectively), are highlighted. Fig. 4a shows all viral variants within the aggregated network G. This representation has been generated in spring layout, a widely used algorithm that treats every link as a spring and determines the position of each node in the image as that which minimizes tension among nodes. In this way, groups of more strongly connected nodes are typically placed closer to each other (and around the center of the illustration), and less connected nodes occupy the periphery. To aid in the visualization of G(T) and to account for specific features of the network (as a sum of sequences in three independent experiments), we have devised an alternative representation in Fig. 4b. Here, nodes have been arranged over an equilateral triangle. Each experimental condition (30^{\circ}C, 37^{\circ}C, and 43^{\circ}C) is associated to a corner and a color (bottom left and blue, bottom right and green, top and red; respectively). Each node’s position is a weighted average according to each sequence’s abundance under each temperature. Nodes are also colored similarly to their positions, by weighting blue, green, and red (see Appendix B). Only color has been projected into Fig. 4a, while color and position carry the same information in Fig. 4b. In both panels, each node’s size is proportional to the logarithm of the corresponding sequence’s abundance summed across all three genotype networks. To further clarify the organization of the aggregated network, Figs. 4c and d show a subset of G containing only the 100 most abundant sequences at each experimental condition, all other specifications being the same. Sequences found only at a given temperature appear therefore collapsed at the vertices in Fig. 4b and d, while in Fig. 4 c they unfold as a fan of nodes connected to the root at each temperature. Note that if each viral population would contain sequences only adapted to the specific environment where it has evolved along the 60 passages, triangles in Fig. 4b and d would be populated only at the three vertices, and empty elsewhere. Sequences present in samples at two temperatures are found along the edges of the triangle. The least-populated area in the triangle lies near the edge between the 30^{\circ}C and 43^{\circ}C corners with a set of sequences populating the edge that apparently work well at both extremes, but not at 37^{\circ}C. Sequences strictly inside the triangle, which is well populated, show up in all three experimental conditions. Thus, at each temperature, the quasispecies sustains a large variability of genotypes also potentially adapted to other conditions. These versatile sequences appear in notable abundance (large node sizes). Supporting figure S2 offers a more dynamic view of how the aggregated network is occupied and explored by depicting each network separately. Maintaining node location and color as here described, it informs of each variant across experiments. The joint representation of the three populations adapting to different environments shows how quasispecies start diverging along ecological adaptation. The consensus sequence of the ancestral population P_{37}^{0} for all three experiments (labeled ”wild type”) is located near the triangle center. After 60 passages, each quasispecies has incorporated mutations in a root sequence that has dragged the accompanying ensemble towards a different region of sequence space. The wild type is still present in all three populations, and these show a large overlap among variants that are potentially preadapted to different environmental conditions. In physics terms, we witness a process of symmetry breaking, where mutation fixation opens a region of sequence space but limits access to other possibilities, in a drifting process along which the original state becomes progressively forgotten. In the triangle representation, this process can be visualized as a flux from the center to each corner. Still, all possible variants are connected in a single network, suggesting that, at this stage of adaptation, the process is reversible should the environmental conditions vary."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07055v1,"Reconstruction of neuromorphic dynamics from a single scalar time series
using variational autoencoder and neural network map","This paper examines the reconstruction of a family of dynamical systems with neuromorphic behavior using a single scalar time series. A model of a physiological neuron based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is considered. Single time series of one of its variables is shown to be enough to train a neural network that can operate as a discrete time dynamical system with one control parameter. The neural network system is created in two steps. First, the delay-coordinate embedding vectors are constructed form the original time series and their dimension is reduced with by means of a variational autoencoder to obtain the recovered state-space vectors. It is shown that an appropriate reduced dimension can be determined by analyzing the autoencoder training process. Second, pairs of the recovered state-space vectors at consecutive time steps supplied with a constant value playing the role of a control parameter are used to train another neural network to make it operate as a recurrent map. The regimes of thus created neural network system observed when its control parameter is varied are in very good accordance with those of the original system, though they were not explicitly presented during training.","Reconstructing dynamical models from time series is an important task from a practical point of view and also is an interesting theoretical challenge. To date, a large number of approaches and methods for solving this problem have been developed Kantz and Schreiber (2004); Bradley and Kantz (2015); Bezruchko and Smirnov (2010). In connection with the intensive development of artificial neural network technologies, it seems interesting to study their capabilities in relation to the dynamical modeling. In this regard, without claiming completeness, we can mention some related works. In papers Scully, Neiman, and Shilnikov (2021); Kong et al. (2021); Hart (2024) a sort of neural networks techniques called reservoir computing is considered as tool for replicating the dynamics of chaotic systems and predicting their properties. Blending several dynamical systems into a single model built on the bases of reservoir computing is considered in papers Flynn, Tsachouridis, and Amann (2021, 2023). In paper Durstewitz, Koppe, and Thurm (2023) recurrent neural network is considered as a tool for reconstruction of a model of dynamics trained directly on the measured physiological data. Paper Zhang et al. (2019) reports a new framework, Gumbel Graph Network, which is a model-free, data-driven deep learning framework to accomplish the reconstruction of both network connections and the dynamics on it. Paper Almazova, Barmparis, and Tsironis (2021) is devoted to reconstruction of chaotic dynamic from scalar time series using plain autoencoder. Along with the reconstruction of dynamical systems, neural networks and machine learning methods inspire new ideas in other fields of nonlinear dynamics. In particular, a series of papers Wu et al. (2024a); Ye et al. (2024); Wu et al. (2024b) develops a technique of dynamical learning of synchronization (DLS) designed to control the synchronization state of a complex network composed of nonlinear oscillators. Paper Wu et al. (2024c) demonstrates that a three-layer neural network, comprising input, training, and output layers and utilizing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), can effectively learn the orderly propagation of signals between network layers under controlled synaptic conditions. Neural networks are used for adaptive modeling and control of dynamical systems Levin, Gewirtzman, and Inbar (1991), applied for El Niño attractor reconstruction Grieger and Latif (1994), employed for dynamics prediction based on state space reconstruction Zimmermann and Neuneier (2000). Also machine learning is utilized for biological models creations and analysis Gilpin, Huang, and Forger (2020). One of the most appealing characteristics of neural networks is their capacity for data generalization. This ability stems from the fact that a well-trained neural network is able to identify and extract from the data features and dependencies that may initially appear to be obscure. In the context of problems related to dynamics reconstruction, this aptitude should facilitate significant advancements in the direction of developing models based on experimental data. It is natural to expect that even with a limited amount of information about the system, such as its single scalar time series, it will be possible to use a neural network to construct a family of models, parameterized by control parameters, that will be able to predict a variety of system behaviors. Our paper considers this possibility in relation to a specific example: the neuromorphic dynamics of a system built on the basis of the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism. We avoid using simplified neuron models and focus on the realistic Hodgkin-Huxley one since planing in our future works to consider an experimental data obtained from a natural system described within the Hodgkin-Huxley framework. The main motivation of this paper is to contribute to the methods of studying dynamics based on experimental data. However, in this paper we define a modeled system using ODEs and get a time series from numerical solving the equations. It means that our data are devoid of the features inherent in the data of a real experiment: they are sampled with a small and constant time step, there are quite a lot of them, the readings are recorded without errors (except for numerical ones) and they are not noisy. The cases with non-perfect experimental data will be considered in our subsequent studies. We use variational autoencoder (VAE) Kingma and Welling (2019); Chollet (2021) and neural network map Kuptsov, Stankevich, and Bagautdinova (2023); Kuptsov and Stankevich (2024) as tools to perform reconstruction. The VAE is used to recover system state vectors by reducing the dimension of delay-coordinate embedding vectors from the original time series. The recovered state-space vectors are then used to train the neural network map, resulting in a reconstructed dynamical system with a single control parameter. An autoencoder is one of the standard neural network architectures, which is used, among other things, to reduce the dimension of data Chollet (2021). The main feature of an autoencoder is that the data vectors it process at some point passes through a bottleneck, that is, it turns out to be represented in the form of low-dimensional vectors. The first part of the autoencoder, called the encoder, is responsible for this. After this, the dimension is restored to the original value by the second part, called the decoder. The objective of training is to achieve a minimal discrepancy between the input and output vectors. To this end, all pertinent data must be compressed into the reduced vectors at the bottleneck. VAE differs from a plain autoencoder in that the output of the encoder is not the reduced vector itself, but parameters of the so-called latent space. The reduced vector is randomly selected from this latent space and passed to the decoder. Random sampling of the reduced vectors from the latent space during training is very important for the purposes of dynamics reconstruction, as it ensures proximity preservation. Thanks to this, it is guaranteed that fragments of the original trajectory that are close to each other will be represented by the close latent space vectors, which we use as the reconstructed state-space vectors of the modeled system. It is mathematically proven Kolmogorov (1956); Arnold (1957); Kolmogorov (1957); Cybenko (1989); Gorban (1998); Haykin (1998) that a two-layer fully connected, i.e., dense, neural network can be used to approximate arbitrary functions of many variables. It means that it can be suitable for reconstruction of a dynamical system. In paper Kuptsov, Kuptsova, and Stankevich (2021) a good quality of dynamics reproduction with such a simple network model was shown for different systems: Lorenz, Rössler, Hindmarch–Rose neuron model. However, already for the Hindmarch–Rose oscillator the quality of reconstruction was lower that for two other systems. It was found that a neural network map based on a simple two-layer structure is difficult to train for so called stiff systems where variables have very different time scales. Then in paper Kuptsov, Stankevich, and Bagautdinova (2023) a more advanced structure of the neural network map was suggested. Instead of a single network accepting the full state vector at once and returning the state vector on the next time step, subnetworks for each dynamical variable were introduced. Each subnetwork still has two-layer structure, but all other variables together with control parameters are injected after an additional dense layer. Such network is found to model stiff dynamics and also is able to discover correctly dynamical regime not shown during training. In paper Kuptsov and Stankevich (2024) it is shown that two neural network maps trained separately can model dynamics of two coupled systems without additional training. Thus the goal of this study is to reconstruct the dynamics of a system as completely as possible, given its single scalar time series, using neural networks. The result of the reconstruction will be a family of dynamical systems, parameterized by a control parameter. Our particular interest will be in the dynamical features of the modeled system that are not explicitly presented during training and nevertheless discovered by the reconstructed system."
