https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10427v1,"SN 2023adsy – a normal Type Ia Supernova at z=2.9, discovered by","SN 2023adsy, a Type Ia supernova discovered by JWST at z=2.9, was found to be a peculiar event, being extremely red and faint, but showing very similar rest-frame light curve decline rate to the majority of low-redshift SNe Ia. In this paper we show that the red color and faint peak magnitude could be explained by significant reddening/extinction due to dust in the host galaxy. If host galaxy extinction is accounted for, the parameters of the best-fit light curve templates in the SALT3-NIR model are compatible with a slowly declining, but still “normal” SN Ia. Comparison of the inferred luminosity distance with the prediction of the \LambdaCDM cosmology (assuming H_{0}=70 km s-1 Mpc-1 and \Omega_{\rm M}=0.315) on the Hubble-diagram suggests no significant evolution of the SN Ia peak luminosity at z>2 redshifts. It is also shown that the discovery of a single SN Ia between 2<z<3 within the area of the JADES survey during 1 year is consistent with the current estimates for the SN Ia rates at such redshifts.","Thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae (SNe) discovered at high (z>2) redshifts offer a great opportunity for testing both the cosmic star formation rate (SFR, Oda & Totani, 2005; Regős & Vinkó, 2019; Yan et al., 2023) as well as the nature of dark energy via the cosmological models (Lu et al., 2022). Recently, SN 2023adsy was discovered by Pierel et al. (2024, P24 hereafter) as a Type Ia SN at z=2.9 during the JADES survey (Eisenstein et al., 2023). Interestingly, P24 found that SN 2023adsy looks like a peculiar SN Ia: its light curve and spectrum suggests a normal Type Ia, but it has a very red color reminiscent of an extremely low-luminosity SN Ia (its absolute peak brightness in the B-band was found to be M_{B}\sim-16.45 mag, about 3 mag lower than that of normal SNe Ia), despite its normal light curve decline rate and relatively high Ca II expansion velocity (\sim 18,000 km s-1). P24 also pointed out that with such a faint peak brightness and red color SN 2023adsy could also be a Ca-rich SN Ia, even though it is \sim 1 mag brighter than a typical Ca-rich event, SN 2016hnk. They noted that its peak brightness is more similar to that of 91bg-like SNe Ia, but the relatively normal decline rate of its light curve is incompatible with a fast-declining 91bg-like SN. Finally, P24 found that the standardized absolute peak magnitude of SN 2023adsy is consistent with the prediction of the \LambdaCDM cosmological model assuming H_{0}=70 km s-1 Mpc-1 and \Omega_{\rm M}=0.315, despite its peculiarities mentioned above. P24 argued that the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting of the host galaxy of SN 2023adsy (JADES-GS+53.13485-27.82088 indicates a low-mass (\sim 10^{8} M⊙), low-metallicity (\sim 0.3Z_{\odot}), low-extinction (A_{V}<0.1 mag) galaxy, which suggests that the red color of the SN is probably not due to dust extinction. However, if SN 2023adsy were intrinsically so red as observed, it would be a very peculiar SN Ia, as mentioned above. Since SN 2023adsy is the first spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia beyond z>2, its peculiar nature might imply additional possibilities about the physical differences between high and low-redshift SNe Ia. In this paper we revisit the issue of the red color of SN 2023adsy by investigating whether it could be due to simply dust extinction within its host galaxy, even though the galaxy itself might have relatively low dust content. We re-analyze the JWST NIRCam photometry of SN 2023adsy published by P24, and examine how the parameters of the best-fit light curve templates change if host extinction is also allowed in the model. The data and the fitting methodology is explained in Section 2, while the results are presented and discussed in Section 3."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10353v1,First spectropolarimetric observation of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 3+1,"We report the first simultaneous X-ray spectropolarimetric observation of the bright atoll neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 3+1, performed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) joint with NICER and NuSTAR. The source does not exhibit significant polarization in the 2–8 keV energy band, with an upper limit of 1.3% at a 99% confidence level on the polarization degree. The observed spectra can be well described by a combination of thermal disk emission, the hard Comptonization component, and reflected photons off the accretion disk. In particular, from the broad Fe K\alpha line profile, we were able to determine the inclination of the system (i\approx 36°), which is crucial for comparing the observed polarization with theoretical models. Both the spectral and polarization properties of GX 3+1 are consistent with those of other atoll sources observed by IXPE. Therefore, we may expect a similar geometrical configuration for the accreting system and the hot Comptonizing region. The low polarization is also consistent with the low inclination of the system.","Weakly-magnetized neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries (NS-LMXBs) are among the brightest sources in the X-ray sky and are perfect laboratories for studying the properties of accretion in the strong gravity regime with X-ray polarimetry. Matter accretes onto the NS surface through Roche-lobe overflow, typically from a late main-sequence or evolved degenerate companion star. The surface of the NS stops the accretion flow, creating a boundary (BL) or spreading layer (SL) between the inner edge of the accretion disk and the NS, which extends to higher latitudes as the accretion rate increases (Inogamov & Sunyaev, 1999; Popham & Sunyaev, 2001; Suleimanov & Poutanen, 2006). According to their joint timing and spectral properties in the X-ray band, NS-LMXBs are traditionally divided into a few broad categories according to their tracks in the Hard-color/Soft-color diagrams (CCDs) or hardness-intensity diagrams (HIDs; Hasinger & van der Klis 1989; van der Klis 1989; van der Klis 2006: Atolls (L\sim 10^{36} erg s-1) show less extended and more compact tracks in a rounded single spot in the hard region of the CCD, termed the island state, or in a banana-shaped branch for bright Atolls (L=10^{37}-10^{38} erg s-1; van der Klis 1995); Z-sources (L>10^{38} erg s-1) exhibit a wide Z-like three-branch pattern in the CCD (van der Klis, 2006; Kuulkers et al., 1994; Migliari & Fender, 2006). At lower luminosities, Atoll sources generally trace isolated patches on timescales from days to weeks, whereas the motion is faster at higher luminosities when they move along the banana branch, sometimes showing secular motion that does not influence the variability of the source (Migliari & Fender, 2006). X-ray spectra of NS-LMXBs are typically modeled with a thermal component dominating at lower energies (below 1–2 keV) plus a harder Comptonized emission. Thermal emission may be related to the direct emission of the accretion disk (Mitsuda et al., 1984, 1989) or of the NS surface, while hard emission is due to inverse Compton scattering of the soft photons by a hot electron plasma, whose geometric configuration and physical properties are still not clear. In addition, the accretion disk can reprocess the primary X-ray continuum, leading to a reflection component that usually includes fluorescent emission lines (Di Salvo et al. 2009; Miller et al. 2013; Mondal et al. 2017; Ludlam et al. 2019; Iaria et al. 2020; see also review by Ludlam 2024). X-ray polarimetry, along with timing and spectral observations, could be crucial for determining the geometry and physical characteristics of the system. The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE; Weisskopf et al. 2016, 2022), successfully launched on 2021 December 9, has introduced a powerful new instrument for studying the physical properties of various types of X-ray astronomical objects. IXPE features three X-ray telescopes that use polarization-sensitive imaging detectors (the gas-pixel detectors; Costa et al. 2001) to measure the Stokes parameters of the X-ray radiation, operating in the 2–8 keV energy range. Being bright sources, IXPE has observed several NS-LMXBs so far (see also the review by Ursini et al. 2024b): out of the twelve NS-LMXBs observed so far (seven Z-sources, five Atolls, and two peculiar sources), Atolls are generally less polarized than Z-sources in the 2–8 keV range (Capitanio et al., 2023; Ursini et al., 2023a; Di Marco et al., 2023a; Saade et al., 2024; Ursini et al., 2024a), but exhibit an increasing trend of the polarization degree with energy. The polarization signal in most observed NS-LMXBs is related to the hard component, characterized by a higher polarization compared to the soft thermal emission (Farinelli et al., 2023; Cocchi et al., 2023; Ursini et al., 2023a; La Monaca et al., 2024). In the majority of NS-LMXBs observed by IXPE, the polarization of the hard component seems to originate from the BL or SL, plus the contribution of reflection: these soft photons reflected off the accretion disk may significantly contribute to the polarization signal (Lapidus & Sunyaev, 1985; Matt, 1993), despite their relatively minor contribution to the overall flux. A peculiar behavior was observed for the ultracompact Atoll 4U 1820–303, which exhibited a rapid increase in polarization up to 10\%\pm 2\% in the 7–8 keV band (Di Marco et al., 2023a), much higher than expected for typical BL or SL configurations (Gnarini et al., 2022; Capitanio et al., 2023; Ursini et al., 2023a; Farinelli et al., 2024; Bobrikova et al., 2024). Therefore, a different shape of the Comptonizing region or an additional contribution, for example from outflows, is required to explain this high polarization. GX 3+1 is a persistent and bright Atoll discovered by Bowyer et al. (1965) and identified as an accreting NS in a LMXB system from the detection of Type I X-ray bursts with typical timescales of tens of seconds (Makishima et al., 1983; Kuulkers & van der Klis, 2000; den Hartog et al., 2003; Chenevez et al., 2006) and exhibits superbursts of longer duration (up to hours) due to carbon burning (Kuulkers, 2002). Assuming that type I X-ray bursts are Eddington limited, the estimated upper limit to the source distance is \sim 6.5 kpc (Galloway et al., 2008), consistent with the results obtained from a double peak photospheric radius expansion burst (Kuulkers & van der Klis, 2000). The near-infrared (NIR) counterpart to GX 3+1 was discovered by van den Berg et al. (2014) as a star with 15.8\pm 0.1 mag, suggesting that the donor star may not be a late-type giant with the NIR dominated by the emission of the outer accretion disk. GX 3+1 is among the brightest persistent Atoll sources associated with the bulge component of the Milky Way. These sources are typically characterized by high X-ray luminosity (10^{37}-10^{38} erg s-1), with moderate and irregular flux variations. Similarly to the bright atolls GX 9+1 and GX 9+9, GX 3+1 exhibits strong long-term X-ray flux modulations, with a timescale of \sim 6 yr (Kotze & Charles, 2010; Durant et al., 2010), likely due to variations in the mass-transfer rate. Moreover, this NS-LMXB was observed only in its banana branch (Lewin et al., 1987; Hasinger & van der Klis, 1989; Asai et al., 1993; Pintore et al., 2015; Thomas et al., 2023), without any evidence of island state in its CCD or HID. The X-ray spectrum of GX 3+1 can be well described by the combination of a soft thermal component, most likely related to the accretion disk, plus a Comptonized component due to the hot electron population in the corona (Oosterbroek et al., 2001; Mainardi et al., 2010; Seifina & Titarchuk, 2012; Piraino et al., 2012; Pintore et al., 2015; Ludlam et al., 2019). Several K\alpha broad emission lines of Ar, Ca, and Fe were also detected in GX 3+1 spectra (Oosterbroek et al., 2001; Piraino et al., 2012). These features arise from the reprocessing of X-ray photons illuminating the accretion disk. In particular, the location of the inner disk radius and the inclination of the system can be estimated from the relativistically broadened Fe K\alpha line profile: from XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL observations, the inclination is \sim 35\degr with the inner edge of the accretion disk located at \sim 10 R_{\rm g} (where R_{\rm g}=GM/c^{2}; Pintore et al. 2015), while it appears to be closer to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) in a NuSTAR observation, with an inclination of 27\degr-31\degr (Ludlam et al., 2019). The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the IXPE, NuSTAR, and NICER observations and data reduction. In Sect. 3, we present the X-ray spectropolarimetric analysis. Finally, in Sect. 4 and 5, we discuss the results and the main conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10256v1,"Mass-loss, composition and observational signatures of stellar winds from X-ray bursts","X-Ray bursts (XRBs) are powerful thermonuclear events on the surface of accreting neutron stars (NSs), which can synthesize intermediate-mass elements. Although the high surface gravity prevents an explosive ejection, a small fraction of the envelope may be ejected by radiation-driven winds. In our previous works, we have developed a non-relativistic radiative wind model and coupled it to an XRB hydrodynamic simulation. We now apply this technique to another model featuring consecutive bursts. We determine the mass-loss and chemical composition of the wind ejecta. Results show that, for a representative XRB, about 0.1\% of the envelope mass is ejected per burst, at an average rate of 3.9\times 10^{-12}\,\text{M}_{{\odot}}\texttt{yr}^{-1}. Between 66\% and 76\% of the ejecta composition is 60Ni, 64Zn, 68Ge, 4He and 58Ni. We also report on the evolution of observational quantities during the wind phase and simulate NICER observations that resemble those of 4U 1820-40.","Type I X-ray bursts (XRBs) are powerful, recurrent thermonuclear explosions on the surface of accreting neutron stars in binary systems (Strohmayer \BBA Bildsten, \APACyear2006; Keek \BBA in’t Zand, \APACyear2008; Galloway \BOthers., \APACyear2008; José, \APACyear2016). They occur when accreted material builds up under moderately degenerate conditions, triggering nuclear reactions and a thermonuclear runaway. This leads to a sharp increase in luminosity and the production of intermediate-mass elements, mainly around A=64 (Woosley \BOthers., \APACyear2004; Fisker \BOthers., \APACyear2008; José \BOthers., \APACyear2010). A typical neutron star (NS), with an escape velocity near \tfrac{2}{3}c, allows only a limited envelope expansion before the nuclear reactions stop due to nuclear fuel consumption. However, at certain accretion rates, significant photospheric radius expansion (PRE) can occur, with luminosity reaching or exceeding the Eddington limit, and potentially leading to material ejection via a radiation-driven wind (see Herrera \BOthers., \APACyear2020, and references therein –\al@HSJ2020, from now on). The contribution of XRBs to Galactic abundances is still debated and is one of the goals of this study. In addition, the study of XRB winds in PRE bursts can lead to the determination of neutron stars radii and masses, therefore providing constraints on the equation of state of NS matter (Lattimer \BBA Prakash, \APACyear2006; Damen \BOthers., \APACyear1990; Steiner \BOthers., \APACyear2010; Güver \BOthers., \APACyear2012; Sala \BOthers., \APACyear2012), but several simple assumptions are usually taken for the determination of the NS mass (maximum luminosity at the Eddington limit) and radius (touch-down of photospheric radius at NS surface). The simulation of the NS envelope during XRB winds can help to reduce uncertainties and test the validity of those assumptions. The last years have witnessed a renewed interest in the modeling of XRB winds. H. Yu \BBA Weinberg (\APACyear2018) performed MESA (Paxton \BOthers., \APACyear2011) simulations of the hydrodynamics of the wind after the Eddington limit is reached; and Guichandut \BOthers. (\APACyear2021) studied the transition from static expanded envelopes to radiatively driven stellar wind and discussed the applicability of steady-state models. In \al@HSJ2020 we determined the conditions for the presence of a radiative wind in a generic NS scenario, we explored the wind model parameter space in terms of energy and mass outflows (\dot{E},\dot{M}), and analyzed possible predictions related to observable variables. Subsequently, in Herrera \BOthers. (\APACyear2023) –\al@HSJ2023 from now on–, we applied the wind model to a more realistic XRB scenario by coupling it to the results of a high resolution (200 shells) hydrodynamic simulation by José \BOthers. (\APACyear2010) –\al@Jose2010 from now on–, which modeled the thermonuclear reactions and complex hydrodynamics of the XRB in the accreted envelope. This way we could self-consistently simulate the evolution of the entire NS envelope, from the nuclear burning shells to the photosphere of the expanding wind, allowing us to study the evolution of observable quantities for the XRB-wind model, to obtain the composition of the envelope layers blown away by the wind, and ultimately to assess the possible contribution of XRBs to Galactic abundances. As a natural continuation to the work presented in \al@HSJ2023, here we present the wind model coupled to another simulation of \al@Jose2010. While this time we use a lower resolution simulation (60 shells) than the one studied in \al@HSJ2023, it simulates four consecutive bursts in a continuous time sequence, accounting for the accretion between bursts and thus the natural chemical evolution. Additionally, we were able to reconstruct the continuous evolution of the photospheric properties of each burst, featuring both the radiative wind and the wind-free phases, for which we have also simulated observations with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer Mission (NICER)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10223v1,Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays versus Models of High Energy Hadronic Interactions,"We evaluate the consistency of hadronic interaction models in the CORSIKA simulation package with publicly available fluorescence telescope data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. By comparing the first few central moments of the extended air shower depth maximum distributions, as extracted from measured events, to those predicted by the best-fit inferred compositions, we derive a statistical measure of the consistency of a given hadronic model with data. To mitigate possible systematic biases, we include all primaries up to iron, compensate for the differences between the measured and simulated energy spectra of cosmic rays and account for other known systematic effects. Additionally, we study the effects of including higher central moments in the fit and project our results to larger statistics.","The study of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs), particles with energies exceeding 10^{18} eV incident on Earth, is crucial for understanding the most energetic processes in the Universe. Key questions in UHECR research include their origin, propagation mechanisms, and composition. The origin of UHECRs is still debated, with potential sources ranging from active galactic nuclei to gamma-ray bursts [1, 2]. Understanding their propagation involves considering interactions with cosmic microwave background photons and (inter)galactic magnetic fields, which crucially affect their trajectories and energy spectra. Additionally, the composition of UHECRs, whether primarily protons, or a mixture of heavier nuclei, has significant implications for both their sources, acceleration and propagation [3]. Detection of UHECRs currently relies on large ground based observatories such as the Pierre Auger Observatory [4, 5] and the Telescope Array [6], comprised of water Cherenkov detectors and fluorescence telescopes. They measure various observables related to extended air showers (EAS) produced by UHECRs, from which the energy, arrival direction, and the composition of primary cosmic rays can be inferred. Interpreting the data from these observatories requires detailed simulations of EAS initiated by UHECRs in the Earth’s atmosphere. These simulations depend crucially on models of hadronic interactions, which describe the behavior of particles produced in high-energy collisions. The accuracy of these models is essential for reliable interpretation of experimental data. Recent developments in hadronic interaction models [7, 8, 9, 10], have improved our understanding of particle interactions at extreme energies. These models are continually calibrated and refined using data from both cosmic ray experiments and particle accelerators. However, some discrepancies persist, particularly in the observed ground-level muon multiplicity, which appears inconsistent with predictions [11]. Conversely, measurements from fluorescence telescopes show better agreement with simulations, highlighting a possible venue for further refinement of hadronic interaction models. Our recent work has focused on developing novel observables, such as the central moments of the shower depth maximum (X_{\rm max}) distributions recorded by the fluorescence detectors, to infer the mass composition of UHECRs [12, 13, 14]. These observables demonstrated differentiating sensitivity to hadronic models, providing a potential pathway to resolve current discrepancies and enhance our understanding of UHECR composition and interactions. In this work, we carefully reexamine the consistency of different hadronic models with X_{\rm max} measurements. Previously [12], we have shown that for the limited statistics of the Pierre Auger Open Data, the first three X_{\rm max} central moments suffice to infer the full UHECR mass composition. Here we extend this study by projecting to larger statistics, relevant for the analysis of the full Pierre Auger dataset. In particular, we focus on the sensitivity of higher X_{\rm max} moments to hadronic interaction models. By marginalizing over possible UHECR mass compositions we construct a robust statistical measure to differentiate between and assess the validity of different models. The remainder of the article is structured as follows. In Section II we review the inference procedure for UHECR mass composition, with the respective likelihood based on X_{\rm max} moments, and discuss the interplay of the CR energy spectrum, mass composition and hadronic interaction model effects. In Section III we present and discuss our results on hadronic model discrimination, while our main conclusions are summarized in Section IV."

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10140v1,Early Detection of Multiwavelength Blazar Variability,"Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with relativistic jets pointing toward the observer. They are notable for their flux variability at all observed wavelengths and timescales. Together with simultaneous measurements at lower energies, the very-high-energy (VHE) emission observed during blazar flares may be used to probe the population of accelerated particles. However, optimally triggering observations of blazar high states can be challenging. Notable examples include identifying a flaring episode in real time and predicting VHE flaring activity based on lower energy observables. For this purpose, we have developed a novel deep learning analysis framework, based on data-driven anomaly detection techniques. It is capable of detecting various types of anomalies in real-world, multiwavelength light curves, ranging from clear high states to subtle correlations across bands. Based on unsupervised anomaly detection and clustering methods, we differentiate source variability from noisy background activity, without the need for a labeled training dataset of flaring states. The framework incorporates measurement uncertainties and is robust given data quality challenges, such as varying cadences and observational gaps. We evaluate our approach using both historical data and simulations of blazar light curves in two energy bands, corresponding to sources observable with the Fermi Large Area Telescope, and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). In a statistical analysis, we show that our framework can reliably detect known historical flares.","Observations of transient phenomena are key to disentangling the physical processes at play in astrophysical systems. In the past years, notable transient events include the spatial correlation of an astrophysical neutrino with a flaring gamma-ray source (Aartsen et al., 2018), the observation of gamma rays and gravitational waves produced by a kilonova (Abbott et al., 2017), and the discovery of new classes of very-high-energy (VHE; >100 GeV) gamma-ray emitters such as gamma-ray bursts and novae (MAGIC Collaboration et al., 2019; H. E. S. S. Collaboration et al., 2019; Aharonian et al., 2022) via detection of transient emission. Measuring or constraining the very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission from transient events is of particular interest, as these gamma rays track the most extreme acceleration processes. Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), such as VERITAS, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., and the next generation Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, are the most sensitive instruments for measuring VHE gamma-ray emission (Park, 2015; Aleksić et al., 2016; Aharonian et al., 2006; Acharya et al., 2013). However, they have fields of view of less than 10\degree, which limits the chance of serendipitous transient detection. Source variability detected at other wavelengths is therefore used to trigger IACT observations, increasing the probability of observing transient events with IACTs. The deep learning approach presented here collates multiwavelength (MWL) information on the activity state of known gamma-ray sources and uses this information to anticipate periods of unusual emission (e.g., flares) in the VHE band. In developing this method, we focus on blazars, a gamma-ray source class which shows strong variability on all observed timescales and wavelengths, and for which a large archive of VHE and MWL observations exists. 1.1 Blazars Blazars are a class of active galactic nuclei with a relativistic jet oriented towards the observer, resulting in strongly Doppler-boosted emission. They are the most numerous source class detected in high energy (HE; 100 MeV–100 GeV) and VHE gamma rays. However, the mechanisms driving particle acceleration in the jets and the observed gamma-ray emission are not well-understood, and models of varying complexity abound (for discussion of acceleration see e.g., Kirk et al. (2000); Sironi et al. (2015); for emission see Cerruti (2020) and references therein). Gaining a better understanding of the underlying acceleration and emission mechanisms in blazars is relevant for a number of topics. For example, blazars are plausible sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, should protons be accelerated in their jets (e.g., Murase et al. (2012); Rodrigues et al. (2018)). As extragalactic sources, located at cosmological distances from Earth, blazar observations can be used to probe the photon and magnetic fields traversed en route to Earth, and to test for signatures of Lorentz invariance violation and photon coupling to axion-like particles, effects that are expected to grow with gamma-ray propagation distance (see Biteau & Meyer (2022) and references therein). For such scientific goals, precise measurements of the broadband spectral energy distributions of sources (SEDs) is critical, being the main handle for interpretation of the emission mechanisms. The photon emission from all VHE-detected blazars is characterized as variable at some or all observed wavelengths, from radio to VHE, on timescales from minutes to years. Bright states are of particular interest, but it is challenging to simultaneously detect a source and measure the SED over multiple wavelengths. This is due in part to limitations on collection areas of instruments in different wavelengths, as well as to the intrinsic variation in flux as a function of energy. Sources that are typically too dim to be detected in the HE and VHE bands without long integration periods (weeks to months) can conversely be detected during flaring episodes within minutes or hours. The SED of a variable blazar is modelled most robustly using simultaneous MWL observations, in order to ensure that different time-dependent flux states are not conflated. Bright states are key to probing the emission mechanism of blazars, and to their physical interpretation. Particularly important is the VHE band, where the photon flux is comparatively low. Flare detection is therefore a cornerstone of the scientific programs of the IACT community (see Aharonian et al. (2007); Albert et al. (2008); Acciari et al. (2009); Abeysekara et al. (2015) for selected examples). Identifying correlated variation at different wavelengths is also valuable, as different models of blazar emission predict correlations (or lack thereof) between different bands. However, consistent definition and identification of flares remains a challenge in the community, as e.g., discussed by Zimmerman et al. (2024). 1.2 Deep Learning and Anomaly Detection Machine learning and, in particular, deep learning, are widely used in astronomy. Many applications are based on supervised learning. This involves input data which are labeled, where the algorithm is trained to encode the mapping between inputs and labels. Examples include classification, such as \gamma/hadron separation for IACT experiments (see e.g., Feng & Lin, 2016; Nieto Castaño et al., 2017), as well as regression tasks, e.g., the evaluation of the redshift of a galaxy (Sadeh et al., 2016). Conversely, for unsupervised learning, specific labels are not known a priori and the objective is to find patterns in the data. Applications are commonly based on clustering (Min et al., 2018) and/or outlier detection (Reis et al., 2018; Malanchev et al., 2021). In the following, we expand on the work of Sadeh (2020) (hereafter SA20), who utilized a recurrent neural network (RNN) for outlier detection. An RNN is a form of a directed graph, representing a sequence of steps in time. Outputs from each time step are fed as input to the next, in addition to the respective temporal data. Such models are useful for characterization of complex data on different timescales. SA20 illustrated the use of their method for the detection of various types of astrophysical transients, such as gamma-ray bursts and neutrino emission by candidate neutrino point sources. The general concept is to use an RNN to characterize the background to a potential transient. This is done by providing the network with existing/past data, taken before the emergence of the putative transient event. For instance, in the case of the search for an astrophysical neutrino transient, the background represents the continuously observed signals of atmospheric neutrinos. The purpose of the RNN is to predict the background within the near future (upcoming time steps of the network), based on observations of the near past. Potential transients are then detectable as deviations of new observations from the expected background predictions. For their chosen datasets, SA20 could construct RNN inputs that increase with the intensity of putative signals. For example, they used the reconstructed gamma-ray flux within a region of interest from an IACT experiment, which increases when a new gamma-ray source appears. As such, transients would always manifest themselves as upward fluctuations from the background predictions of the network. Considering observables that by construction always scale up with the strength of the signal enables the definition of a simple outlier score, acting as a test statistic (TS) for detection. The latter is defined by SA20 as the integrated difference between the predictions of the RNN and the stream of real data. In the current work, we focus on blazar flares as the target transient phenomena. However, we set out to identify any unexpected activity from the source, such as notable downward deviations or correlated changes of the emission on different timescales. For this purpose, the simple test statistic used by SA20 is not appropriate, given that it is designed exclusively for upward deviations from the background. In order to construct a generalized test statistic for arbitrary types of flares, we expand the architecture of the network used by SA20, as discussed in the following. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce our machine-learning based framework and in Sect. 3 we describe how it is trained. Sect. 4 contains a simulation study, in which we evaluate the sensitivity of our method. In Sect. 5 we demonstrate the utility of our method in an analysis of real data from BL Lacertae, before concluding in Sect. 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10092v1,First Searches for Dark Matter with the KM3NeT Neutrino Telescopes,"Indirect dark matter detection methods are used to observe the products of dark matter annihilations or decays originating from astrophysical objects where large amounts of dark matter are thought to accumulate. With neutrino telescopes, an excess of neutrinos is searched for in nearby dark matter reservoirs, such as the Sun and the Galactic Centre, which could potentially produce a sizeable flux of Standard Model particles.The KM3NeT infrastructure, currently under construction, comprises the ARCA and ORCA undersea Čerenkov neutrino detectors located at two different sites in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore of Italy and France, respectively. The two detector configurations are optimised for the detection of neutrinos of different energies, enabling the search for dark matter particles with masses ranging from a few GeV/c2 to hundreds of TeV/c2. In this work, searches for dark matter annihilations in the Galactic Centre and the Sun with data samples taken with the first configurations of both detectors are presented. No significant excess over the expected background was found in either of the two analyses. Limits on the velocity-averaged self-annihilation cross section of dark matter particles are computed for five different primary annihilation channels in the Galactic Centre. For the Sun, limits on the spin-dependent and spin-independent scattering cross sections of dark matter with nucleons are given for three annihilation channels.","The existence of dark matter has been postulated to explain the dynamics of astrophysical objects in gravitational fields and to account for the structure formation in the Universe [1]. Assuming a particle nature for dark matter, one candidate class of particles that is in agreement with the evidences of dark matter are weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). WIMPs can easily be accommodated in our current cosmological model: a particle with a pair-annihilation cross section analogous to the cross section of weak interactions and a mass in the GeV/c^{2}-TeV/c^{2} region which reproduces, via the freeze-out mechanism, the relic abundance of dark matter inferred from the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background. Various extensions of the Standard Model (SM) can provide a candidate WIMP particle. The candidates for the lightest supersymmetric particle of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM, such as the neutralino, the sneutrino or the gravitino, are dark matter candidates. Other approaches to solve the gauge hierarchy problem can also provide WIMP candidates, e.g. the introduction of extra dimensions in Kaluza-Klein theories results in a number of WIMP candidate particles [2]. Finally, a series of minimal extensions to the SM furnish a variety of other dark matter candidates [3]. Three detection strategies are currently employed in an attempt to observe dark matter particles: direct detection, indirect detection and production at colliders. Direct detection experiments attempt to observe the WIMP-nucleon scattering process. The energy transferred to the target nuclei in the scattering is emitted in the form of scintillation light, ionisation electrons or phonons, depending on the medium [1]. Noble gas detectors, bubble chambers and crystal scintillator detectors are the most common approaches to induce and observe the signal of nuclear recoils [4, 5, 6]. Collider searches attempt to observe supersymmetry breaking by searching for signatures of new physics in collision events. Such signatures involve the detection of missing transverse momentum and high jet multiplicity, indicating the production of squarks or gluinos. The observation of missing transverse momentum and additional leptons would indicate the production of charginos and neutralinos [7]. Indirect detection experiments attempt to detect SM particles produced by annihilations or decays of dark matter particles. The SM products that are searched for in different experiments include neutrinos [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], \gamma-rays [14, 15, 16, 17, 18] and antimatter (positrons, antiprotons and antideuterons) [19, 20, 21, 22]. Searches for the products of dark matter annihilations are performed by observing objects where dark matter is thought to accumulate. One such object is the Galactic Centre, as galaxy formation models predict the existence of galactic dark matter halos with very high densities at their centre [23]. A second possible source is the Sun, where dark matter particles of the Galactic halo scatter off nuclei in the solar medium, causing them to get trapped in the gravitational potential of the Sun and accumulate in its core [24]. Given enough time, the dark matter capture and annihilation processes reach equilibrium and a steady flux of particles is predicted to be emitted from the centre of the Sun. Neutrinos below a few TeV can escape the Sun interior and reach the Earth, while no other SM particle can do so [25]. The expected neutrino flux at the Earth surface due to the annihilation of dark matter particles into secondary products can be expressed as \frac{d^{2}\Phi}{dEdt}=\frac{\Gamma}{4\pi D^{2}}\frac{dN}{dE}, (1.1) where the parameter \Gamma is the annihilation rate of WIMP particles, D is the distance to the source and \frac{dN}{dE} represents the number of neutrinos per unit energy emitted in one annihilation event. Neutrino spectra are computed for a set of WIMP masses from the GeV/c^{2} to the 100 TeV/c^{2} scale for five annihilation channels: \mathrm{WIMP+WIMP}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-},\tau^{+}\tau^{-},b\bar{b},W^{+}W^{% -},\nu\bar{\nu}. For each channel, a 100\% branching ratio is assumed, except for the neutrino channel, where a flavour-blind annihilation with a branching ratio of 1/3 to each neutrino flavour is adopted. For both the Galactic Centre and the Sun, the neutrino yields from the subsequent decays and emissions of the annihilation products are described using PYTHIA, a Monte Carlo event generator of high-energy physics collision events [26]. The yields are implemented in the form of tables in the PPPC4DMID framework [27] in the case of annihilations in the Galactic Centre. The neutrino yields from dark matter annihilations in the Sun are obtained with WimpSim [28], implemented within the DarkSUSY software package [29]. The determination of the neutrino spectra produced in both sources contains some common sources of uncertainty, such as the uncertainties on showering and hadronisation in secondary SM processes and the treatment of electroweak corrections [30]. Additional sources of uncertainty in the computation of neutrino spectra in the Sun are related to the transport of neutrinos through the solar medium: the treatment of the interactions and the uncertainties in the neutrino cross sections result in large differences in the predicted spectra in literature [30]. Neutrino oscillations are taken into account when propagating neutrinos from the source to the Earth [31]: as the path they travel is sufficiently large, the energy and path length dependencies are taken as an average value for both sources. The number of muon neutrinos per unit energy emitted in the chain of processes resulting from one WIMP pair annihilation into a pair of tau leptons in the Galactic Centre is shown in Fig. 1 for three different WIMP masses. An identical number of antineutrinos is expected to be produced in the annihilation process. Figure 1: Number of muon neutrinos produced in one WIMP-pair annihilation into tau leptons in the Galactic Centre as a function of the neutrino energy. The curves are shown for three different WIMP masses and account for neutrino oscillations. The WIMP annihilation rate, \Gamma, in the Galactic Centre depends on the spatial distribution of dark matter and the thermally-averaged cross section of the WIMP annihilation process, \langle\sigma\upsilon\rangle, which is the parameter being measured or constrained. The spatial distribution of WIMPs is expressed in terms of the Galactic density profile, which is estimated using the CLUMPY program [32]. In this analysis, the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile is used [23], with the local halo density set to \rho_{\mathrm{local}}=0.471\>\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}/\mathrm{cm}^{3} and the scale radius r_{s}=19.1\>\mathrm{kpc}, as used in the ANTARES publication [8]. This density profile, expressed in terms of the angular distance from the centre of the galaxy, \theta, is integrated along the line of sight (l.o.s.) and through the solid angle that the object subtends in the sky, \Delta\Omega. The integrated quantity is often referred to as the J-factor. The neutrino flux at the surface of the Earth then reads as \frac{d^{2}\Phi_{\nu}}{dE_{\nu}dt}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{1}{2}\frac{\langle% \sigma\upsilon\rangle}{m_{\mathrm{WIMP}}^{2}}\frac{dN_{\nu}}{dE_{\nu}}\int_{% \Delta\Omega}{\int_{\mathrm{l.o.s.}}{\rho^{2}(\theta,l)dl\,d\Omega}}. (1.2) The factor 1/2 appears as the WIMPs are assumed to be their own anti-particles and the squared WIMP mass, m_{\mathrm{WIMP}}^{2}, as two WIMPs participate in the annihilation process. Flux expectations from 15 WIMP masses in the range from 500 GeV/c^{2} to 100 TeV/c^{2} are searched for in the Galactic Centre analysis. The density profile of dark matter in the Milky Way is largely unconstrained due to the difficulty of observing stellar objects close to the centre of the Galaxy. As a consequence, both cuspy and cored density profiles produce a similar level of agreement between theory and observation when fitted to the rotation curves of Milky Way objects [33]. This factor is therefore the largest source of uncertainty in determining the neutrino flux. Cored density profiles, with constant densities within a few kpc of the Galactic Centre, produce a significantly more dispersed spatial signature, as the emission is less concentrated at the centre of the Galaxy. Consequently, neutrinos emitted from cuspy profiles will be more concentrated and easier to discriminate from the background. In the case of the Sun, equilibrium between the WIMP capture and annihilation processes is assumed, which implies \Gamma=C_{r}/2, C_{r} being the capture rate of dark matter in the Sun. The latter is related to the WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section, which can be spin-dependent or spin-independent. If the coupling between WIMPs and nucleons is a spin-dependent axial-vector coupling, WIMPs can only scatter off nuclei with net spin, predominantly hydrogen nuclei. If the coupling between WIMPs and nucleons is a spin-independent scalar coupling, the WIMPs can scatter off all the isotopes composing the Sun, therefore a model of the elemental solar abundances and their mass fractions must be adopted [29]. Each target nucleus has a different mass, resulting in a different form factor suppression and a different kinematic suppression of the capture. All this can be accounted for with the following relation between the WIMP-nucleon cross section and the neutrino flux at the surface of the Earth: \sigma^{\mathrm{SD,SI}}=K^{\mathrm{SD,SI}}\Phi_{\nu+\bar{\nu}}, (1.3) where \sigma^{\mathrm{SD,SI}} represents the spin-dependent/spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section and K is a conversion factor which contains information about the WIMP-WIMP annihilation channel, the mass of the WIMP, the different suppression factors and abundances of each element, the local density and velocity distributions of the WIMP halo surrounding the Sun, the Earth-Sun distance and the neutrino oscillation probabilities. The conversion factors are computed using the software package DarkSUSY. Three annihilation channels are considered when searching for dark matter from the Sun: \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, b\bar{b} and W^{+}W^{-}. For the Sun analysis, 36 masses in the range between 10 GeV/c^{2} and 5 TeV/c^{2} are considered. This paper is organised as follows: the KM3NeT detector, the event simulation, propagation and reconstruction methodology and the event selection are described in Sec. 2. In Sec. 3, the analysis methods used to search for neutrinos produced by dark matter annihilations are described. The results of searches for dark matter in the Galactic Centre and the Sun with KM3NeT are reported in Sec. 4.1 and Sec. 4.2, respectively. The paper is concluded with a summary in Sec. 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09902v1,"Investigation of the non-thermal X-ray emission from the supernova remnant CTB 37B hosting
the magnetar CXOU J171405.7-381031","We present a detailed X-ray investigation of a region (S1) exhibiting non-thermal X-ray emission within the supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 37B hosting the magnetar CXOU J171405.7-381031. Previous analyses modeled this emission with a power law (PL), inferring various values for the photon index (\Gamma) and absorbing column density (N_{\rm H}). Based on these, S1 was suggested to be the SNR shell, a background pulsar wind nebula (PWN), or an interaction region between the SNR and a molecular cloud. Our analysis of a larger dataset favors a steepening (broken or curved PL) spectrum over a straight PL, with the best-fit broken power-law (BPL) parameters of \Gamma=1.23\pm 0.23 and 2.24\pm 0.16 below and above a break at 5.57\pm 0.52 keV, respectively. However, a simple PL or srcut model cannot be definitively ruled out. For the BPL model, the inferred N_{\rm H}=(4.08\pm 0.72)\times 10^{22}\rm\ cm^{-2} towards S1 is consistent with that of the SNR, suggesting a physical association. The BPL-inferred spectral break \Delta\Gamma\approx 1 and hard \Gamma can be naturlly explained by a non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) model. We present an evolutionary NTB model that reproduces the observed spectrum, which indicates the presence of sub-relativistic electrons within S1. However, alternate explanations for S1, an unrelated PWN or the SNR shock with unusually efficient acceleration, cannot be ruled out. We discuss these explanations and their implications for gamma-ray emission from CTB 37B, and describe future observations that could settle the origin of S1.","High-energy cosmic rays nearing PeV energies have been suggested to originate from Galactic sources such as supernova remnants (SNRs) and pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). PWNe are believed to primarily accelerate leptons, while SNRs are thought to be responsible for hadron acceleration. Evidence for energetic hadrons in several SNRs comes from their gamma-ray spectra (e.g., Ackermann et al., 2013). Three primary radiation mechanisms involving energetic leptons or hadrons are thought to be responsible for gamma-ray emission from astrophysical objects. Inverse-Compton (IC) scattering refers to the process where electrons boost the energy of low-energy photons, such as those from the cosmic microwave background or interstellar radiation field (ISRF), to TeV energies. Additionally, non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) radiation emitted by energetic electrons can contribute to the observed gamma-ray emission (e.g., Chevalier, 1999; Slane et al., 2015). On the other hand, the hadronic process entails the collision of high-energy protons, accelerated by SNR shocks or through interaction between an SNR and a molecular cloud (MC), with a dense surrounding medium (e.g., Bykov et al., 2000). These collisions give rise to neutral pions, which subsequently decay into MeV–TeV gamma rays. These concurrent leptonic and hadronic processes can coexist within a given source. Therefore, definitively identifying “hadronic” acceleration requires careful consideration of the aforementioned radiation mechanisms to rule out a purely leptonic origin for the gamma-ray emission via IC and/or NTB processes. This necessitates an approach involving the analysis of the multi-wavelength image and spectral energy distribution (SED), and ultimately, the application of emission models to the observational data (e.g., Reynolds, 2008). CTB 37B (G348.7+0.3)111http://snrcat.physics.umanitoba.ca/SNRtable.php is an SNR harboring the bright magnetar CXOU J171405.7-381031 (hereafter J1714) with a spin period of 3.8 s, surface dipole magnetic-field strength of B_{s}=4.8\times 10^{14} G, and spin-down power of \dot{E}_{\rm SD}=4.2\times 10^{34}\rm\ erg\ s^{-1} (Halpern & Gotthelf, 2010; Sato et al., 2010). The estimated distance to and age of the SNR are 8–13 kpc and 650–6200 yr, respectively (Tian & Leahy, 2012; Nakamura et al., 2009; Blumer et al., 2019). The SNR has been well detected across various wavelengths, including radio (Kassim et al., 1991), X-ray (Nakamura et al., 2009), GeV (Abdollahi et al., 2020), and TeV bands (Aharonian et al., 2008a). Its radio emission emanates from a shell-like structure east of the magnetar (Figure 1). Diffuse X-ray emission was detected surrounding the magnetar; this X-ray emission region is mostly contained within the radio shell. The GeV and TeV emissions exhibit significant spatial overlap with both radio and X-ray regions. Figure 1: A composite image of combined SUMSS (843 MHz; white contours), Herschel SPIRES (red), XMM-Newton (1–8 keV; green) and NuSTAR (3–20 keV; blue) data of CTB 37B. The magnetar is marked as J1714 (cyan cross), and our main target “S1” is denoted by a white ellipse. The NuSTAR image was truncated to remove stray-light contamination (e.g., Figure 2 (a)). The magenta ellipse and the yellow circle show the GeV and TeV counterparts detected by Fermi-LAT (magenta; 68% positional uncertainty) and H.E.S.S. (yellow; 1\sigma extension), respectively. The images were smoothed and logarithmically scaled to improve legibility. Previous TeV observations (e.g., Figure 1 Aharonian et al., 2008a) of the SNR favored hadronic processes over leptonic ones. This is because leptonic scenarios would require an unrealistically low magnetic field strength (B) of \sim1\,\muG or an unexpected cutoff in the electron distribution at around 40 TeV. Zeng et al. (2017) proposed a lepto-hadronic model where hadronic interactions dominate the TeV emission. Their model necessitates a high gas density within the shell (10\rm\ cm^{-3}) to match the supernova (SN) energy budget (e.g., E_{\rm SN}=10^{51}\rm\ erg\ s^{-1}). This value significantly exceeds the density inferred from models of the SNR shell’s overall X-ray emission (e.g., 0.5\rm\ cm^{-3}; Aharonian et al., 2008a; Blumer et al., 2019). The origin of this discrepancy in gas density estimations remains unclear in their work. While the X-ray spectrum of the diffuse emission around J1714 was found to be thermal (Aharonian et al., 2008a), Nakamura et al. (2009) observed non-thermal hard power-law (PL) emission in the south of the magnetar, and subsequent investigations by Chandra and XMM-Newton resolved this PL emission to originate from a compact region at \sim4′ south of J1714 (S1 in Figure 1; see also Blumer et al., 2019; Gotthelf et al., 2019). These previous studies reported inconsistent spectral properties for S1, including photon index (\Gamma) and absorbing column density (N_{\rm H}) (Section 2.4). As a result, the origin of S1’s emission remains uncertain. While Nakamura et al. (2009) attributed it to the SNR shell, Gotthelf et al. (2019) proposed a background source. Blumer et al. (2019) considered both a SNR-MC interaction and an unrelated PWN as possible explanations. The potential association of this non-thermal emission with the SNR holds significant implications for the radiation processes at play within CTB 37B. This non-thermal X-ray region S1 could contribute to the total TeV flux through processes like hadronic interactions or NTB (e.g., Reynolds, 2008; Slane et al., 2015). Based on hard X-ray spectra with \Gamma<2 within the SNRs IC 443 and W49B, Zhang et al. (2018) and Tanaka et al. (2018) suggested NTB emission from them. Moreover, Tanaka et al. (2018) explored the possibility of gamma-ray emission through the NTB process in W49B. However, previous studies on the broadband SED of CTB 37B have not considered this possibility. In this paper, we investigate the S1 emission using both archival and newly acquired X-ray data from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. Our analysis methods and results are presented in Section 2. We interpret the X-ray data under the framework of the NTB scenario in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss the implications of our analysis results.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09901v1,Modeling the X-ray emission of the Boomerang nebula and implication for its potential ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray emission,"The Boomerang nebula is a bright radio and X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by an energetic pulsar, PSR J2229+6114. It is spatially coincident with one of the brightest ultrahigh-energy (UHE, \geq 100 TeV) gamma-ray sources, LHAASO J2226+6057. While X-ray observations have provided radial profiles for both the intensity and photon index of the nebula, previous theoretical studies have not reached an agreement on their physical interpretation, which also lead to different anticipation of the UHE emission from the nebula. In this work, we model its X-ray emission with a dynamical evolution model of PWN, considering both convective and diffusive transport of electrons. On the premise of fitting the X-ray intensity and photon index profiles, we find that the magnetic field within the Boomerang nebula is weak (\sim 10\muG in the core region and diminishing to 1\mu\,G at the periphery), which therefore implies a significant contribution to the UHE gamma-ray emission by the inverse Compton (IC) radiation of injected electron/positron pairs. Depending on the particle transport mechanism, the UHE gamma-ray flux contributed by the Boomerang nebula via the IC radiation may constitute about 10-50\% of the flux of LHAASO J2226+6057 at 100 TeV, and up to 30% at 500 TeV. Finally, we compare our results with previous studies and discuss potential hadronic UHE emission from the PWN. In our modeling, most of the spindown luminosity of the pulsar may be transformed into thermal particles or relativistic protons.","Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are bubbles of nonthermal electron/positron pairs powered by the rotational energy of pulsars(Gaensler & Slane, 2006). Electrons (hereafter, we do not distinguish positrons from electrons unless stated otherwise) are accelerated to ultra-relativistic energies at the termination shock (TS) and give rise to broadband radiations from radio to TeV or even PeV gamma-ray bands, via the synchrotron radiation and the inverse Compton (IC) radiation of the electrons. The Boomerang nebula is fueled by one of the most powerful pulsars detected so far, i.e., PSR 2229+6114, which boasts a spindown luminosity of L_{s}=2.2\times 10^{37}\,erg/s. The pulsar is suggested to be located at about 800 pc away from Earth 111The distance to the Boomerang nebula is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 0.8 kpc (Kothes et al., 2001) to 7.5 kpc (Abdo et al., 2009), though some evidence suggests it is likely around 2-3 kpc (Halpern et al., 2001b). On the other hand, the molecular clouds found in the complex seem to have a different spatial distribution, with the location coincident with the tail region in our line of sight based on CO observations Kothes et al. (2001). , based on the velocity of the HI emission as reported by Kothes et al. (2001) and the other parameters we used are listed in Table 1. It is spatially coincident with the northeast part of an asymmetric radio nebula G106.3+2.7 (Joncas & Higgs, 1990), which may be a supernova remnant (SNR) (Pineault & Joncas, 2000), although the physical connection between the Boomerang nebula and G106.3+2.7 has not been concretely established. The entire complex consists of a compact, bright “ head” in northeast around the pulsar, and an elongated, dimmer “tail” extending toward the southwest, as shown by both the nonthermal radio and X-ray emissions (Pineault & Joncas, 2000; Liu et al., 2020; Ge et al., 2021; Fujita et al., 2021; Pope et al., 2024), as shown in Fig. 1. The intensity of the X-ray emission in the head region decreases with the distance from the pulsar and the spectrum also exhibits a softening trend as the distance increases. The spatial evolution of such properties of the X-ray emission suggests that the emission may originate from the synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons accelerated in the PWN, which are essentially powered by the pulsar (Ge et al., 2021). Figure 1: X-ray Images of the Boomerang nebula. The central-colored part is the combination of the X-ray observation from Chandra and XMM-Newton (Ge et al., 2021). The green circle has a radius of 100” centered at the position of PSR J2229+6114. The two cyan arc marks the approximate boundary between the head (900”) and the tail (1800”) of the SNR in the X-ray band. The white curve outlines the 1.4 GHz radio continuum of the SNR (Pineault & Joncas, 2000). The region roughly represented by a quarter of solid circle extending to the southwest direction is the focus of our model. The same population of electrons can also produce gamma-ray emission via the IC radiation. Indeed, the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) (Acciari et al., 2009; Pope et al., 2024) and the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) (MAGIC Collaboration et al., 2023) have detected very-high-energy (VHE, E>0.1\,TeV) emission from both the tail region and the head region. Ultra high-energy (UHE, E>100\,TeV) emissions have also been detected by High Altitude Water Cherevnkov (HAWC) detector (Albert et al., 2020), Tibet Air Shower Array (AS\gamma) (AS\gamma Collaboration et al., 2021) and Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) (Cao et al., 2021). Particularly, the maximum energy of the LHAASO source, i.e., LHAASO J2226+6057 or correspondingly 1LHAASO J2228+6100u in the first LHAASO catalog (Cao et al., 2024), reaches about 500 TeV. The LHAASO source is extended, spatially overlapping with the Boomerang nebula, and hence part of the UHE emission could in principle originate from the PWN. Note that LHAASO’s measurement on the Crab Nebula has demonstrated that young, energetic PWN is capable of accelerating PeV electrons and emitting PeV photons (LHAASO Collaboration et al., 2021). A key condition constraining the UHE emission from the PWN is the magnetic field. The ratio between the IC emissivity and the synchrotron emissivity of the same electron population is roughly proportionally to that energy density ratio between the radiation field and the magnetic field. If the PWN has a strong magnetic field, the IC radiation would be sub-dominated. Kothes et al. (2006) suggested a very strong magnetic field of B=2.6\,mG inside the Boomerang nebula, assuming that the break in the radio spectrum is caused by the synchrotron cooling. However, this break could be ascribed to other processes, such as a broken power-law electron spectrum formed in the acceleration process (Pope et al., 2024). Liang et al. (2022) studied this issue by modeling the X-ray intensity and photon index profiles, and obtained a weaker magnetic field of B=140{\rm\mu G} based on a simplified one-zone assumption. This magnetic field is, however, still quite strong (i.e., the magnetic energy density U_{\rm B} is much higher than the background radiation energy density U_{\rm ph}), leading to an expected IC flux orders of magnitude lower than the synchrotron radiation. Besides, the synchrotron radiation is very efficient with such a high magnetic field, and therefore only \sim\bf 10^{-4} of the spin-down energy needs to be converted into the electron energy in order to explain the X-ray flux. This value is atypical among PWNe, as the value of \eta_{e} is usually found to be between 0.01 to 1 in previous modeling of other PWNe (Chevalier, 2000; Mayer et al., 2013; de Oña Wilhelmi et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023). With a dynamical PWN evolution model, Pope et al. (2024) explained the X-ray spectrum of the nebula assuming a larger distance of 7.5 kpc for the pulsar. However, Pope et al. (2024) did not take into account the radial profiles of X-ray intensity and photon index in the modeling, and hence it is not clear whether the spatial evolution of the X-ray emission can be reproduced with the employed parameters. In this work, we aim to reproduce both the spectrum and radial profiles of the X-ray emission in the head region with a dynamic PWN model. We will consider various particle transport scenarios, including convection-dominated, convection-diffusion, and diffusion-dominated transports. We constrain critical PWN parameters such as the magnetic field, and estimate the UHE emission of electrons accelerated in the nebula. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the dynamic PWN model is briefly reviewed in Section 2. We present the fitting result for the SED and radial profiles in Section 3. In Section 4, we estimate the UHE gamma-ray emission generated by IC radiation of electrons.

This is observed to happen at roughly one third of the theoretical expectations. Various solutions have been proposed, the most notable of which is the addition of a yet unknown source of heat in the upper layers of the crust, below the burning envelope. In this paper we ran several simulations using the 1D code MESA to explore the impact of opacity on the threshold mass accretion rate after which the bursts disappear, finding that a higher than expected opacity in the less dense layers near the surface has a stabilizing effect.","In binary systems hosting a neutron star and a small mass star, when the companion expands to fill its Roche lobe mass can be transferred to the compact object via an accretion disk. Under the right conditions, especially mass accretion rate, the accreted fuel on the neutron star surface will burn unstably, producing X-ray flashes known as the Type I bursts (see e.g. Strohmayer & Bildsten, 2010). The fluid begins burning in the upper layers, but the cooling proceesses are able to compensate the heating due to the nuclear reactions. As the fluid sinks deeper under the push of newer accreted layers, the burning rate increases, especially due to the increase of temperature. When the cooling cannot compensate the reaction rate anymore, the burning turns explosive and initiates the burst (e.g. Fujimoto et al., 1981; Bildsten, 1998a). Depending on the accretion rate, the first unstable ignition could be due to hydrogen or helium, and the burst can have a larger or smaller amount of hydrogen left to burn at its later stages (Fujimoto et al., 1981; Bildsten, 1998a). Above a certain accretion rate bursts are suppressed because the fluid never reaches unstable burning conditions. To date, one of the persistent discrepancies between theory and observations of Type I X-ray bursts is the critical accretion rate \dot{M}_{\rm{crit}} above which bursts are suppressed. While observations indicate \dot{M}_{\rm{crit}}\approx 0.3\dot{M}_{\rm{Edd}} (Cornelisse et al., 2003; Watts & Maurer, 2007; Galloway et al., 2008; Galloway & Keek, 2021), numerical simulations employing different codes indicate \dot{M}_{\rm{crit}}\approx 1 to 3\dot{M}_{\rm{Edd}} (Bildsten, 1998b; Heger et al., 2007; Fisker et al., 2007), where \dot{M}_{\rm{Edd}} is the Eddington accretion rate. One proposed mechanism to keep the burning layer stable is the presence of a heating source injecting up to a few MeV per baryon at densities of 10^{7} g cm-3 or above, the so called shallow heating (Brown & Cumming, 2009; Wijnands et al., 2017), which is currently of unknown origin. Several explanations or alternatives have been proposed over the years, as for instance modification to the CNO break out 15O(\alpha,\gamma)19Ne (Cooper & Narayan, 2006; Davids et al., 2011), diffusion of 4He or rotation effects (Piro & Bildsten, 2007; Keek, L. et al., 2009; Inogamov & Sunyaev, 2010; Cavecchi et al., 2020). In this note we show that it is possible to suppress the bursts in numerical simulations at the observed mass accretion rate by modifying the opacity. Our results indicate that this is achievable if the opacity in the layers between the surface and the ignition depth is \gtrsim 8 times the electron scattering opacity expected to dominate at these depth."

The effective chiral Lagrangian for kaon-baryon and kaon-kaon interactions is utilized within chiral symmetry approach in combination with the interaction model between baryons. For the baryon-baryon interactions, we adopt the minimal relativistic mean-field theory with exchange of scalar mesons (\sigma, \sigma^{\ast}) and vector mesons (\omega, \rho, \phi) between baryons without including the nonlinear self-interacting meson field terms. In addition, the universal three-baryon repulsion and the phenomenological three-nucleon attraction are introduced as density-dependent effective two-body potentials.The repulsive effects leading to stiff equation of state at high densities consist of both the two-baryon repulsion via the vector-meson exchange and the universal three-baryon repulsion. Interplay of kaon condensates with hyperons through chiral dynamics in dense matter is clarified, and resulting onset mechanisms of kaon condensation in hyperon-mixed matter and the equation of state with the (Y+K) phase and characteristic features of the system are presented.It is shown that the slope L of the symmetry energy controls the two-baryon repulsion beyond the saturation density and resulting stiffness of the equation of state. The stiffness of the equation of state in turn controls admixture of hyperons and the onset and development of kaon condensates as a result of competing effect between kaon condensates and hyperons. The equation of state with the (Y+K) phase becomes stiff enough to be consistent with recent observations of massive neutron stars. Static properties of neutron stars with the (Y+K) phase are discussed such as gravitational mass to radius, mass to baryon number density relations, and density distribution in the core with the (Y+K) phase for typical masses of neutron stars.","It has been a long standing issue to clarify properties of various phases, phase structures, and equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting matter at high density and/or high temperature based on underlying quantum chromodynamics (QCD) baym2018 . Condensation of Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons in strongly interacting system, which may be realized in dense hadronic matter such as inner core of neutron stars, has been paid much attention as unique exotic phases. Historically pion condensation (PC) has been considered extensively from both theoretical and observational points of view, although its existence has not yet been established sawyer1972 ; migdal1978 ; baym1979 ; kmttt1993 . Subsequently, a possible existence of kaon condensation (KC), the Bose-Einstein condensation of K^{-} meson, has been suggested kn86 ; t88 ; mt92 ; m93 ; mtt93 ; tpl94 ; kvk95 ; lbm95 ; lee1996 ; prakash1997 ; tstw98 ; fmmt1996 . While a driving force of PC is the p-wave \pi-nucleon (N) interaction, KC is realized by making use of the s-wave K-nucleon (N) interaction kn86 ; t88 ; mt92 : the s-wave scalar interaction simulated by the KN sigma term \Sigma_{KN} and the s-wave vector interaction corresponding to the Tomozawa-Weinberg term. The former is the explicit chiral symmetry breaking term and is larger than the \pi N sigma term reflecting the relatively large breaking of SU(3) flavor symmetry as compared to SU(2) case. The strength of the latter is specified by the V-spin charge, Q_{V}^{b} \equiv\frac{1}{2}\left(I_{3}^{(b)}+\frac{3}{2}Y^{(b)}\right) for baryon b with I_{3}^{(b)} and Y^{(b)} being the third component of the isospin and hypercharge, respectively, and it works attractively for the nucleon sector (1 for p and 1/2 for n). Thus meson-baryon dynamics specified by chiral symmetry is responsible to formation and properties of such meson-condensed phases baym1979 ; kmttt1993 ; kn86 ; t88 ; mt92 . It has also been shown that weak interactions relevant to rapid cooling mechanisms of neutron stars via enhanced neutrino emissions in the presence of meson condensates can be considered in a universal framework based on chiral symmetry maxwell1977 ; t88 ; bkpp1988 ; fmtt1994 . Since the possible existence of kaon condensation in neutron stars was suggested, researches on deeply bound kaonic nuclear states have been promoted in the context of strangeness nuclear physics where \bar{K} mesons are involveday02 ; yda04 ; ynoh2005 ; agnello2005 ; zs2013 ; bbg2012 ; ghm2016 . The possibility of multi-antikaonic nuclei, where several kaons are embedded in nuclei, and their connection to kaon condensation in neutron stars have been discussed mmt2009 ; mmt2014 ; gfgm2009 . Pertinent kaon dynamics in nuclear medium has also been extensively studied with reference to experiments with meson beams at J-PARC, with heavy-ion collisions at GSI and so forth bbg2012 ; hj2012 ; ghm2016 ; tolos2020 ; song2021 . Formation of basic kaonic clusters, “K^{-}pp”, has been reported in the E27 and E15 experiments at J-PARC, and their production mechanisms and structures have been elucidated ichikawa2015 ; sada2016 ; a2019 ; yamaga2020 ; sekihara2016 . It has been shown that the EOS with KC is largely softened at high densities tpl94 ; fmmt1996 . In general, the softer EOS makes neutron stars more compact leading to reduce both the maximum gravitational mass and its radius. Following the results concerning the softening of the EOS with KC, static and dynamic properties of kaon-condensed neutron stars have been elucidated; effects of KC on mass-radius relations of compact stars, formation of mixed phase of kaon condensates immersed in the normal phase due to the first-order phase transition g2001 ; mtvt2006 , and a low-mass black hole scenario by a delayed collapse of hot neutron stars to kaon-condensed stars bb1994 are such examples. The delayed collapse of protoneutron stars has also been studied by taking into account thermal effects and neutrino degeneracy ty1998 ; pons2000 . Since massive neutron stars as large as 2 M_{\odot} (M_{\odot} being the solar mass) was detected demo10 ; ant13 ; c2020 , precise measurements of mass and radius of neutron stars have been made possible by the development of observational facilities. From X-ray observation by Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) riley2019 ; miller2019 , the mass and radius for the pulsar PSR J0740+6620 has been detected as R = (12.35\pm0.75) km for M = 2.08 M_{\odot} miller2021 and R = (12.39{}^{+1.30}_{-0.98}) km for M = (2.072 {}^{+0.067}_{-0.066}) M_{\odot} riley2021 . Multi-messenger observations of gravitational waves from neutron-star mergers (GW170817) abbott2018 , electromagnetic waves from a gamma-ray burst and kilonova emission have brought about important information on the EOS of dense matter margalit2017 ; horowitz2018 ; shibata2019 . Toward understanding a realistic form of hadronic matter, we investigated a possible coexistence of KC and hyperons Y (Y=\Lambda, \Sigma^{-}, \Xi^{-}, \cdots) in the ground state of neutron-star matter [abbreviated to (Y+K) phase ] m2008 ; mmtt2019 ; mmt2021 . In the (Y+K) phase, softening of the EOS results from combined effects of decreasing energy by the s-wave K-baryon (B) attraction and avoiding the N-N repulsion at high densities by hyperon admixture nyt02 . Although the onset density of KC is in general pushed up to a higher density in the hyperon-mixed matter than the case of nucleon matter ekp95 ; kpe95 ; sm96 , the energy gain becomes large once KC occurs in the hyperon-mixed matter. In Ref. m2008 , both kaon condensates and hyperon-mixing give large energy gain, leading to a local minimum of the energy with respect to \rho_{\rm B}, which suggests self-bound objects with (Y+K) phase. However, such EOS including the local energy minimum cannot reproduce massive compact stars as large as 2 M_{\odot}, so that the self-bound star with (Y+K) phase is unlikely to exist. Most of the other works on coexistent phase of KC and hyperon-mixed matter were not able to exceed the maximum mass as large as 1.85 M_{\odot} m2008 except for the case of density-dependent relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory, where specific density-dependence of the coupling constants between mediating mesons and baryons are assumed cb2014 ; ts2020 ; mbb2021 . Whereas roles of nuclear three-body force have been considered in case of kaon condensation in neutron-star matter zuo2004 ; Li2006 , a large part of softening effect of the EOS with the (Y+K) phase comes from mixing of hyperons which necessarily appear at high densities nyt02 , and the resulting problem associated with the dramatic softening is known as the “hyperon puzzle” nyt02 ; burgio2021 . In order to resolve the hyperon puzzle and to make the EOS reconcile with the recent observations of massive neutron stars, introduction of the universal three-baryon repulsion (UTBR) among not only nucleons (NNN) but also hyperons and nucleons (YYY, YYN, YNN) on an equal footing has been shown to be indispensable nyt02 . Subsequently there appeared several works taking into account three-body and multi-body forces between baryons such as multi-pomeron exchange potential yamamoto2014 ; yamamoto2017 and baryon-meson (M)M, MMM type diagrams in the RMF models to12 . Further the \Lambda N and \Lambda NN interactions have been studied by the use of the diffusion Monte Carlo method lonardoni2015 . Recently, theoretical approaches in the chiral effective field theory (\chiEFT) have been applied for the YNN interaction petschauer2020 ; kohno2018 . As for \Lambda in matter, a possibility of the strongly repulsive \Lambda potential at high density and resulting suppression of the \Lambda-mixing has been suggested with reference to the \chiEFT kohno2018 ; gkw2020 ; jinno2023 . It has also been pointed out that the \Lambda-suppression at high densities is consistent with the \Lambda directed flow data in heavy-ion collisions nara2022 . Therefore there is still controversy about the \Lambda potential at high densities. It is expected that the problem is to be resolved by forthcoming hypernuclear experiments taskforce2022 . In this paper, we base our B-B interaction model on the RMF theory, where \Lambda hyperons necessarily appear at \rho_{\rm B} = (2.5-3.0) \rho_{0} with the nuclear saturation density \rho_{0} (= 0.16 fm-3). In the early stages of a series of our works, we considered the (Y+K) phase by the use of the interaction model where K-B and K-K interactions are described by the effective chiral Lagrangian (abbreviated to ChL) and the B-B interactions are given by exchange of mesons [\sigma, \sigma^{\ast} (\sim\bar{s}s) for scalar mesons, \omega, \rho, \phi (\sim\bar{s}\gamma^{0}s on the assumption of an ideal mixing between \omega and \phi mesons) for vector mesons] in the RMF with the nonlinear self-interacting (NLSI) meson fields mmtt2019 ; mmt2022 ; bb77 . The NLSI terms generate many-baryon forces through the equations of motion for the meson mean fields. However, they are introduced solely to reproduce the ground state properties such as the incompressibility and slope of the symmetry energy around the saturation density. It has been shown that the NLSI terms are not relevant to repulsive energy corresponding to the UTBR leading to the stiff EOS at high densities and that it cannot be compensated with large attractive energy due to the appearance of the (Y+K) phase mmt2022 . In order to keep from the significant softening of the EOS with the (Y+K) phase, we have proposed another prescription for introducing the UTBR. We adopt the RMF model for two-body B-B interaction mediated by meson-exchange, removing the NLSI meson potentials. We call this model a “minimal RMF” (abbreviated to MRMF) throughout this paper. Instead of the NLSI terms, we introduce the density-dependent effective two-body potentials for the UTBR, which has been derived from the string-junction model by Tamagaki t2008 (SJM2) and originally applied to Y-mixed matter by Tamagaki, Takatsuka and Nishizakitnt2008 . Together with the UTBR, phenomenological three-nucleon attraction (TNA) has been taken into account, and we have obtained the baryon interaction model that reproduces saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) together with empirical values of incompressibility and symmetry energy at \rho_{0}. In addition, by specifying the slope L of the symmetry energy within an acceptable range, we set stiffness of the EOS coming from two-baryon repulsion (Two-BR) through the vector meson exchange. Then we have investigated the (Y+K) phase based upon the ChL coupled with this baryon interaction model (MRMF+UTBR+TNA) mmt2021 . It has been shown that the EOS and the resulting gravitational mass and radius of compact stars with the (Y+K) phase are consistent with recent observations of massive neutron stars. In this paper, we further elucidate the onset mechanisms of KC in hyperon-mixed matter and the EOS with the (Y+K) phase in detail with the use of the (ChL+MRMF+UTBR+TNA) model, following up the results of Ref. mmt2021 . Primary points of view being addressed in the paper are interplay between KC and hyperons through chiral dynamics in dense hadronic matter and combined effect of the UTBR and Two-BR on the stiffness of the EOS at high densities. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, chiral symmetry approach for kaon condensation based on the effective chiral Lagrangian is introduced. The “K-B sigma terms” are estimated by taking into account of the nonlinear effect with respect to the strange quark mass beyond chiral perturbation in the next to leading order. In Sec. III, the MRMF is explained in meson-exchange picture for B-B interaction. In addition, the UTBR (SJM2 as a specific model) and TNA are introduced phenomenologically. Section IV gives description of the ground state for the (Y+K) phase: energy density expression for the (Y+K) phase, together with classical field equations for KC and meson mean fields, and ground state conditions. In Sec. V, the results on the properties of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter with our interaction model are given, prior to the results on KC in hyperon-mixed matter. The dependence of the EOS on the slope L is also discussed. Section VI is devoted to the description of pure hyperon-mixed matter, which is followed by the discussion of kaon properties in hyperon-mixed matter and onset of KC. In Sec. VII, results of the ground state properties of the (Y+K) phase and the EOS are given. In Sec. VIII, static properties of neutron stars with the (Y+K) phase are discussed with the results such as gravitational mass to radius, mass to baryon number density relations, and density distribution in the core with the (Y+K) phase for typical masses of neutron stars. Summary and concluding remarks are given in Sec. IX. In Appendix X A, the expressions of the baryon masses and the K-B sigma terms are given by the use of the Feynman-Hellmann theorem for the effective chiral Lagrangian. In Appendix X B, the expressions for the s-wave on-shell K-N scattering lengths are given in order to determine the coefficients of the range terms and coupling constants associated with the \Lambda (1405). The expressions for quantities related to saturation properties in SNM, i. e. the incompressibility, the symmetry energy, and the slope L of the symmetry energy, are given in Appendix X C."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09814v1,Quantum Criticality in Black Hole Scattering,"The Teukolsky equation describing scattering from Kerr black holes captures a few important effects in the process of binary mergers, such as tidal deformations and the decay of ringdown modes, thereby raising interest in the structure of its solutions. In this letter we identify critical phenomena emerging in the corresponding phase space. One special point exists in this phase space, where the black hole is extremal and the scattered wave lies exactly at the superradiant bound, at which the physics simplifies considerably. We provide an indirect realization of a conformal symmetry emerging at this configuration, which leads to its interpretation as a critical point. Away from the critical point conformal symmetry is broken, but it is shown that critical fluctuations continue to be dominant in a wide range of parameters and at finite black hole temperatures. As in quantum many-body systems, the physics in this regime is described exclusively by the temperature and a set of critical exponents, therefore leading to robust predictions that are unique to the Kerr metric.","Over the past decade, a number of remarkable discoveries in black hole physics have been made. Since the first direct detection of gravitational waves emitted from a compact binary merger in 2015 Abbott et al. (2016), the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has cataloged about a hundred events. On a different front, in 2019 the EHT telescope captured the first-ever image of a black hole in the center of the M87 galaxy Akiyama et al. (2019), and a next-generation experiment is already underway Ayzenberg et al. (2023). The immense technological and experimental progress has led to a strong theoretical effort aiming to produce robust and qualitative predictions for black holes, a goal which remains a challenging problem despite a rich scientific history. Identifying symmetry breaking patterns has proven to be a very useful paradigm in addressing similar challenges in almost all areas of physics. Spontaneous symmetry breaking in particle physics and critical phenomena in condensed matter physics are some of the most well-known manifestations of this paradigm. In black hole physics, patterns of symmetry breaking have been studied with respect to ”regional” spacetime symmetries such as the near-horizon symmetries of (near-)extreme Kerr Bardeen and Horowitz (1999); Guica et al. (2009) and the near-ring symmetries associated with the black hole’s photon ring Hadar et al. (2022); Kapec et al. (2023), as well as hidden symmetries arising in different energy limits Maldacena and Strominger (1997); Castro et al. (2010); Charalambous et al. (2021, 2022); Hui et al. (2022a, b). In this letter we would like to report on a different type of symmetry breaking pattern that occurs in the space of configurations. Of particular interest in this context is the Teukolsky equation, which describes linear perturbations over the Kerr metric with mass M and angular momentum parameter a Teukolsky (1973). The Teukolsky equation captures a variety of effects involved in the dynamics of rotating black holes. Some examples include tidal effects during the inspiral phase of a binary merger and quasi-normal mode decay in its ringdown phase. In the eikonal limit, the Teukolsky equation also captures the physics of the photon ring. Figure 1: The phase diagram of perturbations around Kerr black holes. In the two-dimensional space of configurations spanned by the Hawking temperature and the parameter \displaystyle g\equiv a\omega, (1) there is a special point where the black hole is extremal and g is equal to \displaystyle g_{c}\equiv\frac{m}{2}, (2) corresponding to the superradiant bound. Here \omega and m are the energy and azimuthal number of the perturbation. At this point the radial part of the Teukolsky equation simplifies considerably as it reduces to the confluent hypergeometric equation Starobinsky (1973); Starobinskii and Churilov (1973); Teukolsky (1973); Press and Teukolsky (1973); Teukolsky and Press (1974); Bredberg et al. (2010); Hartman et al. (2010). We provide an indirect realization of a conformal SO(1,2) symmetry arising in this configuration. The emergence of conformal symmetry at zero temperature is reminiscent of the Quantum Critical Point (QCP) in quantum many-body systems Sachdev (2011); Hartnoll et al. (2018). At non-zero temperatures conformal symmetry is broken. However, the scaling behavior implied by the critical point gives rise to a wide range at finite temperatures in which the physics is dominated by critical fluctuations. This region is known in condensed matter physics as the Quantum Critical Regime (QCR). We depict the phase diagram describing these phenomena in figure 1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09781v1,Changing Look AGN: An X-ray Look,"To date, a number of changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known. We studied, in detail what happens to the X-ray spectrum during the CL events using the example of the nearby CL Seyfert NGC 1566, which was observed by Swift, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku. We applied the Comptonization model to describe an evolution of NGC 1566 X-ray spectra during outbursts and compared these results with a typical behavior for other AGNs to identify some differences and common properties that can ultimately help us to better understand the physics of the CL phenomenon. We found that changes in the X-ray properties of NGC 1566 are characterized by a different combination of Sy1 (using 1H 0707–495 as a representative) and Sy2 properties (using NGC 7679 and Mrk 3 as their representatives). At high X-ray luminosities NGC 1566 exhibits the behavior typical for Sy1, and at low luminosities we see a transition of NGC 1566 from the Sy1 behavior to the Sy2 pattern. We revealed the saturation of the spectral indices, \alpha for these four AGNs during outbursts (\alpha_{1566}\sim 1.1, \alpha_{0707}\sim 2, \alpha_{7679}\sim 0.9 and \alpha_{mrk3}\sim 0.9) and determined the masses of the black holes (BHs) in the centers of these AGNs namely, M{}_{0707}\sim 6.8\times 10^{7} M⊙, M{}_{7679}\sim 8.4\times 10^{6} M⊙, M{}_{mrk3}\sim 2.2\times 10^{8} M⊙ and M{}_{1566}\sim 2\times 10^{5} M⊙, applying the scaling method. Our spectral analysis shows that the changing-look of NGC1566 from Sy1.2 to Sy1.9 in 2019 was accompanied by the transition of NGC 1566 to an accretion regime which is typical for the intermediate and highly soft spectral states of other BHs. We also find that when going from Sy2 to Sy1, the spectrum of NGC 1566 shows an increase in the soft excess accompanied by a decrease in the Comptonized fraction (0.1<f<0.5), which is consistent with the typical behavior of BH sources during X-ray outburst decay. Our results strongly suggest that the large diversity in its behavior observed among CL, Sy1, and Sy2 AGNs with different X-ray luminosities can be explained by changes in a single variable parameter, such as the ratio of the AGN’s X-ray luminosity to its Eddington luminosity, without any need for additional differences in Sy AGN parameters, such as its inclination, thereby blurring the distinction between the Sy1, Sy2 and CL-AGN subclasses.","Recent detections of numerous changing-look active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN) events have led to a surge of interest in the study of this phenomenon. The origin of the CL-AGN events is still unclear. NGC 1566 galaxy is a prominent representative of the CL-AGN subclass of AGNs. Its supermassive black hole (SMBH) is estimated to be (1.3\pm0.6)\times 10^{7} M⊙. As the closest galaxy (z=0.005, see also Table 1) among the CL-AGNs, NGC 1566 has been intensively studied over the past 70 years. It was first classified as a Seyfert 1 (Sy1) with the broad Hα and Hβ lines (de Vaucouleurs & de Vaucouleurs, 1961). The Hβ line was later found to be weak, leading to the source being classified as Seyfert 2 (Sy2) (Pastoriza & Gerola, 1970). This is consistent with the generally accepted classification of AGN as Sy1 or Sy2, depending on the presence or absence of broad optical emission lines. The existence of different classes of AGN can be explained using a unified model (Antonucci, 1993), based on the orientation of an optically thick torus relative to the line of our vision. However, NGC 1566 exhibits the appearance or disappearance of broad optical emission lines, transitioning from Sy 2 (or Sy 1.8–1.9) to Sy 1 (or Sy 1.2–1.5) and vice versa within a few months (da Silva et al., 2017), and does not fit into the generally accepted classification and constitutes a significant problem in our understanding of AGN. Since 2018, observations of NGC 1566 have been carried out in many wavelength ranges: from hard X-rays (see X-ray image of NGC 1566 in Fig. 2) to infrared rays (Ducci et al., 2018). It became clear that the NGC 1566 flux varies in all wavelengths. In particular, in July 2018, its flux increased strongly and reached its peak (Parker et al., 2019; Oknyansky et al., 2019, 2020). Long-term light curves of ASAS-SN and NEOWISE showed that the IR and optical flux began to increase as early as September 2017 (Cutri et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2018). The Swift/XRT flux increased by about 30 times (Fig. 1) when the source changed from Sy1.8–1.9 to Sy1.2 (Oknyansky et al., 2020, 2019). The source became Sy1 with an appearance of strong broad emission lines (Oknyansky et al., 2019; Ochmann et al., 2020). Having reached their peak, the source fluxes decreased in all wavebands. Several smaller flares were observed after the main outburst (Grupe et al., 2018, 2019). This 2018–2019 outburst of NGC 1566 with a CL-effect was observed using NuSTAR and XMM-Newton. Jana et al. (2021) investigated these observations applying the power-law, NTHCOMP, OPTXAGNF and RELXILL models with an addition of Gaussian lines and taking into account X-ray absorption effects. Each of these models shed light on the CL-peculiarities and the change in the object itself. In the power-law model, Jana et al. (2021) found the presence of a soft excess (< 2 keV), which they approximated by an additional bbody component. This model fits well the XMM-Newton data for about 2.5 years before the 2018 outburst with parameters N_{H}=(3.53\pm 0.06)\times 10^{21} cm-2 and a photon index \Gamma\sim 1.7 (\Gamma=\alpha-1). Moreover, an iron Kα emission line was detected at 6.4 keV with an equivalent width (EW) of 200 eV. The rise phase of the 2018 outburst was analyzed using simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of NGC 1566, and in this model the fit yielded \Gamma=1.8. The Fe Kα line was detected at 6.38 keV with an EW>110 eV, as well as the Fe XXVI emission feature at 6.87 keV with an EW< 37 eV. It is interesting to note that two ionized absorbers were required to fit the source spectra in the rise phase, one low-ionization absorber (\xi\sim 101.7\pm 0.1) with N_{H,1}=(8.1\pm 2.2)\times 10^{20} cm-2, and one high-ionization absorber (\xi\sim 104.7\pm 0.4) with N_{H,2}=(4.3\pm 0.4)\times 10^{21} cm-2. In the outburst decay phase the photon index was almost constant (\Gamma\sim 1.7), the blackbody temperature was constant kT_{bb}\sim 110 eV and the Fe Kα line was detected with EW > 100 eV. Although column density of the weakly ionizing absorber varied in the range of N_{H,1}\sim(1.2-1.3)\times 10^{21} cm-2, no highly ionizing absorber was required to fit the spectra during the outburst decay. In addition, a weak reflection hump was detected as an excess of emission at energies 15–40 keV. In the NTHCOMP model, Jana et al. (2021) fixed the seed photon temperature at kT_{s}=30 eV. They again needed to account for two absorption components during the outburst rise and initial decay phases. They found that as the corona size R_{cor} decreased, the plasma electron temperature kT_{e} increased from 60 to 100 keV with a nearly constant photon index (\Gamma=1.7-1.9). To model this NGC 1566 outburst with OPTXAGNF Jana et al. (2021) again accounted for two absorption components during the outburst rise and initial decay phases. The photon index \Gamma and optical depth \tau were held almost constant at \Gamma=1.7-1.8 and \tau\sim 4-5 throughout the 2018 outburst. Before this outburst, the Eddington ratio and the size of the X-ray corona were found to be small (L/L_{Edd}\sim 0.04 and R_{cor}=12R_{g}) compared to the rise phase outburst (L/L_{Edd}\sim 0.23 and R_{cor}=43R_{g}). In later observations, they decreased L/L_{Edd}\sim 0.06 and R_{cor}\sim 20R_{g}. This model fit all observations well and indicated an increase in the accretion rate and corona size at the outburst peak, as well as a high degree of the plasma Comptonization during the outburst. The RELXILL model again required taking into account two absorption components during the rising and initial decay phases of the outburst. In addition, the model included the reprocessed X-ray emission from the disk as a reflectivity parameter R_{refl}, which turned out to be relatively weak (R_{refl}\sim 0.1-0.2) throughout the outburst. The inner disk edge R_{in} varied from 4R_{g} to 7R_{g}. Tripathi & Dewangan (2022a), hereafter TD22a also analyzed NGC 1566 using XMM-Newton, Swift and NuSTAR data at different epochs during the decay phase of the 2018 outburst using a broadband continuum model OPTXAGNF (Done et al., 2012) taking into account the thermal Comptonization (THCOMP) and the reflection (RELXILL) model, as well as investigated the correlations between the accretion disk X-ray emission, soft X-ray excess and the power-law continuum. They argued that at low X-ray flux levels, the source soft X-ray excess was absent and only the disk emission provided seed photons for thermal Comptonization in the corona, while at high flux levels, both the soft X-ray excess and the disk emission were present, providing seed photons for the thermal Comptonization in the corona. TD22a found that the X-ray photon index remained constant (\Gamma\sim 1.66-1.72), although the electron temperature of the corona increased from 22 to 200 keV from June 2018 to August 2019. At the same time, the optical depth of the corona \tau decreased from 4 to 0.7, and the scattering fraction increased from 1% to 10%. TD22a interpreted this as an increase in the size of the corona and its heating with a decrease in the mass accretion rate during the decay phase. Different models are used to study AGN, including those specifically designed for AGN (assuming a specific structure of active galactic nuclei) and generalized models (with a minimum number of specific assumptions). The first of these, such as the AGNSED model (Kubota & Done, 2018) and models taking into account the double (warm and hot) corona (Petrucci et al., 2013), consider three zones of AGN X-ray formation: an outer standard disc, an inner warm Comptonizing region (to produce the soft X-ray excess) and a hot corona (see Fig. 10 in Petrucci et al. (2013)). Generalized models such as the BMC (Titarchuk et al., 1997; Titarchuk & Zannias, 1998; Laurent & Titarchuk, 1999; Borozdin et al., 1999; Shrader & Titarchuk, 1996), NTHComp (Zdziarski et al., 1996), Comptb (Farinelli & Titarchuk, 2011), Comptt (Titarchuk, 1994) are based on the first principles and also consider three X-ray formation regions: an outer standard disc, a hot Comptonizing region (a so called Transition layer) to reproduce the soft X-ray excess and a thermal Comptoniziation hump in the source spectrum, and a converging flow region (possibly analogous to a hot corona, to form a hard high-energy tail in the source X-ray spectrum). In this paper, we apply these generalized models to identify the features of CL-AGN compared to Sy1 and Sy2, without assuming a specific geometry of these sources. In addition, for better understanding the properties of NGC 1566 during CL events, it is interesting to compare the behavior of this CL-AGN with other AGNs, such as Sy1 and Sy2. To do this, we used the Sy1 galaxy (1H 0707–495) and the Sy2 galaxy (NGC 7679) to study their differences and similarities during X-ray outbursts in comparison to CL-AGN. The Narrow-Line Sy 1 galaxy 1H 0707–495 (z = 0.0411, hereafter 1H 0707, see also Table 1) is a bright Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy (Leighly, 1999). BH mass estimates in 1H 0707 vary over a wide range from 2\times 10^{6} to 107 M⊙ Zhou & Wang (2005); Kara et al. (2013); Done & Jin (2016). In particular, Zoghbi et al. (2011) assumed that most of the radiation is emitted at \sim 2r_{g} and estimated the inner radius and the emissivity index using their spectral fitting. They interpreting the 30 s lag as the light crossing time and estimated a BH mass of M_{BH}\sim 2\times 10^{6}M_{\odot}, which was consistent with the uncertain mass of this BH quoted in the literature (Zhou & Wang, 2005). NGC 7679 is a barred lenticular galaxy seen face on (Yankulova et al., 2007). It is located at a distance of about 200 million light years from Earth (see also Table 1). It was discovered by Heinrich d’Arrest on September 23, 1864. The nucleus of NGC 7679 turned out to be active and was classified as a Seyfert galaxy. The most common theory for the energy source of Seyfert galaxies is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. NGC 7679 is believed to host a supermassive black hole, with a mass estimated at 5.9\times 10^{6} M⊙ based on velocity dispersion (Alonso-Herrero et al., 2013). The X-ray spectrum of NGC 7679 using BeppoSAX shows no significant absorption above 2 keV, and the Kα line of iron was only slightly detected. However, the galaxy shows signs of obstruction to visual light as it lacks broad emission lines. Two possible reasons: the presence of dust or an X-ray emitting accretion disk that is not covered and the broad line region is covered (Risaliti, 2002a). To date, the classification of NGC 7679 as Sy1 or Sy2 remains controversial. On the one hand, this AGN has an optical spectrum without broad emission lines, which allows it to be classified as a Sy2 (Risaliti, 2002a). On the other hand, NGC 7679 has significant variable X-ray emission, typical of Sy1. The main feature of objects like NGC 7679 is not the strength of their starburst, but the apparent optical faintness of the Sy1 nucleus when compared to the X-ray luminosity. As a second representative of Sy2 galaxies we used Markarian 3 (hereafter Mrk 3), which is one of the brightest and best-studied members of the Sy2 class. The host galaxy is classified as an elliptical or S0 galaxy type. Awaki et al. (1990), Awaki et al. (1991) and Smith & Done (1996) revealed an anomalously flat power-law continuum emerging through a tall occultation column (N_{H}\sim 6\times 10^{23} cm-2) from GINGA observations of Mrk 3. A strong Fe line with high equivalent width (EW\sim 1.3 keV) was also detected. Mrk 3 has the hardest spectrum among all 16 Sy2 galaxies studied by Smith & Done (1996), significantly harder than the spectrum of Sy1 galaxies. In ASCA observations of Mrk 3, the object showed a spectrum with a photon index \Gamma\sim 1.8 and a two-component iron line (Iwasawa et al., 1994). Thus, the dominant component of the Kα iron line at 6.4 keV has EW=0.9 keV, while the second component at 7 keV has EW=0.2 keV. A reanalysis of the spectrum of Mrk 3 using non-simultaneous GiINGA, ROSAT and ASCA observations (Griffiths et al., 1998) covering a wide spectral band (0.1–30 keV) yielded a typical value for the power law, \Gamma\sim 1.7, when either an additional absorption edge at 8 keV (possibly arising from a warm absorber) or reflection was included in the spectral model. Recent observations with BeppoSAX (Cappi et al., 1999), which extend the spectral coverage to 150 keV, indeed confirm a presence of a steep (\Gamma\sim 1.8) internal power law. Turner et al. (1997) also reanalyzed the ASCA data and proposed an alternative model in which the internal continuum is resolved through very large absorption column (N_{H}>10^{24} cm-2), while the reflection component is not obscured. Georgantopoulos et al. (1999) analyzed the RXTE data for Mrk 3 and found an agreement with the earlier results of GINGA. They used a spectral model consisting of a very hard power-law continuum (\Gamma\sim 1.1) modified below \sim6 keV by a strongly absorbing column (N_{H}\sim 6\times 10^{23} cm-2) and an iron line with a high equivalent width at 6.4 keV. Their conclusions are consistent with the results by Turner et al. (1997) on the complex absorption of a molecular torus. It is interesting to note that Boorman et al. (2018) found an anti-correlation between the equivalence width of the narrow core of the neutral Fe K\alpha fluorescence line, ubiquitously observed in the reflection spectra of obscured AGNs, and the mid-infrared continuum luminosity at 12 \mum. This is consistent with numerous studies of the X-ray Baldwin effect for unobscured and slightly obscured AGNs and challenges the traditional view that the Fe K\alpha line originates from the same region as the underlying reflection continuum, which together make up the reflection spectrum. However, the found anti-correlation does not apply to Mrk 3, as Ricci et al. (2015) find a Compton-thin column density (90% confidence level) for this source. Risaliti (2002b) discuss another type of X-ray changing look for AGNs based on changes in column density (from 20% to 80%) during AGN X-ray variability on time scales of months to years. Namely, the AGN switched between thin Compton thin (N_{H}<1.5\times 10^{24} cm-2) and Compton thick (N_{H}>1.5\times 10^{24} cm-2) regimes (see also Matt et al. (2003)). To describe the BH states in AGN during outbursts, it is convenient to use the terminology used to identify the BH states in X-ray binaries (XRBs). Thus, the observed manifestations of BHs in galactic sources are traditionally described in terms of a classification of BH spectral states (see Klein-Wolt & van der Klis (2008); Remillard & McClintock (2006); Belloni et al. (2005), for various definitions of BH states). A general classification of BH states for four main BH states is accepted by the community: the quiescent, the low hard (LHS), the intermediate (IS, sometimes subdivided into Hard intermediate, HIMS, and Soft intermediate, SIMS) and the high soft (HSS) states. When a BH transient goes into an outburst, it leaves the quiescent state and enters the LHS, a low-luminosity state with an energy spectrum dominated by the thermal component of Comptonization combined with a weak thermal component. The photon spectrum in the LHS is thought to be the result of Comptonization (upward scattering) of soft photons, which originated in the relatively weak inner part of the accretion disk, from electrons in the hot surrounding plasma (see, e.g., Sunyaev & Titarchuk (1980)). The HSS photon spectrum is characterized by a pronounced thermal component, which is probably a sign of strong radiation emanating from the geometrically thin accretion disk. The IS is a transition state between the LHS and the HSS. At the same time, the subdivision the IS into SIMS and HIMS states reflects the specifics of a BH source at the entrance and exit from the outburst. As for supermassive BHs in AGNs, despite the different time scale, sizes and sources of accreted matter compared to XRBs, they show a similar pattern of the spectral changes during their outbursts. Therefore, we use the terminology given above, but note that there is, of course, no direct analogy. In addition, the excess soft radiation of AGNs is another component of the Comptonization effect, since the disk temperature of AGNs is much lower. X-ray spectroscopy is a very powerful tool for shedding light on the CL-AGN relationship, mainly because X-rays are emitted closer to the primary emission source than optical emission lines, which are reprocessed emission from interstellar gas (e.g., Terashimai et al. (2009)). In this paper we present the comparative analysis for NGC 1566, 1H 0707–495 and NGC 7679 using the Suzaku, ASCA, Swift and BeppoSAX observations. In §2 we present the list of observations used in our data analysis while in §3 we provide the details of X-ray spectral analysis. We analyze an evolution of X-ray spectral and timing properties during the state transition in §4. In §5 we present a description of the spectral models used for fitting these data. In §6 we discuss the main results of the paper. In §7 we present our final conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09690v1,"A study on late time UV-emission in core collapse supernovae
and the implications for the peculiar transient AT2018cow","Context. Over time, core-collapse supernova (CCSN) spectra become redder due to dust formation and cooling of the SN ejecta. An ultraviolet (UV) detection of a CCSN at late times thus indicates an additional physical process such as interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar material, or viewing down to the central engine of the explosion. Both these models have been proposed to explain the peculiar transient AT2018cow, a luminous fast blue optical transient that has been detected in the UV 2–4 years after the event with only marginal fading over this time period.Aims. To identify if the late-time UV detection of AT2018cow could indicate that it is a CCSN, we investigate if CCSNe are detected in the UV between 2–5 years after the explosion. We determine how common late-time UV emission in CCSNe is and compare those CCSNe detected in the UV to the peculiar transient AT2018cow.Methods. We use a sample of 51 nearby (z¡0.065) CCSNe observed with the Hubble Space Telescope within 2–5 years of discovery. We measure their brightness, or determine an upper limit on the emission through an artificial star experiment if there is no detection.Results. For two CCSNe we detect a point source within the uncertainty region of the SN position. Both have a low chance alignment probability with bright objects within their host galaxies and are therefore likely related to the SNe, both of which are known to be interacting supernovae.Conclusions. Comparing the absolute UV magnitude of AT2018cow at late times to the absolute UV magnitudes of the two potential SN detections, there is no evidence that a late-time UV detection of AT2018cow is atypical for interacting SNe. However, when limiting the sample to CCSNe closer than AT2018cow, we see that it is brighter than the upper limits on most CCSN non-detections. Combined with a very small late time photospheric radius of AT2018cow, this leads us to conclude that AT2018cow’s late-time UV detection was not driven by interaction. It suggests instead that we are possibly viewing the inner region of the explosion, perhaps due to the long-lived presence of an accretion disc. Such properties are naturally expected in tidal disruption models and are less straightforward (though not impossible) in supernova scenarios.","Supernovae (SNe) are the explosive endpoints of the lives of stars. With a steep increase in the number of telescopes built specifically to detect transients (e.g., the Zwicky Transient Facility [ZTF]; Bellm et al. 2019, the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae [ASAS-SN]; Shappee et al. 2014, the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System [ATLAS]; Tonry 2011, the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer [GOTO]; Gompertz et al. 2020; Steeghs et al. 2022), the number of detected SNe has increased significantly. Over the next decade the increase in sample size will accelerate with the commissioning of the Black hole Gravitational-wave ElectroMagnetic counterpart array (BlackGEM; Bloemen et al. 2016) and the Vera Rubin Observatory (Ivezić et al., 2019). There are multiple types of SNe, observationally classified predominantly by the absence or presence of hydrogen in the explosion spectra, Type I and Type II SNe, respectively (Minkowski, 1941). Within Type I SNe there are multiple sub-types, corresponding to different explosion mechanisms and progenitors. Type Ia SNe are caused by a thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf (Nomoto et al. 1984; Woosley & Weaver 1986, and references therein). Their explosion spectra show strong silicon absorption features (e.g., Maguire 2017). Type Ib (Elias et al., 1985) and Ic (Wheeler & Harkness, 1986) are core collapse SNe (CCSNe), which originate from massive stars (M>8M_{\odot}, see Smartt 2009 for a review), that either do or do not show helium in their spectra, respectively. Stars can lose their hydrogen (and helium) envelopes through, e.g., mass transfer due to binary interactions (Podsiadlowski et al., 1992; Eldridge et al., 2008) and/or stellar winds (Vink et al., 2001; Crowther, 2007). Additionally, Type Ic SNe can show very broad lines, called Ic-BL (Modjaz et al., 2016; Sahu et al., 2018), or narrow emission lines (Type Icn; Fraser et al. 2021; Gal-Yam et al. 2022; Perley et al. 2022), while Type Ib SNe sometimes show narrow lines (Type Ibn; Pastorello et al. 2007). SNe Type II are also CCSNe, but as mentioned before, their spectra contain hydrogen. The classes of CCSNe are also sub-divided based on their light curves, besides being classified based on spectral properties. Type II SNe are split into Type IIb which have helium rich spectra (Woosley et al., 1987), IIn which show narrow emission lines in their spectra (Schlegel, 1990), IIL which show a linear decay in magnitude in their light curves, and IIP which show a plateau of approximately constant brightness in their light curves (Barbon et al., 1979; Doggett & Branch, 1985). In this paper, we focus on Type II CCSNe. Besides removing (some of) the hydrogen and/or helium envelope, mass loss in massive stars can lead to a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) around a star. When the SN ejecta interact with this CSM, narrow emission lines will appear in the spectrum, creating Type In or IIn SNe as mentioned before. Mass loss in massive stars can arise through different mechanisms. Besides stellar winds and binary interactions, eruptions can release material from the star (e.g., Smith & Arnett, 2014; Yoshida et al., 2021). The shape and speed of the CSM combined with the speed and energy of the SN ejecta determines the (late-time) evolution of the light curve and spectra of interacting SNe (e.g., Dessart et al., 2015; Ercolino et al., 2024), see Dessart (2024) for a review of interacting SNe. Dessart et al. (2023) showed that for typical red supergiant (RSG) parameters, CSM interaction would predominantly cause extra brightening in the UV and not as much in the optical and infrared. It is therefore most beneficial to study SNe in the UV to constrain the CSM interaction properties. The classification of SN type is based on observational properties, which means it is not always clear cut. It can change over time as emission lines appear and disappear due to e.g., interactions with the CSM. For example, Dong et al. (2024) show that the classification of SN2022cvr changes from a IIb to a Ib over time. There are also works that demonstrate that Type IIP and Type IIL SNe are not two distinct types, but rather a continuum of slopes in the plateau due to different amounts of hydrogen being present (e.g., Anderson et al., 2014; Sanders et al., 2015; Galbany et al., 2016b; Hiramatsu et al., 2021). With the increase in survey cadence and depth of transient surveys, an increase in the number of peculiar transients has also occurred. For example, luminous fast blue optical transients (Inserra, 2019; Metzger, 2022, LFBOTs; e.g,) can spectroscopically look similar to SNe, however, their light curves decay on a timescale that is too fast to be powered by the radioactive decay of nickel. Therefore, they are hard to explain with one of the classical SN models. LFBOTs are a class of transients for which there is no clear consensus on the progenitor model. A ‘naked’ engine model in which there is a CCSN with a small ejecta mass, in which the emission is powered by accretion onto a compact object that has formed during the SN, has been proposed (e.g., Prentice et al., 2018a; Perley et al., 2019; Margutti et al., 2019; Mohan et al., 2020). An alternative model is where the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole is responsible for the emission (e.g., Kuin et al., 2019; Perley et al., 2019; Inkenhaag et al., 2023). A third model invokes interaction between an outflow and a dense CSM to explain the observed properties (e.g., Fox & Smith, 2019; Leung et al., 2020; Xiang et al., 2021; Pellegrino et al., 2022). The prototype of this class of transients is AT2018cow, which was the first of the sample to be discovered in real time (Prentice et al., 2018a; Perley et al., 2019). It is the most nearby of the sample, and combined with the real time detection, this led to an extensive observing campaign. Despite the resulting rich data set, there is no consensus on the progenitor model of this peculiar transient (see e.g., Prentice et al., 2018a; Perley et al., 2019; Margutti et al., 2019; Xiang et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022; Inkenhaag et al., 2023). Other examples of peculiar transients related to SNe are Calcium-strong transients, which are intrinsically faint (e.g., Kasliwal et al., 2012) and super-luminous SNe, which are luminous but rare (e.g., Quimby et al., 2011; Gal-Yam, 2012). The UV light curves of CCSNe decay at a fast rate as the photosphere cools, and the SNe fade away in the UV on a timescale of tens of days (Brown et al., 2009; Pritchard et al., 2014). Therefore, if a SN is detected in the UV beyond this timescale, there is a mechanism involved that extends the duration of the UV emission phase, e.g., shock interaction between the SN ejecta and the CSM (Fransson, 1984; Chevalier & Fransson, 1994). This CSM has been expelled by the progenitor star before the SN explosion, and hence studying the composition of the CSM and the timescale on which the ejecta-CSM interaction happens can help us constrain progenitor models if we detect late-time UV emission. The main goal of this work is to investigate the nature of AT2018cow through comparing the late time UV emission in CCSNe to that of AT2018cow in order to investigate if a CCSN nature of AT2018cow is possible. For this, we use a sample of UV Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images obtained within 5 years of the SN discovery, count how many CCSNe are detected in these images and compare the upper limits and detections to the late-time UV emission of AT2018cow. Late-time UV and/or optical emission in CCSNe can be an indication of interaction of the SN ejecta with CSM (Type IIn SNe; e.g., Quimby, 2006; Ofek et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2007, SN2006gy; Benetti et al., 2010; Newton & Puckett, 2010; Stoll et al., 2011, SN2010jl, Monard et al., 2013, SN2013L;, Brennan et al., 2024, SN2021adxl;), so an important secondary goal is to compare our observations to previously known interacting SNe. This paper is observational in nature, we will not focus on modelling the CSM interaction. In this paper we investigate what fraction of CCSNe is detected in the UV between 2–5 years after the explosion and compare possible detections to the detected properties of AT2018cow. In Section 2 we discuss the sample used and describe the analysis of the sample. This includes obtaining astrometric solutions, measuring the brightness of detected sources and performing an artificial star experiment to determine upper limits in the case of non-detections. In Section 3 we present the results of our analysis. The results are discussed in the context of interacting SNe in Section 4. In this section we also discuss what our results mean for the nature of peculiar transient AT2018cow. In this Manuscript we use H{}_{0}=67.8 km s-1 Mpc-1, \Omega_{\rm m}=0.308 and \Omega_{\rm\Lambda}=0.692 (Planck Collaboration et al., 2016). Magnitudes are presented in the AB magnitude system unless specified otherwise and uncertainties are 1\sigma unless stated otherwise."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09609v1,Effect of viewing angle in Gamma-Ray Burst properties,"The empirical classification of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is based on their distribution in the plane of burst duration and spectral hardness. Two distinct distributions, long-soft and short-hard bursts, are observed in this plane, forming the basis for the long and short classification scheme. Traditionally, this scheme was mapped to two different GRB progenitor classes. However, several recent bursts have challenged this mapping. This work investigates how an observer’s viewing angle relative to the jet axis influences the duration-hardness plane. We simulate single-pulse GRBs using an optically and geometrically thin homogeneous top-hat jet model. Bursts are simulated with an isotropic viewing angle distribution, and we calculate the pulse duration and spectral hardness corresponding to FERMI Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) energy bands. The viewing angle significantly impacts spectral hardness for our assumed broken power-law spectra, while its effect on duration is less pronounced. Our analysis indicates that soft and low-luminous bursts are likely off-axis events. It is possible that some of the fast X-ray transients and X-ray rich GRBs observed by the Einstein Probe and the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) missions originate from off-axis jets.","Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are classified as long and short bursts based on the observed bimodal distribution in their duration. The spectral hardness of the \gamma-ray pulse is found to be correlated broadly with duration, leading to a classification of GRBs as long-soft and short-hard bursts (Kouveliotou et al., 1993). Traditionally, these two classes are directly associated with two distinct progenitor systems where collapsing massive stars lead to long-soft bursts and merging neutron star binaries lead to short-hard bursts. Ideally, one considers that a longer-lasting accretion disk formed by the envelope of the collapsing star can lead to a longer duration burst (Woosley, 1993; Paczyński, 1998) while merging compact objects with a disk of much smaller mass can lead to shorter bursts (Eichler et al., 1989; Narayan et al., 1992; Meszaros & Rees, 1992; Rosswog et al., 1999). However, several recent bursts have challenged this hypothesis (Zhang et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2021; Lü et al., 2022a; Troja et al., 2022; Rastinejad et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2022; Lü et al., 2022b; Du et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024). Studies have indicated that the dividing line between long and short duration GRBs is sensitive to factors such as the detector energy band and burst redshift (Zhang et al., 2007, 2009; Qin et al., 2013; Tarnopolski, 2015), also see (Zhang & Choi, 2008). Relativistic effects can also influence the observed duration and hardness, which is used to explain X-ray flashes (Yamazaki et al., 2002a; Butler et al., 2005; Guidorzi et al., 2009; Urata et al., 2015) and low luminosity GRBs such as GRB 980425 and GRB 031206 (Sazonov et al., 2004; Soderberg et al., 2004; Pescalli et al., 2015a; Patel et al., 2023). The ultra-relativistic bulk velocities of GRB jets cause significant Doppler deboosting of observed flux when directed towards the observer. If there is considerable misalignment between the jet axis and the observer’s viewing angle, relativistic effects reduce the brightness, leading to non-detection unless the burst is highly luminous or nearby. Therefore, most bursts detected are nearly on-axis. However, the probability of detecting an off-axis burst is not negligible if it is energetic, nearby, or both. For example, by modelling a large sample of X-ray afterglows Ryan et al. (2015) inferred that a substantial fraction of bursts are not viewed along the jet axis. To explain the afterglow of the short GRB 140903A Troja et al. (2016) invoked an off-axis GRB model. The presence of relativistic effects in such cases can also change the prompt emission properties, such as the burst duration, hardness, and fluence from what it would have been if observed closer to the jet axis (Yamazaki et al., 2002b, 2003, 2004a; Salafia et al., 2015, 2016). An example of this is GRB170817A, associated with the binary neutron star merger GW170817. The \gamma-ray pulse was short (2.0\pm 0.5), soft (\sim 0.7), and faint ((1.4\pm0.3) \times 10-7erg cm-2) corresponding to an isotropic equivalent energy of 4.17\times1046 erg (Goldstein et al., 2017). Afterglow observations revealed that it was observed at \sim 30^{\circ} off-axis angle (Margutti et al., 2017; Troja et al., 2017; Resmi et al., 2018; Lazzati et al., 2018; Lamb et al., 2019). This confirmed the potential presence of off-axis events in the population of GRBs detected so far. Motivated by this, several authors searched for and reported sub-populations of GBM bursts showing similar properties as GRB170817 (Troja et al., 2018a; Burns et al., 2018; von Kienlin et al., 2019). This paper explores how viewing angle affects the spectrum and light curve of a single pulse GRB. We assume an optically and geometrically thin relativistic shell with co-moving frame emissivity that decays exponentially over time (Woods & Loeb, 1999). We assume a broken power-law shape for the intrinsic spectrum of the pulse. We simulate the duration-hardness plane by varying the parameters of the pulse, such as the characteristic decay time-scale of co-moving frame emissivity, intrinsic spectrum, and the Lorentz factor of the jet. We examine how an off-axis GRB could manifest in the observed population and draw similarities between our simulated population and some recent bursts. We assume a uniform tophat jet in our calculations. However, there is growing observational evidence that both long and short GRBs have complex jet structures (Troja et al., 2018b; O’Connor et al., 2023; Gill & Granot, 2023). In structured jets, where the bulk Lorentz factor and energy per solid angle gradually decrease away from the jet axis, the Doppler de-boosting is less severe, and the variation in burst properties with viewing angle can differ noticeably. In Section 2, we explain the theoretical model. In Section 3, we present the specturm and light curve of a single pulse off-axis GRB and in Section 4 we discuss the simulated population of GRBs. Finally, we summarise our work in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09556v1,Two-temperature treatments in magnetically arrested disk GRMHD simulations more accurately predict light curves of Sagittarius A,"The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) observed the Galactic centre source Sgr A∗ and used emission models primarily based on single ion temperature (1T) general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. This predicted emission is strongly dependent on a modelled prescription of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. The two most promising models are magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states. However, these and nearly all MAD models exhibit greater light-curve variability at 230 GHz compared to historical observations. Moreover, no model successfully passes all the variability and multiwavelength constraints. This limitation possibly stems from the fact that the actual temperature ratio depends on microphysical dissipation, radiative processes and other effects not captured in ideal fluid simulations. Therefore, we investigate the effects of two-temperature (2T) thermodynamics in MAD GRMHD simulations of Sgr A∗, where the temperatures of both species are evolved more self-consistently. We include Coulomb coupling, radiative cooling of electrons, and model heating via magnetic reconnection. We find that the light-curve variability more closely matches historical observations when we include the 2T treatment and variable adiabatic indices, compared to 1T simulations. Contrary to the common assumption of neglecting radiative cooling for the low accretion rates of Sgr A∗, we also find that radiative cooling still affects the accretion flow, reducing the electron temperature in the inner disk by about 10%, which in turn lowers both the average flux and variability at 230 GHz by roughly 10%.","Sagittarius A∗ (Sgr A∗) was discovered as a bright compact radio source in the centre of the Milky Way galaxy (Balick & Brown, 1974; Ekers et al., 1975; Lo et al., 1975). Subsequent observations provided compelling evidence that this object is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) by analysing its proper motion and the dynamics of individual stars in orbit around it (Schödel et al., 2002; Ghez et al., 2003, 2008; Gillessen et al., 2009; GRAVITY Collaboration et al., 2018; Do et al., 2019; GRAVITY Collaboration et al., 2019). More recently, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) presented direct evidence for the presence of this SMBH via imaging of the near-event-horizon regions (\al@SgrAEHTC2017I,SgrAEHTC2017VII; \al@SgrAEHTC2017I,SgrAEHTC2017VII). When the mass accretion rate onto black holes is low (f_{\mathrm{edd}}\equiv\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\mathrm{edd}}\lesssim 10^{-3})111\dot{M}_{\mathrm{edd}}=4\pi GM/(c\kappa_{es}\eta_{\mathrm{NT}}) is the Eddington accretion rate, M is the mass of the black hole, \kappa_{es} is the opacity due to electron scattering, and \eta_{\mathrm{NT}}=0.178 is the radiative efficiency of a thin accretion disk with BH spin a=0.9375 (Novikov & Thorne, 1973). For Sgr A∗ , \dot{M}_{\mathrm{edd}}\approx 0.05M_{\odot}/\mathrm{yr}., it is commonly thought that a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) is formed, such as in the case of Sgr A∗ with the Eddington ratio f_{\mathrm{edd}}\sim[1-100]\times 10^{-8} (e.g. Agol 2000; Bower et al. 2003; Marrone et al. 2007; \al@SgrAEHTC2017V,SgrAEHTC2017VIII; \al@SgrAEHTC2017V,SgrAEHTC2017VIII). This type of flow is considered to be thermally stable and optically thin (Narayan & Yi, 1994; Yuan & Narayan, 2014). RIAFs are collisionless, in the sense that the electron-ion collision timescale is much longer than the accretion timescale, and likely have two distinct temperatures for ions and electrons (Shapiro et al., 1976; Rees et al., 1982; Mahadevan & Quataert, 1997; Quataert, 1998). Most state-of-the-art radiatively inefficient models assume that the accretion structure is governed by ideal general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD; e.g. Gammie et al., 2003). The EHTC so far has employed a fiducial set of GRMHD models of Sgr A∗ that treat the fluid as comprised of single temperature (1T) ions, where the electron density and temperature is not explicitly considered in the evolution equations (EHTC Sgr A∗2017 V). Therefore, the question is raised of how incorporating a two-temperature (2T) treatment would impact the predicted observables from simulations of Sgr A∗. Narayan et al. (1995) proposed an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model for Sgr A∗, where less than 0.1\% of the available accretion energy is radiated. They modelled an accreting plasma with the ions at nearly virial temperature and colder electrons. Later, Yuan et al. (2002) proposed a coupled system of a jet and ADAF with a fixed ion-to-electron temperature ratio R=T_{i}/T_{e} in the jet, which better fit the low-frequency radio emission of Sgr A∗ than an ADAF alone. In the 1T GRMHD simulations explored by the EHTC, the thermal electron distribution function (eDF) is determined using the so-called R(\beta) prescriptions (e.g. Mościbrodzka et al., 2016; Anantua et al., 2020). In regions of the accretion flow where the gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio \beta\neq 1, the electron temperature is approximately independent of \beta. Consequently, T_{e} fluctuates approximately as much as T_{i} (see section 3.5). None of the EHTC models fully satisfy all the constraints from multi-wavelength observations (\al@SgrAEHTC2017II,SgrAEHTC2017V; \al@SgrAEHTC2017II,SgrAEHTC2017V). Light-curve variability at 230 GHz poses a particularly stringent challenge, as nearly all MAD models—and a significant portion of weakly magnetized (SANE) models—exhibit greater variability than seen in historical observations (Wielgus et al. 2022 and references therein). The two most promising MAD models fail only on the variability constraint, possibly attributed to the unknown electron distribution function (eDF). The actual T_{i}/T_{e} depends on microphysical dissipation and radiative processes not captured in ideal fluid simulations. Future models of Sgr A∗ need to incorporate collisionless effects and a more sophisticated treatment of electron thermodynamics, including radiative effects (e.g. Chatterjee et al., 2023). While the physics of electron cooling is well understood, the mechanisms of heating in collisionless plasma remain largely unconstrained. Heating models include prescriptions for weakly collisional MHD turbulent cascades (Howes 2010, H10; Kawazura et al. 2019, K19) and magnetic reconnection mechanisms (Rowan et al. 2017, R17; Rowan et al. 2019, R19). Ressler et al. (2015, 2017) introduced a method to evolve a gas consisting of ions and electrons that share the same dynamics but have independent thermodynamical evolution using the H10 model. Sądowski et al. (2017); Chael et al. (2018); Chael et al. (2019); Liska et al. (2024) implemented this so-called 2T treatment in a GR radiation MHD (GRRMHD) scheme with coupling between gas, radiation, magnetic fields and gravity. When using the R17 model, it was demonstrated that electrons are always cooler than ions and that electron heating is more uniform (Chael et al., 2018). Additionally, the R17 model was favoured in a polarimetric parameter survey of Sgr A∗, comparing H10, K19 and R17 (Dexter et al., 2020). For f_{\mathrm{edd}}\lesssim 10^{-5} and R17 model, a gas mixture consisting of relativistic electrons with an adiabatic index \gamma_{e}=4/3 and non-relativistic ions with \gamma_{i}=5/3 was found (Chael et al., 2018; Liska et al., 2024). As a result, assuming a single fixed value for the gas adiabatic index could also lead to inconsistencies between the total and individual temperatures and pressures. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct a detailed comparison between the evolved T_{e} from 2T GRMHD simulations and the T_{e} calculated using the R(\beta) prescription. A common assumption for Sgr A∗ is that radiative cooling and transport do not have a significant impact on the dynamics. However, recent GRMHD simulations have shown that radiative cooling has an impact when the mass accretion rate is above certain threshold. Building on the pioneering work of (Fragile & Meier, 2009), significant changes in the dynamical evolution and broad-band spectra were found when f_{\mathrm{edd}}\gtrsim 10^{-7}, for a SANE state with electron radiative cooling and fixed T_{i}/T_{e} (Dibi et al., 2012; Drappeau et al., 2013; Yoon et al., 2020). Similarly, variations in T_{i}/T_{e} were identified when f_{\mathrm{edd}}\gtrsim 10^{-7} in a 2T-treatment (Dihingia et al., 2023). For a SANE state, radiation has a negligible effect on either the dynamics or the thermodynamics of the accreting gas when f_{\mathrm{edd}}\sim 2\times 10^{-8} (Sądowski et al., 2017). In a Monte Carlo radiation MHD scheme, where emission, absorption, and scattering are treated probabilistically, radiative cooling was found to affect the spectrum for f_{\mathrm{edd}}\gtrsim 10^{-6} in SANE states (Ryan et al., 2015; Ryan et al., 2017). On the other hand, a MAD state has significantly higher radiative efficiency due to more efficient synchrotron emission, and consequently an increasing T_{i}/T_{e} was found when f_{\mathrm{edd}}\gtrsim 10^{-7} (Liska et al., 2024). However, a detailed analysis of the impact of the 2T treatment on light curve variability at 230 GHz has not been conducted, particularly for a MAD state. In this paper, we simulate a 2T GRMHD MAD state of Sgr A∗ with variable adiabatic index (Ressler et al., 2015; Sądowski et al., 2017), Coulomb coupling (Stepney & Guilbert, 1983), radiative cooling of electrons including synchrotron, bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton (Esin et al., 1997; Yoon et al., 2020). Additionally, we model electron/ion heating via magnetic reconnection (R17) but we do not account for anisotropic thermal conduction along magnetic field lines, as considered in Ressler et al. (2015). Recent studies have incorporated similar or more advanced physics at lower grid resolutions (Chael et al., 2018; Dexter et al., 2020; Ressler et al., 2023). However, an analysis of variability that systematically adds one layer of physics at a time has been lacking. We quantify the variability of the total flux density using the modulation index M_{3}, calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, measured over three-hour intervals. Our results show that the inclusion of 2T treatment, variable adiabatic index, and cooling systematically shifts the M_{3} distribution towards lower variability values at 86, 230, 345, and 1360 GHz. The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 provides the numerical setup for simulations. The results of the impact of including a two temperature treatment, heating, variable adiabatic index, radiative cooling of electrons on the light-curve variability are discussed in Section 3. The conclusions of the study are presented in Section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09394v1,"Towards Multi Energy Neutrino Astronomy: 
Diagnosing Enhanced Circumstellar Material around Stripped-Envelope Supernovae","A novel approach is proposed to reveal a secret birth of enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding a collapsing massive star using neutrinos as a unique probe. In this scheme, non-thermal TeV-scale neutrinos produced in ejecta-CSM interactions are tied with thermal MeV neutrinos emitted from a pre-explosion burning process, based on a scenario that CSM had been formed via the pre-supernova activity. Taking a representative model of the pre-supernova neutrinos, spectrum and light curve of the corresponding high-energy CSM neutrinos are calculated at multiple mass-loss efficiencies considered as a systematic uncertainty. In addition, as a part of method demonstration, the detected event rates along time at JUNO and IceCube, as representative detectors, are estimated for the pre-supernova and CSM neutrinos, respectively, and are compared with the expected background rate at each detector. The presented method is found to be reasonably applicable for the range up to 1 kpc and even farther with future experimental efforts. Potentialities of other neutrino detectors, such as SK-Gd, Hyper-Kamiokande and KM3NeT, are also discussed. This is a pioneering work of performing astrophysics with neutrinos from diverse energy regimes, initiating multi energy neutrino astronomy in the forthcoming era where next-generation large-scale neutrino telescopes are operating.","More than three decades have passed since mankind acquired a means of observing stars and the Universe in a probe other than light, for the first time, at an epoch-making observation of neutrinos from a supernova SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud (Hirata et al., 1987; Bionta et al., 1987; Alekseev et al., 1987). Cosmic observation via neutrinos —neutrino astronomy— has been progressing by recent achievements at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory; confirmation of the astrophysical diffuse neutrino flux (e.g., Abbasi et al., 2021, 2024) as well as observations of neutrino emission from a blazar TXS 0506+056 (Aartsen et al., 2018) and a Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 (Abbasi et al., 2022). One can expect this momentum will be further accelerated by more neutrino telescopes that are planned to be built in upcoming years. They are designed specifically for their own scientific purposes, producing variations in flavor and energy of detectable neutrinos. For instance, liquid scintillation detectors, such as on-going KamLAND (Suzuki, 1999) and upcoming JUNO (Abusleme et al., 2022), have advantages of detecting low-energy (\lesssim10 MeV) electron antineutrinos, while water-based Cherenkov detectors, e.g., IceCube (Aartsen et al., 2017), KM3NeT (Adrián-Martínez et al., 2016) and Super-/Hyper-Kamiokande (Fukuda et al., 2003; Abe et al., 2018), are better to explore high-energy (GeV–PeV) neutrinos with their gigantic size. Utilizing multiple types of detectors would enable us to pursue astrophysics through detection of neutrinos from the same source over the wide energy range, as is practiced in optical survey, i.e., open up an era of multi energy neutrino astronomy. The main scope of this paper is to demonstrate one example of multi energy neutrino astronomy with a special focus on circumstellar material (CSM) around core-collapsing massive stars. Understanding the physical properties of massive stellar outbursts is an important step towards completing stellar evolution theory (e.g., Yoon, 2015). In particular, the mass-loss activity prior to a core-collapse supernova explosion (SN) is imprinted on the physical properties of the CSM, which can contribute to the radiation source of the SN (see, for example, Kiewe et al., 2012; Chevalier & Fransson, 2017; Smith, 2017). Recent developments in transient surveys and rapid follow-up systems have led to an increased awareness of the diversity of the CSM structures inferred from the progenitors of SNe. For example, in the case of the type-Ibn SN iPTF13beo, the mass-loss rate from the progenitor Wolf-Rayet star (WR) was estimated to be about 2\times 10^{-3}M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}, far exceeding the value of about 10^{-6}M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1} predicted by the steady-state star wind (Gorbikov et al., 2014). Standard stellar evolution theory predicts that the mass-loss rate does not increase significantly before the SN explosion (Langer, 2012), so several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increase in the mass-loss rate that deviates from the steady-state wind structure (e.g., Quataert & Shiode, 2012; Shiode & Quataert, 2014; Smith & Arnett, 2014; Fuller, 2017; Wu & Fuller, 2021; Tsuna et al., 2021, 2023; Matsuoka & Sawada, 2024; Ercolino et al., 2024). One possibility is that the huge neutrino luminosity just before the stellar collapse leads to the extreme mass loss at the stellar surface (Moriya, 2014). The mass loss from the core due to the neutrino emission leads to a sudden decrease in the gravitational force. The effect of mass loss due to high neutrino luminosities after the core collapse of a star has been established in Lovegrove & Woosley (2013) and Nadezhin (1980). Moriya (2014) suggested that for massive stars near the Eddington luminosity, the gravitational potential can be significantly reduced because of the neutrino emission shortly before the core collapse, and then the weakened gravitational force leads to the enhanced mass loss. Here, we propose the following strategy for testing hypotheses as a way of determining the origin of the enhanced CSM. First, let us hypothesize that the extreme mass loss is caused by the loss of mass in the central core due to neutrino emission L_{\mathrm{pre}\mathchar 45\relax\nu} just before the explosion of a massive star (predicts the CSM density \rho_{\mathrm{csm}}\propto L_{\mathrm{pre}\mathchar 45\relax\nu}; Moriya, 2014). In the central core of a massive star after the carbon-burning stage, very-high-luminosity thermal neutrino emission (\mathcal{O}(1)\,\mathrm{MeV}) is expected, and if the star is close enough to Earth, its neutrinos can be detected by the latest neutrino detectors several weeks before collapse of the core (Odrzywolek et al., 2004, 2011). Furthermore, it has also been proposed that the high-density CSM formed by the extreme mass loss may interact with the SN shock wave to occur high-energy neutrino emission (predicts L_{\mathrm{CSM}\mathchar 45\relax\nu}\propto\rho_{\mathrm{csm}}; Murase, 2018, 2024). And it has been shown that a high-statistics \mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{TeV} neutrino signal in IceCube is expected even for an ordinary SNe in the Galaxy. Therefore, we can hypothesize that if the dense CSM around a SN progenitor is originally caused by release of pre-SN neutrinos, then there should be characteristic correlation between pre-SN neutrinos and high-energy neutrinos from the same astronomical object (L_{\mathrm{pre}\mathchar 45\relax\nu}\propto L_{\mathrm{CSM}\mathchar 45\relax\nu} in a broad sense). Figure 1: Schematic diagram for the proposed flow of diagnosing the CSM origin with low- and high-energy neutrino detections. When reconstructing the pre-SN neutrino light curve from the observed inverse beta decay events at a detector, systematic uncertainties regarding estimated background, signal detection efficiency, distance estimation, and so on, as well as statistical uncertainty should be considered. This is same for when calculating the expected number of high-energy neutrino events at another detector. The proposed method can be practiced in a self-consistent way with requiring no specific pre-SN neutrino model. In the present work, we propose a novel method to study the origin of the enhanced CSM by detecting low- and high-energy neutrinos at relevant detectors (JUNO and IceCube mainly considered in this paper). Our methodology is schematically illustrated in Figure 1 and each procedure therein is performed as explained below, while we leave detailed descriptions in the corresponding section. (1) Select low-energy neutrino event candidates at a detector and capture the detected number in time. (2) Reconstruct pre-SN neutrino light curve based on the selected event number, expected background, signal detection efficiency, estimated distance to the SN, etc. (3) Reconstruct non-thermal high-energy neutrino light curve using the presented model in this paper. (4) Calculate the high-energy neutrino event rate in time expected at a detector using neutrino cross section, detection efficiency, background, distance to the SN, etc. (5) Perform a statistical test to compare the expected and observed time distributions. A theoretical model used in the procedure (3) is explained in Sec. 2, and the other procedures (1,2,4,5) bridging between theory and experiment are described in Sec. 3. Concluding remarks and discussion are given in Sec. 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09332v1,On the possible contributions of two nearby blazars to the NGC 4151 neutrino hotspot,"Context. The origin of the high-energy astrophysical neutrinos discovered by IceCube remains unclear, with both blazars and Seyfert galaxies emerging as potential sources. Recently, the IceCube Collaboration reported a {\sim}{3}\sigma neutrino signal from the direction of a nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. However, two gamma-ray loud BL Lac objects, 4FGL 1210.3+3928 and 4FGL J1211.6+3901, lie close to NGC 4151, at angular distances of 0.08∘ and 0.43∘, respectively.Aims. We investigate the potential contribution of these two blazars to the observed neutrino signal from the direction of NGC 4151 and assess their detectability with future neutrino observatories.Methods. We model the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of both blazars using a self-consistent numerical radiation code, AM3. We calculate their neutrino spectra and compare them to the measured NGC 4151 neutrino spectrum and future neutrino detector sensitivities.Results. Our models predict neutrino emission peaking at \sim1017 eV for both blazars, with fluxes of {\sim}10^{-12}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{erg\leavevmode\nobreak\ cm^{-2}% \leavevmode\nobreak\ s^{-1}}. This indicates their contribution to the \sim10 TeV neutrino signal observed from the direction of NGC 4151 is minor. While detection with current facilities is challenging, both sources should be detectable by future radio-based neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2’s radio array and GRAND, with 4FGL J1210.3+3928 being the more promising candidate.","More than ten years ago, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory discovered a diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos (IceCube Collaboration 2013), the nature of which still remains elusive. One of the most plausible candidates are blazars, a rare and energetic subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). AGNs are powered by the accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. Blazars, distinguished by their relativistic jets aligned close to our line of sight, are natural candidates for neutrino emitters due to their role as powerful cosmic-ray accelerators. The blazar TXS 0506+056 was the first source associated with high-energy neutrino emission (IceCube Collaboration et al. 2018). IceCube has subsequently detected high-energy neutrino events in spatial and temporal coincidence with increased activity of several other individual blazars, among which are PKS 1424-41 (Kadler et al. 2016; Gao et al. 2017), GB6 J1040+0617 (Garrappa et al. 2019), PKS 1502+106 (Franckowiak et al. 2020; Rodrigues et al. 2021), and PKS 0735+178 (Sahakyan et al. 2022). Recently, the landscape of potential neutrino sources has expanded beyond blazars to include other classes of AGNs. The IceCube Collaboration reported a 4.2\sigma signal from the nearby Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1068 (Aartsen et al. 2020; IceCube Collaboration et al. 2022). Seyfert galaxies, characterized by weak or absent jet activity, represent a distinct class of AGNs. Their coronal activity could produce gamma-ray deficit neutrinos (see e.g., Inoue et al. 2019). This potential has been further supported by additional observational studies (Abbasi et al. 2024a; Neronov et al. 2024; Sommani et al. 2024). The IceCube collaboration has recently announced a {\sim}3\sigma evidence for \sim10 TeV neutrino emission from the direction of another Seyfert galaxy, NGC 4151 (Abbasi et al. 2024a, b). This nearby Seyfert galaxy, located at a distance of d=15.8 Mpc (Yuan et al. 2020), provides an intriguing case study for investigating neutrino emission from Seyfert galaxies. Both corona and jet contributions of NGC 4151 itself to the neutrino signals have been studied in the literature (Inoue & Khangulyan 2023; Murase et al. 2024, but see also Peretti et al. 2023). However, two gamma-ray loud blazars, 4FGL J1210.3+3928 and 4FGL J1211.6+3901, are located 0.08∘ and 0.43∘ respectively from NGC 4151 (Buson et al. 2023; Murase et al. 2024). While 4FGL J1210.3+3928 lies within the 68% confidence region of the neutrino excess attributed to NGC 4151, 4FGL J1211.6+3901 is located between two separated 95% confidence contours (Abbasi et al. 2024b) as shown in Fig. 1. Since blazars have been promising neutrino emitters, there might be a potential contribution from these two blazars to the observed neutrino signal attributed to NGC 4151. In this work, we investigate possible contributions of these nearby blazars to the neutrino excess close to NGC 4151 by numerical modeling of the observed multi-wavelength emission of 4FGL J1210.3+3928 and 4FGL J1211.6+3901. We discuss the detectability of the predicted neutrino flux from the two blazars by next-generation neutrino telescopes. Throughout this paper, we set the cosmological constants as H_{0}=70 km s-1 and \Omega_{\textrm{m}}=0.3. Figure 1: The location of 4FGL J1210.3+3928 and 4FGL J1211.6+3901 with respect to NGC 4151. The black cross, dash-dotted and dotted black lines corresponds respectively to the best-fit location of the neutrino source and its 68% and 95% confidence regions (Abbasi et al. 2024b)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09278v1,"A Recent Supermassive Black Hole Binary in the Galactic Center Unveiled
by the Hypervelocity Stars","Dozens of B-type hypervelocity stars (HVSs) moving faster than the Galactic escape speed have been discovered in the Galactic halo and are produced most likely by the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic Center (GC). However, the velocity distribution and in particular the deficit of the HVSs above 700 km/s is seriously inconsistent with the expectations of the present models. Here we show that the high-velocity deficit is due to the deficiency in close interactions of stars with the SMBH, because an orbiting intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) of about 15,000 Solar mass kicked away slowly approaching stars 50-250 million years ago. The SMBH-IMBH binary formed probably after the merger of the Galaxy with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) dwarf galaxy, and coalesced about 10 million years ago. Afterwards, HVSs with speed up to above 3000 km/s are produced by binary tidal disruptions and the counterparts formed the S-star cluster at the GC.","HVSs in the Galactic halo In Fig. 1, we give our numerical results of the cumulative distributions of velocity (v-CDF) and Galactocentric distance (R-CDF) of HVSs with the model of SMBHB system in empty loss cone regime (see Methods and SI). In order to compare with the observations of the halo HVSs by Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) survey (brown_gaia_2018, ), only the early type main-sequence HVSs with mass \geq 2.5M_{\odot} and Galactocentric distance between 50 kpc and 120\,{\rm kpc} are considered. In Fig. 1, we also give the numerical results of v-CDF and R-CDF for HVSs in the same ranges of stellar mass and Galactocentric distance obtained with both the Hills mechanism in empty loss cone regime and the SMBHB slingshot in full loss cone regime. The v-CDF obtained with the Hills mechanism in empty loss cone regime is consistent with the results obtained by (generozov_constraints_2022, ), which adopted the same observed distributions of the semimajor axis, eccentricity, and mass ratio of stellar binaries of moe_mind_2017 . Fig. 1 shows that the v-CDF and R-CDF of HVSs obtained with both the SMBHB slingshot effect in full loss cone regime and the Hills mechanism in empty loss cone are significantly different from the observations of the HVSs of the MMT sample. However, the v-CDF and R-CDF of HVSs produced by the SMBHB system in empty loss cone regime are significantly different. In particular, the v-CDF shows a deficit of HVSs above a specific velocity associated with the orbit size and mass ratio of the SMBHB. Such a velocity distribution is unique and well consistent with the observations of the halo HVSs. To give quantitive constraints on the parameters of the SMBHB system, we jointly fit the v-CDF and R-CDF of HVSs of the MMT HVS sample with those of the mock samples of the SMBHB model in empty loss cone regime (Methods). Both the observational data with (kreuzer_hypervelocity_2020, ) (MMT+Gaia sample) and without (brown_gaia_2018, ) (MMT sample) the corrections of the Gaia proper motions of the MMT HVS survey sample have been fitted. The results are showed in Fig. 1 and the best fitted parameters are given in Table 1. The best fitted parameters of the SMBHB model for both MMT and MMT+Gaia samples have some differences. Because the tangential velocities of HVSs in the Galactic halo should not be significant (yu2007, ) and the corrections of the Gaia proper motions of the halo HVSs have very large observational uncertainties, here we give the discussions and conclusions mainly based on the results obtained with the MMT sample. Fig. 1 and Table 1 show that both the velocity and Galactocentric distance distributions of the halo HVSs, in particular the deficit of HVSs above 700\,{\rm km/s}, can be well reproduced with the mock HVSs ejected by the SMBHB system in empty loss cone regime when the SMBHB has the mass ratio q_{\rm MBHB}\simeq 3\times 10^{-3}, eccentricity e_{\rm MBHB}\simeq 0.4 (e_{\rm 500}), and semimajor axis a_{\rm MBHB}\simeq 160\,{\rm AU} (a_{\rm 500}) at the look-back time 500\,{\rm Myr}. The best fitted two-body relaxation timescale is about twice (with the MMT HVS sample) or one-third (with the MMT+Gaia sample) of the fiducial value at the SMBH influence radius obtained with the typical Coulomb-logarithmic \ln{\Lambda}=15. Because both the velocity correction of the Gaia proper motions of the halo HVSs and \ln{\Lambda} are in large uncertainties, the results are consistent with the two-body relaxation processes and suggest a weak effect of the massive perturbers (perets_massive_2007, ). In the SMBHB model in empty loss cone regime, about 97.5% the early-type halo HVSs are expected to have velocity below 700\,{\rm km/s} and about 2.5% of them are expected to have velocity above 700\,{\rm km/s}, which is about twenty times less than the expectations of either the Hills mechanism in empty loss cone regime or the SMBHB slingshot in full loss cone regime (see Fig. 1, or (generozov_constraints_2022, )). The probability suggests that only about half a HVS is expected to have velocity above 700\,{\rm km/s} among the observed about 20 late B-type halo HVSs of the MMT sample. During the dynamical interaction with the SMBHB, a loose binary with r_{\mathrm{bt}}\gtrsim a_{\mathrm{MBHB}} would be tidally separated and a tight binary with r_{\mathrm{bt}}\ll a_{\mathrm{MBHB}} would survive and be ejected out without disruption. Our results (Table 1) suggest that about 10% of the expected late B-type halo HVSs are in binary. The results imply that about two hypervelocity binaries (HVBs) would be detected among the 20 halo MMT HVSs and are consistent with the discovery of one candidate of HVB or rejuvenated hyper-velocity blue straggler (edelmann_he_2005, ; gualandris_hypervelocity_2007, ; przybilla_lmc_2008, ; perets_runaway_2009, ; erkal_hypervelocity_2019, ). The Galactocentric distance distribution of the HVSs could give constraints on the variation of the production rate with the lookback time and the results are given in Fig. 2. It shows that the production of the early-type HVSs begins with the start of the star formation of the young stellar population of the NSC at about 500\,{\rm Myr} ago. The production rate increases with the star formation and reaches a maximum of about 10^{-6}\,{\rm HVS\;yr^{-1}} at 150\,{\rm Myr} ago, when the first star formation episode ends schodel_milky_2020 . Thereafter, the production rate decreases with time, following the dynamical relaxation of the young stellar population of the NSC and the orbital evolution of the SMBHB. The early type HVSs are produced mainly by the gravitational slingshot effect until about 12\,{\rm Myr} ago, when the SMBHB is about to coalescence due to the gravitational wave (GW) radiations. After the coalescence of the SMBHB, all the HVSs are produced with the Hills mechanism. During the past about 6\,{\rm Myr}, the tidal disruptions of binaries originating in the CWD give rise to a burst production of early type HVSs of mass \geq 2.5\,{\rm M_{\odot}} with a peak production rate R_{\rm CWD}\simeq 7\times 10^{-6}\,{\rm HVS\;yr^{-1}}."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09248v1,Constraint on Lorentz Invariance Violation for spectral lag transition in GRB 160625B using profile likelihood,"We reanalyze the spectral lag data for of GRB 160625B using frequentist inference to constrain the energy scale (E_{QG}) of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). For this purpose, we use profile likelihood to deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters. This is in contrast to Bayesian inference implemented in previous works, where marginalization was carried out over the nuisance parameters. We show that with profile likelihood, we do not find a global minimum for \chi^{2} as a function of E_{QG} below the Planck scale for both the linear and quadratic models of LIV, whereas bounded credible intervals were obtained using Bayesian inference. Therefore, we can set lower limits in a straightforward manner. We find that E_{QG}\geq 3.7\times 10^{16} GeV and E_{QG}\geq 2.6\times 10^{7} GeV at 68% c.l., for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively. Therefore, this is the first proof of principles application of profile likelihood method to the analysis of GRB spectral lag data to constrain LIV.","The spectral lags of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) have been widely used Desai (2024); Yu et al. (2022); Wei and Wu (2022) as a probe of Lorentz invariance Violation (LIV) ever since this was first proposed more than two decades ago Amelino-Camelia et al. (1998). The spectral lag is defined as the time difference between the arrival of high energy and low energy photons, and is positive if the high energy photons precede the low energy ones. In case of LIV caused by an energy-dependent speed of light, one expects a turnover in the spectral lag data at high energies. Among the plethora of searches for LIV using GRBs, the first work which found a turnover in the spectral lag data was by Wei et al. (2017) (W17, hereafter). This analysis found evidence for a transition from positive to negative time lag in the spectral lag data for GRB 160625B, by using the data from Fermi-LAT and Fermi-GBM. By modeling the time lag as sum of intrinsic astrophysical time-lag and an energy-dependent speed of light, which kicks in at high energies, they argued that this observation constitutes a robust evidence for a turnover in the spectral lag data. Statistical significance of this turnover was then calculated using frequentist, information theory and Bayesian model selection techniques Ganguly and Desai (2017); Gunapati et al. (2022). Using Bayesian inference, lower limits on the quantum gravity energy scale was set at 0.5\times 10^{16} GeV and 1.4\times 10^{7} GeV for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively Wei et al. (2017). These limits were obtained by marginalizing over the astrophysical nuisance parameters. All other analyses searching for LIV using GRB spectral lags have always used Bayesian inference. These include some of our own past works Agrawal et al. (2021); Desai et al. (2023); Pasumarti and Desai (2023). In this work we redo the analysis in Wei et al. (2017) using frequentist inference, where we deal with the nuisance astrophysical parameters using profile likelihood. While the profile likelihood is a “bread and butter” tool in experimental high energy Physics Particle Data Group et al. (2020), until recently it has seldom been used in Astrophysics, where Bayesian inference is commonly used. Recently, however there has been a renaissance in the use of Profile likelihood in the field of Cosmology (see Herold et al. (2022); Campeti and Komatsu (2022); Colgáin et al. (2024); Karwal et al. (2024); Herold et al. (2024) for an incomplete list). In particular it was shown that one reach opposite conclusions for the fraction of Early Dark energy using Profile Likelihood as compared to Bayesian inference Herold et al. (2022). The outline of this manuscript is as follows. We review the basic data analysis done in W17 to search for LIV in Section II. We compare the contrast Bayesian and frequentist parameter estimation highlighting how these methods handle nuisance parameters in Sect. III. Our results and conclusions can be found in Sect. IV and Sect. V respectively."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09195v1,"The origin channels of hierarchical binary black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O1, O2, and O3 runs","We infer the origin channels of hierarchical mergers observed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O1, O2, and O3 runs using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis under a parametric population model. By assuming the active galactic nucleus (ANG) disk and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, we find that NSCs likely dominate the hierarchical merger rate in the universe, corresponding to a fraction of f_{\rm NSC}=0.87_{-0.29}^{+0.10} at 90% credible intervals in our fiducial model; AGN disks may contribute up to nearly half of hierarchical mergers detectable with LVK, specifically f_{\rm det,AGN}=0.34_{-0.26}^{+0.38}. We investigate the impact of the escape speed, along with other population parameters on the branching fraction, suggesting that the mass, mass ratio, and spin of the sources play significant roles in population analysis. We show that hierarchical mergers constitute at least \sim10\% of the gravitational wave events detected by LVK during the O1-O3 runs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is challenging to effectively infer detailed information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of black hole merger parameters if multiple formation channels are considered.","During the first three observing runs, the LIGO (LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al., 2015), Virgo (Acernese et al., 2015), and KAGRA (Somiya, 2012; Aso et al., 2013) (LVK) Collaboration reported nearly a hundred binary compact merger events (Abbott et al., 2019, 2021; The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al., 2021; Abbott et al., 2023a). The majority of binary black hole (BBH) mergers could be explained by first-generation (1G) mergers formed from the collapse of stars. These primarily arise from isolated binary evolution, as well as dynamical formation in young/open star clusters and globular clusters (Mapelli, 2021; Mandel & Farmer, 2022). Others might stem from second (or higher) generation mergers, referred to hierarchical (repeated) mergers (O’Leary et al., 2016; Gerosa & Berti, 2017; Fishbach et al., 2017), which could mainly originate from active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks and nuclear star clusters (NSCs) (Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021; Arca Sedda et al., 2023b), although hierarchical mergers can also occur in globular clusters (GCs) and young massive clusters (YSCs). Because they are less frequent in the latter environments, which strongly depends on the escape speed of their dynamical environments (see e.g., Antonini & Gieles, 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2019; Mapelli et al., 2021; Kimball et al., 2021; Arca Sedda et al., 2023a). Hierarchical mergers can efficiently bridge the pair-instability (PI) mass gap predicted by PI supernovae (Heger et al., 2003) and Pulsational PI supernovae (Woosley et al., 2007; Belczynski et al., 2016), explaining the growth of intermediate-mass black holes (BHs) in dense stellar environments (e.g., Di Carlo et al., 2020b, a; Tagawa et al., 2021; Fragione et al., 2022; González Prieto et al., 2022; Kritos et al., 2023; Di Cintio et al., 2023). In the active phase of galactic nuclei, a high-density gas disk can efficiently capture stellar-mass BHs and facilitate binary formation and mergers (Bellovary et al., 2016; Bartos et al., 2017; Tagawa et al., 2020b). This unique environment leads to distinctive characteristics of BBHs. The BH mass spectrum is expected to undergo hardening due to the orbital alignment of BHs with the AGN disks, which preferentially selects heavier BHs (Yang et al., 2019a). Under accretion, the spin magnitudes of BHs are likely to be higher, with spin directions tending to align or anti-align with the disk (Bogdanović et al., 2007; Tagawa et al., 2020a; Yi & Cheng, 2019; McKernan et al., 2020). Moreover, migration and migration traps efficiently promotes BH hierarchical growth with extreme mass ratio mergers (Yang et al., 2019b; Li, 2022a). NSCs are also efficient sites for the occurrence of hierarchical mergers (Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021). BBHs in NSCs are formed through dynamical pairing, either via exchanges between a binary star and an intruder, or via dynamical encounters of three initially single bodies (Heggie, 1975; Hills & Fullerton, 1980). The remnant of a 1G BBH merger can be retained by the host cluster if the escape speed of the host cluster is larger than its kick velocity. This surviving remnant can then pair up with another BH to form a hierarchical BBH. Therefore, the crucial condition for hierarchical mergers in NSCs is the escape speed of the host cluster—higher escape speeds result in more efficient hierarchical mergers (Gerosa & Berti, 2019; Li, 2022b; Li et al., 2023a). Additionally, the occurrence of relatively symmetric binary for hierarchical mergers may be preferential in NSCs due to mass segregation (Pavlík & Vesperini, 2022). As a result, the difference in hierarchical mergers lies in the presence of additional changes in the mass and spin of BHs in NSCs compared to those in AGN disks. This implies that the mass and effective spin distributions of hierarchical mergers in AGN disks are higher than those in NSCs (Li et al., 2023a). Regarding the mass ratios of hierarchical mergers, unequal-mass pairings are favored in AGN disks, represented by the hierarchical branch of NG+1G mergers (NG refers to the BH generation), while in NSCs, relatively equal-mass pairings are still favored, represented by the hierarchical branch of NG+NG mergers. In addition, it is generally agreed that the efficiency of BH hierarchical growth in AGN disks may be higher than in NSCs (e.g., Yang et al., 2019b; Li et al., 2023a), although it depends on several parameters that are currently unknown. These parameters include the formation channel of NSCs, the real structure and dynamics of an AGN disk, the possible existence of migration traps, the presence of a supermassive BH in the NSC, and the dynamical evolution of the NSC and its co-evolution with the surrounding environment (Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021; Arca Sedda et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023b). Primarily focusing on 1G mergers, previous research has examined the branching fractions of their isolated binary evolution or cluster channels for BBH mergers (Zevin et al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2023; Iwaya et al., 2023; Vaccaro et al., 2024). However, some of the BBH mergers detected by LVK might be hierarchical mergers originating from dynamical channels, such as AGN disks and NSCs. In this study, our objective is to infer the branching fractions of the AGN disk and NSC channels for hierarchical mergers. Our focus is on investigating the population parameters (see Table 1) that influence branching fractions, which suggests that effectively inferring information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of BBH merger parameters presents a significant challenge."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09143v1,Particle Acceleration via Transient Stagnation Surfaces in MADs During Flux Eruptions.,"Context. In an accreting black hole, the appearance of a stagnation surface within the magnetized funnel has been analytically and numerically retrieved. However, in the complex physical environment during a flux eruption event, this situation may change drastically.Aims. In this study, we focus on the simulation of accretion processes in Magnetically Arrested Disks (MADs) and investigate the dynamics of plasma during flux eruption events.Methods. We employ general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and search for regions with a divergent velocity during a flux eruption event. These regions would experience rapid and significant depletion of matter. For this reason, we monitor the activation rate of the floor and the mass supply required for stable simulation evolution to further trace this transient stagnation surface.Results. Our findings reveal an unexpected and persistent stagnation surface that develops during these eruptions, located around 2-3 gravitational radii ({\rm r_{g}}) from the black hole. The stagnation surface is defined by a divergent velocity field and is accompanied by enhanced mass addition. This represents the first report of such a feature in this context. The stagnation surface is (7-9\,\,{\rm r_{g}}) long. We estimate the overall potential difference along this stagnation surface for a supermassive black hole like M87 to be approximately \Delta V\approx 10^{16} Volts.Conclusions. Our results indicate that, in MAD configurations, this transient stagnation surface during flux eruption events can be associated with an accelerator of charged particles in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. In light of magnetic reconnection processes during these events, this work presents a complementary or an alternative mechanism for particle acceleration.","AGN-launched jets are powerful energy sources that lie in the center of galaxies. They are considered to originate from a black hole and are fueled by an accretion disk surrounding them (Blandford et al., 2019). Magnetic fields play a key role in the jet formation, as jets are thought to be launched in connection to the accumulation of the magnetic flux that threads the event horizon (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2023, 2024). These field lines will rotate in the same direction as the black hole and provide the energy required for these jets as Poynting flux via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism (Blandford & Znajek, 1977), as confirmed by GRMHD simulations (Komissarov, 2004; Tchekhovskoy et al., 2011) and observed in nature in radio galaxies such as M 87 (Lu et al., 2023) and 3C 84 (Paraschos et al., 2023, 2024). Figure 1: Illustration of how a stagnation surface appears during flux eruption events. On the left panel, the funnel is displayed during normal evolution. On the right panel, the disk is expelled forcing the plasma in the boundary of the jet to follow a different trajectory that can disconnect it from the inner funnel, ultimately resulting in the production of a transient stagnation surface (red). However, unlike other compact objects (Muslimov & Harding, 1997), the black hole cannot provide the funnel with plasma. Quickly, all particles will either get accreted or ejected as an outflow, leaving it empty with no way of dynamically replenishing the plasma, since disk material field lines do not enter the jet region. In this case, the ideal fluid approximation will break-down, introducing E_{\parallel}\equiv\@vec{E}\cdot\@vec{B} which will accelerate non-thermal particles to high energies (Levinson & Rieger, 2011). In nature, the mass replenishment is associated with physical processes that are able to create a substantial amount of electron-positron pairs within the funnel. For example, photons that are radiated from the accreting disk, are candidates for photon-photon collisions (Kusunose & Mineshige, 1996; Vincent & Lebohec, 2010; Mościbrodzka et al., 2011). Other mechanisms include particles that land within the funnel from the boundary of the jet. These are particle-particle interactions, or a combination of both particle-photon interactions. In a more complex case, a pair cascade process (see for example Blandford & Znajek 1977) will be initiated and produce \gamma-ray emission. This process takes place until the electric field is completely screened. This region can be recognized as a magnetospheric gap. These gaps have been frequently associated with fast \gamma-ray variability of AGNs (see, for example, Levinson & Rieger, 2011; Aleksić et al., 2014; Katsoulakos & Rieger, 2018; Petropoulou et al., 2019; Chen & Yuan, 2020). In GRMHD simulations, certain regions are stabilized by manually resupplying each cell with the necessary plasma to maintain simulation stability (McKinney, 2006). Recently, Chael (2024) introduced a combination of Force-Free and GRMHD solutions that are being smoothly connected from the wind region to the highly magnetized funnel, which however a priori assumes that the funnel region is filled with the required plasma. For M87, a magnetically arrested disk (Narayan et al., 2003) is considered the most likely scenario (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2021), where frequent magnetic reconnection events in the equatorial plane are believed to be responsible for high energy radiation (Hakobyan et al., 2023; Stathopoulos et al., 2024). In this work we use GRMHD simulations to investigate the consistent and periodic appearance of a transient stagnation surface during the flux eruption events of a MAD system. They are defined as surfaces with a divergent velocity field. We further assist our efforts by monitoring the floor activation that takes place mainly inside the funnel. The paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2 we introduce the general idea of how we expect these stagnation surfaces to be formed, in Sect. 3 we discuss the methods employed, in Sect. 4 we discuss the results and finally conclude in Sect. 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09135v1,Fast Radio Bursts and Interstellar Objects,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient radio events with millisecond-scale durations, and debated origins. Collisions between planetesimals and neutron stars have been proposed as a mechanism to produce FRBs; the planetesimal strength, size and density determine the time duration and energy of the resulting event. One source of planetesimals is the population of interstellar objects (ISOs), free-floating objects expected to be extremely abundant in galaxies across the Universe as products of planetary formation. We explore using the ISO population as a reservoir of planetesimals for FRB production, finding that the expected ISO-neutron star collision rate is comparable with the observed FRB event rate. Using a model linking the properties of planetesimals and the FRBs they produce, we further show that observed FRB durations are consistent with the sizes of known ISOs, and the FRB energy distribution is consistent with the observed size distributions of Solar System planetesimal populations. Finally, we argue that the rate of ISO-neutron star collisions must increase with cosmic time, matching the observed evolution of the FRB rate. Thus, ISO-neutron star collisions are a feasible mechanism for producing FRBs.","Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are gigahertz radio-emitting, millisecond-timescale transient events. First detected in 2007 (Lorimer et al., 2007), a large catalogue has been assembled by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al., 2021). The majority of known FRBs are extragalactic (Mannings et al., 2021), with only one yet known in the Milky Way (Bochenek et al., 2020; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al., 2020). They exist in a wide range of host galaxies and local environments, but remain sparse: the inferred volumetric FRB rate for events above a threshold energy of 10^{35}\mathrm{~{}erg} is (7^{+9}_{-6})\times 10^{7}\mathrm{\,Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}} (Bochenek et al., 2020). Two types are known: single (one-off) events, and repeating FRBs. One of the many (cf. Platts et al., 2019; Zhang, 2020) proposed mechanisms to produce an FRB is a collision between a planetesimal and a neutron star (NS), initially suggested by Geng & Huang (2015). Though neutron stars have been found to have planetary systems bound to them (Wolszczan & Frail, 1992), the radiation mechanism of Geng & Huang (2015) is specifically for unbound planetesimals, colliding on radial trajectories, as bound planetesimals are expected to interact differently (Brook et al., 2014). Dai et al. (2016) and Bagchi (2017) invoked the mechanism of Geng & Huang (2015) to explain repeating FRBs as NS undergoing frequent encounters in debris disks around other stars. However, the feasibility of this scenario producing repeating FRBs at the rate observed is debated (Smallwood et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2024). Nevertheless, non-repeating FRBs may still be generated by NS-planetesimal collisions, if impacts can occur at a suitable rate in free space. In this work we consider the collisions between NS and interstellar objects (ISOs). An expected feature of planet formation (McGlynn & Chapman, 1989), ISOs are planetesimals unbound from the planetary systems they formed in (’Oumuamua ISSI Team et al., 2019) with a density of 10^{15}~{}\mathrm{pc}^{-3} in the Solar neighbourhood (Do et al., 2018) and a total number of \sim 10^{27} across the Milky Way, and two discovered so far: 1I/ ‘ Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. We first quantify the ISO-NS collision rate and consider its implications (Section 2). We then use the radiation mechanism of Dai et al. (2016) to compare the observed durations and energetics of FRBs to the sizes of ISOs (Section 3). Finally in Section 4 we discuss testable implications of FRBs being produced by ISO-NS collisions, and challenges with scaling the ISO-NS collision rate with the FRB event rate."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09119v1,Geminga: A Window of the Role Played by Local Halo in the Cosmic Ray Propagation Process,"An emerging commonality among the recently observed pulsar halos is the presence of distinct radiation patterns at high energies, while no extended radiation is detected around the GeV energy band. This commonality suggests that pulsar halos play a crucial role in the local propagation of cosmic rays, making it necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. This work focuses on the 3D propagation study of cosmic rays, incorporating the Geminga pulsar into our propagation model to investigate its contribution to different observational spectra. We consider Geminga a dominant local source of positrons, successfully reproducing the observed positron spectrum and multi-energy spectra of the Geminga halo. Through calculations of signal and background at different angles, we find that: (1) at low energies, the slow diffusion characteristic around the pulsar region leads to a low electron density in the extended area around Geminga, causing the background radiation to exceed the signal intensity far; (2) at high energies, the larger effective diffusion radius of high-energy electrons/positrons causes the signal from Geminga to dominate the local high-energy phenomena; (3) the observed fluctuation of diffuse gamma-ray radiation by LHAASO is likely due to the incomplete subtraction of radiation from the local halo. We hope LHAASO will detect more cosmic ray halo sources to validate our model further.","As cosmic ray observation experiments enter an era of precision, traditional cosmic ray propagation models cannot predict some finer spectral structures. For instance, primary CR spectra exhibit a spectral hardening at high energies. Data from AMS-02 reveals that the CR spectra above several hundred GeV deviate from a simple power law, displaying a spectral hardening, a phenomenon now confirmed across various experimental platforms (Aguilar et al., 2021; An et al., 2019; Atkin et al., 2018). Secondary CR spectra also harden at this energy range, and their spectra are steeper than those of primary CRs beyond this energy. The latest observations by DAMPE further confirm an excess in the secondary-to-primary flux ratio of CRs at high energies (Dampe Collaboration, 2022). To explain these observations, a spatially dependent CR propagation model has been developed. In contrast to conventional models that assume uniform propagation of CRs across the Galaxy, we propose the following: (1) CR propagation depends on the local distribution of matter (Guo & Yuan, 2018; Guo et al., 2016; Evoli et al., 2012); (2) local CR sources act as both a potential well, confining local CRs, and a barrier, impeding external CRs from penetrating these regions (Yao et al., 2024; Nie et al., 2024; Tomassetti, 2012); and (3) local CRs primarily consist of two components—component A, comprising CRs accelerated from distant sources and diffused into the region, which dominates at low energies, and component B, consisting of CRs from local sources, which dominate at high energies (Yao et al., 2024; Nie et al., 2024). High-energy phenomena in the Galactic vicinity are thus predominantly driven by local sources. This propagation model effectively accounts for the observed CR spectral features. However, observations of diffuse gamma-ray emissions in the Galaxy and extended emissions from local CR sources may provide further validation of this propagation framework. Gamma-ray extended emissions observed near pulsars confirm the existence of regions around them that exhibit slower diffusion relative to the interstellar medium (ISM). Since the morphology of pulsar halos follows the spatial distribution of their parent electrons/positrons, they serve as ideal probes for studying local CR propagation in the Galaxy. Observations of extended radiation from pulsars at different energy bands provide an opportunity to test our model. Recently, the Milagro Collaboration (Abdo et al., 2009), High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) (Abeysekara et al., 2017), HESS (H. E. S. S. Collaboration et al., 2023). and Fermi-LAT (Di Mauro et al., 2019) have all revealed radiation from the Geminga halo. Notably, the Milagro Collaboration reported gamma-ray radiation from the Geminga direction extending over 2 degrees and spanning the energy range of 1-100 TeV. This observation was confirmed by HAWC, which detected extended gamma-ray emissions coincident with the position of Geminga. However, a decade-long analysis of Fermi-LAT data indicates no significant extended emission beyond the Geminga region in the 10-500 GeV energy range (Quattrociocchi et al., 2019; Xi et al., 2019). Therefore, we believe that local CR halos play a crucial role in the propagation of CRs in the Galaxy, and investigating the mechanisms that generate the observability of pulsar extended emissions at different energy bands is essential. This work focuses on the observations of radiation spectra from different energy bands in the Geminga halo, made by Fermi-LAT and HAWC, as well as the distribution of diffuse gamma rays near Geminga observed by LHAASO, and the measurement of cosmic-ray positrons by AMS-02. These observations constrain the injection and diffusion of cosmic-ray particles in the Geminga halo and allow us to investigate the observability of extended radiation from the Geminga halo across different energy ranges. We aim to test the proposed spatially dependent cosmic-ray propagation model. The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the diffusion of electrons/positrons in the pulsar halo; Section 3 discusses our results; and Section 4 provides a summary and outlook for future work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09106v1,Time-integrated polarizations in GRB prompt phase via the Multi-window interpretation,"Aims. The multi-window observations, including the light curve and the evolutions of the spectral peak energy (E_{p}), the polarization degree (PD) and the polarization angle (PA), are used to infer the model parameters to predict the time-integrated PD in gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt phase.Methods. We select 23 GRBs co-detected by Fermi/GBM and polarization detectors (i.e., GAP, POLAR and AstroSat). In our multi-window fitting, the light curve, E_{p} curve, PD curve and PA curve are interpreted simultaneously under the synchrotron radiation model in ordered magnetic fields (i.e., the aligned-fields case and the toroidal-fields case).Results. For the bursts with abrupt PA rotations, the predicted time-integrated PD of the aligned-fields case roughly matches the corresponding observed best fit value, while it is higher for the toroidal-fields case. For the bursts without abrupt PA rotation(s), the predicted PDs of the aligned-fields case and the toroidal-fields case are comparable and could interpret the observational data equally well. For GRB 170206A, its observed time-resolved and time-integrated PDs are comparable and both smaller than our predicted upper limits in ordered magnetic fields. So mixed magnetic fields, i.e., the magnetic fields with both ordered and random components, should be reside in the radiation regions of this burst. Except 1 out of the total 23 bursts, the predicted time-integrated PDs, which are around \sim 44\% for the aligned-fields case and around 49\% for the toroidal-fields case, are consistent with the corresponding observed values. Therefore, consistent with the former study, the models with synchrotron radiation in ordered magnetic fields could interpret most of the current polrization data within 1\sigma error bar.","Although there had been decades after gamma-ray burst (GRB), which is the most catastrophic event in the universe, was first discovered, their origin is still indebate. The light curves of the GRBs show rich diversity, which adds the difficulty in finding their physical origin. However, the spectrum of the GRBs is often described by the Band function (Band et al., 1993), which is a broken power law, smoothly jointed at (\alpha_{B}-\beta_{B})E_{p}/(2+\alpha_{B}), where E_{p} is the peak energy of the \nu F_{\nu} spectrum and \alpha_{B} (\beta_{B}) is the low-energy (high-energy) spectral index of the photon number flux. Observationally, there are mainly two kinds of the peak energy evolution patterns, i.e., the hard-to-soft and intensity-tracking patterns (Liang & Kargatis, 1996; Ford et al., 1995; Kaneko et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2010, 2012, 2018). And the origin of the Band function is also mysterious. Three popular models are involved to interpret the observations of GRB prompt phase (Narayan et al., 1992; Paczynski & Xu, 1994; Rees & Meszaros, 1994; Thompson, 1994; Eichler & Levinson, 2000; Mészáros & Rees, 2000; Giannios, 2008; Zhang & Yan, 2011). In the scenario of the internal shock and the magnetic reconnection models, the radiation mechanisms are both the synchrotron emission (Daigne et al., 2009; Lan et al., 2021a; Giannios, 2008; Zhang & Yan, 2011). However, it is the multiple inverse-Compton scatterings in the high-energy gamma-rays for the photosphere model (Thompson, 1994; Lundman et al., 2018; Parsotan et al., 2020). Since all three models could explain the observed light curves and energy spectra in GRB prompt phase, these models and hence their corresponding radiation mechanism can not be distinguished by the traditional observations. Polarization, as a new window, is very sensitive to the radiation mechanism, magnetic field configuration (MFC) in the radiation region and the geometry (Waxman, 2003; Granot, 2003; Rossi et al., 2004; Lazzati, 2006; Toma et al., 2009; Lan et al., 2021b; Gill et al., 2021; Guan & Lan, 2023; Sui & Lan, 2024). Therefore, it can be used as a powerful tool to infer these properties of the radiating sources. Because of the depolarization due to the multiple scatterings, the predicted polarization degree (PD) is roughly 0 in the gamma-ray band for the photosphere model (Lundman et al., 2018; Parsotan et al., 2020; Parsotan & Lazzati, 2022). However, the predicted time-integrated PD can be as high as (40-50)\% for the synchrotron model in an ordered magnetic field (Toma et al., 2009; Gill et al., 2020, 2021; Guan & Lan, 2023; Sui & Lan, 2024). If the polarization angle (PA) rotates with time (or energy) and/or the magnetic field is mixed 111There are both the ordered component and the random component of the magnetic field (Lan et al., 2019). in the radiation region, there would be a reduction of the time- and energy-integrated PD. So the predicted time-integrated PD can range from 0\% to 50\% for the synchrotron models (Lan et al., 2019; Sui & Lan, 2024). Therefore, the precise PD observations are important in distinguishing the models and hence the corresponding radiation mechanisms during GRB prompt phase. If the gamma-ray emission in GRB prompt phase are unpolarized, the photosphere model survives and the synchrotron model with a totally random magnetic field could also interpret such observations. However, if the PD of the gamma-ray radiation are non-zero, the photosphere model is rejected. The Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimeter (GAP) is a polarization detector to measure the linear polarizations in GRB prompt phase in the energy range of (70 keV, 300 keV) (Yonetoku et al., 2006; Murakami et al., 2010; Yonetoku et al., 2011). POLAR is also a dedicated GRB polarimeter and the linear polarizations were measured in the energy range of (50 keV, 500 keV) (Produit et al., 2018). The Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager on board AstroSat is an in operation GRB polarization detector and its polarization measurement is done in the energy range of (100 keV, 600 keV) (Chattopadhyay et al., 2022). There should be sufficient photons to do polarization analysis, most of the current polarization observations are the time- and energy-integrated results (Yonetoku et al., 2011, 2012; Zhang et al., 2019; Kole et al., 2020; Chattopadhyay et al., 2022). The time-resolved observations are relatively rare and the time-resolved polarization analysis had been done in only 4 GRBs (Yonetoku et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2019; Burgess et al., 2019; Kole et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2019; Chattopadhyay et al., 2022). The number of the bursts detected by the polarization detector GAP is 3 and the averaged best-fit value of the time-integrated PD is 60\% for GAP bursts (Yonetoku et al., 2011, 2012). The observed time-integrated PDs of 15 bursts among the total 20 bursts detected by AstroSat are the upper limits and only 5 bursts are reported with concrete PD values (Chattopadhyay et al., 2022). The averaged best-fit value of the time-integrated PD of these 5 bursts is 57.83\%. There are 14 GRBs with reported polarization detections by the POLAR (Zhang et al., 2019; Kole et al., 2020) and the averaged best-fit value of the time-integrated PD is 17.79\%. The smallest lower limit of the detected time-integrated PD within 1\sigma confidence level is 16\% for GAP bursts and the highest upper limit of the detected PD within 1\sigma is 84\% for POLAR bursts. Since the observational errors are rather large and confidence levels (usually within 1\sigma) are relatively low, the current data are in general not contradict. Recently, time-integrated PDs in GRB prompt phase had been studied by Guan & Lan (2023). They used the observed parameters of the energy spectra to estimate the time-integrated PD, in which the time-resolved information was missed. However, up till now, there are 4 GRBs with time-resolved polarization observations. Among these 4 GRBs, there are 3 bursts with PA rotating abruptly at least once during the burst, which would lead to a reduction of the time-integrated PD. And also the variations of the parameters on the equal arrival time surface (EATS) would also impact the final time-integrated PDs (Sui & Lan, 2024). Therefore, the time-evolution effect should not be neglected in deducing the time-integrated PDs. The parameters are taken as their typical or fiducial values and vary in reasonable ranges to predicted the time-integrated PDs in Sui & Lan (2024). Actually, in addition to the polarization observations, both the observed light curves and energy spectra would put limits on the model parameters. Therefore, in order to predict more precise time-integrated PDs in GRB prompt phase, multi-window interpretations (i.e., the simultaneous interpretation/fitting of the light curve, E_{p} curve, PD curve and the PA curve) are needed. In this paper, the time-integrated PDs in GRB prompt phase are studied via the time-resolved multi-window fitting. The EATS efffect is considered and the time-resolved information is included. The observed PA rotations are recovered during the bursts. More important, most of the key model parameters are inferred from the fitting of the light curves, the energy spectra and the polarization curves. The predicted time-integrated PD for each burst is customized. In Section 2, the data processing is presented. In Section 3, we describe our model. In Section 4, our numerical results are presented. Finally, we give our conclusions and discussion in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09070v1,Origin of the twice {90}^{\circ} rotations of the polarization angle in GRB 170114A and GRB 160821A,"The observed twice abrupt {90}^{\circ} rotations of the polarization angle (PA) in the prompt phase of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are difficult to be understandable within the current one-emitting-shell models. Here, we apply a model with multiple emitting shells to solve this new challenging problem. Two configurations of large-scale ordered magnetic fields in the shells are considered: toroidal and aligned. Together with the light curves and the spectral peak-energy evolutions, the twice {90}^{\circ} PA rotations in GRB 170114A and GRB 160821A could be well interpreted with the multi-shell aligned magnetic fields configuration. Our numerical calculations also show that the multiple shells with the toroidal magnetic field configuration could not explain the observed twice {90}^{\circ} PA rotations. An aligned magnetic field configuration in the GRB outflow usually indicate to prefer a magnetar central engine, while a toroidal field configuration is typically related to a central black hole. Therefore, the magnetar central engines for the two GRBs are favored.","Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most violent bursts in the universe, whose origin is still mysterious. There are two kinds of GRB central engines, i.e., the magnetar and the black hole. The outflow from a magnetar is a stripped wind and the magnetic field configuration (MFC) in the wind is aligned, while the jet from a black hole is powered by Blandford-Znajek mechanism (Blandford & Znajek, 1977) and the MFC in the jet emission region is usually toroidal (Spruit et al., 2001). Generally speaking, both the light curves and the energy spectra would depend on the strength of the magnetic field and are independent of the MFC in the emitting region. Hence, both of them can not be used as a probe of the MFC in the radiation region. In addition to the light curves and the energy spectra, polarizations provide two additional observable quantities, i.e., the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA). The PA rotation could be gradual for the synchrotron radiation in an aligned field, while it would only be abruptly by 90^{\circ} for a toroidal field. Therefore, the PA rotation pattern can be used to test the MFC in the radiation region and the GRB central engine (Lan et al., 2016). Up till now, there has been about 40 bursts with polarization observations in GRB prompt emission (Yonetoku et al., 2011, 2012; Zhang et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2019; Kole et al., 2020; Chattopadhyay et al., 2022). Among these polarization observations, there are only 4 GRBs with time-resolved PA analysis during GRB prompt phase and 3 of them show PA rotations with time, i.e., only about 10\% of the GRBs show PA rotations in GRB prompt phase. As we know, sufficient photon numbers are needed for the polarization analysis, so the small fraction may be due to the lack of the enough photons for the time-resolved analysis. GRB 170114A is a single-pulse burst, and the detailed time-resolved polarization analysis shows that its PA rotates abruptly by \sim{90}^{\circ} twice around the light-curve peak of the prompt phase (Burgess et al., 2019). The one-emitting-shell model with an aligned field in its radiation region could not interpret such abrupt twice 90^{\circ} PA evolutions (Wang & Lan, 2023a). The model with a toroidal field in the emitting region is also problematic because the predicted twice PA rotations are both at the decay phase of the light curves with low flux density (Cheng et al., 2020). Similar to GRB 170114A, the time-resolved analysis shows that PA of GRB 160821A also changes abruptly by {90}^{\circ} twice with one rotation at the rise phase of the light curve and one at decay phase (Sharma et al., 2019; Chattopadhyay et al., 2022). The current models could not interpret such observed twice PA rotations. In this work, we use a multi-emitting-shells model with an aligned field in each shell to explain the twice PA rotations observed in GRB 170114A and GRB 160821A. This paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, our model is presented. In Section 3, we use our model to interpret multi-windows observations, especially the observed twice abrupt PA rotations of the two bursts. Finally, we make our conclusions and discussion in Section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09045v1,Polarization properties of 28 repeating fast radio burst sources with CHIME/FRB,"As part of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) project, we report 41 new Rotation Measures (RMs) from 20 repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) obtained between 2019 and 2023 for which no previous RM was determined. We also report 22 additional RM measurements for eight further repeating FRBs. We observe temporal RM variations in practically all repeating FRBs. Repeaters appear to be separated into two categories: those with dynamic and those with stable RM environments, differentiated by the ratios of RM standard deviations over the averaged RM magnitudes. Sources from stable RM environments likely have little RM contributions from the interstellar medium (ISM) of their host galaxies, whereas sources from dynamic RM environments share some similarities with Galactic pulsars in eclipsing binaries but appear distinct from Galactic centre solitary pulsars. We observe a new stochastic, secular, and again stochastic trend in the temporal RM variation of FRB 20180916B, which does not support binary orbit modulation being the reason for this RM changes. We highlight two more repeaters that show RM sign change, namely FRBs 20290929C and 20190303A. We perform an updated comparison of polarization properties between repeating and non-repeating FRBs, which show a marginal dichotomy in their distribution of electron-density-weighted parallel-component line-of-sight magnetic fields.","Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond bursts of radio waves from extragalactic distances. First discovered by Lorimer et al. (2007), the provenance of these energetic bursts remains a mystery. Polarization analysis of FRBs is a way to obtain observational constraints that can provide important clues on their emission mechanisms and their host environments, hence improving our understanding of the progenitor theories. In the literature, polarimetric information is still relatively rare for FRBs. At the time of writing, polarimetric information is only available for over 100 sources out of the 700+ currently published FRB sources. This is because most of the FRB search programs thus far are conducted using intensity data so polarization analysis is limited to search projects equipped with the capability to trigger raw voltage callback or to repeating FRBs where subsequent follow-up observations collecting Stokes information are possible. The detection of linear polarization implies the possibility of constraining the Faraday rotation measure (RM), which represents the amount of rotation of the polarization position angle of linearly polarized light as it passes through a magneto-ionic medium due to the influence of the magnetic field and the column density of the free electrons along the line-of-sight between the FRB and the observer. Thus far, FRBs have mostly been observed with high linear polarization fraction, although values from 0 to 100% have been reported (see, e.g. Sherman et al., 2024; Pandhi et al., 2024). FRBs have also been seen with a wide range of RM magnitudes, from almost zero to tens of thousands of rad m-2 (Michilli et al., 2018). The observed RM values can shed light on the local environment of the FRB, given the intergalactic medium RM contribution is expected to be small (see, e.g. Amaral et al., 2021). For example, the high RM magnitude of the order of 105 rad m-2 and large temporal RM variations observed for FRB 20121102 may be associated with a turbulent supernova remnant (Marcote et al., 2017). On the other end of the scale, the almost-zero RM observed in FRB 20200120E has been attributed to the clean environment of the host globular cluster (Bhardwaj et al., 2021; Nimmo et al., 2022; Kirsten et al., 2022). Small observed RM values can also be used as an upper bound to constrain the cosmic contribution to the line-of-sight RM and help to probe the magnetization of the cosmic web (Hackstein et al., 2019). The polarization angle (PA; \psi) is the emission angle (geometry) of the linearly polarized component of the light from the FRB source and is typically presented as a function of time during the burst. Diverse PA variations during bursts (for example, sweeping up, down, up and down) have been observed in some FRBs (e.g. FRB 20180301; Luo et al., 2020), with at least one recently reported one-off FRB displaying PA evolution that closely matches the rotating vector model often applied to pulsar measurements (Mckinven et al., 2024). It has been suggested that such diverse variations are consistent with a magnetospheric origin for the FRB radio emission associated with different open magnetic field line regions as the central compact object, possibly a magnetar, rotates, and disfavour synchrotron maser models that predict constant PAs attributed to ordered magnetic fields. However, the fact that both varying and constant PAs have been observed in repeaters and non-repeaters (Luo et al., 2020; Michilli et al., 2018; Masui et al., 2015) in different environments (Feng et al., 2022) also suggests that the PA is intrinsic to the radiation physics of the FRB and might not be a meaningful classifier to distinguish between different repetition behaviors and host environments. Currently, \sim3% of all published FRBs have been seen to repeat111https://blinkverse.alkaidos.cn (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al., 2023). Repeating FRBs allow for the study of temporal variations in the polarization properties. RM variations on timescales of days to years have been detected, potentially pointing to dynamic magneto-ionic environments (Hilmarsson et al., 2021; Mckinven et al., 2023a). A temporal RM sign change in FRB 20190520B indicated a reversal in the direction of the magnetic field lines, where the orbit of a binary star has been proposed as an explanation for the observed polarization properties (Dai et al., 2022; Anna-Thomas et al., 2023). The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a radio telescope located at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO). As a transit telescope, CHIME has no moving parts and scans each sky position within its \sim200 deg2 instantaneous field-of-view with a daily cadence. This makes the FRB search backend of CHIME (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al., 2018) particularly well suited for discovering and subsequently monitoring repeating FRB behavior. At the time of writing, 60 repeating FRBs are reported on the CHIME repeating FRB database222https://www.chime-frb.ca/repeaters (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al., 2019; Fonseca et al., 2020; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al., 2023). Furthermore, CHIME is equipped with a complex voltage recording system (herein referred to as the baseband buffer system) (Michilli et al., 2021), which holds data from the last \sim20 s. FRBs above the detection threshold trigger a call-back data dump from the baseband ring buffer, enabling a polarimetric study of FRBs with high time and frequency resolution. This paper presents the first polarization information for 20 repeating FRBs whose discoveries were initially reported by CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2023) (hereafter CHIME23), which increases the number of repeaters with polarization properties from 18 to 38. We also present updated polarization information for eight repeating FRBs with previously published polarization data. In Section 2, we describe the data set and the analysis techniques. In Section 3, we present the polarization results and discuss the astrophysics implications in Section 4, before concluding in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09013v1,Quark Star Mergers: The Equation of State of Decompressed Quark Matter and Observational Signatures,"Quark stars are challenging to confirm or exclude observationally because they can have similar masses and radii as neutron stars. By performing the first calculation of the non-equilibrium equation of state of decompressed quark matter at finite temperature, we determine the properties of the ejecta from binary quark-star or quark star-black hole mergers. We account for all relevant physical processes during the ejecta evolution, including quark nugget evaporation and cooling, and weak interactions. We find that these merger ejecta can differ significantly from those in neutron star mergers, depending on the binding energy of quark matter. For relatively high binding energies, quark star mergers are unlikely to produce r-process elements and kilonova signals. We propose that future observations of binary mergers and kilonovae could impose stringent constraints on the binding energy of quark matter and the existence of quark stars.","References Bodmer (1971) A.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09002v1,The Fastest Path to Discovering the Second Electromagnetic Counterpart to a Gravitational Wave Event,"The discovery of a second electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave event represents a critical goal in the field of multi-messenger astronomy. In order to determine the optimal strategy for achieving this goal, we perform comprehensive simulations comparing two potential paths forward: continuing the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing run, O4, versus temporarily shutting down the detectors for upgrades before beginning the next observing run, O5. Our simulations incorporate current O4 instrument sensitivities and duty cycles, as well as projected configurations for O5, while accounting for variables such as binary neutron star merger rates, system properties, viewing angles, dust extinction, and kilonova (KN) observables. Our results indicate that a KN discovery would occur 125^{+253}_{-125} days (middle 50% interval) sooner in O5 compared to O4, suggesting that extending O4 would lead to faster discovery if the shutdown period between runs is >4 months. Moreover, for 88% of our simulations, continuing O4 results in earlier KN discovery when compared to the expected two-year shutdown between O4 and O5. Given these findings and the critical importance of avoiding a >10 year gap between first and second electromagnetic counterpart discoveries, we suggest LVK consider extending O4 operations for as long as feasible prior to shutting down for critical upgrades.","The LIGO-Virgo and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations (LVC and LVK, respectively) have discovered, through observations of gravitational waves (GWs), hundreds of compact-binary mergers (Abbott et al., 2019, 2021, 2023, 2024). However, there have only been two binary neutron star (BNS) mergers detected, GW170817 (Abbott et al., 2017) and GW190425 (Abbott et al., 2020). An electromagnetic (EM) counterpart was discovered for GW170817 (Coulter et al., 2017; Lipunov et al., 2017; Soares-Santos et al., 2017; Valenti et al., 2017; Abbott et al., 2017), AT 2017gfo (a kilonova; KN), allowing the community to observe the KN across all wavelengths and over several weeks (Andreoni et al., 2017; Arcavi et al., 2017; Coulter et al., 2017; Cowperthwaite et al., 2017; Díaz et al., 2017; Drout et al., 2017; Evans et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017; Kasliwal et al., 2017; Lipunov et al., 2017; Pian et al., 2017; Pozanenko et al., 2018; Shappee et al., 2017; Smartt et al., 2017; Tanvir et al., 2017; Troja et al., 2017; Utsumi et al., 2017; Valenti et al., 2017). These observations led to major discoveries related to cosmology (Abbott et al., 2017a; Bulla et al., 2022), high-energy astrophysics (Abbott et al., 2017b; Goldstein et al., 2017), gravity (Barack et al., 2019), nuclear physics (Margalit & Metzger, 2017; Lattimer, 2019), and compact object formation (Blanchard et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017). No EM counterpart was discovered for GW190425 (Coughlin et al., 2019; Hosseinzadeh et al., 2019; Lundquist et al., 2019; Antier et al., 2020; Gompertz et al., 2020; Boersma et al., 2021; Coulter et al., 2024; Paek et al., 2024; Smartt et al., 2024). This is in part because the two-dimensional localization was \sim10,183 deg2 (90% confidence), including regions covering the Milky Way plane and near the Sun, making follow-up observations difficult. More critically, most observations were tuned to discover a counterpart similar to AT 2017gfo. Because EM observers lacked access to prompt parameter measurements, especially the chirp mass, they did not expect the high mass of GW190425, which suggests a particularly faint and red KN (Foley et al., 2020), and could not properly adjust their searches to match the expected properties of the KN. Regardless, no EM counterpart to any GW event has been discovered since 2017. As a result, there will be a >7 year gap between the discoveries of the first and second GW counterparts. After the discovery of GW170817, the community expected a relatively high BNS merger – and EM counterpart – discovery rate. Initial measurements of the volumetric BNS merger rates with expected increases in GW detector sensitivity suggested more detections during the third GW observing run (O3); one BNS merger (GW190425) and no EM counterparts were discovered in O3. This excercise was repeated for the current fourth observing run (O4), resulting in predictions of 3_{-3}^{+6} BNS mergers and 1_{-1}^{+4} discoverable KNe, respectively (Shah et al., 2024). Thus far, no BNS mergers nor EM counterparts have been detected in O4. O4 was originally scheduled to conclude at the end of 2024. It has since been extended to June 9, 2025. There is a planned \geq2 year downtime between O4 and the next observing run, O5. If this schedule is kept and no counterparts are detected in the final months of O4, there will be more than a decade gap between GW counterpart discoveries. Such a gap would have severe consequences for the astrophysical and nuclear physics communities that have built human, physical, and software infrastructure to support this science. Here, we ask the simple question: If the goal is to discover a second EM counterpart as quickly as possible, is it better to continue O4 or to shut down, improve the LVK infrastructure, and start O5? The answer depends on the volumetric rate of BNS mergers, the current O4 parameters, the expected O5 parameters, and the length of downtime between O4 and O5. In the following sections, we describe a simulation approach to answer this question (Section 2, Section 3), presenting our results in Section 4. We present conclusions and recommendations in Section 5 and 6 respectively."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09681v1,"X-ray reverberation modelling of the continuum, optical/UV time-lags in quasars","Context. Extensive, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of nearby and higher redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) have shown that the UV/optical variations are well correlated with time delays which increase with increasing wavelength. Such behaviour is expected in the context of the X-ray thermal reverberation of the accretion disc in AGN. Aims. Our main objective is to use time-lag measurements of luminous AGN and fit them with sophisticated X-ray reverberation time-lags models. In this way we can investigate whether X-ray reverberation can indeed explain the observed continuum time lags, and whether time-lag measurements can be used to measure physical parameters such as the X-ray corona height and the spin of the black hole (BH) in these systems.Methods. We use archival time-lag measurements for quasars from different surveys, and we compute their rest frame, mean time-lags spectrum. We fit the data with analytical X-ray reverberation models, using \chi^{2} statistics, and fitting for both maximal and non spinning BHs, for various colour correction values and X-ray corona heights.Results. We found that X-ray reverberation can explain very well the observed time lags, assuming the measured BH mass, accretion rate and X-ray luminosity of the quasars in the sample. The model agrees well with the data both for non-rotating and maximally rotating BHs, as long as the corona height is larger than \sim 40 gravitational radii. This is in agreement with previous results which showed that X-ray reverberation can also explain the disc radius in micro-lensed quasars, for the same corona heights. The corona height we measure depends on the model assumption of a perfectly flat disc. More realistic disc models may result in lower heights for the X-ray corona.Conclusions.","In the last decade, there have been many monitoring, multi-wavelength campaigns with the goal of studying the X-ray/UV/optical variations in active galactic nuclei (AGN). These campaigns are split, broadly speaking, into two categories. The first category includes the intensive monitoring of nearby AGN using the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, AstroSat (to a lesser extent), and in many cases ground based telescopes as well (e.g. McHardy et al. 2014; Edelson et al. 2015; Fausnaugh et al. 2016; Edelson et al. 2017; Cackett et al. 2018; Chelouche et al. 2019; Edelson et al. 2019; Cackett et al. 2020; Hernández Santisteban et al. 2020; Vincentelli et al. 2021; Kara et al. 2021; Donnan et al. 2023; Miller et al. 2023; Kara et al. 2023; Kumari et al. 2023, 2024). Only a few, bright Seyferts belong to this category of intensively sampled observations over a prolonged period of time, albeit their number is increasing. The second category includes long-term monitoring campaigns of quasars, that is AGN which are at higher redshifts and are brighter than their nearby counterparts (e.g. Jiang et al. 2017; Mudd et al. 2018; Homayouni et al. 2019; Yu et al. 2020; Guo et al. 2022; Jha et al. 2022; Homayouni et al. 2022). There are usually many AGN observed during each campaign, but their light curves are not as densely sampled as the ones from the monitoring of the nearby Seyfert galaxies. In all cases, the UV/optical variations are well correlated, with the variations at longer wavelengths being delayed with respect to the variations at shorter wavelengths. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of X-ray reverberation in AGN. According to this hypothesis, some of the photons emitted by the X-ray corona are directed straight to the observer, while the rest are directed towards the accretion disc. A fraction of the latter is ‘reflected’ by the disc in the X-ray range. The remaining fraction is absorbed, increasing the temperature of the disc and the emitted UV/optical flux. Since X-rays are highly variable, the additional disc emission in the UV/optical bands is expected to be also variable, revealing a time lag (with respect to the X-ray), which should increase with wavelength (as observed). This phenomenon is referred to as the disc X-ray thermal reverberation (e.g. Kazanas & Nayakshin 2001; Cackett et al. 2007). In the last few years, we have studied in detail X-ray reverberation in AGN, for instance Kammoun et al. (2021a; hereafter K21a) and Dovčiak et al. (2022). We have been able to successfully fit the time-lags spectra of nearby AGN (Kammoun et al. 2019, Kammoun et al. (2021b; hereafter K21b), Kammoun et al. 2023), the mean and the variable, optical/UV/X-ray spectral energy distribution in NGC 5548 (Dovčiak et al. 2022; Kammoun et al. 2024), and the radial flux profiles in micro-lensed quasars (Papadakis et al. 2022). Additionally, Panagiotou et al. (2020, 2022) utilised the same model to compute model power spectral density function (PSD) in the UV/optical range, and successfully fitted the optical/UV PSDs from the extensive monitoring campaign of NGC 5548. So far, we have studied results from the intensive monitoring campaigns of nearby Seyferts. In this work, we use archival time-lag measurements of high(er) redshift and more luminous AGN, compute their mean time-lags spectrum, and we fit them with the analytical models of K21a and b, considering the modifications recently proposed by Kammoun et al. (2023). Our objective is to investigate whether X-ray reverberation can explain the observed time lags in these objects as well. Our paper is organised as follows: In Sect. 2, we present the archival time-lag measurements that we use in our sample. In Sect. 3 we present the theoretical models we used, while in Sect. 4 we present the results of our analysis. Finally, we summarise and discuss the results and their implications in Sect. 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09528v1,Searching for quantum-gravity footprint around stellar-mass black holes,"According to the asymptotically safe gravity, black holes can have characteristics different from those described according to general relativity. Particularly, they are more compact, with a smaller event horizon, which in turn affects the other quantities dependent on it, like the photon ring and the size of the innermost stable circular orbit. We decided to test the latter by searching in the literature for observational measurements of the emission from accretion disk around stellar-mass black holes. All published values of the radius of the inner accretion disk were made homogeneous by taking into account the most recent and more reliable values of mass, spin, viewing angle, and distance from the Earth. We do not find any significant deviation from the expectations of general relativity. Some doubtful cases can be easily understood as due to specific states of the object during the observation or instrumental biases.","The description of all physical phenomena in the Universe in one unified theory is the ultimate dream of theoretical physics. Despite of decades of theoretical research [1, 2], little has been obtained on the observational/experimental side. Any experimental or observational evidence of quantum gravity remains elusive still today [3]. Today more than ever, it is necessary to find some observational constrain, to try stopping the uncontrolled proliferation of theories. Among the different available variants of quantum gravity theories, asymptotically safe gravity (ASG) could offer some interesting opportunities. First developed by Steven Weinberg [4], it has its pillars on quantum field theory and renormalization group [5, 6]. Most important, it is expected to have observational consequences on astrophysical and cosmological scales [7], and in particular around black holes [8, 9, 10, 11]. For large values of the distance r>>l_{\rm Planck}, where l_{\rm Planck}\sim 1.62\times 10^{-33} cm is the Planck length, the gravitational constant G(r) becomes [9]: G(r)\sim G_{\rm N}\left(1-\frac{\xi}{r^{2}}\right) (1.1) where G_{\rm N}\sim 6.67\times 10^{-8} cm3 g-1 s-2 is the classical gravitational constant, and 0<\xi<1 is the coupling coefficient. The main effect on black holes is a more compact object, although without curvature singularities [10]. A smaller event horizon affects also all the other related quantities such as the photon ring [10], the ergosphere [9] and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit r_{\rm isco} [11]. The effects of ASG should be larger for smaller masses, although the constraint of 0<\xi<1 sets severe limits on them. When the mass of the compact object is much larger than the Planck mass – which is any real case – the critical surfaces of an ASG black hole should not be distinguishable from the classical one according to [8] (see their Fig. 4 and 5). However, [11] suggested that differences up \sim 30% in the r_{\rm isco} are expected in the case of maximally rotating prograde black holes already with a small value of \xi (see his Table I). Moreover, the constraint on \xi was put to question in Eichhorn and Held [10], who claim that values greater than 1, which lead to larger deviations from GR, can be admitted within the framework of the ASG. The same authors also stress that “irrespective of theoretical considerations, any observational avenue to put constraints on deviations from GR, should be explored” [10]. This is also our philosophical approach to the problem, searching for any deviation from GR around black holes. Some attempts have been already made based on X-ray spectroscopy [12, 13, 14], but to date no deviations were found. We focus our study on the search for deviations from the value of the r_{\rm isco} in the case of stellar-mass black holes calculated according to general relativity. Since these objects are the smallest black holes (primordial black holes were never observed to date), the effects of ASG – if any – should be maximized. Anyway, it should be noted that the theoretical minimum mass of a black hole is estimated to be \sim 2.33M_{\odot} [15], which is still \sim 38 orders of magnitude greater than the Planck mass (but remind the above quote by Eichhorn and Held [10]). In addition, since the peak of the emission from the accretion disk is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the compact object, it falls in the X-ray energy band, where are less problems of contamination from the nearby environment. In the case of supermassive black holes, the disk emission peaks in the ultraviolet, where there are contaminations from emission lines of the broad-line region and the host galaxy. As a first step, since we need of observations of black holes in specific states (high/soft, see Sect. 3), we searched in all the available literature for measurements of the inner radius of the accretion disk. Then, we made all the values homogeneous to compare each other."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09322v1,Gravitational wave asteroseismology of neutron stars with unified EOS: on the role of high-order nuclear empirical parameters,"We analyze the sensitivity of non-radial fluid oscillation modes and tidal deformations in neutron stars to high-order nuclear empirical parameters (NEP). In particular, we study the impact of the curvature and skewness of the symmetry energy K_{\rm sym}, Q_{\rm sym}, and the skewness of the binding energy in symmetric nuclear matter Q_{\rm sat}. As we are interested in the possibility of gravitational wave detection by future interferometers, we consider that the tidal interaction is the driving force for the quadrupolar non-radial fluid oscillations. We have also studied the correlations between those quantities, which will be useful to understand the strong physics of gravitational wave phenomena. Our main results show that K_{\rm sym} impacts the frequencies of the fundamental mode mainly for low-mass neutron stars. The NEP Q_{\rm sym} and Q_{\rm sat} affect the fundamental modes of intermediate and heavy neutron stars, respectively. In the case of the first pressure mode, K_{\rm sym} shows a small effect, while Q_{\rm sat} shows a considerable decrease in this oscillation mode independent of the neutron star mass. Similarly, for tidal deformability, the NEP Q_{\rm sat} and Q_{\rm sym} show a bigger impact than K_{\rm sym}. Given the impact of the NEP on gravitational wave phenomena and the currently large uncertainties of these parameters, the prospect of higher sensitivity in future gravitational wave detectors promise a possible new tool to constrain high-order NEP.","The dawn of the multimessenger era has begun with the binary neutron star (NS) merger observation of gravitational waves (GW) Abbott et al. (2017) and its electromagnetic counterpart Cowperthwaite et al. (2017), and it is providing new insights into the nature of matter at extreme conditions. This new and exciting field of research is leading to huge investments all around the globe in the planning of third-generation (3G) interferometers, such as the Einstein Telescope Punturo et al. (2010); Branchesi et al. (2023) and the Cosmic Explorer Hall et al. (2021); Hall (2022), which will observe the Universe by GW at unprecedented distances. The precise modeling of NS and their mergers is a prerequisite to tackling fundamental questions that will be studied by 3G detectors, e.g., the origin of the Universe, NS oscillations, rotational oscillations modes of compact star and the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter. The dense matter EoS is a key ingredient to model NS physics. Describing all the different NS regions within a unified framework is a challenge in view of the very wide range of densities spanned in its different layers. For example at the surface of the star, we can find Fe56 and neighboring elements, on the outer crust the atomic nuclei embedded on a gas of electrons becomes heavier and rich in neutrons until some neutrons start to drip from the nuclei. This marks the beginning of the NS inner crust, where exotic neutron rich nuclei coexist with a neutron (super) fluid Chamel and Haensel (2008). At even more high densities we reach the outer core which is composed of free leptons and nucleons. The composition of the NS inner core is currently unknown, and the modeling of this region can maintain the nucleonic hypothesis or add extra degrees of freedom like hyperons, meson condensates, and quark matter Oertel et al. (2017); Blaschke and Chamel (2018); Somasundaram et al. (2023). Due to the difficulty of constructing an EoS that describes all the NS within an unified approach, specially due to the complexity of the crust physics, a common practice is to match different models for the NS crust and core. It was however shown that the use of non-unified EoS adds extra uncertainties on NS observables, e.g 4\% on radius, and 30\% crust thickness Fortin et al. (2016). For GW phenomena, Ref. Suleiman et al. (2021) shows that an inconsistent treatment of crust and core can lead to 20\% error on NS tidal deformability with respect to the unified treatment and the authors of Ferreira and Providência (2020) found that different crust-core glueing leads to 20\% difference on the Love number k_{2} when compared to unified EoS. To avoid adding uncertainties related to different crust-core matching, in the present work we use thermodynamic consistent and unified EoS, on the lines of Ref. Grams et al. (2022a). Several works have analyzed the possibility of extra degrees of freedom on the NS interior and its effect on GW seismology, such as the impact of hyperons onset Pradhan and Chatterjee (2021), phase transition to quark matter Kumar et al. (2023) and the effect of dark matter admixed NS Shirke et al. (2024). However more exotic particles might be present on compact stars, current observations do not rule out the possibility of NS composed only by nuclear matter Dinh Thi et al. (2021); Somasundaram et al. (2023); Mondal et al. (2023) due to the masquerade effect Alford et al. (2005). In the present work we keep the nucleonic hypothesis to better understand the impact on high-order nuclear empirical parameters (NEP) on NS. As we have seen in the previous discussion, a NS can have different composition in its interior, and considerable effort is being made to better understand the complexities of the NS EoS. In this respect, the study of the fundamental mode (f-mode) has attracted the attention by the physics community, because it can bring important information about the mean density of a NS. The f-mode belongs to the family of non radial oscillations modes of a NS, and this mode is related to the mean density of the star. Another interesting oscillation mode is the p-mode, which has higher frequencies than the f-mode. The f-mode has received much attention because it can be excited more easily, however recent simulations of supernovas show that the p-mode could also be activated Kumar et al. (2024) by the strong dynamics of the explosion. We also have the g-mode, which is related to density discontinuities inside the star, and finally, when rotation is considered, it can appear the r-mode. All of these modes are very important because are coupled to the emission of gravitational radiation, and it is very clear to the scientific community that the detection of those modes will be imminent when the 3G detectors will be finished and operating. Another phenomena that can be observed in a GW signal is the tidal deformability of a NS. Such deformations manifest when two NS are very close and can be coupled to non radial oscillations. The NS tidal deformability is very important because is directly related to the matter composition of NS. During the late inspiral, tidal deformations raised on each star by the gravitational field of its companion depend crucially on the star’s internal properties Han and Steiner (2019); Hinderer et al. (2010). Recently there have been different works trying to correlate f and p-modes, tidal deformability, mass and star radius. For example we can mention Kunjipurayil et al. (2022), where it was used Skyrme Hartree-Fock and relativistic mean-field models. Their study shows a strong correlation between the frequencies of f- and p-modes, damping times with the pressure of \beta-equilibrated matter. Also in Montefusco et al. (2024), the authors considered a metamodel representation of the nucleonic EoS of an NS, with the objective to identify possible biases on oscillation modes arising from asuming a barotropic EoS, and provided a distribution of expected f and p mode frequencies that could be detected by 3G GW interferometers. In this work we study the effect of the high-order NEP of the EoS on the non radial oscillations and tidal deformations. For this purpose, we construct a set of unified (crust-core) EoS with a flexible approach thanks to the meta-modeling technique Margueron et al. (2018a). Such technique was already largely used to investigate uncertainties on NS mass and radii Margueron et al. (2018b). For example, the authors of Ref. Jaiswal and Chatterjee (2021); Pradhan et al. (2023) investigate the role of nuclear parameters on NS f-modes, however, restricted to lower order parameters, such as the effective mass and the nuclear symmetry energy. The paper is organized as follows. In section II we present the method to compute the EoS used in this work. In section III we present the standard theoretical basis of non radial oscillations together with our results for the f- and p-modes. In section IV we make a discussion about tidal deformations and finally in section V we make our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09319v1,Solar flares in the Solar Orbiter Era: Short exposure EUI/FSI observations of STIX flares,"Aims. This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of short-exposure extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations of solar flares in the study of particle acceleration, heating and energy partition in flares. This work highlights the observations now available from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument suite onboard Solar Orbiter while operating in short exposure mode.Methods. A selection of noteworthy flares observed simultaneously by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) and the Full Sun Imager of EUI (EUI/FSI) are detailed. New insights are highlighted and potential avenues of investigation are demonstrated, including forward modelling the atmospheric response to a non-thermal beam of electrons using the RADYN 1D hydrodynamic code, in order to compare the predicted and observed EUV emission.Results. The examples given in this work demonstrate that short exposure EUI/FSI observations are providing important diagnostics during flares. A dataset of more than 9000 flares observed by STIX (from November 2022 until December 2023) with at least one short exposure EUI/FSI 174 Å image is currently available. The observations reveal that the brightest parts of short-exposure observations consist of substructure in flaring ribbons which spatially overlap with the hard X-ray emission observed by STIX in the majority of cases. We show that these observations provide an opportunity to further constrain the electron energy flux required for flare modelling, among other potential applications.","During solar flares, the emission at ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths can become locally enhanced by several orders of magnitude on a timescale of seconds to minutes. Even moderately sized C-class flares typically saturate current EUV and UV imagers as well as soft X-ray imagers. This means that spatial information in the saturated pixels is lost. Further, depending on the type of detectors used (CMOS vs. CCD), the total flux may or may not be conserved and neighbouring pixels might be affected (so called “bleeding”). Saturation during enhanced solar flare emission in such instruments is due to the fact that they are not exclusively designed to study flares. It is challenging to design an instrument with a sufficiently large dynamic range that can observe both the faintest solar emission and the largest flares for a given exposure time. The saturation effect leads to challenges in many flare studies, particularly for relating coronal and chromospheric UV/EUV emission to observations from hard X-ray emission during the impulsive phase of flares. One way to address the saturation issue of EUV imagers is to shorten the exposure time used. Some EUV/UV imagers, such as Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, use automatic exposure control, in which flight software determines the exposure time based on count flux (Lemen et al., 2012). However, with variations in this exposure time over the course of a flare, it can become a challenge to study given that the response of the detectors may be non-linear in exposure time which can introduce artificial variations linked to the exposure time changes. Regardless, despite the variable exposure time setting, the exposure time is often too long and AIA observations of flares are frequently still saturated. Efforts have been made to overcome saturation issues through a reconstruction approach which utilises the knowledge of the AIA diffraction pattern (Raftery et al., 2011; Krucker et al., 2011; Schwartz et al., 2014; Torre et al., 2015; Guastavino et al., 2019; Krucker et al., 2021). However, there are still challenges with total flux conservation and dealing with pixel bleeding. Kazachenko et al. (2017) also tackled this issue by linearly interpolating the flux prior to and post saturation in order to infer spatial information about flare ribbons. An approach of this kind, is, however, not suitable for photometric analysis. In the era of multi-messenger observations, the availability of EUV imagers on the far side of the Sun from Earth has become increasingly important for event studies since we cannot rely on Earth-based assets like AIA. For example, the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) (Rochus et al., 2020; Berghmans et al., 2023) onboard Solar Orbiter (Müller et al., 2020) provides EUV images for observations taken by the Solar Orbiter instrument suite as the spacecraft sweeps out an elliptical orbit spending half of the mission duration on the far side of the Sun from Earth. EUI consists of three telescopes, the Full Sun Imager (EUI/FSI) and two High Resolution Imagers, which observe in Lyman \alpha, 174 Å and 304 Å passbands. The focus of this work is on EUI/FSI observations. To combat the aforementioned saturation issues, EUI/FSI has been regularly taking short exposure observations alongside normal exposure frames in both the 174 Å and 304 Å channels since the end of 2022. This paper demonstrates the value of short exposure EUV observations in flare studies and details the invaluable new datasets provided by EUI/FSI as well as recent observations with EUI’s High Resolution Imager, EUI/HRIEUV . In this work, a subset of interesting flares co-observed by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) are presented and new insights enabled by this observation mode are discussed."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09147v2,Post-Newtonian templates for phase evolution of spherical extreme mass ratio inspirals,"We present various post-Newtonian (PN) models for the phase evolution of compact objects moving along quasi-spherical orbits in Kerr spacetime derived by using the 12PN analytic formulas of the energy, angular momentum and their averaged rates of change calculated in the framework of the black hole perturbation theory. To examine the convergence of time-domain PN models (TaylorT families), we evaluate the dephasing between approximants with different PN orders. We found that the TaylorT1 model shows the best performance and the performance of the TaylorT2 is the next best. To evaluate the convergence of frequency-domain PN models (TaylorF families), we evaluate the mismatch between approximants with different orders. We found that the performance of the TaylorF2 model is comparable with the TaylorT2 model. Although the TaylorT2 and TaylorF2 models are not so accurate as the TaylorT1, the fully analytical expressions give us easy-to-handle templates and are useful to discuss effects beyond general relativity.","Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are important targets of space-borne gravitational wave (GW) detectors, like Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) [1], TianQin [2], and Taiji [3]. An EMRI consists of a compact object orbiting and plunging into a massive black hole, which is expected to exist in the center of galactic nuclei. Before plunging into the central black hole, the object emits GWs including a huge number of cycles. The observation and data analysis of the GWs allow us to measure the intrinsic parameters of the EMRI system precisely and will provide insights into the theory of gravity, the physics and astrophysics of black holes [4, 5, 6]. Matched filtering is one of promising techniques to analyze the observed GWs and extract the physical information from signals emitted by EMRIs accurately and efficiently. This technique requires waveform templates representing the real signals from EMRIs accurately. The GW templates of EMRIs are often calculated by black hole perturbation theory because the extreme mass ratio is suitable for the small parameter in the perturbative expansion. In the context of black hole perturbation theory, an EMRI is modeled as a point mass moving in Kerr spacetime, and the GWs are represented by the gravitational perturbations induced by the point mass. The gravitational perturbations of Kerr black hole are described by the perturbations of the Newman-Penrose variables [7], which satisfy the Teukolsky equations [8, 9] with the source constructed from the energy-momentum tensor for the point mass. This means that we need to know the precise motion of the point mass to calculate the GWs accurately by solving the Teukolsky equation. In the test-mass limit, the motion is expressed by a geodesic in Kerr spacetime. Taking into account the self-interaction with the own gravitational field, however, a deviation of the mass’ motion from the geodesic arises. This can be interpreted as the “self-force” (see Refs. [10, 11] and the references therein) effect. The dominant contribution of the gravitational self-force to the mass’ motion is the time-averaged dissipative piece at the first order of the mass ratio, which induces the losses of the energy and angular momentum of the point mass and drives the gradual inspiral into the central black hole. The dissipative effect is most noticeable on the orbital phase and therefore the GW phase. A phase difference of O(1) significantly reduces the overlap between an observed signal and the corresponding template, and leads to failure of the detection or the accurate estimation of the physical parameters. Therefore, it is important to calculate the time-averaged dissipative self-force at high precision. The time-averaged dissipative self-force can be rewritten in the secular changes of three orbital parameters, the energy, azimuthal angular momentum, and Carter parameter of the point mass. There are several works on calculating the rates of the secular change in both numerical and analytical approaches based on the black hole perturbation theory. The state-of-the-art studies on the numerical approach can provide the data of the secular evolution for general bound orbits in Kerr spacetime [12, 13, 14, 15]. Since the numerical calculation costs a lot of computational resources, however, the use of combination with the analytical approach is expected to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency. There have been several efforts in analytically calculating the secular evolution of the orbital parameters since the 1990s (see Ref. [16, 17] and the references therein). The post-Newtonian (PN) formulas of the secular evolution for general bound orbits are presented in our previous works [18, 19, 20]. The recent advances in computers have made it possible to extend the analytical calculation to the higher PN order. Several works on calculating the higher PN corrections have been done in Refs. [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. In this work, we focus on the secular evolution of orbits off equatorial plane in Kerr spacetime, which has attracted less attention in the study of the analytic calculation of the self-force so far. As the first step, we consider the evolution of a spherical orbit, which is an orbit with a constant radius on a plane precessing around the rotation axis of the central black hole. We calculate the 12PN formulas for the secular change of orbital parameters for spherical orbits with arbitrary inclination angle, through the procedure based on the adiabatic approximation proposed in Refs. [19, 20] 111In Refs. [19, 20], the PN and eccentricity-expanded formulas for generic bound orbits not only spherical orbits are presented. Since the higher PN calculation with finite eccentricity requires significantly more cost than the non-eccentric orbit case, however, we restrict the calculation to the spherical orbit case in this work.. To study the convergence of the PN formulas and the impact of the higher corrections on the accuracy of the gravitational waveform, we derive the PN templates of the phase evolution, the time-domain, TaylorT and frequency-domain, TaylorF models [27, 28], for quasi-spherical orbits. Although the TaylorT and TaylorF templates in the context of the black hole perturbation theory have been derived in Ref. [29], the work is restricted to the circular orbit case in Schwarzschild spacetime in exchange for the remarkably high, 22PN order. This work presents the extension into the spherical orbit case in Kerr spacetime, and we investigate how the convergence of the PN formulas is influenced by the orbital inclination and the spin of the central black hole. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly review the spherical orbit in Kerr spacetime and its secular evolution driven by the dissipation due to the gravitational radiation. In Sec. III, we present the TaylorT and TaylorF models derived in a similar manner to Ref. [29]. In addition, we propose alternative choices of the TaylorT1 and TaylorT4 templates, which appear because of increasing the number of orbital parameters. In Sec. IV, we examine the performance of the Taylor models for several sets of the orbital inclination and the black hole spin. In Sec. V, we summarize our results. In Appendices A–I, we present the explicit expressions of the PN coefficients of the orbital energy and angular momentum, their time averaged rates of change, the TaylorT and TaylorF templates, up to the 4.5PN order. Throughout this paper, we adopt the geometrized units with c=G=1 and metric signature (-+++), and the Kerr metric is described in the Boyer–Lindquist coordinates (t,r,\theta,\varphi)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09083v1,Mechanism of generating collisionless shock in magnetized gas plasma driven by laser-ablated target plasma,"Mechanism of generating collisionless shock in magnetized gas plasma driven by laser-ablated target plasma is investigated by using one-dimensional full particle-in-cell simulation. The effect of finite injection time of target plasma, mimicking finite width of laser pulse, is taken into account. It was found that the formation of a seed-shock requires a precursor. The precursor is driven by gyrating ions, and its origin varies depending on the injection time of the target plasma. When the injection time is short, the target plasma entering the gas plasma creates a precursor, otherwise, gas ions reflected by the strong piston effect of the target plasma create a precursor. The precursor compresses the background gas plasma, and subsequently, a compressed seed-shock forms in the gas plasma. The parameter dependence on the formation process and propagation characteristics of the seed-shock was discussed. It was confirmed that the seed-shock propagates through the gas plasma exhibiting behavior similar to the shock front of supercritical shocks.","While collisionless shocks have long been studied as powerful accelerators of cosmic rays, their acceleration mechanisms remain highly complex and largely veiled. Studies of collisionless shocks have traditionally employed various methods such as in-situ and remote observations in space, theoretical modeling, and numerical simulations. Recently, in addition to these methods, efforts to generate magnetized collisionless shocks using high-power laser facilities in laboratory experiments have garnered significant attention Matsukiyo et al. (2022); Yamazaki et al. (2022); Yao et al. (2021); Schaeffer et al. (2019, 2017); Kuramitsu et al. (2016); Schaeffer et al. (2015, 2014); Niemann et al. (2014). Among a number of methods of shock generation, Yamazaki et al. (2022)Yamazaki et al. (2022) and Matsukiyo et al. (2022)Matsukiyo et al. (2022) proposed a method to generate a shock in a homogeneously magnetized ambient gas plasma with uniform Alfvén velocity. In the experiment, a solid aluminum target irradiated with a laser is ablated and a surrounding nitrogen gas filling uniformly an entire chamber is ionized by the strong radiation emitted by the laser-target interaction. The ionized gas plasma initially at rest is uniformly magnetized in sufficiently large volume for a long time by using a Helmholtz-like coil. Although they observed developing shock (seed-shock hereafter), propagating in the gas plasma, detailed formation process of the seed-shock in this system has not been fully understood. The complexity arises from the highly intricate interaction between gas plasma and target plasma. Since it is nearly impossible to separately measure the two plasmas in experiments, comparison with numerical simulations becomes crucial. However, there has not been a well-established computational method that accurately replicates these early-stage shock formations. One commonly used numerical simulation in this field is the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulation (Birdsall and Langdon, 2004). A number of methods of shock generation using the PIC simulation have been proposed so far (e.g. Pongkitiwanichakul et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2021; Moreno et al., 2020; Schaeffer et al., 2020; Dieckmann et al., 2018 and reviewed in Ref. Burgess and Scholer, 2015). Normally, as enough time elapses, the influence of initial conditions and boundary conditions can be ignored, so differences in shock generation methods are not a concern. However, to accurately simulate the initial stages of shock generation observed in laser experiments, considerable attention needs to be paid to the initial setup of the calculations. Fox et al. (2013)Fox et al. (2018) introduced a localized heating operator to refine and incorporate the effects of laser ablation. This involves setting up a high-density region mimicking the target at one end of the system (with a constant density over time) and imparting a sufficiently high plasma temperature only to that specific area. This allows the target plasma to thermally expand into its surroundings. In their approach, it is necessary to handle a very high-density plasma in a narrow region, which results in high computational costs. Matsukiyo et al. (2022)Matsukiyo et al. (2022) employed a different method to reproduce similar effects in one-dimensional simulations. They injected a high-temperature, high-density target plasma into a system filled with uniform background gas plasma at a specific point for a finite duration. This eliminates the need to deal with target material that does not interact with the background gas plasma, thereby reducing computational costs. In the simulation they showed that injected target ions gyrate around ambient magnetic field in a gas plasma and turned back after a quarter of their gyro period. During this, a background gas ions are dragged (or accelerated) by the target ions so that the gas ions are gradually accumulated and compressed to form a shock-like steepened density profile afterwards. They called this steepened structure a developing shock. However, it is unclear how universal the process is. If the mechanism for generating a shock in experiments is elucidated, it would enable us to devise means to generate a shock in a short period of time, making it possible to measure a more developed shock. In this paper we use the same simulation method as Ref. Matsukiyo et al., 2022 to investigate the mechanism of shock formation in a magnetized gas plasma interacting with an ablated target plasma. We will show that the mechanism of shock formation changes depending on the injection time of target plasma. Moreover, it will be demonstrated that the time it takes to form a sufficiently steep density structure depends on the strength of the ambient magnetic field. To distinguish the structure we mainly discuss in this paper with usually discussed a well developed shock, we call the early stage steepened density or magnetic field structure discussed here a seed-shock, which does not accompany well developed steady and long enough downstream state. A seed-shock is equivalent to the structure named a developing shock in Ref. Matsukiyo et al., 2022. The paper is organized as follows. In section II simulation settings are explained. The mechanism of seed-shock formation is discussed in section III. The parameter dependence of seed-shock properties is shown in section IV. Then, discussions are given in section V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09078v1,Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at an oblique heliospheric termination shock,"Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at a heliospheric termination shock is investigated. Using two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation, accelerated pickup ions are self-consistently reproduced by tracking long time evolution of shock with unprecedentedly large system size in the shock normal direction. Reflected pickup ions drive upstream large amplitude waves through resonant instabilities. Convection of the large amplitude waves causes shock surface reformation and alters the downstream electromagnetic structure. A part of pickup ions are accelerated to tens of upstream flow energy in the time scale of \sim 100 times inverse ion gyro frequency. The initial acceleration occurs through shock surfing acceleration mechanism followed by shock drift acceleration mechanism. Large electrostatic potential accompanied by the upstream waves enables the shock surfing acceleration to occur.","A collisionless shock is ubiquitous in space. It is an energy converter formed in a supersonic plasma flow. A variety of explosive phenomena in space, stellar wind, astrophysical jet accompany collisionless shocks. One of the outstanding issues of collisionless shock physics is the mechanism of particle acceleration occurring around it. It is believed that cosmic rays are produced in a collisionless shock through the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism (e.g., Blandford & Eichler (1987)). In order for the DSA mechanism to work, preaccelerated nonthermal particles have to exist near a shock front. However, the mechanism producing such nonthermal particles, which should be dominated by complex microstructures of local electromagnetic fields, has been an open question for a long time. This is called the injection problem (Balogh & Treumann, 2013; Burgess & Scholer, 2015; Amano et al., 2022). The heliospheric termination shock (HTS) is thought to be an ideal laboratory to study the injection process, because the anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) having typically several tens of mega electron volts (MeV) are believed to be accelerated there (Chalov, 2006). However, the Voyager spacecraft observed only little amount of ACRs in the heliosheath, downstream of the HTS (e.g., Stone et al. (2005)). The reason for this was inferred by McComas & Schwadron (2006) as that efficient acceleration of ACRs occurs in the flank regions of the HTS, where geometrical condition of the local HTS is more suitable for particle acceleration than that of the HTS where the two Voyager spacecraft crossed. On the other hand, Giacalone et al. (2021) recently performed hybrid (kinetic ions with charge neutralizing electron fluid) simulations and showed that the acceleration rate of low energy (\lesssim 50 keV) pickup ions (PUIs) is more or less independent of the position in the HTS. The nonthermal particles in this energy range are expected to have their global map obtained in the near future through the IMAP (Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe) mission. In their simulation (Giacalone et al., 2021), turbulence in the solar wind is taken into account. Particles are expected to undergo scattering by the turbulent field, leading to some degree of acceleration, and there is a potential for these particles to be injected into the DSA process (Giacalone et al., 2021; Trotta et al., 2021; Pitňa et al., 2021; Zank et al., 2021; Trotta et al., 2022; Nakanotani et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). Another expected effect is the tilting of local magnetic field line. In oblique shocks particles reflected by the shock travel upstream, exciting waves themselves and generating mildly accelerated particles injected into the DSA process. Such a situation may occur in some specific regions of termination shock and perhaps locally everywhere when solar wind is turbulent. In this scenario, the generation of mildly accelerated particles needs to occur near the shock, but the detailed mechanism is not well understood. This study aims to validate the latter scenario. It is thought that initial acceleration sets in when a particle is reflected at the shock. In general shock potential strongly affects the reflection of PUIs. In a hybrid simulation, the electrostatic potential is typically derived from a generalized Ohm’s law, which includes a term proportional to the electron pressure gradient. Calculating this electron pressure gradient term requires assuming a specific equation of state for electrons. Consequently, the electrostatic field in a hybrid simulation becomes model-dependent. Swisdak et al. (2023) pointed out that fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation leads to higher fluxes and maximal energies of PUIs than hybrid simulation likely due to differences in the shock potential. Before the Voyager spacecraft crossed the HTS, the shock surfing acceleration (SSA) was widely accepted as a plausible mechanism of injection (Lee et al., 1996; Zank et al., 1996). However, the Voyager did not observe the expected amount of high energy particles when they crossed the HTS (Decker et al., 2008). This implies that the shock surfing acceleration mechanism did not work effectively either. The reason for that SSA does not work in the termination shock was explained by Matsukiyo & Scholer (2014) by using one-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of (quasi-)perpendicular shock that most of potential jump in a PUI mediated shock occurs in an extended foot produced by reflected PUIs so that the potential jump at a shock ramp is insufficiently small for the SSA mechanism to work. The shock potential in an oblique PUI mediated shock has not been extensively studied so far. Although the ab-initio PIC simulation is useful to reproduce complex multiscale electromagnetic structures responsible for injection processes, it requires large numerical cost. That is why PIC simulation of a collisionless shock in a plasma containing PUIs has been limitted mainly to the cases with one spatial dimension (e.g., Lee et al. (2005); Matsukiyo et al. (2007); Matsukiyo & Scholer (2011, 2014); Oka et al. (2011); Lembege & Yang (2016, 2018); Lembege et al. (2020)). Two-dimensional PIC simulations including PUIs are first conducted by Yang et al. (2015). They focused on the impact of PUIs on shock front nonstationarity of a perpendicular shock, \Theta_{Bn}=90^{\circ}, and energy dissipation up to t=8\Omega^{-1}_{i}, where \Theta_{Bn} denotes the shock angle, the angle between shock normal and upstream magnetic field, and \Omega_{i} is upstream ion cyclotron frequency. Kumar et al. (2018) performed longer simulation up to t\sim 30\Omega^{-1}_{i} for quasi-perpendicular shocks, \Theta_{Bn}=80^{\circ}. They paid more attention to energy distribution of PUIs and solar wind ions (SWIs) for different upstream velocity distribution functions of PUIs. A little longer calculation up to t\sim 40\Omega^{-1}_{i} was done with \Theta_{Bn}=70^{\circ} by Swisdak et al. (2023). However, since the shock angle is close to or equal to perpendicular in the above previous studies, significant acceleration of PUIs are not reproduced. Indeed, when considering the average values, the shock angle of the termination shock is nearly perpendicular. However, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, it is easy to predict that the local shock angle fluctuates significantly due to the effects of solar wind turbulence and unsteady solar activity. This fluctuation could have important implications for the ion injection process. In this study we focus the initial acceleration, which is often called injection process, of PUIs at an oblique HTS. The microstructures of a local oblique HTS with \Theta_{Bn}=50^{\circ}, and with 60^{\circ} and 70^{\circ} for comparison, mediated by the presence of PUIs and their impact on PUI acceleration are discussed by performing two-dimensional full PIC simulation with unprecedentedly long simulation time (t_{max}=125\Omega^{-1}_{i})."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08970v1,Discovery of a Dense Association of Stars in the Vicinity of the Supermassive Black Hole Sgr A*,"We focus on a sample of 42 sources in the vicinity of the bow-shock source IRS 1W (N-sources), located at the distance of 6.05^{\prime\prime} north-east of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), within the radius of 1.35^{\prime\prime}. We present the first proper motion measurements of N-sources and find that a larger subset of N-sources (28 sources) exhibit a north-westward flying angle. These sources can be bound by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) or the concentration that we observe is due to a disk-like distribution projection along the line of sight. We detect the N-sources in H, K_{s}, and L’ bands. The north-westward flying sources could be a bound collection of stars. We discuss a tentative existence of an IMBH or an inclined disk distribution to explain a significant overdensity of stars. The first scenario of having an IMBH implies the lower limit of \sim 10^{4}~{}M_{\odot} for the putative IMBH. Our measurements for the first time reveal that the dense association of stars containing IRS 1W is a co-moving group of massive, young stars. This stellar association might be the remnant core of a massive stellar cluster that is currently being tidally stripped as it inspirals towards Sgr A*. The second scenario suggests that the appearance of the N-sources might be influenced by the projection of a disk-like distribution of younger He-stars and/or dust-enshrouded stars.","The extended radio source Sgr A consists of three components in terms of different radiative and spatial properties: Sgr A East, which is a non-thermal supernova remnant, Sgr A West which is a thermal region associated with the ionized mini-spiral structure, and the compact variable radio source Sgr A * associated with the supermassive black hole (SMBH) of \sim 4\times 10^{6}\,M_{\odot} (Balick & Brown, 1974; Goss & McGee, 1996; Eckart & Genzel, 1996; Ghez et al., 1998; Genzel et al., 2010; Eckart et al., 2017; GRAVITY Collaboration et al., 2019; Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2022; Genzel et al., 2024, and references therein) at the center of the Milky Way. The thermal Sgr A West region or the mini-spiral (Ekers et al., 1983; Lo & Claussen, 1983) is detected as a distinct filamentary structure in near- and mid-infrared bands (Clénet et al., 2004; Viehmann et al., 2006; Mužić et al., 2007; Bhat et al., 2022) as well as in the mm- and radio domain (Zhao et al., 2009, 2010; Moser et al., 2017). It is composed of three clumpy streamers orbiting around Sgr A* that consist of dust and ionized and atomic gas with the dust temperature of \sim 100\,K and the gas temperature of \sim 10^{4} K (Yusef-Zadeh et al., 1998; Kunneriath et al., 2012). A surprisingly large number of massive young stars with the age of a few million years resides in the Milky Way’s innermost half parsec (pc). They form at least one disk-like structure of clockwise orbiting stars (CW) (Genzel et al., 2003; Levin & Beloborodov, 2003). Paumard et al. (2006) also propose the existence of a second disk of counter-clockwise orbiting stars (CCW), which, however, appears to be less populous. The existence of disk-like structures, which can be traced even within the innermost S cluster (Ali et al., 2020), suggests the association of star-formation in the Galactic Center with the accretion disks that formed during the previous enhanced accretion activity of Sgr A*. The mechanism which leads to the presence of young stars with the age of \lesssim 5{\rm Myr} is still not completely understood because there are several factors in the Galactic Center environment that should be inhibiting the star-formation process, such as intense UV radiation and stellar winds, large turbulence, enhanced magnetic field, and the tidal forces from the SMBH (Morris, 1993). This problem is known as the “Paradox of youth” (Ghez et al., 2003), though with the advance of star-formation and dynamical models in galactic nuclei, it has been possible to explain the occurrence of young stars in the Galactic Center, see e.g. Mapelli & Gualandris (2016) for a review. Three plausible scenarios are generally discussed: 1. in-situ star-formation approach, in which stars form in the gravitationally unstable accretion disk or within an infalling molecular cloud that gets shocked due to collisions with the surrounding gas or is tidally compressed (Morris, 1993; Levin & Beloborodov, 2003; Nayakshin et al., 2006; Hobbs & Nayakshin, 2009; Lu et al., 2009; Bartko et al., 2009a; Paumard et al., 2006; Jalali et al., 2014; Bartko et al., 2010); 2. in-spiral star formation approach which claims that the star cluster first starts forming outside the central parsec, e.g. within the circum-nuclear disk or even further away in the central molecular zone. The presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) can shorten the dynamical friction timescale, which needs to be at most a few million years long in order for stars to be still young when they settle around the SMBH (Gerhard, 2001; McMillan & Portegies Zwart, 2003; Hansen & Milosavljević, 2003; Portegies Zwart et al., 2006; Berukoff & Hansen, 2006; Rizzuto et al., 2021; Peißker et al., 2021); 3. rejuvenation scenario, which proposes that late-type stars have undergone collisions with other stars, a dense accretion disc, or a jet, which caused their colder outer layers to be stripped off and made them appear hotter and younger than they actually would be (Morris, 1992, 1993; Genzel et al., 2003; Zajaček et al., 2020). In addition, late-type stars aligned with an accretion disk accrete material from it, which also leads to their rejuvenation by gaining fresh hydrogen (Cantiello et al., 2021). Apart from the cluster of young stars centered around Sgr A* within \sim 0.5\,{\rm pc}, there is a distinct concentration of infrared sources IRS 13 located at the projected distance of \sim 3-4^{\prime\prime} (\sim 0.12-0.16 pc) south-west of Sgr A * (Peißker et al., 2023; Dinh et al., 2024; Peißker et al., 2024). IRS 13 has been studied as a suitable candidate for the first two aforementioned scenarios for the origin of young stars in the central parsec. IRS 13 consists of two components – the northern part IRS 13N and the eastern part IRS 13E. IRS 13N hosts young, infrared-excess sources (Maillard et al., 2004; Eckart et al., 2004; Paumard et al., 2006; Mužić et al., 2008; Eckart et al., 2013). IRS 13E mainly contains massive Wolf- Rayet (WR) stars and the violent supergiant E1(OBI) (Maillard et al., 2004; Moultaka et al., 2005; Paumard et al., 2006), whereas the rest of the stars are fainter ones, identified as late-type stars and are most likely the background stars (Fritz et al., 2010). The velocity dispersion of the IRS 13E sources motivated the speculation about the existence of an IMBH to bind the cluster and thus prevent it from tidal disruption at the given distance from Sgr A*. The required mass of the assumed IMBH was inferred to be about \sim 10^{4}M_{\odot} (Maillard et al., 2004; Schödel et al., 2005). The existence of the prominent X-ray source in the IRS 13E cluster reinforced the discussion about the IMBH. On the other hand, Zhu et al. (2020) argue that a colliding wind scenario between E2 and E4 can explain the X-ray spectrum as well as the morphology of IRS 13E and suggests that there is no significant evidence that IRS 13E hosts an IMBH more massive than \sim 10^{3}M_{\odot}. In general, the occurrence of IMBHs in nuclear star clusters is expected based on dynamical arguments. Rose et al. (2022) propose that dynamical mechanisms operating in galactic nuclei, specifically black hole-star collisions, mass segregation, and relaxation, are particularly effective in the formation of IMBHs of \lesssim 10^{4}M_{\odot}. Their findings imply that at least one IMBH is likely to exist in the central parsec of the Galaxy. Another channel for the occurrence of IMBHs in galactic nuclei is their infall within massive stellar clusters (Spitzer, 1969; Portegies Zwart & McMillan, 2002; Rasio et al., 2004; Fragione, 2022), which directly relates dense stellar associations such as IRS13 with an IMBH. Rose et al. (2022) suggest that the collisions between black holes and stars can contribute to the diffuse X-ray emission in the Galactic Center region. Hence, also a growing black hole inside IRS13E that collides with the surrounding stars could contribute to the X-ray emission of the cluster. Another apparent concentration of stars in the inner parsec of the Galactic Center is associated with the source IRS 1W that is located within the northern arm of the mini-spiral. The mini-spiral contains mostly hot, ionized gas traced by bright Br\gamma emission. Vollmer & Duschl (2000) interpret the kinematics of the ionized gas in the northern arm to be Keplerian. IRS 1W has been studied previously as a bow shock source interacting with the material of the northern arm. Its broad-band infrared continuum emission is consistent with the temperature of \sim 300 K (Tanner et al., 2002, 2003, 2005) suggesting the presence of warm dust in its bow shock. Ott et al. (1999) used the speckle camera SHARP on the New Technology Telescope (NTT) and showed that IRS 1W is an extended source which could be a young star. Previously it was suggested that it could have formed in the northern arm of the mini-spiral or from the accreted gas and dust in the infalling material out of the northern arm. However, due to the current low inferred mass of the minispiral gas of \sim 100\,M_{\odot} it is unlikely that it formed within the northern arm. Tanner et al. (2005) observed IRS 1W alongside IRS 10W and IRS 21 by W.M. Keck 10 meter and Gemini 8 meter telescopes and identified them as bow-shock sources with central sources as Wolf-Rayet stars. The stellar-wind properties and kinematics of IRS 1W are similar to the properties of the clockwise orbiting He emission-line stars. Viehmann et al. (2006) showed that IRS 1W is very red and has a featureless spectral energy distribution (SED). Sanchez-Bermudez et al. (2014) analyzed the bow-shock orientation alongside the proper motion and confirmed that IRS 1W is a Wolf-Rayet star with a bow shock created by the interaction between the mass-losing star and the surrounding interstellar gas. The apparent stellar overabundance in the vicinity of IRS 1W could hypothetically be a stellar cluster similar to IRS 13 that is getting tidally disrupted upon the approach towards the SMBH. We investigate this possibility in more detail in this paper. We focus on the area around IRS 1W that contains 42 sources including IRS 1W. The geometrical center of these sources is situated at 6.24\pm 0.47 arcsec (right ascension) and 0.25\pm 0.42 arcsec (declination) with respect to Sgr A* in 2005.366 epoch within the circular region with a radius of 1.35^{\prime\prime}. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe analyzed datasets in the near-infrared (NIR) domain. The identification of stars associated with IRS 1W that constitute an apparent overabundance in comparison with other fields around Sgr A* is analyzed in Section 3. The NIR photometry colour-colour diagram of the sources is presented in Section 4. Proper motions of the sources are analyzed in Section 5, where the significant stellar concentration with the common proper motion in the north-western direction is identified. We discuss potential clustering scenarios (IMBH-bound cluster or a projected disk-like distribution) in Section 6. Finally, we summarize the main results in Section 7.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08949v1,AT 2021hdr: A candidate tidal disruption of a gas cloud by a binary super massive black hole system,"With a growing number of facilities able to monitor the entire sky and produce light curves with a cadence of days, in recent years there has been an increased rate of detection of sources whose variability deviates from standard behavior, revealing a variety of exotic nuclear transients. The aim of the present study is to disentangle the nature of the transient AT 2021hdr, whose optical light curve used to be consistent with a classic Seyfert 1 nucleus, which was also confirmed by its optical spectrum and high-energy properties. From late 2021, AT 2021hdr started to present sudden brightening episodes in the form of oscillating peaks in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream, and the same shape is observed in X-rays and UV from Swift data. The oscillations occur every \sim60-90 days with amplitudes of \sim0.2 mag in the g and r bands. Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations show no radio emission at milliarcseconds scale. It is argued that these findings are inconsistent with a standard tidal disruption event (TDE), a binary supermassive black hole (BSMBH), or a changing-look active galactic nucleus (AGN); neither does this object resemble previous observed AGN flares, and disk or jet instabilities are an unlikely scenario. Here, we propose that the behavior of AT 2021hdr might be due to the tidal disruption of a gas cloud by a BSMBH. In this scenario, we estimate that the putative binary has a separation of \sim0.83 mpc and would merge in \sim7\times104 years. This galaxy is located at 9 kpc from a companion galaxy, and in this work we report this merger for the first time. The oscillations are not related to the companion galaxy.","The centers of most galaxies are thought to host a supermassive black hole (SMBH). If fed by a surrounding accretion disk, the system shines and becomes an active galactic nucleus (AGN; Rees, 1984). A common property of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum (Netzer, 2013), which occurs stochastically and is thought to be related mostly to flux variations in the accretion disc, with typical amplitudes of < 0.5 mag in the optical continuum on timescales of between months and years (e.g., Vanden Berk et al., 2004; MacLeod et al., 2016). In recent decades, objects whose behavior deviates from typical AGN-like variations have been discovered. These include tidal disruption events (TDEs, Gezari 2021; Zabludoff et al. 2021), binary supermassive black hole (BSMBH; Charisi et al. 2016; De Rosa et al. 2019) candidates, changing-look (CL; LaMassa et al. 2015; Ricci & Trakhtenbrot 2023; Zeltyn et al. 2024) events, the recently discovered ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs; e.g., Hinkle et al., 2022), and anomalous-variability flares, which are due to disk instabilities or similar perturbations to the accretion process (Graham et al., 2017; Trakhtenbrot et al., 2019b; Frederick et al., 2021; Dotti et al., 2023). Many of the previous novel SMBH-related events were found thanks to the ever-increasing expansion of optical time domain facilities, which monitor the entire observable sky in search of variable objects. Among them, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, Graham et al., 2019; Bellm et al., 2019; Masci et al., 2019) observes the same region of the sky approximately every 3 days, allowing the construction of well-sampled light curves, and alerting the scientific community to significant changes in the sky. A multiwavelength perspective is often crucial to properly assess the evolving emission mechanisms and energetics of these variable sources (e.g., Hernández-García et al., 2023). For this, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Roming et al., 2005; Burrows et al., 2005) is an ideal facility, as it allows a rapid response to proposals that request follow-up observations, obtaining data in X-rays, UV, and optical. In this paper, we present an intriguing source that was discovered in 2021 thanks to the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events broker (ALeRCE; Förster et al., 2021) using ZTF data, and that we began monitoring with Swift in 2022. We complement these data with observations in radio and optical spectra. The host of this new transient or variable event, whose light curves show relatively well-defined oscillations on timescales of months, is an early stage merger composed of an AGN and a low-ionization nuclear emission line region (LINER); the combination of these two rare phenomena is reported for the first time (De Rosa et al., 2019). The paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2 we present the selection of the target, in Sect. 2.2 we include information about the nuclear region of the host galaxy and its environment, in Sect. 3 we present the data used for our analysis, in Sect. 4 we describe the multiwavelength light curves obtained during the transient phase, and in Sect. 5 we discuss the main results obtained in this work. Finally, we present our conclusions in Sect. 6. The appendix provides further details and analysis of the data as well as the full light curves."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08921v1,"The equilibrium configurations of neutron stars in the optimized f(R,T) gravity","We construct equilibrium configurations for neutron stars using a specific f(R,T) functional form, recently derived through gaussian process applied to measurements of the Hubble parameter. By construction, this functional form serves as an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration, circumventing the cosmological constant problem. Here, we aim to examine its applicability within the stellar regime. In doing so, we seek to contribute to the modified gravity literature by applying the same functional form of a given gravity theory across highly distinct regimes. Our results demonstrate that equilibrium configurations of neutron stars can be obtained within this theory, with the energy density and maximum mass slightly exceeding those predicted by General Relativity. Additionally, we show that the value of some parameters in the f(R,T) functional form must differ from those obtained in cosmological configurations, suggesting a potential scale-dependence for these parameters. We propose that further studies apply this functional form across different regimes to more thoroughly assess this possible dependence. Keywords: tov equation; neutron stars; modified gravity","Modified gravity is a highly active area of research in physics, as it has the potential to explain the cosmic acceleration without relying on the cosmological constant. The advantage of that is the evasion of the infamous cosmological constant problem, which is the tremendous discrepancy between the theoretically predicted and observed values of the vacuum energy density [1, 2, 3, 4]. The operational framework of modified gravity is outlined in the following. General Relativity field equations in the presence of the cosmological constant can be obtained from the variation of the following action S=\frac{1}{16\pi}\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}(R-2\Lambda)+\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\mathcal% {L}_{m}, (1) in which g is the metric determinant, R is the Ricci or curvature scalar, \Lambda is the cosmological constant, \mathcal{L}_{m} is the matter lagrangian density and natural units are assumed. Modified gravity (usually) neglects \Lambda and substitutes R by a function of it, namely, f(R), and even of other scalars. The variation of these augmented actions yields field equations with extra terms in comparison with General Relativity field equations, and those extra terms may be capable of explaining the cosmic acceleration in accordance with observations. Some successful examples of that are presented, e.g., in [5, 6, 7, 8]. The extra terms of the modified gravity field equations must be negligible in regimes where General Relativity is already probed. In other words, for a modified gravity theory to be acceptable, it must converge to the results of General Relativity in the regimes where the latter has already been experimentally validated. Some severe solar system constraints were put to modified gravity in [9, 10, 11]. It is an unpleasant current feature of modified gravity theory applications that usually there is no concern with the behaviour of a particular model in different regimes of application. That is, when one applies a particular modified gravity to a particular field of applications (equilibrium configurations of compact objects, solar system, galactic dynamics, structure formation, cosmological models etc.), there is usually no consideration of the outcomes obtained in the remaining applications. Let us exemplify such an argumentation in the following. In a paper by Capozziello and collaborators [12], the rotation curves of 15 low surface brightness galaxies were examined, showing no need for dark matter, in the f(R)=f_{0}R^{n} gravity, with f_{0} a constant that accounts for the correct units and n=3.5. Later, Faraoni showed that in order for the scalar field in the scalar-tensor version of R^{n} gravity to be non-tachyonic, one must have 1\leq n\leq 2 [13]. More dramatically, by writing n=1+\delta, the precession of the perihelion of Mercury yields \delta=(2.7\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-19} [14, 15, 16], a stringent limit often ignored in R^{n} gravity (check References [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], among others). Allemandi and Ruggiero have written a quite interesting paper in which they use gravitational redshift, light deflection, gravitational time-delay and geodesic precession to constrain different f(R) gravity models [25]. Remarkably, they obtained that the estimated values of the f(R) functional form parameters are orders of magnitude bigger than the values obtained in the cosmological framework. As one would expect, this is not a feature of f(R) gravity theory only. Exactly motivated by severe weak field constraints on f(R) theory that, as a matter of fact, rule out most of the suggested models [26, 27, 32, 28, 29, 30, 31], Harko and collaborators proposed the f(R,T) gravity theory [33], for which T is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The motivations to insert terms on T in the gravitational action will be provided next. For now, let us mention that the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation was derived for the first time for the f(R,T) gravity in [34]. The functional form chosen for f(R,T) was f(R,T)=R+2\lambda T, with constant \lambda, and such a constant presented different values - around one order of magnitude - when solutions were obtained for neutron stars and strange stars, being lower in the former case. Later, the same approach was applied to white dwarfs and a lower limit for \lambda was found, namely |\lambda|>3\times 10^{-4} [35]. The examples on the above regard are numerous and spread to several modified gravity theories. They point to an incoherence in the results of a given theory when applied to different regimes or to a hidden scale-dependence of these “constants”. It is the purpose of the present article to verify the neutron stars equilibrium configurations viability of a particular functional form of the f(R,T) gravity which is well succeeded, by construction, in the cosmological scenario. We will work with the functional form found by Fortunato et al. [36]. In [36], the f(R,T) functional form was constructed through gaussian process [37], that was applied through the use of a series of measurements of the Hubble parameter. The result obtained was f(T)=\alpha T^{2}+A\tanh[\lambda(T+T_{0})]+\beta T+\gamma. (2) More details on this result as well as the values obtained for the constants \alpha,A,\lambda,T_{0},\beta and \gamma will be given in the following. The article is organized as follows. In Section II we present the basis of the f(R,T) gravity. In Section III, we derive the TOV-like equation. In Section IV we present our results, which are obtained by particularizing f(T) as according to Eq.(2). Those are discussed in Section V, in which we also provide some perspectives for applications of (2)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08866v1,The GRBSN webtool: An open-source repository for gamma-ray burst-supernova associations,"This paper presents the GRBSN webtool, a public facing application which hosts the most complete list of GRB-SN associations to date. In contrast to other repositories of supernova or gamma-ray burst data, this tool brings together all of the information required to study a GRB-SN association. GRBSN allows users to view and interact with plots of the data; search and filter the whole database; and download all multi-wavelength data related to a GRB-SN association, including radio, X-ray, optical/NIR photometric and spectroscopic data. The tool is fully open source and is hosted on a public GitHub repository, meaning users can upload their own data, flag missing data and suggest improvements. As the number of confirmed GRB-SN associations increases, the webtool will provide a robust framework in which to catalogue these associations and their associated data. The web application is freely available and publicly accessible at https://grbsn.watchertelescope.ie.","The discovery of the supernova (SN) SN1998bw and its associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 980425 in April 1998 confirmed that some GRBs are associated with the death and collapse of massive stars and established the link between type Ic-BL supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) (Galama et al., 1998). To date, 58 of these GRB-SN associations have been discovered (see Cano et al. 2017 for a review in GRB-SN associations) and many key discoveries have been made. Despite this there remain many unanswered questions about these events. Multiwavelength observations are critical to the study of a GRB-SN association. Detection of the GRB high-energy prompt and afterglow components relies on \gamma/X-ray observations from telescopes such as Swift (Gehrels et al., 2004). On the other hand, supernovae are usually detected by large optical/nIR survey telescopes, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) (Bellm et al., 2019) or ATLAS (Tonry et al., 2018). Spectroscopic classifications of newly discovered SNe are typically reported to the Transient Name Server111https://www.wis-tns.org. In the case of a GRB with no prompt emission, commonly known as orphan afterglows (off-axis GRBs, choked GRBs or dirty fireballs), the supernova emission may precede the GRB emission (e.g. Izzo et al., 2020). For these events, the first detection is expected to happen in the optical/nIR energy range. In these cases, follow up observations with X-ray instruments may then be necessary to confirm the presence of the GRB afterglow component. At later times (\sim yrs) radio observations may be necessary to determine whether a supernova harbours an ultra-relativistic jet associated with an orphan afterglow (e.g. Soderberg et al., 2006; Corsi et al., 2016). As shown in Figure 1, there are around one to two confirmed GRB-SN events per year, with some small fluctuations from year to year. The use of large scale survey telescopes has made it easier than ever to detect new Ic-BL supernovae, with a large increase in detections since ZTF began operations in 2018. With future facilities, such as the Vera Rubin Observatory (Ivezić et al., 2019), surveying large sections of the sky each night, the detection rate of Ic-BL supernovae is expected to increase significantly. This is expected to lead to a large number of new GRB-SN events, including several orphan afterglows. More events means more data to be gathered and analysed and it is vital that these data are rapidly and easily accessible for the community. Figure 1: The Ic-BL classification rate has increased significantly over the past 27 years, with a larger number classified after 2018 with the advent of ZTF. GRB-SNe are marked in this plot, in cases where a spectroscopic confirmation was made. Sources: TNS and WISeREP. Existing repositories and webtools are not designed to meet the needs of GRB-SN astronomers. There are currently no tools which display all of the data for every GRB-SN association in one place and in a consistent way. In particular, though some tools such as the Open Supernova Catalogue222The public facing side of the OpenSN tool is no longer available as of March 8th 2022. The API remains available. (Guillochon et al., 2017) provide the optical and spectroscopic data for the events which were classified as Ic-BLs, this represents only half the sample, as many GRB-SN do not have a spectroscopically confirmed supernova. Furthermore there is usually no X-ray or radio data available on these tools, both of which are crucial for studying the GRB component. To access the full dataset, researchers must consult multiple sources. Retrieving the data in this way is a long and tedious process that results in duplication of effort. In some cases this data is only available from the original paper and often not in a machine readable format. In some cases these papers are locked behind a paywall, meaning the data may be unavailable to some researchers and to the public. The GRBSN webtool has been developed to solve this problem. The webtool’s database includes multiwavelength lightcurves as well as the bulk parameters of both the supernova and gamma-ray burst components. The catalogue currently consists of 61 GRB-SNe, making it the most comprehensive list of GRB-SN associations available to date. These events can be divided into 3 categories: 29 GRBs with a spectroscopically confirmed supernova (“Spectroscopic GRB-SN”), 31 GRBs with a photometrically confirmed supernova (“Photometric GRB-SN”) and 1 off-axis GRB detected through its association with a Ic-BL supernova (“Orphan GRB-SN”). With greater numbers of GRB-SNe expected to be discovered in the coming years, this tool has the potential to make the tracking and investigation of GRB-SN associations much simpler."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08820v1,Effects of Nontrivial Topology on Neutron Star Rotation and its Potential Observational Implications,"Rotational irregularities are one of the prominent observational features that most pulsars exhibit. These glitches, which are sudden increases in spin angular velocity, remains an open problem. In this study, we have investigated the potential role of nontrivial topological defects, specifically in the form of Nambu-goto-type CSs, and its connection to spin irregularities. Such CSs which are one-dimensional topological defects may be formed during various symmetry-breaking and phase transition scenarios and can interact with the neutron stars. In this work, we see that the appearance of such topological defects trapped within the core can lead to the coupling of the string tension with the angular velocity, leading to the abrupt rotational changes observed as pulsar glitches. We have further studied how these coupling may generate detectable gravitational waves as a mixture of continuous and burst signals. The evolution of cusps of CSs trapped within neutron stars and the neutron star’s mass quadruple moment change due to rotation could produce distinctive gravitational wave signatures, well within the noise cutoff of advLIGO. Our study highlights a potential connection between topological defects, pulsar glitches, and gravitational wave emissions, offering a possible avenue for observationally testing the presence of CSs and their astrophysical effects.","Compact stars such as Neutron stars (NS) formed from core collapsing supernova explosions have highly dense cores. Such NS has extreme physical conditions, like exceeding nuclear saturation densities, around 10^{15} g/cm3 or 1 baryon/fm3 number density, strong gravitational fields, and high rotational speeds, making them natural laboratories for testing the limits of fundamental physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Under such extreme condition, one of the model for the core is the overlapping of the baryons and pointing to a state of de-confined quark matter (QM) resulting in a phase transition (PT) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Various constraints on the maximum mass and radius of such stars has been implemented [13, 14] from the gravitational wave data of the binary merger GW 190814 [15], and from the observed pulsars PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0952-0607, and PSR J0030+0451 using both Bayesian analysis [16] and also using the frame work of Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity [17]. Recent studies in the field of high-energy astrophysics and condensed matter physics have shown the possible presence and significance of topological phases in strongly interacting matter, such as those found in the NS cores [18, 19, 20, 21]. The presence of stable, global features which cannot be removed by continuous deformations, describes a nontrivial topology such as vortex lines, domain walls, or cosmic strings (CS). In the case of NS, such topological defects (TD) are expected to form in the core, where densities are high enough to form color superconducting phases or QM and are governed by the principles of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [22, 23, 24]. In this work we have considered CSs which are hypothetical one-dimensional TDs that may have formed during PTs in the early universe. These defects, which are a consequence of symmetry-breaking processes, are modeled using the Nambu-Goto (NG) action expressed as the area of the string’s world-sheet, a two-dimensional surface traced out by the string as it moves [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. The action is written as: S=-\mu\int d^{2}\sigma\sqrt{-g} (1) where, \mu is the energy per unit length of the string, \sigma is the coordinates of the two dimensional world-sheet traced by the string and g is the determinant of the metric induced on the world-sheet. Transitions from a high-energy symmetric state to a lower-energy state with broken symmetry, described mathematically by the breaking of a larger symmetry group G to a smaller subgroup H. Now for a scalar field \Phi whose dynamics are governed by a potential with spontaneous symmetry breaking, at high energies, the field respects the symmetry group G. As the universe cools, the potential causes the field to settle into a vacuum manifold M=G/H, where H is the unbroken subgroup. CSs are associated with non-contractible loops in this vacuum manifold, which can be classified by the fundamental group \pi_{1}(M). If \pi_{1}(M)\neq 0, then the vacuum manifold supports CS solutions. Typically the breaking of a U(1) symmetry, where the vacuum manifold M is a circle S^{1}, whose fundamental group is the non-trivial, \pi_{1}(S^{1})=\mathbb{Z}. This non-trivial fundamental group implies that strings can form, and their winding number corresponds to elements of the group \mathbb{Z}, representing how many times the field winds around the vacuum manifold [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. Accordingly such TDs if formed in these phases arising from PT via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in the core of NS [36, 37, 38], could significantly affect the star’s internal structure and thus its rotational dynamics. NS rotate rapidly, often with periods ranging from milliseconds to seconds, and exhibit phenomena such as “glitches” which are sudden changes in their rotational speed. These glitches are thought to result from angular momentum exchange between different components of the star, such as the crust and the superfluid interior [39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. Recent theoretical work suggests that the presence of non-trivial topology within NS could modify their moment of inertia, leading to changes in their rotational frequency. For example, vortex lines in a superfluid phase may act as conduits for angular momentum transfer, while domain walls or other TDs could interact with the star’s magnetic field, leading to the dissipation or storage of rotational energy. These effects could manifest as changes in the star’s spin-down rate, or they may influence the timing and magnitude of observed glitches [44, 45, 46, 47]. Moreover, TDs could also affect the coupling between different layers of the star, further impacting its rotational dynamics. The potential observational implications of non-trivial topology in NS are quite possible. One of the most promising signatures of topological effects is the emission of gravitational waves. If TDs exist in the core, they could interact with the star’s rotation and magnetic field, producing gravitational wave signals that could be detectable by observatories like advLIGO and Virgo [48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53]. In summary, the study of NS glitches and spin-down irregularities could provide indirect evidence for the presence of topological structures and non-trivial topology. By linking topological phases of matter with observable astrophysical phenomena, some new insights could be gained into the physics of dense matter, the properties of quantum fields under extreme conditions, and the broader implications for astrophysical and cosmological models. The paper is structured as follows: In section II, we have defined the metric of a compact object coupled to a NG type defect. We have solved such a metric to obtain the rotational equation for the star and have also discussed various EoS that can arise due to a hadronic and a hybrid star. In section III, we have solved the rotational equation for various EoS and also across various energy density for the strings. Here we have also discussed about the universality of the rotational changes across EoSs. In section IV, we have discussed how the appearance of a TD can cause the spin up of the star and how radiative losses due to such strings can cause the star to lose angular momentum. In section V, we have discussed the possible gravitational wave signals for such a star and the detectibility of it in the advLIGO and Virgo detectors. In section VI we have drawn conclusions from the results obtained."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08762v1,Particle acceleration and multi-messenger radiation from Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources,"Super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass compact objects powers fast outflows in Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Such outflows, which can reach mildly relativistic velocities, are often observed forming bubble structures. Wind bubbles are expected to develop strong wind termination shocks, sites of great interest for diffusive shock acceleration. We develop a model of diffusive shock acceleration in the wind bubbles powered by ULXs. We find that the maximum energy in these objects can easily reach the PeV range, promoting ULX winds as a new class of PeVatrons. We specialize our model in the context of the Galactic source SS 433 and show that high-energy protons in the bubble might explain the highest energy photons (>100 TeV) and their morphology recently observed by LHAASO. We discuss the detectability of such a source in neutrinos and we analyze the possible radio counterpart of ULXs focusing on the case of W50, the nebula surrounding SS 433. We finally discuss the possible contribution of Galactic ULXs to the cosmic-ray flux at the knee concluding that their role might be substantial.","Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources (ULXs; see review King et al., 2023) are loosely defined as point-like sources located away from the galactic nucleus and characterized by fluxes which, assuming isotropic emission, translate to an X-ray luminosity L_{X}\gtrsim 10^{39}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}. Over the past decade our understanding of ULXs has vastly expanded, having identified almost 2000 ULXs until now (Walton et al., 2022). Moreover, after the discovery of pulsating ULXs (e.g Bachetti et al., 2014; Israel et al., 2017b; Amato et al., 2023) and various spectral studies (e.g. Pintore et al., 2014; Koliopanos et al., 2017) it is now widely accepted that ULX engines are fueled by super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass compact objects (Israel et al., 2017a), instead of sub-Eddington accretion onto intermediate mass black holes as early studies have suggested (Colbert & Mushotzky, 1999). Extreme accretion goes hand to hand with strong winds and outflows (Fabrika et al., 2015; Kaaret et al., 2017; Weng & Feng, 2018). Outflows have been seen in Galactic X-ray binaries hosting both neutron stars and black holes accreting below the Eddington limit (e.g. Ponti et al., 2012; Vincentelli et al., 2023). But perhaps one of the early arguments for super-Eddington accretion came from the studies of a low-mass X-ray binary Cyg X-2. King & Ritter (1999) argued that the system had survived a phase of extreme accretion (10^{-6}-10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1}) during which about only 0.1M_{\odot} was accreted and 2-3\leavevmode\nobreak\ M_{\odot} were expelled, suggesting that Cyg X-2 had once gone through a ULX phase. For ULXs, observing campaigns with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer of XMM-Newton, revealed the presence of blueshifted absorption features consistent with outflow velocities of 0.2-0.3c (e.g. Pinto et al., 2017, 2020). It should also be noted that the presence of these winds and their properties are also supported by simulations (Kitaki et al., 2021). These radiative driven outflows are optically thick and can reprocess the accretion luminosity, while due to their inhomogeneity they imprint variability onto the X-ray emission and spectral hardness (Middleton et al., 2015; Gúrpide et al., 2021). The basic idea is that these optically thick outflows block escaping radiation along certain line of sights allowing a distant observer to only view the central engine along a narrow funnel. This geometric structure would cause collimation of the radiation - commonly referred to as beaming - along the funnel, and block radiation for an edge-on observer. Since beaming enhancement would be proportional to mass accretion rate (King, 2009), the majority of ULXs could be perhaps hidden from us due to their unfavorable orientation. One of those hidden ULXs is the Galactic source SS 433, where studies have argued that the central engine accretes at a rate of 10^{-5}-10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1} (Shkovskii, 1981). The properties of the outflows in SS 433 have been recently studied by Middleton et al. (2021). The authors modeled broadband X-ray spectra from NuSTAR and demonstrated that emission is consistent with reflection from the outflow funnel walls with outflow velocity of 0.15-0.3c and a wind-cone half-opening angle of 10 degrees. Cygnus X-3 has been recently characterized as another hidden ULX by IXPE observations (Veledina et al., 2024a). Specifically, the authors found that the energy-independent linear polarization is orthogonal to the direction of the radio ejections, indicating the presence of a collimating outflow with a half-opening angle less than 15 degrees. While, subsequent studies have also suggested that a face-on observer would observe Cygnus X-3 with an apparent luminosity 5\cdot 10^{39}\rm erg\,s^{-1}, making the system a bonafide ULX (Veledina et al., 2024b). Quasi-spherical shocked ionized structures are typically observed in association with ULXs (see e.g. Pakull & Mirioni, 2002; Soria et al., 2021; Gúrpide et al., 2022). These structures can extend for more than 10^{2} pc in diameter implying Myr lifetime of the associated engine. These observations suggest that ULX-driven winds are not only resulting in relatively collimated jets, but typically they expand with wide opening angle forming a bubble structure (Belfiore et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2022, 2023). Wind bubbles are extremely interesting objects in the context of high-energy astrophysics as they can provide an ideal environment for diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). In fact, the evolution of wind bubbles results in the formation of strong shocks (Weaver et al., 1977; Koo & McKee, 1992), where cosmic rays (CRs) can be accelerated. In the context of DSA, the high velocity of ULX winds is of particular interest as the acceleration timescale of CRs is expected to scale as the inverse of the second power of the wind speed (Drury, 1983). This would make ULX winds extremely efficient accelerators up to the PeV range, which is believed to be the range of maximum energy for Galactic CR sources (Blasi, 2013; Gabici et al., 2019). The nature of the Galactic CR accelerators at PeV energies, often referred to as PeVatrons (Cristofari, 2021), is one of the main open questions in the CR community that has not found an answer yet. However, recent gamma-ray observations performed by LHAASO (Cao et al., 2024) identified several Galactic sources whose non-thermal radiation clearly implies the presence of PeV particles. Interestingly, some of these sources are observed in coincidence with Galactic hidden ULXs (LHAASO Collaboration, 2024), thereby providing support to the hypothesis that ULXs are a new class of PeVatrons. Fast winds from stellar-mass compact objects and microquasars were known as sites of non-thermal emission (see e.g. Romero & Orellana, 2005; Escobar et al., 2021, 2022; Abaroa et al., 2023) as well as potential site for PeV acceleration (Abaroa et al., 2024). In this work, we develop a model of DSA taking place in the wind bubbles excavated by ULXs. We do so by solving the energy-dependent and space-dependent transport equation, and analyzing the possible multi-messenger implications in terms of CRs, gamma rays, radio and high-energy neutrinos. Our investigation shows that ULXs wind bubbles are extremely promising cosmic accelerators that in several conditions can energize CR protons up to the PeV range. Therefore, we propose Galactic ULXs as a novel class of PeVatron candidates through DSA. The manuscript is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we outline the ULXs wind-bubble structure and the acceleration and transport model for non-thermal particles. In Sec. 3 we present our results in terms of accelerated particle spectra and maximum energies achieved at ULX wind shocks. In Sec. 4 we apply our model to SS 433, a hidden Galactic ULX, and discuss our predictions in light of recent gamma-ray observations at very high energies. We also analyze the possible neutrino and radio counterpart of our ULX bubble model. In Sec. 5 we discuss the contribution of Galactic ULXs to the observed cosmic-ray flux at Earth at energies close the knee of the spectrum. Finally, we conclude in Sec. 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08658v1,Probing cosmic chemical enrichment with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories,"By observing binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to the edge of the Universe, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will map the BBH merger rate across all of cosmic history. This merger rate traces the formation rate of their progenitor stars convolved with a delay time distribution. Given theoretically-motivated priors on the delay time distribution, we show how XG observations can measure the BBH progenitor formation rate, probing the star formation rate (SFR) up to z>15. However, the progenitor formation rate does not directly give a measurement of the SFR, but rather a combination of the SFR and its metallicity distribution as a function of redshift. Fortunately, the metallicity-dependence of BBH formation likely varies as a function of BBH mass and/or formation channel. We find that if different BBH subpopulations with distinct metallicity biases can be identified, comparing their rates as a function of redshift yields a simultaneous measurement of the SFR and its metallicity distribution. Given optimistic theoretical priors and one year of observation, this may provide a \sim 10\% measurement of the SFR at its peak and a 0.2 dex (0.7 dex) measurement of the median metallicity out to z=10 (z=15) at 90% credibility, although the uncertainties scale with theoretical uncertainties on BBH delay times and formation efficiencies.","The current generation of ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA are surveying the population of merging compact object binaries out to redshifts z\lesssim 2 (LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al., 2015; Acernese et al., 2015; Akutsu et al., 2021). In their first three observing runs, the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observatory network detected \approx 70 binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to z\approx 1 (Abbott et al., 2019, 2021a, 2023a). At design A+ sensitivity, the LVK network will observe hundreds to thousands of merging BBHs out to z\approx 2 (Borhanian & Sathyaprakash, 2022). The growing GW catalog is expanding our understanding of the BBH population and their progenitor stars. With hundreds of events, we can map the population properties of BBH systems, including how their merger rate varies with mass, spin and merger redshift, over the Universe’s past 10 billion years. The existing observations are revealing features in the BBH population, including peaks and dips in the mass distribution, correlations between BBH masses and spins, and evolution of the BBH merger rate with redshift (e.g. Fishbach & Holz, 2017; Talbot & Thrane, 2018; Fishbach et al., 2018; Abbott et al., 2021b; Tiwari & Fairhurst, 2021; Edelman et al., 2023; Callister & Farr, 2024; Farah et al., 2023; Callister et al., 2021; Abbott et al., 2023b). The proposed next-generation of ground-based GW observatories, including Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, would be sensitive enough to detect BBH mergers with total masses above 10\,M_{\odot} out to z\approx 30 (Hall & Evans, 2019; Maggiore et al., 2020; Kalogera et al., 2021; Evans et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2023; Branchesi et al., 2023). As Vitale et al. (2019) showed, this would enable a direct measurement of the BBH merger rate over the entire history of the Universe, from the very first mergers to the present day. The redshift evolution of the BBH merger rate informs a combination of their progenitor formation history and the delay time distribution between progenitor formation and BBH merger. For the remainder of this work, we assume that BBH systems are the remnants of massive stellar evolution (as opposed to, e.g., primordial BHs; Carr & Kühnel 2020). Starting from a massive star origin, the formation of merging BBH systems may involve isolated binary evolution and/or stellar dynamics (see, e.g. Mapelli, 2021; Mandel & Farmer, 2022, for reviews). Isolated binary evolution may include stable mass transfer (van den Heuvel, 1976; Neijssel et al., 2019; Gallegos-Garcia et al., 2021), unstable mass transfer leading to a common envelope (Paczynski, 1976; Dominik et al., 2012), and chemically homogeneous evolution (de Mink & Mandel, 2016; Marchant et al., 2016). Meanwhile, dynamical assembly may occur in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters (Kulkarni et al., 1993; Sigurdsson & Hernquist, 1993; Rodriguez et al., 2015), nuclear star clusters (Antonini & Rasio, 2016) (possibly involving a central supermassive BH; Rose et al. 2022), and the disks of active galactic nuclei (McKernan et al., 2014; Rowan et al., 2023), and involves dynamical friction and three-body interactions leading to binary hardening, exchanges and ejections. There are environments in which both binary stellar evolution and dynamical processes are relevant, including stellar triples (Thompson, 2011; Antonini et al., 2017) and young star clusters (Rastello et al., 2020). 1.1 Progenitor formation rate and dependence on metallicity Regardless of formation channel, as long as BBH systems have a stellar origin, the BBH progenitor formation rate depends on the properties of stellar populations across cosmic history, including the star formation rate, the stellar initial mass function (IMF), the initial chemical composition (metallicity) of stars, their binary fraction, and the star forming environment, such as whether stars form in a dense cluster or near a supermassive BH. The conditions of star formation vary significantly over cosmic time (Madau & Dickinson, 2014). The initial metallicity (particularly the iron abundance) of progenitor stars is especially relevant for BBH formation (Belczynski et al. 2010; see Chruślińska 2024 for a review). The high iron opacity in outer stellar layers drives stellar winds, which leads to mass loss and increased radial expansion (Kudritzki & Puls, 2000). This means that higher-metallicity stars with a greater iron abundance are less likely to retain enough mass in their cores to collapse to a BH, particularly one more massive than \sim 10\,M_{\odot}. Furthermore, high-metallicity stars are more likely to merge with their stellar companion due to the increased radial expansion, preempting BBH formation in isolated binaries. Supernova natal kicks, which can disrupt binary systems, may also be larger at higher metallicities. The effect of metallicity on BBH formation efficiency is amplified by the other properties of star formation that correlate with metallicity. For example, there are indications that the low-metallicity IMF favors more massive stars, which would increase the number of BHs formed (Li et al., 2023; Klessen & Glover, 2023; Hennebelle & Grudić, 2024). The fraction of star formation that occurs in dense stellar clusters is also thought to be higher at low metallicity, which increases the rate of BBH mergers driven by stellar dynamics (Lamers et al., 2017; El-Badry et al., 2019; Reina-Campos et al., 2019; Belokurov & Kravtsov, 2023). Thus, within most proposed formation channels, the formation of merging BBH systems is thought to be more efficient at low metallicities compared to high metallicities, although the details depend on the formation channel. The theoretical expectation that BBH formation is more efficient at low metallicities is consistent with current observations of BBH mergers at z\lesssim 1. The overall star formation peaks at redshift z\approx 2–3, while the star-forming metallicity increases monotonically with time (decreasing redshift) as stars enrich their environments with heavy elements during their lives and deaths. The steep evolution of the BBH merger rate, as inferred from the latest GW catalog GWTC-3 (Abbott et al., 2023b), favors a combination of short delay times and a progenitor formation rate that peaks at higher redshifts than the Madau & Fragos (2017) SFR, consistent with the low-metallicity SFR (Fishbach & Kalogera, 2021; Vijaykumar et al., 2023; Karathanasis et al., 2023; Fishbach & van Son, 2023; Turbang et al., 2024; Schiebelbein-Zwack & Fishbach, 2024). 1.2 Delay time distributions The delay time for merging binaries refers to the time between the formation of the progenitor stars and the merger of the BBH. This timescale is dominated by the GW inspiral time, which depends on how closely the two BHs can be brought together by their evolutionary pathway. For circular binaries, the inspiral time scales with the initial orbital separation as \tau_{\mathrm{insp}}\propto a^{4} (Peters, 1964). The delay time experienced by a given BBH merger is drawn from a probability distribution referred to as the delay time distribution. Regardless of formation channel, the delay time distribution is generally predicted to have a long tail towards long delay times because of the steep dependence of the GW inspiral time on the orbital separation: increasing the orbital separation only slightly results in a much longer delay time. The specific delay time distribution is determined by the evolutionary pathway. Within isolated binary evolution, it is generally expected that common envelope can lead to shorter delay times than stable mass transfer because a successful common envelope ejection can shrink the binary orbit more effectively (Gallegos-Garcia et al., 2021; van Son et al., 2022a). According to population synthesis models, common envelope evolution generally yields delay time distributions that can be approximated by power laws with slopes \alpha\approx-1, while stable mass transfer yields distributions with shallower slopes, although the details depend on uncertain physical parameters (Fishbach & van Son, 2023). Within dynamical assembly, the delay time distribution depends on the mass and size of the star cluster, with more massive, denser clusters leading to tighter BBH systems with shorter delay times between star cluster formation and BBH merger (Hong et al., 2018; Rodriguez & Loeb, 2018). For a realistic cluster mass function, the predicted delay time distribution is usually well-described by a power-law slope \approx-1 (Rodriguez et al., 2019; Ye & Fishbach, 2024). 1.3 Binary black hole subpopulations In reality, multiple evolutionary pathways, with different progenitor formation rates and delay time distributions, may contribute to the BBH population. Ng et al. (2021) argued that a combination of different subpopulations, including the remnants of the first (Pop III) stars, remnants of Pop II isolated binary evolution, and dynamically-assembled binaries in star clusters, may create multiple peaks in the BBH merger rate as a function of redshift. They showed that these different subpopulations could be identified by measuring the redshift evolution of the BBH merger rate with XG observatories. In addition to having different merger redshift distributions, BBH subpopulations from distinct formation channels exhibit different mass and spin distributions. Indeed, there are already indications that the BBH population consists of a superposition of distinct subpopulations from different formation channels, characterized by unique mass, spin and redshift features (Zevin et al., 2021b; Wong et al., 2021; Godfrey et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024; Ray et al., 2024). BBH systems that were dynamically assembled in dense star clusters, which can be identified by their isotropic distribution of spin orientations (Rodriguez et al., 2016), may dominate the merger rate at high component masses \gtrsim 30\,M_{\odot}, perhaps explaining the peak in the BBH mass spectrum at \sim 35\,M_{\odot} (Godfrey et al., 2023; Ray et al., 2024). This is in line with some theoretical models (Antonini et al., 2023). The highest mass BBH systems may be explained by repeated, hierarchical mergers in dense clusters, which cause these systems to be spinning more rapidly (Fishbach et al., 2017; Gerosa & Berti, 2017; Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021; Kimball et al., 2021; Li et al., 2024; Pierra et al., 2024). In the future, if orbital eccentricity can be robustly measured from the GW signal, it would provide a powerful discriminator for dynamical assembly that can place constraints on the formation history of globular clusters (Rodriguez et al., 2018; Samsing, 2018; Zevin et al., 2021a, a; Romero-Shaw et al., 2021). Among BBH mergers from isolated binary evolution, population synthesis models suggest that evolution involving a common envelope phase may dominate the merger rate at low component masses \sim 10\,M_{\odot}, while stable mass transfer may contribute more at higher masses (van Son et al., 2022a). Post-common envelope systems may experience tidal spin up, leading to second-born BHs with larger spins (Zaldarriaga et al., 2018; Bavera et al., 2020; Olejak & Belczynski, 2021). Even within a fixed BBH evolutionary channel, the formation efficiency and delay time distribution may correlate with BBH mass and spin. For example, within isolated binary evolution channels, population synthesis studies often predict that the formation efficiency of high-mass BBH mergers depends most strongly on metallicity, with low-mass BBH mergers (component masses \lesssim 10\,M_{\odot}) and BNS mergers exhibiting only mild, if any, dependence on metallicity (Giacobbo & Mapelli, 2018; Klencki et al., 2018; Neijssel et al., 2019; Iorio et al., 2023, although see Gallegos-Garcia et al. 2023). This means that high-mass BBH mergers probably prefer to form at higher redshifts compared to low-mass systems. Meanwhile, the delay time distribution from common envelope evolution may correlate with the spins of the BBH because of the correlation between tidal spin up and the orbital separation of the BBH (Qin et al., 2018; Bavera et al., 2022). Dense star clusters probably merge more massive BBHs faster than low-mass BBHs because of mass segregation (Belczynski et al., 2022; Ye & Fishbach, 2024). In this work, we make use of the fact that different subpopulations of binary compact object mergers (as identified based on their masses and/or spins) may trace different progenitor metallicities with different delay time distributions. We consider a simplified toy model in which the different subpopulations are perfectly identified from their masses and spins. If we have a theoretical expectation of the delay time distribution corresponding to each subpopulation, we can propagate sources back to their formation redshifts (Fishbach & van Son, 2023). Then, by measuring the formation rate of each subpopulation as a function of redshift and comparing them, we can disentangle the overall SFR and its metallicity dependence, as emphasized by Chruślińska (2024). The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In §2, we describe our model for the metallicity-specific SFR and explain its relationship to the BBH merger rate. We simulate populations of mock BBH mergers in §3, discuss their consistency with current LVK data, and show how XG detectors can reconstruct the merger rate as a function of redshift. In §4, we describe how to deconvolve the inferred merger rates with a theory-motivated prior on the delay time distribution, yielding a measurement of the BBH progenitor formation rate for each subpopulation (§4.1). Combining this with a theory-motivated prior on the BBH formation efficiency, we show how XG detectors can measure metallicity as a function of redshift (§4.2). We conclude in §5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08630v1,Black hole jets on the scale of the Cosmic Web,"Jets launched by supermassive black holes transport relativistic leptons, magnetic fields, and atomic nuclei from the centres of galaxies to their outskirts and beyond. These outflows embody the most energetic pathway by which galaxies respond to their Cosmic Web environment. Studying black hole feedback is an astrophysical frontier, providing insights on star formation, galaxy cluster stability, and the origin of cosmic rays, magnetism, and heavy elements throughout the Universe. This feedback’s cosmological importance is ultimately bounded by the reach of black hole jets, and could be sweeping if jets travel far at early epochs. Here we present the joint LOFAR–uGMRT–Keck discovery of a black hole jet pair extending over 7 megaparsecs — the largest galaxy-made structure ever found. The outflow, seen 7.5 gigayears into the past, spans two-thirds of a typical cosmic void radius, thus penetrating voids at {\sim}95\% probability. This system demonstrates that jets can avoid destruction by magnetohydrodynamical instabilities over cosmological distances, even at epochs when the Universe was 15–7 times denser than it is today. Whereas previous record-breaking outflows were powered by radiatively inefficient active galactic nuclei, this outflow is powered by a radiatively efficient active galactic nucleus, a type common at early epochs. If, as implied, a population of early void-penetrating outflows existed, then black hole jets could have overwritten the fields from primordial magnetogenesis. This outflow shows that energy transport from supermassive black holes operates on scales of the Cosmic Web and raises the possibility that cosmic rays and magnetism in the intergalactic medium have a non-local, cross-void origin.","1 Main text Nearly every galaxy harbours a spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH) in its centre. The episodic infall of dust, gas, and stars is believed to activate the Blandford–Znajek mechanism [5], in which electric and magnetic fields convert black hole spin to kinetic energy carried by electrons and positrons. These leptons form a pair of jets: collimated, relativistic flows along the spin axis that point away from the galactic centre. Supported by helical magnetic fields [e.g. 58], the most powerful jets avoid disruption by stellar winds [e.g. 54] and entrain wind-borne atomic nuclei [e.g. 77], while blasting off towards intergalactic space. These jet-driven outflows comprise the majority of bright sources in the known radio sky. To clarify the impact of black hole energy transport on the intergalactic medium (IGM), recent studies [e.g. 14, 47, 48, 45] searched for Mpc-scale outflows: Nature’s largest, and often most powerful, jet systems. The International LOFAR Telescope [ILT; 70] has emerged as the prime instrument for their discovery and characterisation. Our team systematically scanned the ILT’s ongoing northern sky survey at wavelength \lambda=2.08\ \mathrm{m} both with machine learning and by eye — the latter with significant contributions from citizen scientists [26]. This endeavour has increased the number of known Mpc-scale outflows from a few hundred to over eleven thousand [45]. Our largest find is the outflow shown in Fig. 1, which we name Porphyrion. Figure 1: Deep radio images of a 7 Mpc–long, black hole–driven outflow at central wavelengths \lambda=2.08\ \mathrm{m} (top) and \lambda=0.46\ \mathrm{m} (bottom). These images were taken with the ILT and uGMRT, respectively, and have resolutions of 6.2^{\prime\prime} and 4.3^{\prime\prime}. The top panel’s inset shows ILT VLBI imagery at \lambda=2.08\ \mathrm{m} and a resolution of 0.4^{\prime\prime}. The bottom panel’s inset shows Legacy Survey DR10 optical–infrared imagery. The larger images cover 15^{\prime}\times 15^{\prime} of sky area, whilst the insets cover 1^{\prime}\times 1^{\prime}. For scale, we show the stellar Milky Way disk (diameter: 50 kpc) and a ten times inflated version. The source, of angular length \phi=13.4^{\prime}\pm 0.1^{\prime}, is unusually thin. It consists of a northern lobe, a northern jet, a core, a southern jet with an inner hotspot, and a southern outer hotspot with a backflow. To investigate from which of two radio-emitting galaxies halfway along the jet axis the outflow originates, we processed ILT very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) data of the central 4^{\prime}\times 4^{\prime}. At a spatial resolution of 3\ \mathrm{kpc}, the image (Fig. 1’s top panel inset) shows lone, unresolved radio sources in these galaxies, in both cases implying active accretion onto an SMBH. Because the detection of jets near either black hole (and along the overarching NNE–SSW axis) would clarify Porphyrion’s origin, we performed deep follow-up observations with the Upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at \lambda=0.46\ \mathrm{m}. The resulting image and ancillary optical–infrared data (Fig. 1’s bottom panel) reveal that the outflow protrudes from a massive (M_{\star}=6.7\begin{subarray}{c}+1.4\\ -1.4\end{subarray}\cdot 10^{11}\ M_{\odot}) galaxy. We observed this galaxy with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer [LRIS; 51, 41, 64, 61] on the W. M. Keck Observatory’s Keck I Telescope, measuring a spectroscopic redshift z=0.896\pm 0.001 (Fig. 2). Figure 2: Both rest-frame ultraviolet–optical spectroscopy (top) and radio–ultraviolet photometry (bottom) demonstrate that the outflow’s host galaxy harbours an RE AGN. Top: LRIS spectrum exhibiting hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and neon emission. The forbidden lines from multiply ionised oxygen and neon (dark red) could not be generated by even the hottest stars, and instead stem from the narrow-line region of an RE AGN at a redshift z=0.896\pm 0.001. Bottom: Bayesian inference of the galaxy’s SED (Methods) favours the presence of an AGN accretion disk (dark blue) with an obscuring torus (purple), again indicating radiative efficiency. We witness Porphyrion at t_{\mathrm{BB}}=6.3\ \mathrm{Gyr} after the Big Bang. The outflow’s angular length and redshift entail a sky-projected length l_{\mathrm{p}}=6.43\pm 0.05\ \mathrm{Mpc}. This makes Porphyrion the projectively longest known structure generated by an astrophysical body. The outflow’s total length exceeds this projected length, but by how much depends on the unknown inclination of the jets with respect to the sky plane. Deprojection formulae [48] predict a total length l=6.8\begin{subarray}{c}+1.2\\ -0.3\end{subarray}\ \mathrm{Mpc}, with expectation \mathbb{E}[L\ |\ L_{\mathrm{p}}=l_{\mathrm{p}}]=7.28\pm 0.05\ \mathrm{Mpc} (Methods). We thus estimate Porphyrion to be {\sim}7\ \mathrm{Mpc} long in total. Spanning {\sim}66\% of the radius of a typical cosmic void at its redshift, the outflow is truly cosmological. The fact that outflows exceeding 4 Mpc have been known since the 1970s [76], whilst those exceeding 5 Mpc remained undiscovered half a century of technological progress later, hitherto suggested a physical limit to outflow growth near 5 Mpc. Our finding proves this suggestion false. Surprisingly, SMBH jets can remain collimated over several megaparsecs, despite the growth of (magneto)hydrodynamical (MHD) instabilities — chiefly Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities — predicted theoretically and seen in simulations of shorter jets [e.g. 53]. No MHD simulations of Mpc-scale jets yet exist: the spatio-temporal grids required imply a numerical cost {\sim}10^{2} times higher than that of state-of-the-art runs. Outflows like Porphyrion thus offer a window into a jet physics regime that, at present, cannot be explored numerically. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) with accretion disks extending to the innermost stable circular orbits of their SMBHs efficiently convert the gravitational potential energy of infalling matter into radiation, and are thus called radiatively efficient (RE); all others are called radiatively inefficient (RI) [27, 23]. In RE AGN, the luminous accretion disk photo-ionises a circumnuclear region emitting narrow, and often forbidden, spectral lines. The Keck-observed prominence of forbidden ultraviolet–optical lines from oxygen and neon (chiefly that of the [O III]\lambda5007 line, which is 10.3\pm 0.2 times brighter than the H\beta line) therefore reveals the presence of an RE AGN [7]. By contrast, all previous record-length outflows, such as 3C 236 (l_{\mathrm{p}}=4.6\ \mathrm{Mpc}; [76]), J1420–0545 (l_{\mathrm{p}}=4.9\ \mathrm{Mpc}; [39]), and Alcyoneus (l_{\mathrm{p}}=5.0\ \mathrm{Mpc}; [47]), are fuelled by RI AGN in recent history (t_{\mathrm{BB}}=10.2–12.4\ \mathrm{Gyr}). Whereas RI AGN occur primarily in evolved, ‘red and dead’ ellipticals [27], RE AGN feature vigorous gas inflows and are thus generally found in star-forming galaxies. Indeed, in the first billions of years of cosmic time, RE AGN dominated the radio-bright AGN population [75]. The potential of Mpc-scale outflows to spread cosmic rays (CRs), heat, heavy atoms, and magnetic fields through the IGM is particularly high if large specimina could emerge from the type of AGN abundant at early epochs, when the Universe’s volume was smaller. The discovery of a 7\ \mathrm{Mpc}–long, RE AGN–fuelled outflow before cosmic half-time therefore highlights the hitherto understudied cosmological transport capabilities of Mpc-scale outflows. Figure 3: By superimposing Porphyrion’s total length and radio luminosity (green dot) on evolutionary tracks from dynamical modelling (red–white–blue curves), we infer the outflow’s two-sided jet power and age. We assume the host galaxy to reside in a galaxy group bordering voids, through which the jets eventually travel. The host galaxy likely inhabits a Cosmic Web filament. Vast voids, which make up the bulk ({\sim}80\%) of the Universe’s volume [20], surround such massive structures in most directions. Jets as long as Porphyrion’s encounter void-like densities and temperatures with high probability ({\sim}95\%; Methods). Indeed, the collimated nature of the jets favours scenarios in which they descend into voids, as jets gain resilience against Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities when the ambient density declines [e.g. 53]. Dynamical modelling suggests a two-sided jet power Q=1.3\pm 0.1\cdot 10^{39}\ \mathrm{W} and an age T=1.9\begin{subarray}{c}+0.7\\ -0.2\end{subarray}\ \mathrm{Gyr} (Fig. 3; Methods). The outflow’s average expansion speed v=0.012\ c, comparable to Alcyoneus’ [47]. In voids and the warm–hot IGM, the speed of sound c_{\mathrm{s}}\sim 10^{0}–10^{1}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}: the jets grow hypersonically at Mach numbers \mathcal{M}\sim 10^{2}–10^{3} and drive strong shocks into voids. Porphyrion’s jets have carried an energy E=QT=8\begin{subarray}{c}+2\\ -1\end{subarray}\cdot 10^{55}\ \mathrm{J} into the IGM — an amount comparable to the energy released during galaxy cluster mergers [e.g. 71]. This suggests that the outflow is among the most energetic post–Big Bang events to have occurred in its Cosmic Web region. Even though the SMBH might have gained a significant fraction of its mass while powering the jets (\Delta M_{\bullet}>2\frac{E}{c^{2}}=9\begin{subarray}{c}+2\\ -1\end{subarray}\cdot 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}), it appears to have maintained a constant spin axis throughout gigayears of activity. Shocks running perpendicular to the jets dissipate enough heat into the filament to increase its temperature by \Delta T\sim 10^{7}\ \mathrm{K} and its radius by \Delta r\sim 10^{-1}–10^{0}\ \mathrm{Mpc} (Methods). Outflows like Porphyrion thus locally alter the Cosmic Web’s shape. Figure 3 illustrates that the radio luminosity — and, consequently, the radio surface brightness — of constant–jet power, Mpc-long outflows decreases over time. As Fig. 1 evinces, Porphyrion borders on the noise of leading current-day telescopes; all outflows further progressed on the same evolutionary track hitherto evade detection. Similar outflows at higher redshifts or at lower jet powers, and similar but less slenderly shaped outflows, are likewise undetectable. More generally, statistical modelling [48] suggests that the detectable population is just the tip of the iceberg: owing to their low radio surface brightnesses, most Mpc-scale outflows are still concealed by noise. These arguments imply the existence of a hidden population of outflows with sizes comparable to, and possibly larger than, Porphyrion’s. Figure 4: Leptons escaping from the lobes of void-penetrating Mpc-scale outflows diffuse rapidly in weakly magnetised voids. For a single void, and through cosmic time, we show the volumetric fraction filled by electrons and positrons (with 1\ \mathrm{GeV} of initial energy) originating from Porphyrion. Equally energetic protons diffuse faster, given their minimal inverse Compton losses to the CMB. We consider diffusion through turbulent magnetic fields with strengths B and coherence lengths \lambda_{\mathrm{c}}\sim 1\ \mathrm{Mpc} (spanning a factor two; see translucent bands). The hatched strip marks the time prior to Porphyrion’s observed state during which its lobes likely (with probability {>}80\%) penetrated voids. Mpc-scale outflows long enough to breach filaments, such as Porphyrion, transport large quantities of heavy atoms and CRs into voids [4]. In particular, Mpc-scale jets endow \mathrm{Mpc}^{3}-scale volumes in voids with metallicities Z\sim 10^{-3}–10^{-2}\ Z_{\odot} (Methods). Furthermore, we predict that — in voids — the jet- and buoyancy-dominated phases of outflow dynamics are followed by a diffusion phase. Figure 4 shows the time evolution of the volume-filling fraction of CRs escaping from a void-penetrating lobe. Many particles undergo this fate: the lobe leaks CR energy at a rate P\sim 10^{30}\ \mathrm{W}\sim 10^{3}\ L_{\odot} (Methods), equivalent to a flux of {\sim}10^{39} 1 GeV–particles per second.111However, in the context of lobe energetics, this loss channel is negligible. For example, as P\sim 10^{-9}\ Q, jet power fluctuations have a far greater effect [e.g. 74]. The weaker the magnetic fields in voids initially are (see annotations), the greater the mean free path of the diffusing CRs is, and thus the more rapidly they disperse. If these CRs spread an amount of magnetic energy comparable to their own energy, as suggested by equipartition at source, then a single void-penetrating lobe could fill its void with a magnetic field of strength B\sim 10^{-16}–10^{-15}\ \mathrm{G} within a Hubble time (Methods). Diffusion-driven magnetisation is self-regulating: as the magnetic field strength rises, the mean free path falls, slowing further diffusion. This mechanism for astrophysical magnetogenesis generates fields consistent with constraints from GeV gamma-ray searches around TeV blazars [e.g. 46, 10]. Porphyrion indicates that RE AGN may be at least as effective at generating Mpc-scale outflows as RI AGN are in the Local Universe. If the comoving number density of actively powered Mpc-scale outflows has remained roughly constant over time at {\sim}10^{1}\ (100\ \mathrm{Mpc})^{-3} [48, 45], and a comoving volume of (100\ \mathrm{Mpc})^{3} contains {\sim}10^{1} voids [13], then there would exist {\sim}1 actively powered Mpc-scale outflow near every void at every instant. As Mpc-scale outflows are powered for {\sim}10^{-2}–10^{0}\ \mathrm{Gyr} [e.g. 25, 47], {\sim}10^{2} Mpc-scale outflows may have been generated near every void throughout cosmic history. Only few ({\sim}0.5\%)222A single Mpc-scale outflow may penetrate two or more voids. would need to extend into voids to make CR diffusion from leaky lobes common enough to magnetise the Universe to the observed levels. Our work suggests that void magnetic fields only trace primordial fields if the latter were strong; otherwise, primordial signals are readily overwritten by void-penetrating Mpc-scale outflows. Rather than stemming from the Early Universe, magnetism in voids could thus trace the history of black hole energy transport on the scale of the Cosmic Web."

AGN B2 2234+28A and 3C 454.3","Axion-photon oscillation effect provides a possible explanation for the presence of very-high-energy (VHE) \gamma-ray signals from distant sources. In this work, we propose a model-dependent method to select possible sources that may give sufficient constraints on the axion parameters. We investigate such effect in the spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) B2 2234+28A and 3C 454.3 based on data obtained from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and MAGIC U.L. We utilize the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to fit the axion parameters, yielding a result of g_{a\gamma}=3.05^{+0.51}_{-0.31}\times 10^{-11} GeV-1 for the axion-photon coupling strength and m_{a}=5.25^{+2.35}_{-2.65}\times 10^{-8} eV for the axion mass. We also perform 95% confidence level (CL) constraints to set an upper limit for g_{a\gamma}.","I INTRODUCTION The hypothetical pseudoscalar boson called axion originate from addressing the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Existence of analogous particles known as axion-like particles (ALPs) are also predicted by theories beyond the Standard Model such as string theory[7, 8], and have been considered as potential constituents of dark matter[9, 10, 11, 12]. ALP’s coupling with high energy photons leads to ALP-photon oscillation under transverse external magnetic field [13, 14, 15]. Many laboratory experiments are currently seeking ALP’s via this effect [16, 17], such as CAST [18], OSQAR [19, 20] and PVLAS [21, 22]. The conversion effect also suggests the feasibility of probing ALPs via astrophysical methods, i.e., through modifications in \gamma-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Specifically, ALP-photon oscillation reduces the photon loss due to annihilation with extragalactic background light (EBL) [23, 24, 25, 26, 27], leading to high energy photons that have considerably small probabilities of arrival on Earth being observed [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. Many prior works have been conducted utilizing such effect to constrain ALP parameters based on spectra of very high energy (VHE) \gamma-ray emission of TeV scale from sources such as Gamma Ray Burst 221009A (GRB 221009A) [34, 35], the Crab Nebula [36], Markarian 421 (Mrk421) [37, 38, 39, 40], Mrk 501 and M87 [41]. Despite the robustness of AGN spectrum data, only those spectra that exhibit observable modifications under ALP theory can provide stringent constraints on ALP parameters. It should be noted that while higher energy photons are more likely to undergo ALP oscillation, the detection of such \gamma-ray does not necessarily indicate efficient ALP modification. The relatively short distance of low redshift sources may diminish the effect of EBL absorption, allowing the transmission of VHE photons without ALP effects. An example of this is M87, from which photons ranging from GeV to TeV orders are observed [42, 43, 44]. However, the source cannot provide stringent constraints[41] because the main mechanism that enables the detection of its VHE photons is related to its relatively short distance from Earth, rather than any potential ALP effect. Therefore, we develop a source selection method that takes into account both the ALP oscillations at high energy scale and the reduced EBL absorption at low redshifts. This approach allows us to identify potential sources whose photons would indeed experience ALP oscillations during their journey through space under ALP theories and subsequently alter the Spectral energy distribution (SED). Using such method, we target our constraints on \gamma-ray observations of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) B2 2234+28A (B2A, z=0.790) and 3C 454.3 (3C4, z=0.859). B2A exhibited significantly increased activity in the GeV energy band in the recent decade [45], while 3C4 was once one of the brightest \gamma-ray sources in the sky [46] and photons of TeV scale was recently detected. The amplified \gamma-ray signals of both sources were observed by Fermi-LAT [47, 48] and MAGIC [49, 50, 51], covering an energy range of 1 GeV to 10 TeV, sufficient to conduct stringent constraints given the high redshifts of the two sources. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we briefly introduce the interstellar propagation of photons considering both EBL absorption and ALP-photon oscillation. In Section III, we present our method to select potential sources whose spectrum would exhibit apparent strengthening in the flux of high-energy photons, based on the critical energy for ALP-photon oscillation and its influence on photon propagation probability. In section IV, we describe the statistical and programming method used to analyze the observational data. The derived constraints, complemented by a detailed analysis, are presented in Section V. Finally, we summarize our results and conclusions in Section VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08572v1,"Large Gravitational Wave Phase Shifts 
from Strong 3-body Interactions in Dense Stellar Clusters","The phase evolution of gravitational waves (GWs) can be modulated by the astrophysical environment surrounding the source, which provides a probe for the origin of individual binary black holes (BBHs) using GWs alone. We here study the evolving phase of the GW waveform derived from a large set of simulations of BBH mergers forming in dense stellar clusters through binary-single interactions. We uncover that a well-defined fraction of the assembled eccentric GW sources will have a notable GW phase shift induced by the remaining third object. The magnitude of the GW phase shift often exceeds conservative analytical estimates due to strong 3-body interactions, which occasionally results in GW sources with clearly shifted and perturbed GW waveforms. This opens up promising opportunities for current and future GW detectors, as observing such a phase shift can identify the formation environment of a BBH, as well as help to characterise the local properties of its surrounding environment.","Gravitational wave (GW) templates for binary black hole (BBH) mergers are constructed with the masses, spins, and orbital eccentricities of the progenitor systems. The GW signals from BBHs forming in astrophysical environments rather than isolation are subject to additional modulations, which, if observable, yield a means to probe the environment and formation mechanism of the BBH itself on a single-event basis [e.g. 87]. These modulations include general relativistic propagation effects (e.g., GW source acceleration [e.g. 91, 45, 34, 54, 19, 53, 89, 74, 23, 78, 72, 90, 37, 87, 63, 28], GW lensing and gravitational redshift [e.g. 26, 50]), astrophysical environmental effects (e.g., gas dynamical friction [e.g. 11, 93] and tidal forces [63]), and effects beyond classical general relativity (GR) [e.g. 17, 18]. As no BBH merges in a completely empty Universe, such effects should leave imprints in every observed GW signal; however, in most cases the modulations are too small to be resolved. This has led to the key question whether any of the considered BBH merger formation channels such as stellar clusters [51, 38, 10, 75, 9, 59, 52, 57, 58, 58, 7, 48, 55, 60, 61, 62, 84, 84, 82, 79], isolated binary stars [20, 21, 22, 14, 13, 68, 46, 56, 67, 69, 76, 77, 35], active galactic nuclei (AGN) discs [12, 71, 44, 73, 66, 80, 25], or galactic nuclei [47, 30, 85, 6, 70, 29, 27, 83, 40, 39, 8, 81], naturally produce a notable fraction of mergers with measurable GW modulations able to inform about the environment of the merger. Figure 1: Illustration of 3-body interaction resulting in a BBH merger with an observable GW Phase Shift. Top left: A stellar cluster with highlighted BH interactions, each of which is able to produce BBH mergers. Top right: Zoom-in on a binary-single interaction resulting in a BBH merger with the third object still bound (3-body merger). Turquoise- and pink lines show the trajectory of the merging BHs (true path), where the orange lines illustrate the path the BBH would have taken without the third object (reference path). The trajectory of the third BH is depicted in red. The white lines show lines-of-sight for an observer located in the lower right corner, where the green lines illustrate the spacial distance between the true- and the reference paths along the sight-lines, respectively. Bottom: GW strain as a function of time. The turquoise curve shows the GW signal for the observed BBH inspiral (true path), where the orange shows what the isolated BBH merger signal would look like (reference path). The two signals are shifted by the light crossing time between the true and the reference BBH paths, i.e. the time it takes the GWs to travel along the green lines. This gives rise to a unique observable GW phase shift that can be directly mapped to the BBH formation and environment. In this Letter we perform post-Newtonian ({\cal PN}) N-body simulations (see Methods), to show that BBHs formed through binary-single interactions occurring in dense stellar clusters naturally lead to a well-defined population of GW sources with a measurable GW phase shift caused by the presence of the third object. This is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows an illustration of different dynamical interactions in a cluster environment (upper left), a BH binary-single interaction producing a GW-driven merger (upper right), and the corresponding GW phase-shifted signal caused by the presence of the third-object (lower panel). Several dynamical pathways can lead to BBH mergers in clusters [e.g. 62], but the pathway relevant for clearly producing phase-shifted sources observable by ground based detectors is characterized by two of the three interacting BHs inspiralling and merge while the third is still bound (Fig. 1 upper right and Fig. 2), also referred to as a 3-body merger (see Methods). Such 3-body mergers constitute \sim 10\% of the BBH mergers from globular clusters (GCs) [60] and dominate the fraction of eccentric sources, which implies that GW phase-shifted sources will form in notable numbers with observable prospects for both current ground-based GW detectors (LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA) [1, 3, 4, 2] and future (Einstein Telescope (ET) [43], Cosmic Explorer (CE) [24]), as well as space-borne detectors (DECIGO/TianQin/Taiji [36, 42, 31, 41] (deci-Hertz) and LISA [5] (milli-Hertz)). Figure 2: Distribution of maximum GW phase shifts from 3-body BBH mergers. Results from {\cal PN} simulations between a BBH and a single incoming BH that concludes with two of the three BHs merging while the third BH is still bound (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). Each dot shows the maximum observable GW phase shift (y-axis) for each of these mergers, as a function of the corresponding GW peak frequency (bottom x-axis) or merger time (top x-axis), derived using the methods outlined in Sec. II. Each colour refers to a different SMA of the initial BBH before interaction: \sim 1 AU (orange), \sim 0.1 AU (red), and \sim 0.01 AU (blue). The dashed coloured lines illustrate the asymptotic limit \Delta{\phi}\propto f^{-13/3}, where the horizontal dotted line indicates the analytical maximum value for \Delta{\phi} assuming the distance between the BBH and the single BH, R, is similar to the initial SMA, a (see Methods). The three highlighted examples, (A,B,C), are shown and studied further in Fig. 3."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08555v1,The two alternative explosion mechanisms of core-collapse supernovae: 2024 status report,"In comparing the two alternative explosion mechanisms of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), I examine recent three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of CCSNe in the frame of the delayed-neutrino explosion mechanism (neutrino mechanism) and argue that these valuable simulations show that neutrino heating can supply a non-negligible fraction of the explosion energy but not the observed energies, hence cannot be the primary explosion mechanism. In addition to the energy crisis, the neutrino mechanism predicts many failed supernovae that are not observed. The most challenging issue of the neutrino mechanism is that it cannot account for point-symmetric morphologies of CCSN remnants, many of which were identified in 2024. These contradictions with observations imply that the neutrino mechanism cannot be the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe. The alternative jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) seems to be the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe; neutrino heating boosts the energy of the jittering jets. Even if some simulations show explosions of stellar models (but usually with energies below observed), it does not mean that the neutrino mechanism is the explosion mechanism. Jittering jets, which simulations do not include, can explode the core before the neutrino heating process does. Morphological signatures of jets in many CCSN remnants suggest that jittering jets are the primary driving mechanism, as expected by the JJEM.","Two theoretical alternative explosion mechanisms that are based on the gravitational energy of the collapsing stellar core exist to explode core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe): the delayed neutrino explosion mechanism (neutrino mechanism) and the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). In 2024, more than a dozen papers on each mechanism further explored their properties. Studies of the neutrino mechanism in 2024 have concentrated mainly on simulating the outcomes of neutrino heating of the collapsing core of the stellar progenitor (e.g., Andresen et al. 2024; Burrows et al. 2024b; Janka & Kresse 2024; Müller 2024a; Müller et al. 2024; Nakamura et al. 2024; van Baal et al. 2024; Wang & Burrows 2024; Laplace et al. 2024; Huang et al. 2024; Boccioli et al. 2024; Maunder et al. 2024). Neutrino heating occurs behind the stalled shock (closer to the newly born neutron star; NS) in the gain region at radii of r\simeq 100{~{}\rm km}. Jets play no role in these simulations. I group the jet-based magnetorotational explosion mechanism (e.g., Kondratyev et al. 2024; Shibagaki et al. 2024; Zha et al. 2024) with the neutrino mechanism despite that it is based on jets because this mechanism operates only in rare cases (\simeq 1\% of CCSNe, e.g., Müller 2024b) when there is a rapidly rotating pre-collapse core; this mechanism assumes that most CCSNe are jetless and explode by the neutrino mechanism. In the JJEM, the newly born NS, or later a black hole if formed, launches several to tens of pairs of opposite jets with fully or partially stochastically varying directions; these jets explode the star. In (Soker, 2024a), I list the updated quantitative estimates of the properties of the jittering jets for most CCSNe that are the descendant of iron core collapse to an NS. The properties of the JJEM in electron capture CCSNe (if they occur) were studied by Wang et al. (2024). Many expected outcomes of the JJEM are similar (but not identical) to those of the neutrino mechanism, like overall nucleosynthesis and neutrino emission; some other emission differences are hard to detect, like different gravitational wave properties (e.g., Mezzacappa et al. 2023 for the neutrino mechanism and Soker 2023a for the JJEM). The most robust property to distinguish the predictions of the neutrino mechanism and the JJEM is the morphology of CCSN remnants (CCSNRs), specifically point-symmetric morphologies. In Section 2, I elaborate on these common properties and differences following 2024 papers. The JJEM predicts that in many, but not all, CCSNRs, two or more pairs of jittering jets will imprint opposite (to the center) structural features. Namely, the jittering jets will shape a point-symmetric CCSNR. At the time of submission of this paper, the neutrino mechanism does not explain most of the properties of point-symmetric CCSNRs, and it seems it cannot explain point-symmetric CCSNRs (Soker & Shishkin 2024). Indeed, in a recent study Vartanyan et al. (2024) present a simulation of the neutrino mechanism until shock breakout from the star. They do not reproduce a point-symmetric morphology and do not refer to it. For these, I consider point-symmetric CCSNRs to rule out the neutrino mechanism as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNRs. The systematic identification of point-symmetric CCSNRs and their attribution to the JJEM was a breakthrough in 2023 (Soker 2024b for a review), with more CCSNRs identified in 2024. The list of 12 point-symmetric CCSNRs with attributed morphologies to the JJEM is as follows: SNR 0540-69.3 (Soker, 2022a), the Vela CCSNR (Soker 2023b; Soker & Shishkin 2024), CTB 1 (Bear & Soker, 2023), Cassiopeia A (Bear & Soker, 2024), Puppis A (Bear et al., 2024), the Cygnus Loop (Shishkin et al., 2024), N63A (Soker, 2024c), SN 1987A (Soker, 2024d, e), G321.3–3.9 (Soker, 2024f; Shishkin & Soker, 2025), G107.7-5.1 (Soker, 2024f), W44 (Soker, 2024g), and the Crab Nebula (Shishkin & Soker, 2024). In a review talk at the Transients Down Under meeting111https://transientsdownunder.github.io/program_slides/, held in Melbourne, Australia, on 29 January 2024, Hans-Thomas Janka reported on the status of neutrino-driven explosions in CCSN simulations and writes about the simulations of different research groups: “3D simulations differ in many aspects of numerics, physics inputs, seed perturbations, and, qualitatively and quantitatively, in their outcomes. 3D code comparison is missing and highly desirable.” Indeed, different groups that study the neutrino mechanism obtain different results, not only in three-dimensional (3D) simulations but also in scaled 1D simulations, such as which initial stellar mass ends in an explosion or ‘failed supernova’ (e.g., figure 1 in Boccioli & Fragione 2024 and Figures 5 and 6 in Boccioli & Roberti 2024 comparing to Sukhbold et al. 2016). A comparison between these groups of simulators is indeed highly desirable. I also find that comparing the neutrino mechanism and the JJEM is highly desirable. Therefore, I set the goal of performing such a comparison in this paper (Section 2). In this paper, I focus on new results from 2024 (for a partial comparison of earlier studies of the two alternative CCSN explosion mechanisms, see the review Soker 2024b). In Section 3, I examine two recent sets of simulations of the neutrino mechanism to emphasize the point that that mechanism comes short of supplying the observed explosion energies. In Section 4 I discuss the pre-collapse core convection and its role in the two mechanisms, possibly also in pre-explosion envelope activity. In Section 5, I summarize this comparison and conclude that even if simulations of the neutrino mechanism manage to explode some stellar models, it does not imply that it is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08503v1,Quasi-steady evolution of fast neutrino-flavor conversions,"In astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs), neutrinos potentially experience substantial flavor mixing due to the refractive effects of neutrino self-interactions. Determining the survival probability of neutrinos in asymptotic states is paramount to incorporating flavor conversions’ effects in the theoretical modeling of CCSN and BNSM. Some phenomenological schemes have shown good performance in approximating asymptotic states of fast neutrino-flavor conversions (FFCs), known as one of the collective neutrino oscillation modes induced by neutrino self-interactions. However, a recent study showed that they would yield qualitatively different asymptotic states of FFC if the neutrino number is forced to evolve. It is not yet fully understood why the canonical phenomenological models fail to predict asymptotic states. In this paper, we perform detailed investigations through numerical simulations and then provide an intuitive explanation with a quasi-homogeneous analysis. Based on the analysis, we propose a new phenomenological model, in which the quasi-steady evolution of FFCs is analytically determined. The model also allows us to express the convolution term of spatial wave number as a concise form, which corresponds to useful information on analyses for the non-linear feedback from small-scale flavor conversions to large-scale ones. Our model yields excellent agreement with numerical simulations, which lends support to our interpretation.","In dense neutrino gases, neutrino self-interaction [1, 2] can induce collective flavor conversions much faster than the neutrino oscillation in vacuum [3] and other relevant physical timescales in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs). The fast flavor conversion (FFC) represents such a case that has been attracting much attention in CCSN and BNSM modelers [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Linear stability analysis of flavor conversions suggests that fast flavor instabilities (FFIs) commonly occur in CCSNe and BNSMs [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 14, 15, 12, 19, 20, 21], motivating detailed studies of the non-linear dynamics of FFCs [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] including their interplay with various weak processes involving baryons and leptons [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 36, 42]. Numerical simulations of quantum kinetic neutrino transport are the most straightforward way to study the non-linear phase of FFCs. However, there is a huge disparity between the scale of FFCs and the global system of CCSNe and BNSMs, which makes global simulations of FFCs intractable. For this reason, most previous CCSN and BNSM simulations incorporating effects of neutrino flavor conversions have been done by setting occurrence conditions and vigor of flavor conversions in parametric manners [43, 44, 45, 46, 47]. This approach offers qualitative insights into how the dynamics of CCSN and BNSM are influenced by flavor conversions, but the prescription is not developed self-consistently with neutrino quantum kinetics, which would yield unrealistic outcomes. Subgrid or coarse-grained models are representative frameworks to fill the gap between these phenomenological approaches and first-principle ones in solving the quantum kinetic equation (QKE). By taking advantage of the scale difference between neutrino flavor conversions and astrophysical systems, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a coarse-grained formulation, the so-called miscidynamics [48]. In this method, QKE of neutrino transport is approximated based on the assumption that flavor conversions instantaneously settle down onto local equilibrium. Another (but relevant to miscidynamics; see [49]) approach has also been proposed recently, which is Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) subgrid model [50]. The subgrid model essentially corresponds to a relaxation-time approximation. In this approach, we need to determine asymptotic states and timescales of flavor conversions one way or another, and then we replace the term of neutrino oscillation with a relaxation term towards asymptotic states of flavor conversions. A similar approach has also been proposed in [51], and their global simulations showed an excellent capability to model the neutrino radiation field without solving QKE. The accuracy of subgrid models depends to a large extent on how well one can determine asymptotic states of flavor conversions from coarse-grained neutrino distributions. There are numerous attempts to tackle the issue, in particular for FFCs; see, e.g., [52, 28, 53, 54, 55, 31, 32]. In [55, 31], we proposed that the stability and conserved quantities are key ingredients to determine the asymptotic states. More specifically, the asymptotic state of FFC needs to satisfy a condition that there is no crossing of ELN-XLN where ELN and XLN denote electron-neutrino and havey-leptonic-neutrino lepton number, respectively, in neutrino angular distributions. Given the condition of conserved quantities (which depends on the boundary condition of neutrino transport; see, e.g., [31] for more details) and assuming fully depolarized in a certain angular region, we can approximately obtain the asymptotic state. Our method is consistent with both local- and global numerical simulations; see e.g., [25, 56] for the former and [29, 57] for the latter. We also note that our phenomenological model has been recently improved in [32] and also extended to spatially multi-dimensional cases [54, 58]. Very recently, on the other hand, the authors in [59] found an intriguing phenomenon, in which FFCs can persist even after spatially-averaged ELN-XLN angular crossings disappear if the background neutrinos are forced to be evolved (see Sec. III for more details). This results in different asymptotic states of neutrinos from those predicted by the canonical asymptotic schemes mentioned above (since flavor conversions are assumed to be no longer active after the disappearance of ELN-XLN angular crossings). It should be mentioned that the authors in [59] attempted to give an interpretation of the phenomenon with a quasi-linear theory, but it failed to reproduce outcomes, exhibiting that the mechanism is still far from being understood. Since this anomaly of FFC evolution could be a significant obstacle in developing accurate subgrid models, this problem is worthy of in-depth investigation. In this paper, we scrutinize the specific (but important) problem. As we shall show later, this analysis offers new insights into the non-linear properties of self-induced flavor conversions. This paper is organized as follows. After giving basic equations and notations in Sec. II, we start with reviewing the result of [59] in Sec. III. In this section, we thoroughly explain why their results are interesting, which helps understand the backgrounds and motivations for readers unfamiliar with the literature. We then summarize our strategy to understand the phenomenon in Sec. IV. After describing essential information on our numerical schemes solving QKE, we summarize our numerical models which are designed to highlight key properties of quasi-steady evolution of FFC in Sec. IV. In Sec. V, the numerical results are summarized and then we apply our quasi-homogeneous analysis to the results. Based on the analysis we construct an analytic model to determine the secular evolution of FFCs in Sec. VI. Finally, we conclude the paper by summarizing and discussing key findings in the present study. Throughout the paper, we work in natural units (c=\hbar=1 where c and \hbar denote the speed of light and reduced Planck constant, respectively), which allows us to measure the time, length, and neutrino number density by the unit of neutrino self-interaction potential. We, hence, set the self-interaction potential as unity without loss of generality."

We determine multifrequency, multi-epoch scattering times for the large dispersion measure millisecond pulsar J1903+0327 by developing a three component model for the emitted pulse shape that is convolved with a best fit pulse broadening function (PBF) identified from a family of thin-screen and extended-media PBFs. We show that the scattering time, \tau, at a fiducial frequency of 1500 MHz changes by approximately 10% over a 5.5 yr span with a characteristic timescale of approximately 100 days. We also constrain the spectral index and inner scale of the wavenumber spectrum of electron density variations along this line of sight. We find that the scaling law for \tau vs. radio frequency is strongly affected by any mismatch between the true and assumed PBF or between the true and assumed intrinsic pulse shape. We show using simulations that refraction is a plausible cause of the epoch dependence of \tau, manifesting as changes in the PBF shape and 1/e time scale. Finally, we discuss the implications of our scattering results on pulsar timing including time of arrival delays and dispersion measure misestimation.","The spin stability of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) enables their use as astrophysical clocks in pulsar timing programs that probe plasma propagation processes and gravity. The most notable application is the recently announced evidence for a stochastic background of nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs), most likely produced by a population of supermassive binary black holes at cosmological distances (Agazie et al., 2023a; EPTA Collaboration and InPTA Collaboration et al., 2023; Reardon et al., 2023). The timing program conducted by NANOGrav (the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves) yields pulse times of arrival with sub-microsecond precision for many of the 68 pulsars reported in Agazie et al. (2023a). Forward goals of the program include better characterization of the GW spectrum at yet lower frequencies and the detection of individual supermassive black hole binary systems. These require longer data sets at monthly cadence or faster, combined with arrival times measured with higher precision. Arrival time precision involves a combination of astrophysical and instrumental factors, the latter including the growing problem of radio frequency interference (Agazie et al., 2023b). MSPs can be selected on the basis of their spin stabilities and the best objects are those with the narrowest pulses and shortest periods, yielding a large number of pulses per unit observing time. Propagation through the interstellar medium (ISM) yields several kinds of chromatic delays that need to be mitigated in order to improve timing precision (Rickett, 1990; Agazie et al., 2023b). More robust techniques for correction of the impact of interstellar scattering on the arrival times reported by pulsar timing array (PTA) groups are warranted. In this paper we use simulations and analysis of a highly scattered millisecond pulsar to study pulse shape distortions produced by multipath propagation through the ISM and the resulting arrival time biases that result. The largest delays from the ISM are dispersion delays \propto\nu^{-2}{\rm DM} that have a (nearly) deterministic dependence on radio frequency \nu, where dispersion measure, {\rm DM}, is the line of sight (LoS) integral of the electron density, n_{\rm e}. Removal of dispersion delays requires a contemporaneous measurement of DM because it is time variable due to spatial variations of the electron density encountered along the LoS. Inhomogeneities in the electron number density diffract and refract pulses (which we collectively describe as ‘scattering.’). This causes broadening and angular wandering of a pulsar’s image, pulse distortion, and an overall delay that scales approximately as \nu^{-4}. Estimation of DM using multifrequency measurements is complicated by the presence of scattering delays, which nontrivially evolve across frequency in concert with the emitted pulse shape. In particular, we show that the scattering delay contribution to an arrival time differs not only from the amplitude of the scattering time but also in its scaling with frequency. This means that using multifrequency arrival times to estimate scattering times will often lead to misestimated scattering times. Our analysis focuses on the PSR J1903+0327 (P=2.15 ms), an appropriate object for probing scattering effects given its large {\rm DM}=297\,{\rm pc~{}cm^{-3}} and its inclusion in NANOGrav’s timing program. Large scattering is consistent with the large distance to this pulsar (\sim 6\,kpc) in the Galactic plane (Galactic coordinates l=37.34^{\circ},b=-1.01^{\circ}). While this MSP contributes little to the sensitivity of NANOGrav’s PTA to long-wavelength gravitational waves, observations at monthly cadence provide the means for a study of DM and scattering along its line of sight (Agazie et al., 2023b; Geiger & Lam, 2022). We also note that it is an object of interest for probing the neutron star equation of state and, given its likely origin in a triple stellar system, for understanding millisecond pulsar formation mechanisms (Champion et al., 2008; Freire et al., 2011; Kalam et al., 2015). In Section 2 we briefly summarize the observational data and then discuss pulse-shape modeling in Section 3. Section 4 presents results of simulations that illustrate the origin of systematic errors in estimates for scattering parameters and arrival times. This is followed by application of our methods to the PSR J1903+0327 in Section 5. Section 6 summarizes our results and our major conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08116v1,Jet Archaeology and Forecasting: Image Variability and Magnetic Field Configuration,"We investigate how magnetic field variations around accreting black holes on event horizon scales affect the morphology of magnetically-driven jet on larger scales. By performing radiative transfer calculations on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we find that temporal variation in the magnetic flux on the event horizon and the jet power are imprinted on the variability of jet width up to several hundred gravitational radii. When the magnetic flux around the black hole drops and then rises, the jet initially narrows or becomes truncated, then widens, creating a thin-thick pattern that propagates down the jet. This suggests that extended jet observations can provide a history record of horizon-scale magnetic field dynamics, and conversely, upcoming changes in the jet image can be predicted from direct observation of the magnetized accreting plasma near the black hole. Furthermore, the pattern of jet width variations shows acceleration up to the relativistic regime as it moves away from the black hole, aligning with plasma bulk motion. We also find in time-averaged images that both the bulk plasma motion and magnetic field configuration in the jet-launching region, which are sensitive to black hole spin, shape diverse features through relativistic beaming and aberration. Higher black hole spins result in more poloidal bulk motion and toroidal magnetic fields, leading to more symmetric jet images and linear polarization patterns. These results suggest a new method for testing the magnetically arrested disk model and the Blandford-Znajek process, and for determining the black hole spin through observations bridging horizon and jet-launching scales.","In recent years, very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration have achieved direct imaging of supermassive black holes (BH) in the centers of nearby galaxies on event horizon scales (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2019a, 2022; see also Lu et al., 2023). M87, one of the primary targets, has a well-studied jet that has now been imaged from scales of sub-mpc to \sim80 kpc (e.g., de Gasperin et al., 2012; Hada et al., 2016; Walker et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2023). Upgrades and extensions to the EHT via the next-generation EHT (ngEHT) project and Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) will achieve at least a resolution of 5 \muas (micro-arcseconds) at 230 GHz and a dynamic range close to 1000, from which movies connecting the inner accretion disk to the jet will be possible (Doeleman et al., 2023; Johnson et al., 2024). Thus, jet simulations providing detailed predictions at high-resolution and in the time domain are of timely importance. So far, polarized EHT images favor strongly magnetized Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) models over their more weakly magnetized Standard And Normal Evolution (SANE) counterparts, the latter of which tend to be more weakly polarized and less consistent with multi-wavelength constraints (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2021a, 2019b, 2024). In MAD models, the magnetic field advected along with the accreting plasma saturates and becomes dynamically important, leading to non-axisymmetric structures in the inflow and efficient launching of jets (Narayan et al., 2003; Igumenshchev et al., 2003). MADs also exhibit disruptive magnetic reconnection or “flux eruption events,” which offer an electron acceleration mechanism hypothesized to explain multi-wavelength polarized flares (e.g., Dexter et al., 2020; Ripperda et al., 2022; Chatterjee & Narayan, 2022; Najafi-Ziyazi et al., 2024). MAD models accelerate efficient relativistic jets powered by the spin-energy of the BH, tapped by magnetic fields threading the horizon (Blandford & Znajek, 1977; BZ process; see also Tchekhovskoy et al., 2011). It will be important to verify predictions of MAD models with observations in the jet launching region as well. Previous observational studies have explored variable features of parsec-scale jets after X- and gamma-ray flares (for example, light curve; Pushkarev et al., 2010; relativistic blobs; Jorstad et al., 2001, 2013; jet orientation; Rani et al., 2014; and jet base; Niinuma et al., 2015; Lisakov et al., 2017). These high-energy flares can be associated with eruptive events in the vicinity of the BH (Tavecchio et al., 2010; Rani et al., 2014; Broderick & Tchekhovskoy, 2015; see also Schinzel et al., 2012; Marscher, 2014 for another possibility of the flares taking place far from the BH). Most recently, The Event Horizon Telescope-Multi-wavelength science working group et al. (2024) reported changes in the position angle of the M87 jet orientation andthe bright spot on the M87* ring at the same time with a gamma-ray flare in 2018, though the emission origin of the flare and its relation to the jet orientation are uncertain. Polarization images can also be a strong tool to address the magnetically-driven jet mechanism and have attracted a large interest. An ordered linear polarization (LP) vector pattern has been detected around the photon ring (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2021b) and the extended jet (e.g., Walker et al., 2018), which implies the existence of a persistent magnetic field structure bridging these scales. In theoretical approaches, polarization images have been suggested as a tool for inferring black hole spin (Palumbo et al., 2020; Chael et al., 2023; Emami et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Ricarte et al., 2023b; Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2024), although interpreting these images can be challenging due to Faraday effects, particularly Faraday rotation. Studies have also investigated the Faraday effects on the polarization images around the BH (Mościbrodzka et al., 2017; Ricarte et al., 2020; Tsunetoe et al., 2022), as well as relativistic effects from accelerated plasma bulk motion (Laing, 1981; Lyutikov et al., 2005; Broderick & McKinney, 2010; Murphy et al., 2013). It has also been suggested that circular polarization (CP) images can shed new light on the jet mechanism (Tsunetoe et al., 2020, 2021; Ricarte et al., 2021; Mościbrodzka et al., 2021; Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2023; Joshi et al., 2024). On the scale of more extended jets, the effect of magnetic field helicity combined with viewing angle was examined in Laing (1981) and Murphy et al. (2013) using one-zone cylindrical jet models. Kramer & MacDonald (2021) calculated polarization images based on relativistic MHD jet models with different magnetic field configurations, obtaining a bimodal pattern of horizontal and vertical LP vectors to the jet (see also Pariev et al., 2003; Porth et al., 2011). Davelaar et al. (2023) also investigated the effect of waves on shearing flow surfaces on the LP features. Motivated by this previous activity and by upcoming observations, we examine the relationship between the horizon-scale dynamical variability in MAD simulations and the polarized morphology of the jet launching region in synthetic images. Narayan et al. (2022) surveyed the jet and disk morphology in MAD GRMHD simulations for a variety of BH spins and found that the prograde spin cases give wider jets up to 100~{}r_{\rm g} scale than the retrograde cases (see subsection 2.1 for detail). Here r_{\rm g}=GM_{\bullet}/c^{2}, G is the the gravitational constant, M_{\bullet} is the BH mass, and c is the speed of light. Chatterjee et al. (2023) also pointed out that the jet opening and tilt angles at 10~{}r_{\rm g} are correlated and anti-correlated with the normalized magnetic flux, respectively. Here, we focus on the transverse structure of the inner jet image for an M87-like system on a scale \lesssim 100~{}r_{\rm g} (\sim 0.003~{}{\rm pc}\sim 0.37~{}{\rm mas}; milli-arcseconds), which corresponds to \lesssim 300~{}r_{\rm g} if de-projected with the observer’s inclination angle of i=163\arcdeg (or 17\arcdeg). Since the plasma on these scales is being accelerated up to the relativistic regime, the jet morphology in the images is affected by relativistic beaming and aberration effects on the synchrotron radiation. With this in mind, we perform polarimetric general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations based on MAD GRMHD models, to obtain theoretical prediction of images and investigate the relationship between the plasma dynamics and observable image features. This paper is organized as follows. Our methodology is introduced in section 2, which consists of GRMHD simulations (subsection 2.1) and GRRT calculations (subsection 2.2). We describe our main results in section 3, regarding the variability of jet shape in subsections 3.1 and 3.2 and the averaged image features in subsections 3.3. Applications of our results are addressed in section 4, including an estimation of the jet acceleration profile in subsection 4.1, the variability of the jet width in 4.2, correlation between the jet power and width in 4.3, the spin-dependence of polarization images in 4.4, and comparison with observations and contribution of nonthermal electrons in 4.5. Finally, we present a summary and conclusions in section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08106v1,"Intranight optical monitoring of the rare quasar J0950+5128, the brightest known candidate for transition from radio-quiet to radio-loud state","We report a novel pilot project to characterise intra-night optical variability (INOV) of an extremely rare type of quasar, which has recently been caught in the act of transiting from a radio-quiet to radio-loud state, on a decadal time scale. Such rare transitions may signify a recurrence, or conceivably the first switch-on of jet activity in optically luminous quasars. The newly formed jet could well be jittery and unsteady, both in power and direction. The optically brightest among such radio-state transition candidates, the quasar J0950+5128 (z=0.2142), was monitored by us with dense sampling in the R-band, during 2020-21 in 6 sessions, each lasting > 4 hours. This is the first attempt to characterise the INOV properties associated with this recently discovered, extremely rarely observed phenomenon of quasar radio-state transition. The non-detection of INOV in any of the 6 sessions, down to the 1-2% level, amounts to a lack of evidence for a blazar-like optical activity, \sim 2 years after its transition to radio-loud state was found. The only INOV feature detected in J0950+5128 during our observational campaign was a \sim 0.15-mag spike lasting ¡ 6 minutes, seen at 13.97 UT on 18-March-2021. We also report the available optical light curves of this quasar from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, which indicate that it had experienced a phase of INOV activity around the time its transition to the radio-loud state was detected, however that phase did not sustain until the launch of our INOV campaign \sim 2 years later.","Optical monitoring of many individual quasars, radio-loud and radio-quiet, spanning several decades has revealed that large intensity variations ( ¿ 100%) are exclusive to the former category. Prominent examples in this category, showing large outbursts (on month-like time scales), include the blazars AO0235+164: Webb & Smith, 1989; OJ 287: Takalo, 1994; CTA102: Raiteri et al., 2017; 1ES 1927+654: Trakhtenbrot et al., 2019. Traditionally, this signature of strongly beamed jets of energetic particles has not been found associated with radio-quiet quasars (RQQs; e.g., Padovani, 2017), for which only a much milder optical variability is observed even on year-like time scales (e.g., MacLeod et al., 2012; Caplar et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018; Stone et al., 2022; Arévalo et al., 2023). The persistent dichotomy in the degree of variability has led to the common perception that among quasars, any transition from the radio-quiet to radio-loud state does not happen on human time scales, although this almost certainly takes place on time scales of \sim 10^{5-6} years (see, e.g., Reynolds & Begelman, 1997; Czerny et al., 2009; An & Baan, 2012). Such variability time-scales are also expected by extrapolating from the compact stellar binaries, powered by \sim 10M_{\odot} black holes, for which jet-driven large radio variability is often witnessed on hour/day-like time scales (Mirabel & Rodríguez, 1999). However, over the past few years, exceptions to this popular perception about quasars have begun to surface, based on reports of detection of (first-time) switching-on, or restarting, of powerful jet activity in a few quasars, marked by between 6 to 25 fold jump in radio flux at centimetre wavelengths within a time span of at most 15-20 years (Mooley et al., 2016; Kunert-Bajraszewska et al., 2020; Nyland et al., 2020; Wójtowicz et al., 2020; also, Bannister et al., 2011a; Bannister et al., 2011b). The link of this jump in radio emission to newborn jets has been reinforced by the observed Gigahertz-Peaked-Specrtum (GPS) type (evolving) radio spectrum associated with such state transition episodes, as reported in the discovery papers cited above. Indications of changes occurring on such short time scales had earlier come from the targeted Very Large Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) campaigns which revealed nascent radio jets in quasars, with kinematical ages as small as \sim 20 years (Owsianik et al., 1998; Owsianik & Conway, 1998; Gugliucci et al., 2005; Orienti & Dallacasa, 2021). The detection of such young jets has bolstered the prospects of understanding the nature of the trigger for jet activity in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), which sometimes succeeds in pulling them out of the radio-quiet state. Arguably, the best prospect of AGN hosting the earliest cycles of jet activity is to be found in radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert1 (NLS1) galaxies (Mathur, 2000). The existence of relativistic jets in such sources was indisputably established by their detection at gamma-rays (Abdo et al., 2009), supported by independent observations, such as detection of high-amplitude intra-night optical variability (INOV) in several radio-loud NLS1 galaxies (e.g., Liu et al., 2010; Paliya et al., 2013; Kshama et al., 2017; Gopal-Krishna & Wiita, 2018; Paliya, 2019; Ojha et al., 2021). A very striking related clue has come from the discovery of strong, recurrent flares at millimetre wavelengths, on day-like time scales, in several NLS1s which are essentially radio-quiet at centimetre wavelengths (Lähteenmäki et al., 2018)111The presence of relativistic jets in radio-quiet quasars, using millimetric observations, had earlier been inferred by Chini et al. (1989), using the IRAM telescope.. These flares represent jumps in millimetre flux densities by factors of up to 103 in a matter of just a few days! The discovery paper poses the question whether this violent behaviour is a manifestation of an early-stage of AGN activity and whether its source, possibly a jittery and intermittent relativistic jet (see, e.g., Czerny et al., 2009; Lalakos et al., 2022), is still confined within the Broad Line Region (BLR) region and, consequently, subject to free-free absorption, explaining the jet’s faintness at centimetre/metre wavelengths (e.g., Berton et al., 2020). This raises the possibility that a similarly violent activity on hour/day-like time scale might get triggered during the reported episodes of transition of quasars, from a radio-quiet to radio-loud state (see above). Here we attempt to test such a scenario by searching for strong intranight optical variability (INOV) which has now emerged as a reliable diagnostic of AGN activity driven by Doppler-boosted jet, including even the jets forming in low-mass AGN (e.g., Gopal-Krishna et al., 2023 and references therein). The target chosen for our INOV monitoring campaign is the quasar J0950+5128 which is the optically brightest known candidate for radio-quiet to radio-loud state transition (Nyland et al., 2020), out of the discovery of 26 such cases found by these authors to have undergone the radio state transition sometime during the last about two decades. Their radio emergence was unveiled during a comparison of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS, Lacy et al., 2020) epoch 1 observations (2017-2019) with the existing FIRST (Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm; 1993-2011) survey database (Becker et al., 1995). The peak frequencies of the observed GPS spectra of these transition candidates, which have been measured for 14 of them using the Very Large Array (VLA), seem consistent with the very young (radio) ages of these quasars (Nyland et al., 2020), as estimated using the radio size-peak frequency relation established for young AGN jets (O’Dea, 1998; Jeyakumar, 2016). As noted in Nyland et al. (2020), the z=0.2142 quasar J0950+5128 (J095036.75+512838.12), which is powered by a black hole with an estimated mass of 108 M_{\odot}, was not detected in the FIRST survey (hence < 0.44 mJy at 1.4 GHz) in April 1997. In April 2019, however, its flux density was found to have risen to 8.77 mJy at 3 GHz, corresponding to a radio luminosity of 3.7\times 10^{40} erg/s. From VLA observations, its angular size was found to be < 0.16 arcsec at 13.2 GHz (Nyland et al., 2020). The SDSS catalogue gives its r-magnitude as 17.35, making it suitable for intranight monitoring with the 1.3-metre optical telescope accessible to us for this pilot experiment. The details of our optical observations, together with the derived differential light curves (DLCs) for 6 sessions are presented in Sect. 2, followed by a brief discussion of the results in Sect. 4 and the conclusions summarised in Sect. 5."

Thermodynamical maps are produced from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT data using a new method for modelling the astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds. The temperature peak of 24\pm 4 keV is also the pressure peak of the cluster and closely correlates spatially with the Sunyaev-Zeldovich peaks from the MUSTANG2 data. The cluster center hosts shock fronts to the north and south, for which we report lower limits for the shock Mach numbers of \mathcal{M}=1.6\pm 0.4 and \mathcal{M}=1.9\pm 0.3, respectively. Bayesian X-ray Analysis methods were used to disentangle different projected spectral signatures for the filament structure, with Akaike and Bayes criteria being used to select the most appropriate model to describe the various temperature components. We report an X-ray filament temperature of 2.9_{-0.3}^{+0.5} keV and a density (1.60\pm 0.05)\times 10^{-4}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}, corresponding to an overdensity of 150 relative to the critical density of the Universe. We estimate the hot gas mass of the filament to be \sim 4.4\times 10^{12}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm M_{\odot}, while its total projected weak lensing measured mass is \sim 6.8\pm 2.7\times 10^{13}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm M_{\odot}, indicating a hot baryon fraction of 4–10%.","Current cosmological models and numerical simulations predict that the majority of the missing baryons in our Universe sit in the faint galaxy cluster outskirts and the interconnecting filaments of the cosmic web (Cen & Ostriker, 1999; Davé et al., 2001). This warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) contributes to the growth of galaxy clusters through a slow constant accretion, as the in-falling filamentary gas virializes within the gravitational potential wells of massive clusters. Only a small number of X-ray bridges and filaments have been studied so far. This is partially because the diffuse WHIM remains a complicated challenge to detect with today’s instruments. Numerical cosmological simulations predict WHIM temperatures of 10^{5} to 10^{7} K and densities of 10-7 to 10-4 cm-3 (Cen & Ostriker, 2006; Haider et al., 2016); in other words, features in the WHIM are inherently characterized by soft X-ray emission, low surface brightness, and poor signal to noise ratios due to dominant contributions to the signal from both astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds. Needless to say, much care needs to be taken when modelling the spectra of these complex regions to account for all of the different contributions from other emission signatures. Current observational information about filaments is derived from either absorption or emission. Observations in emission have so far been limited to a small number of systems, MACS J0717.5+3745 (Ebeling et al., 2004), Abell 399/401 (Sakelliou & Ponman, 2004), Abell 222/223 (Werner et al., 2008), Abell 2811 (+offset)/2804/2801 (Sato et al., 2010), Abell 3558/3556 (Mitsuishi et al., 2012), Abell 2744 (Eckert et al., 2015a), Abell 3391/3395 (Alvarez et al., 2018; Reiprich et al., 2021; Veronica et al., 2022, 2024), Abell 2029/2033 (Mirakhor et al., 2022), and Abell 3667/3651 (Dietl et al., 2024). Temperature measurements were obtained only for four of these systems. For two of the four, it has been reported that the filament emission is dominated by the emission of the Intracluster Medium (ICM), as evidenced by the excessively large temperatures. There is a debate about the origin of these X-ray filaments. While some of the detected bridges could indeed be classified as WHIM filaments, others are due to other physical processes, such as shock-related compression heating between the two merging atmospheres or emission of ram-pressure stripped tails from infalling haloes. One of the most extensively studied merging galaxy clusters in almost every available wavelength is MACS J0717.5+3745 (RA 07h17m32.1, DEC +37∘45’21”), an extremely massive, intermediate redshift (z=0.5458), Hubble Frontier Fields Cluster (Ebeling et al., 2001). MACS J0717.5+3745 is also one of the most complex galaxy clusters to date, having hosted at least four different sub-cluster collisions. The collective mass from the many ingested dark matter halos makes this a great target for gravitational lensing studies and additional exploration of local substructures via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect due to the high temperatures. The complex mergers have also resulted in a complex ICM morphology, characterized by perturbed plasma discontinuities, stripped atmospheres, shock fronts, and cold fronts, and results in many peculiar features in the X-ray morphology and radio surface brightness features. Besides the gravitational lensing study, Jauzac et al. (2018), also looked at many of these X-ray substructures in detail. Most intriguing is the prominent X-ray bridge located in the S-SE of the cluster, which has previously been studied by van Weeren et al. (2016, 2017) using Chandra data. This paper aims to investigate the X-ray bridge in detail, statistically disentangling the diverse distribution of complex emission signatures associated with the filament using Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA) methods and nested models, along with a new dynamically-adaptive method for the full instrumental background modelling of each region for both Chandra and XMM-Newton. This paper also presents new thermodynamical maps using a joint modelling method combining available data from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT, as well as trend-modeled residual maps where the average cluster thermodynamical properties over radial distances are removed. This paper additionally presents previously unpublished data from 90 GHz MUSTANG2 observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in the direction of MACS J0717.5+3745. In Section 2, we explain the methods used in the data reduction, followed by Sec. 3 that explains the instrumental and X-ray background model and analysis of both Chandra and XMM-Newton. Section 4 then describes the main results of the thermodynamic maps and the properties of the filament, while Section 5 discusses these results. Throughout the paper, we assume the standard \Lambda cold dark matter cosmology with \Omega_{m}=0.286, \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.714, and H_{0}=69.6. Consequently, at z=0.5458, 1 arcmin corresponds to 387.42 kpc. The wilms abundance table is adopted for all plasma emission and photoelectric absorption models in the discussed spectral models (Wilms et al., 2000). Unless stated otherwise, the error bars correspond to a 68% confidence interval."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08068v1,"Core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) stars compared to NICER data
including XTE J1814-338","A core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) star models is compared to recent NICER data of masses and radii. It is in particular interesting to capture the outlier XTE J1814-338. Instead of integrating the TOV equations from the center to surface, we follow here another pathway by accommodating all uncertainties of the equation(s) of state (EoS) at supra-nuclear density or/and an unknown dark matter admixture in a parameterization of the core by its radius r_{x}, the included mass m_{x} and the pressure p_{x} at r_{x}. The corona, which may be dubbed also envelope or halo or outer crust, is assumed to be of standard-model matter where the EoS is supposed to be faithfully known.","The advent of detecting gravitational waves from merging neutron stars, the related multimessenger astrophysics and the improving mass-radius determinations of neutron stars, in particular by NICER data, stimulated a wealth of activities Riley:2021pdl ; Miller:2021qha ; Miller:2019cac ; Riley:2019yda ; Raaijmakers:2021uju ; Kini:2024ggu ; Doroshenko:2022nwp ; Choudhury:2024xbk ; Pang:2021jta ; Vinciguerra:2023qxq ; Fonseca:2021wxt ; Romani:2022jhd ; Salmi:2024bss ; Salmi:2024aum . Besides masses and radii, moments of inertia and tidal deformabilities become experimentally accessible and can be confronted with theoretical models Rutherford:2024srk . The baseline of the latter ones is provided by non-rotating, spherically symmetric cold dense matter configurations. The sequence of white dwarfs (first island of stability) and neutron stars (second island of stability) and possibly a third island of stability shows up thereby when going to more compact objects, with details depending sensitively on the actual equation of state (EoS). Since the radii of configurations of the second (neutron stars) and third (hypothetical quark/hybrid stars) islands can be very similar, the notion of twin stars has been coined for equal-mass configurations. These issues and their background are surveyed in Schaffner-Bielich:2020psc . We emphasize the relation of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision physics, probing the EoS at large temperatures and small net-densities, and compact star physics, probing small temperatures and large net baryon densities when focusing on static compact-star properties. (Of course, in binary or ternary compact-star merging-events, also finite temperatures and a large range of densities are probed which are accessible in medium-energy heavy-ion collisions HADES:2019auv .) Implications of the conjecture of a first-order phase transition emerging from a QCD critical endpoint continuing to small temperatures and large baryon densities Du:2024wjm can also be studied by neutron–hybrid-quark stars. In fact, a cold EoS encoding a strong local softening due to the first-order phase transition can give rise to the third island of compact stars. In special cases, these appear as twins of neutron stars Li:2024sft ; Laskos-Patkos:2024fdp ; Li:2022ivt . While the standard model of particle physics (SM) seems to accommodate nearly all of the observed phenomena of the micro-world, severe issues remain. Among them is the fundamental problem of the very nature of dark matter (DM): Astrophysical and cosmological observations seem to require inevitably its existence, but details remain elusive despite many concerted attempts. Supposed DM behaves like massive particles, these could be captured gravitationally in the centers of compact stars Karkevandi:2021ygv ; Dengler:2021qcq ; Hippert:2022snq , thus providing a non-SM component there. This would be an uncertainty on top of the less reliably known SM-matter state at supra-nuclear densities. Beyond the SM, also other feebly interacting particles could populate compact stars. A candidate scenario is provided, for instance, by mirror world Alizzi:2021vyc ; Goldman:2019dbq ; Beradze:2019yyp ; Berezhiani:2021src ; Berezhiani:2020zck . There are many proposals of portals from our SM-world to such beyond-SM scenarios, cf. Beacham:2019nyx ; Pitz:2024xvh ; Yang:2024ycl ; Diedrichs:2023trk , which can be tested by their consequences for compact stars. New mass-radius data Kini:2024ggu point to a puzzling compact object, XTE J1814-338, which stimulates various explanations Pitz:2024xvh ; Yang:2024ycl ; Laskos-Patkos:2024fdp . Also HESS J1731-347 Doroshenko:2022nwp seems to be a particularly interesting object Li:2024sft ; Li:2022ivt . We confront these and other data with our core-corona decomposition (CCD). Our note is organized as follows. Section II is devoted to the CCD, where a specific EoS is deployed for the explicit construction. The comparison of the CCD with data is presented in Section III, where we include XTE J1814-338 as compact object with a large massive core (which may contain a DM component or/and a special SM material component) and speculate whether HESS J1731-347 belongs to the sequence of SM matter neutron stars with radii of about 12 km. We summarize in Section IV. Appendix A lists some entries to data, and Appendix B is devoted to a brief comment on a particular core model based on a statistically determined EoS from multimessenger data; a remark refers to the usefulness of the CCD when dealing with a first-order phase transition."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08837v1,A massive white dwarf or low-mass neutron star discovered by LAMOST,"We report the discovery of a close binary J0606+2132 (Gaia DR3 3423365496448406272) with P_{\rm obs}=2.77 days containing a possible massive white dwarf or a neutron star using the LAMOST spectroscopic data. By a joint fitting of the radial velocity from LAMOST and the light curve from TESS, we derived a circular Keplerian orbit with an inclination of i=81.31∘{}^{+6.26^{\circ}}_{-7.85^{\circ}}, which is consistent with that derived from v{\rm sin}i. Together with the mass of the visible star, we derived the mass of the invisible object to be 1.34{}^{+0.35}_{-0.40}M_{\odot}. Spectral disentangling with the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra shows no absorption feature from an additional component, suggesting the presence of a compact object. No X-ray or radio pulsed signal is detected from ROSAT and FAST archive observations. J0606+2132 could evolve into either a Type Ia supernova or a neutron star through accretion-induced collapse if it is a white dwarf, or into an intermediate-mass X-ray binary if it is a neutron star.","Radial velocity (RV) monitoring method has been widely applied to detect compact objects. Compared to the traditional X-ray method, the RV method can detect quiescent compact objects in binaries, which comprise the majority of binary systems including compact companions in the universe. Recently, the RV method has found about 10 X-ray quiescent black hole (BH) candidates (e.g., Casares et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2019; Shenar et al., 2022; Mahy et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024), which is about half the number of BHs discovered by X-rays over the past 60 years. A sample of star-white dwarf (WD) and star-neutron star (NS) binaries have also been discovered through the RV method (e.g., Li et al., 2022; Mazeh et al., 2022; Yi et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2024a, b). For binaries including an early-type star, the large mass of the early-type star implies a massive companion, even if the system has a small binary mass function. Thus, these binaries are promising targets for the search for massive compact objects, such as massive WDs, NSs, and BHs. Recently, RV monitoring has identified several systems containing a massive compact object and an early-type star (e.g., Casares et al., 2014; Khokhlov et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2022; Mahy et al., 2022; Shenar et al., 2022). The discovery of more compact objects can help to construct a comprehensive mass distribution, which is essential for advancing our understanding of binary evolution. Based on data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), we conducted a campaign to search for compact objects hidden in binaries including early-type stars. This search utilized several catalogs of early-type stars (Shridharan et al., 2021; Xiang et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2022) that were constructed using LAMOST spectra. First, we cross-matched these catalogs with LAMOST DR9 low-resolution and medium-resolution general catalogs. Second, we focused on the sources which have more than two LAMOST medium-resolution spectral observations with r-band signal-to-noise ratio (S/Nr) greater than 5 and show clear RV variation. Finally, we identified a close binary Gaia ID 3423365496448406272 (R.A. = 91.7051933o; Decl. = 21.5425898o; hereafter J0606+2132) which has a large binary mass function, suggesting the possible presence of a compact object. This source has been recognized as a binary system in several studies (Zhang et al., 2021, 2022; Tian et al., 2020), but its properties haven’t been investigated in detail. Additionally, Liu et al. (2024) proposed J0606+2132 as a compact object candidate based on its RV variation. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we detail the spectroscopic and photometric observations. Section 3 presents stellar information of the visible star, including the distance, atmospheric parameters, and the mass, etc. In Section 4, we estimate the systematic information of J0606+2132 through RV fitting and light curve (LC) fitting. Section 5 discusses the nature of the companion and gives possible evolution scenarios for J0606+2132. Finally, we provide a summary in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08793v1,Dark energy effects on realistic neutron stars,"By considering realistic equations of state (EoSs) to describe the ordinary matter of the stellar crust, in this study, we explore the effect of a dark energy core, made of Chaplygin Dark Fluid (CDF), on neutron stars (NSs). To accomplish this purpose, we solve the stellar structure equations and investigate the impact of the CDF parameters on the several macroscopic properties of NSs such as mass-radius (M-R) relation, and tidal deformabilities of a single star and of a binary system, the latter being of great importance when analyzing gravitational-wave signals coming from the merger of such compact objects. We also present an analysis of the radial oscillation modes for the rapid phase transition, with the aim of distinguishing regions consisting of dynamically stable stars from those of unstable ones. Specifically, our outcomes reveal that an increase in the energy density jump (controlled by a parameter \alpha) leads to an increase in the radial stability of the NS with a CDF core. Furthermore, our theoretical results are consistent with the observational M-R measurements of millisecond pulsars from NICER data and tidal deformability constraints from the GW170817 event.","According to various cosmological observations, our universe is currently undergoing an accelerated expansion phase [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], so that the late-time acceleration is a widely accepted phenomenon nowadays. The standard model of cosmology, also called the “\LambdaCDM model”, is based on cold dark matter (responsible for cosmic structure formation) and cosmological constant \Lambda which is commonly associated with the vacuum density energy of the universe. Such a model is in good agreement with the observational data [8], however, it suffers from coincidence and fine-tuning problems [9, 10]. Since then, many attempts have been proposed to address these issues and the literature therefore offers a variety of models as candidates to describe dark energy [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. A dark energy fluid with negative pressure and positive energy density may be a candidate to describe cosmic acceleration [13], although the exact nature of this dark energy still remains a mystery. In particular, negative pressure can be obtained using quintessence dark energy, where quintessence is more precisely a scalar field [11]. Nevertheless, quintessence model fails to avoid fine-tuning in explaining the cosmic coincidence problem. In that regard, the Chaplygin fluid prescription provides a good alternative to explain the transition from a universe filled with dustlike matter in the early era to an accelerated expansion phase in the late stage [21]. In fact, the Chaplygin gas and its generalized models have been investigated and confronted with different observational cosmological measurements by several researchers [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. If it is assumed that the universe is filled with an exotic form of fluid, described by a Chaplygin-type equation of state (EoS), then dark energy could be present in stellar interiors. In recent years there has therefore been a growing interest in investigating the role of dark energy on the relativistic (internal and/or external) structure of compact objects. As a matter of fact, Anti-de Sitter black holes surrounded by Chaplygin Dark Fluid (CDF) were recently investigated [31, 32, 33], where the existence of a dark fluid described by the Chaplygin gas as a cosmic background is assumed. Additionally, Li and collaborators [34] explored the impact of CDF on the geodesic structure, shadows and optical appearance of a black hole surrounded by various profiles of accretions. In particular, the authors showed that the CDF parameter B plays a crucial role in the formation of optical images of the black hole, by affecting features such as the event horizon radius, photon sphere radius, and the radius of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO)/OSCO. In addition to black holes, the connection between dark energy and compact stars has become an active area of research in the last few years. Indeed, it was shown that Chaplygin-type EoS gives rise to compact-star radii and masses compatible with astrophysical observations [35, 36, 37, 38], and such stars are often referred to as dark energy stars (DESs) [39, 40, 41, 42]. These single-phase models have recently been extended to a hybrid context [43], where dark energy is confined in the core of the compact star while the crust contains baryonic matter. The presence of the dark energy core (made of a CDF) leads to a sizable change in the internal structure of NSs with a polytropic EoS for the external layer. Despite the crust being described by a simple EoS, there is a great possibility that these stars exist in the universe since they are dynamically stable under radial perturbations and because their mass-radius relations are compatible with observational measurements. In this work, we aim to extend this simple toy model of hybrid stars by adopting more realistic EoSs to describe the crust and to investigate the influence of the dark energy core on their tidal deformability which are measurable in the chirp signals of merging NSs. To depict the ordinary matter of the outer layer, we use two well-known models, i.e., the relativistic mean-field (RMF) and the Skyrme one. The arrangement of this paper is the following: in Sec. II we provide both EoSs to depict our hybrid star model, one for the dark energy core and one for the crust made of hadronic matter. We employ parametrizations of two different hadronic models to describe the outer layer so that our stellar model is characterized by four astrophysical parameters \{\rho_{c},\rho_{\rm dis}^{+},\alpha,A\}. We introduce the basic differential equations related to spherically symmetric equilibrium configurations in the theory of General Relativity in Sec. III. We continue our discussion of numerical calculations especially focusing on the mass-radius diagram, tidal deformability, and the radial stability for the rapid phase transition in Sec. IV. In the same section, we compare our theoretical predictions with observational data. Finally, we give a summary and our conclusions in Sec. V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08774v1,JWST observations constrain the time evolution of fine structure constants and dark energy-electromagnetic coupling,"It was hypothesized in the literature that some physical parameters may be time-evolving and the astrophysical data can serve as a probe. Recently, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have released its early observations. In this work, we select the JWST spectroscopic observations of the high redshift (z>7.1) galaxies with strong [O III] (\lambda=4959Å and 5007Å in the rest frame) emission lines to constraint the evolution of the fine structure constant (\alpha). With the spectra from two galaxies at redshifts of 7.19 and 8.47, the deviation of \alpha to its fiducial value is found to be as small as 0.44^{+8.4+1.7}_{-8.3-1.7}\times 10^{-4} and -10.0^{+18+1.5}_{-18-1.5}\times 10^{-4}, respectively (the first error is statistical and the latter is systematic). The combination of our results with the previous data reveals that \frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{d\alpha}{dt}=0.30^{+4.5}_{-4.5}\times 10^{-17}~{}{\rm yr% ^{-1}}. Clearly, there is no evidence for a cosmic evolution of \alpha. The prospect of further constraining the time evolution of \alpha is also discussed. The scalar field of dark energy is hypothesized to drive the acceleration of the universe’s expansion through an interaction with the electromagnetic field. By integrating the observational data of the fine-structure constant variation, \frac{\Delta\alpha}{\alpha}(z), we have established a stringent upper limit on the coupling strength between dark energy and electromagnetism. Our analysis yields \zeta\leq 3.92\times 10^{-7} at the 95% confidence level, representing the most stringent bound to date.","Fundamental physical constants are one facet of nature’s laws, but are they really non-revolving in the universe? Dirac (1937) proposed the famous large-number coincidence, suggesting an association between fundamental constants and the current status of the universe. About one decade after that, Teller (1948) argued that the time variation of gravitational constant (G) seems impossible due to the ecosystems on our Earth. Nevertheless, further probe is still necessary to check whether there is the cosmic evolution of the physical constants or not. One good target is the fine-structure constant which can be expressed as \alpha=\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\hbar c}, where e is the electron charge, \varepsilon_{0} is the vacuum permittivity, \hbar is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light in the vacuum. The numerical value of this dimensionless constant is found to be \alpha^{-1}=137.035999206(11) (Morel et al. 2020). A reliable identification of a deviation of \alpha from such a standard value would suggest the presence of the new physics. In the middle of the 20^{th} century, Stanyukovich (1963) and Gamow (1967) introduced the idea of time-variation of \alpha in cosmology. Dyson (1967) deduced that the time variation of e is less than 1/1600 during the history of Earth from the terrestrial existence of the nuclei Re^{187} and Os^{187}. But Gamow (1967) did give suggestions on the detection of the time-varying \alpha through astronomical sources. Savedoff (1956) firstly analyzed the spectral fine-structure of the emission lines of [N II] and [Ne III] in the spectrum of the nearby Seyfert galaxy. Astronomers have since been clear that the upper bound of the relative variation \Delta\alpha/\alpha and the time variation \frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{d\alpha}{dt} in our local universe must be extremely small (Petrov et al. 2006; Rosenband et al. 2008; Wilczynska et al. 2015; Martins & Pinho 2017). Consequently, modern observations focus on high-redshift celestial bodies to explore the potential change of \alpha in the early universe (Alves et al. 2018; Wilczynska et al. 2020). Thanks to the successful launch and outstanding performance of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), astronomers are now able to catch a glimpse of the young generation of galaxies and stars at very high redshifts. Recently, Jiang et al. 2024a, b111After the initial submission of our manuscript for publication on May 4, 2024, Jiang et al. 2024b appeared in arXiv. In our analysis, just the high resolution spectral data have been taken into account, while Jiang et al. 2024b also analyzed the medium resolution data. constraint on high redshift evolution of fine-structure constant with galaxy spectrum, improved the high redshift research of electromagnetism force. With the JWST data, the possible cosmic evolution of \alpha and dark energy-electromagnetism coupling can be further explored, which is the main purpose of this work. In this paper we probe the cosmic variation of \alpha using the [O III] \lambda\lambda4959,5007 doublet emission-lines (hereafter [O III]) of the very high redshift (z>7) galaxies. These two lines do not suffer from serious absorption and are strong enough to be reliably measured in the infrared spectrum of the high redshift objects. We concentrate on two sources at the redshifts of z=8.47 and 7.19 from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES; Eisenstein et al. 2023; Bunker et al. 2023). The structure of this work is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our sample, discuss the advantages of the [O III] doublet to probe the possible variations of \alpha, and outline our method for fitting the spectroscopic data. Section 3 covers the calculation of the variation of \alpha and the presentation of our key findings. We will wrap up and delve into the implications of our results in Section 4. In Section 4, we constraint the time evolution of the fine-structure constant and Dark Energy-electromagnetism coupling. Additionally, we address potential contamination issues associated with the [O III] method utilized in this study. Throughout this work, we adopt a \Lambda-CDM Model with H_{0}=67.4{\rm\,km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}, \Omega_{m}=0.3, and \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7 (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08710v1,Damping of density oscillations from bulk viscosity in quark matter,"In this contribution, we extend the discussion about the calculation of the bulk viscosity of quark matter in the normal phase due to electroweak processes and its effect on the damping of baryon density oscillations that might occur in the coalescence of two compact stars. Employing the EoSs from the MIT bag model and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) up to \mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s}), we analyze our results varying densities in the range of temperatures from 0 to 10 MeV for frequencies around 1 kHz. Our estimates show that bulk viscous effects might play a relevant role during the postmerger stage if the system reaches a deconfined quark matter phase.","From the theoretical point of view, a lot of effort has been invested in elucidating the composition of compact stars. Conventional approaches involve the study of different microscopic models and their associated equations of state (EoSs), the dynamical processes that occur in their interior, and their response to external perturbations. In the latter case, one resorts to transport theory to obtain the rate at which conserved quantities such as energy, momentum, mass, charge and others are transferred from one region to another within the medium by computing the transport coefficients (viscosities, relaxation times, conductivities and others) [1]. The value of the transport coefficients is determined by the microscopic composition and the dominant interactions of the constituents. Concerning the bulk viscosity, there are indications that bulk viscous dissipation may be physically important in the survival time of the post-merger object a few milliseconds after the coalescence of two neutron stars [2]. Thus, the inclusion of bulk viscosity on numerical simulations of mergers might be important in its postmerger dynamics."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08676v1,Investigating Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei with Long-term Optical and X-Ray Observations,"Context. Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) show the appearance and disappearance of broad emission lines in their UV/optical spectra on timescales of months to decades.Aims. We investigate here how CL transitions depend on several AGN parameters such as accretion rate, obscuration properties and black hole mass.Methods. We study a sample of 20 nearby optically-identified CLAGNs from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), using quasi-simultaneous optical and X-ray observations taken in the last \sim 40 years.Results. We find that for all CLAGNs, the transition is accompanied by a change in Eddington ratio. The CL transitions are not associated with changes in the obscuration properties of the AGN. CLAGNs are found to have a median Eddington ratio lower than the AGNs in the BASS sample in which CL transitions were not detected. The median of the transition Eddington ratio (Eddington ratio at which AGN changes its state) is found to be \sim 0.01 for type 1 \leftrightarrow 1.8/1.9/2 transition, which is consistent with the hard \leftrightarrow soft state transition in black hole X-ray binaries. Most CL events are constrained to occur within 3–4 years, which is considerably shorter than the expected viscous timescale in AGN accretion disk.Conclusions. The transitions of the optical CLAGNs studied here are likely associated to state changes in the accretion flow, possibly driven by disk-instability.","Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are powered by the accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located at the center of galaxies (e.g., Rees, 1988). In the optical/UV, AGNs are generally classified as either type 1 or type 2. Type 1 AGNs show both broad emission lines (BELs; full-width half maxima; FWHM >1000 km s-1 ) originating in the broad line region (BLR) and narrow emission lines (NELs; FWHM <1000 km s-1 ) originating in the narrow line region (NLR). Type 2 AGNs show only NELs in their UV/optical spectra. Depending on the strength of the BELs, finer classifications (type 1.5, 1.8, and 1.9) can be used (e.g., Osterbrock, 1981; Winkler, 1992a). In the X-rays, on the other hand, AGNs are classified based on their obscuration properties, and in particular by their line-of-sight hydrogen column density (N_{\rm H}). AGNs can be usually defined to be obscured if N_{\rm H}>10^{22} cm-2 , while they are referred as unobscured if N_{\rm H}<10^{22} cm-2 . Furthermore, obscured AGNs can be divided into Compton-thick (CT; N_{\rm H}>10^{24} cm-2 ) and Compton thin (N_{\rm H}<10^{24} cm-2 ). Generally, type 1 AGNs are found to be unobscured, while type 2 AGNs are obscured (e.g., Awaki et al., 1991; Koss et al., 2017; Ricci et al., 2017a; Oh et al., 2022). The FWHM of the emission lines is in good agreement with the X-ray obscuration, with type 1–1.8 AGNs having N_{\rm H}<10^{21.9} cm-2 , and type 2 AGNs having N_{\rm H}>10^{21.9} cm-2 ; however, type 1.9 AGNs show a range of N_{\rm H} (Koss et al., 2017, 2022b). These different classes of AGN can be explained by the simplified AGN unification model (UM), which is based on the orientation with respect to an anisotropic absorber (e.g., Urry & Padovani, 1995; Antonucci, 1993; Netzer, 2015; Ramos Almeida & Ricci, 2017). According to this scheme, type 1s are observed face-on, with BLR and NLR visible to the observer, while type 2s are observed edge-on, with the view to the BLR covered by the obscuring material, which leaves only the NLR directly visible to the observer. The intermediate classes of AGNs (type 1.5, 1.8, 1.9) are thought to be seen through the edge of the obscuring material, where the gas is not optically thick enough to block the entire BLR (e.g., Antonucci, 1993; Goodrich, 1995; Runco et al., 2016). While the UM provides a good first-order explanation to the different AGN populations, over the past few decades it has been shown that several additional parameters, such as the covering factor of obscuring materials, accretion rate, can affect the probability of an AGN to be observed as obscured or unobscured (e.g., Elitzur & Ho, 2009; Ricci et al., 2017b, 2023). Changing-look AGNs (CLAGNs) are the objects that show drastic optical and X-ray spectral variability on timescales that range from hours to years and can be generally divided into two classes (see Ricci & Trakhtenbrot, 2023, for a recent review). In the UV/optical, CLAGNs transition from type 1 to type 2, or vice versa, within timescales of months to decades. Most of these objects can be considered as ‘changing-state’ AGNs (CSAGNs). In X-rays, typically, a different kind of CL event is observed. In these objects, the N_{\rm H} show rapid variability on a timescale of hours to years. We refer to these objects as ‘changing-obscuration’ AGNs (COAGNs). Over the years, many AGNs, such as NGC 1566 (Oknyansky et al., 2019), NGC 3516 (Ilić et al., 2020), Mrk 1018 (Cohen et al., 1986), Mrk 590 (Shappee et al., 2014), have been found to show CL transitions on a timescale of months to decades. Many of those sources had undergone such transitions more than once. For example, Mrk 1018 was turned off to enter the type 1.9 state in 1984 (Cohen et al., 1986) and re-brightened again to transition to type 1 state in 2008 (Shappee et al., 2014). NGC 1566 showed CL transition several times in the past 60 years, changing its state between type 1 and 1.8/1.9 (Shobbrook, 1966; Pastoriza & Gerola, 1970; Alloin et al., 1986; Baribaud et al., 1992; Oknyansky et al., 2020). NGC 4151 was initially identified as type 1 AGN in the 1970s, but it moved to type 1.8/1.9 in the 1980s with the disappearance of the broad lines (Osterbrock, 1981; Shapovalova et al., 2010). Later, the source changed back to type 1 state as it re-gained the broad lines. In addition to the local Seyfert galaxies, several higher redshift quasars have been found to show the CL transitions (e.g., LaMassa et al., 2015; Merloni et al., 2015; MacLeod et al., 2016). Recently, Zeltyn et al. (2024) identified 116 CLAGNs in the first year data in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) with repeated spectroscopic observations, of which 107 sources are newly identified CLAGNs. That sample of CLAGNs is the largest reported to date. The origin of the CS and CO events is still unclear, and many models have been proposed to explain these events. Generally, the COAGNs are linked to obscuration associated with the clumpiness of the BLR or the circumnuclear molecular dusty gas and dust (e.g., Nenkova et al., 2008a, b; Yaqoob et al., 2015; Ricci et al., 2016; Jana et al., 2020, 2022). The CSAGNs are believed to be caused by the change in the accretion rate, which is attributed to the local disk instabilities (Stern et al., 2018; Noda & Done, 2018), or major disk perturbation, such as tidal disruption events (TDEs; e.g., Merloni et al., 2015; Ricci et al., 2020). Some CS events were explained by moving gas clouds and dust which attenuate the BLR emission (e.g., Goodrich, 1989, 1995; Zeltyn et al., 2022). However, various problems arise when explaining the CS events with obscuration. One needs a large dusty cloud to cover the BLR efficiently, which would take tens of years, assuming reasonable cloud velocity (e.g., LaMassa et al., 2015). However, many CS transitions are observed in a much shorter timescale of months to years (e.g., Denney et al., 2014; Trakhtenbrot et al., 2019; Oknyansky et al., 2019). Additionally, the signature of the obscuration is not observed in the X-ray spectra during/after the transitions (e.g., Denney et al., 2014). In fact, many CSAGNs show the same level of obscuration before and after the transition. Furthermore, many CSAGNs are found to be unobscured, discarding obscuration as a reason for CS events (e.g., Lyu et al., 2021; Jana et al., 2021). The optical continuum flux also changes with the BEL flux, indicating the accretion flow as a reason for the CS transitions (e.g., Ricci & Trakhtenbrot, 2023). Few AGNs, such as NGC 1365 and NGC 7582, showed both CS and CO transitions in the past (e.g., Risaliti et al., 2007; Temple et al., 2023b; Neustadt et al., 2023). However, those transitions are not correlated and are observed in different timescales, indicating independent transitions. Polarimetric studies also suggest that CS transitions are unlikely due to changes in the obscuration properties of the source (e.g., Marin, 2017; Hutsemékers et al., 2019, 2020). The BELs flux responds to changes in the ionizing luminosity, which is evident from reverberation studies (e.g., Blandford & McKee, 1982; Peterson, 1993; Runco et al., 2016; Fonseca Alvarez et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2021a; Oknyansky et al., 2023a). The appearance and disappearance of the BELs are examples of the extreme variability of the BLR. In the disk-wind model, the BLR could originate from outflows produced by the accretion disk, which directly connects the BELs with the accretion rate (e.g., Emmering et al., 1992; Nicastro, 2000; Elitzur & Ho, 2009; Temple et al., 2023a). In this framework, the BLR would not be sustained below a certain luminosity, L_{\rm crit}<2.3\times 10^{40} M_{8}^{2/3} erg s-1 (M_{8} is black hole mass in 10^{8} M_{\odot}; Elitzur & Ho, 2009). This model suggests that the AGN would follow the transition sequence as type 2 \rightarrow 1.8/1.9 \rightarrow 1.2/1.5 \rightarrow 1.0, with increasing accretion rate (Elitzur, 2012; Elitzur et al., 2014). Local disk instabilities in the accretion disk could also explain CS events (Noda & Done, 2018; Sniegowska et al., 2020). The instabilities can be triggered by various mechanisms on different timescales (e.g., Ricci & Trakhtenbrot, 2023). In Mrk 1018, the CS transition is explained with the disk-instability model (Noda & Done, 2018). The CS transition is linked with the soft excess, which is believed to ionize the gas clouds in the BLR. In Mrk 1018, the BEL disappeared when the Eddington ratio (\lambda_{\rm Edd} ) decreased from \sim 0.08 to \sim 0.006, with the primary continuum and soft excess flux reduced by a factor of \sim 60 and \sim 7, respectively. This transition is tied with the soft-to-hard spectral state transition, similar to black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), which occurs at \lambda_{\rm Edd} \simeq 0.01-0.02 (e.g., Maccarone, 2003; Done et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2015). Similar behavior is also found in other CSAGNs (e.g., Ai et al., 2020; Ruan et al., 2019). Figure 1: Distribution of \lambda_{\rm Edd} with the spectral states for each source. The red-dashed horizontal lines in each panel represent the transition Eddington ratio (\lambda_{\rm Edd}^{\rm tr}) for each source, except NGC 2992. NGC 2992 did not show transition between type 1 and type 1.8–2 states. The timescale of CSAGNs is a concerning factor when comparing it with state transitions in BHXBs. Simple mass-scaling relations indicate the viscous timescale for the AGNs with mass of \sim 10^{6-8}M_{\odot} would be \sim 10^{4-6} years. However, the timescale would reduce as the accretion disk of AGN is radiation pressure-driven, as opposed to the gas pressure-driven accretion disk in BHXBs (Noda & Done, 2018). The inclusion of magnetic field would further decrease the timescale (Feng et al., 2021b). Additionally, various instability mechanisms are suggested to explain the timescale of the CS transitions (e.g., Sheng et al., 2017; Sniegowska et al., 2020; Scepi et al., 2021). Some CSAGNs are associated with external perturbation, such as TDE. In CS quasar SDSS J0159+0033, TDE is believed to cause the CS transition (Merloni et al., 2015). In the local universe, the CS transition in 1ES 1927+654 is also found to be caused by TDE (Trakhtenbrot et al., 2019; Ricci et al., 2020). The CL event in narrow line Seyfert galaxy SDSS J015804.75–005221.8 can also be associated with the TDE (Petrushevska et al., 2023). In a sample of CLAGN with Swift-BAT light curves, Temple et al. (2023b) found that a majority of CLAGN showed clear changes in their 14-195 keV X-ray flux at the same time as the change in optical type. This suggests that the majority of CL events in local AGN are not due to changes in obscuration but must instead be driven by changes in the accretion state. However, detailed spectral modeling across the full X-ray energy range is needed to confirm this suggestion, which is one aim of this work. In this paper, we investigate how the optically identified CL transitions depend on several AGN parameters, such as accretion rate (in terms of \lambda_{\rm Edd} ), obscuration (in terms of N_{\rm H}), and black hole mass. Additionally, we provide constraints on the timescale of the CL transitions with long-term observations. For this purpose, we study a sample of 20 optically-identified CLAGNs using the archival quasi-simultaneous optical and X-ray observations taken in the last \sim 40 years. In Section 2, we present our sample and measurements. In Section 3, we present the result of our analysis. In Section 4, we discuss our findings. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize our results. Throughout the paper, we used \LambdaCDM cosmology, with the H_{0} = 70 km s-1 Mpc-1, \Omega_{\rm M} = 0.3, \Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.7. Figure 2: Median Eddington ratio in each spectral state. The blue circles represent the median for \lambda_{\rm Edd} for CLAGNs. The orange diamonds represent the median of \lambda_{\rm Edd} for the other AGNs from BASS sample for which CL transitions were not detected."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08564v1,Shadow analysis of an approximate rotating black hole solution with weakly coupled global monopole charge,"We investigate the shadow properties of a rotating black hole with a weakly coupled global monopole charge, using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm. This study explores how this charge and rotational effects shape the black hole’s shadow, causal structure, and ergoregions, with implications for distinguishing it from Kerr-like solutions. Analysis of null geodesics reveals observable features that may constrain the global monopole charge and weak coupling parameters within nonminimal gravity frameworks. Observational data from M87* and Sgr A* constrain the global monopole charge and coupling constant to 0\leq\gamma\lesssim 0.036 and -0.2\lesssim\alpha\leq 0, respectively.keywords: Black holes, nonminimal coupling, global monopole charge, Newman-Janis algorithm, shadow PACS numbers: 04.20.Fy, 04.20.Jb, 04.25.-g","Black holes are among the most fascinating astrophysical phenomena predicted by general relativity (GR) and have been central to theoretical and observational research for decades. Observations of M87* [1] and Sgr A* [2] by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration have intensified interest in black holes, allowing us to probe their properties beyond theoretical models. Despite GR’s successes at cosmic scales, it faces significant limitations when addressing quantum effects, topological defects, and certain early-universe phenomena. For instance, GR does not inherently include quantum-scale phenomena or high-energy structures, such as global monopoles, which are predicted by symmetry-breaking mechanisms in various field theories [3, 4]. These monopoles, arising from phase transitions in the early universe, are characterized by a global monopole charge (GMC) that affects spacetime geometry. The presence of the GMC meaningfully alters black hole properties, influencing thermodynamic behavior, stability, and observable features such as photon orbits and shadow boundaries [5, 4, 6]. Studying black holes with a GMC thus offers a valuable connection between gravitational and particle physics, revealing possible limitations of GR and suggesting pathways for developing modified gravitational theories. In fact, topological defects like global monopoles are predicted by grand unified theories and arise from the Kibble mechanism, which links defect formation to the breaking of specific symmetry groups during cosmological phase transitions [7, 8]. A global monopole, resulting from the symmetry breaking of \mathrm{SO}(3) to \mathrm{U}(1), generates a unique gravitational effect that can be modeled by a Schwarzschild-like metric with an additional GMC term. This charge is connected to the symmetry-breaking energy scale and modifies spacetime by introducing a deficit angle, which affects the paths of test particles and the bending of light. Furthermore, the monopole’s core mass can be negative or negligible, leading to a repulsive gravitational effect that produces distinct features in black hole metrics. Furthermore, in modified gravity theories, the gravitational influence of global monopoles has been extensively studied, particularly in models that incorporate matter-curvature coupling [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. A recent study [17] in nonminimally coupled gravity showed that interactions between matter and geometry impart intriguing properties to global monopoles. In particular, the nonminimal coupling yields a positive core mass for the monopole and affects its internal structure, including core size. This study also examined the possibility of a nonminimal global monopole acting as an extra ”hair” for a Schwarzschild black hole. By analyzing geodesic motion and gravitational light bending in the weak coupling regime, the study aimed to identify potential observational signatures of the GMC. This approach enables constraints on the nonminimal coupling and GMC parameters, providing insights into the symmetry-breaking scale. Recent work in Ref. [18] further investigated light propagation in the vicinity of this black hole, proposing observational limits on spacetime parameters. Building on this interest in the impact of GMC on black hole properties, this paper examines the shadow of the rotating counterpart of this black hole. Analyzing the shadow of rotating black holes is essential, as it reveals observational signatures that can help differentiate various gravitational theories and enhance our understanding of spacetime geometry, especially in the presence of exotic features like topological defects. To obtain the rotating solution, we take the static metric introduced above as the seed and apply a modified version of the Newman-Janis algorithm (NJA) [19] to generate the rotating counterpart. This modified Newman-Janis algorithm (MNJA), as presented in Refs. [20, 21], is particularly effective when extended to theories beyond GR, offering improved accuracy and stability in these contexts. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. II provides an overview of the static black hole solution with a weakly coupled GMC, covering its spacetime and causal structure. In Sect. III, we apply the MNJA step-by-step to derive the rotating counterpart of the static black hole. Sect. IV examines the causal structure of the resulting spacetime, including horizon formation under varying black hole parameters, as well as the ergoregions and their evolution in terms of the GMC and coupling constant. Sect. V introduces the Lagrangian formalism and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to study light propagation in the black hole’s exterior geometry. Here, we derive equations of motion for null geodesics and identify conditions for spherical photon orbits, mapping photon regions outside the event horizon and demonstrating the effects of the GMC on these regions. This section also parametrizes the celestial plane for an observer at infinity, enabling shadow boundary plots for several cases and detailed analysis of their properties. To facilitate observational testing, Sect. VI introduces shadow observables and derives their mathematical expressions. We use these to constrain the GMC and coupling constant based on EHT data for M87* and Sgr A*. In Sect. VII, we calculate the black hole’s evaporation rate, considering parameter constraints inferred from EHT data. Finally, we summarize our findings in Sect. VIII. Throughout this paper, we adopt natural units with G=c=1=M_{\rm{pl}}, and use a sign convention of (-,+,+,+), with primes denoting differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08554v1,Blandford-Znajek power as a strong-gravity signature,"The Blandford-Znajek mechanism is an electromagnetic manifestation of the Penrose process that currently constitutes the best theoretical candidate to explain the launching of relativistic jets by black holes. In this talk we offer a modern review about the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and the analytic construction of black hole magnetospheres. Higher order perturbative corrections are crucial in order to produce results that are complementary to numerical simulations when the black hole is in the high-spin regime, and can potentially predict new features about the non-perturbative structure of the Blandford-Znajek theory. Moreover, we show by means of an explicit example that these perturbative corrections depend in a non-degenerate manner on the underlying theory of gravity considered, enabling one to use the BZ power emitted as a strong-gravity signature to test General Relativity against alternative theories of gravity on future horizon-scale observations.","The mechanism responsible for the emission of jets by supermassive Black Holes (BHs) is one of the outstanding questions in the field of relativistic astrophysics. New observational perspectives were recently opened by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), with the potential to shed a new light on the complex interplay of matter and electromagnetic fields subject to the extreme conditions characterizing the BH environment. In fact the observations already revealed some of the features expected to be crucial in the physics of jet emission: the polarized images of M87* produced by EHT confirmed that strong and ordered magnetic fields are present at the horizon scale [1, 2, 3, 4], whereas comparisons with synthetic templates obtained by means of GRMHD simulations fostered models in which the BH is rapidly spinning and the jet is launched via the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism [5]. Since its first theoretical formulation, and well before the strong indications provided by EHT, the BZ mechanism has always been considered a favourite theoretical candidate to explain how relativistic jets are launched and sustained by BHs immersed in strongly magnetised environments, and many research efforts have been devoted to clarify its dynamics and its relevance in BH physics [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. According to our modern understanding, the BZ mechanism is an electromagnetic manifestation of a generalised Penrose process [18, 19], in which the active component operating the energy and angular momentum extraction is a strong magnetosphere that spins together with the BH. The nature of the BZ mechanism is thus deeply rooted in general relativity, and a natural question to ask in this regard is whether strong-gravity signatures can be derived by analyzing the power emitted in this process. In order to address this question it is therefore crucial to clarify which elements contribute to the expression that characterize the BZ power. Intuitively, due to its Penrose process-like nature, it is to be expected that the faster the BH spins the more energy will be available to be extracted. Moreover, since the energy extraction is operated by the magnetic environment in which the BH is immersed, one also expects that the greater is the number of open magnetic field lines penetrating the horizon the more energy can be transfered from the BH to the infinity. A leading order approximation for the BZ power, already derived in the seminal BZ paper [5], is indeed considered to be \dot{E}_{+}\simeq\kappa\left(2\pi\Psi_{H}\right)^{2}\Omega_{H}^{2}, where \kappa is a numerical coefficient associated to the magnetospheric topology, (2\pi\Psi_{H}) represents the flux of open magnetic field lines threading the BH horizon, and \Omega_{H} is the BH angular velocity [20, 11]. The scaling \dot{E}_{+}\sim\Omega_{H}^{2}, in particular, is typically regarded as a distinguishing signature of the BZ mechanism, often employed in numerical investigation to identify the process. Nonetheless, analytical [17] as well as numerical [20] studies agree that for BHs in the high spinning regime the contribution of an additional high-spin factor f(\Omega_{H}) becomes relevant. A more accurate expression for the BZ power extracted that accounts for its presence, thus, reads \dot{E}_{+}=\kappa\left(2\pi\Psi_{H}\right)^{2}\Omega_{H}^{2}~{}f(\Omega_{H})~% {}~{}. (1) The function f(\Omega_{H}) can be computed either numerically, by fitting data extracted from the simulations [20], or analytically by combining perturbative approaches with matched asymptotic expansion schemes [17]. The latter method has been employed to derive an explicit sixth order expression for a split-monopole magnetospheres in the Kerr metric, that has been shown to be featured with logarithmic terms \begin{split}f(\Omega_{H})\simeq 1+1.38(M\Omega_{H})^{2}&-11.25(M\Omega_{H})^{% 4}+1.54|M\Omega_{H}|^{5}\\ &+\Big{[}11.64-0.17\log|M\Omega_{H}|\Big{]}(M\Omega_{H})^{6}+\dots~{}~{},\end{split} (2) and well agrees with simulations even for BHs spinning closely to the Thorne limit [17]. From Eq. (2) one can immediately observe that if the BH is slowly spinning the usual quadratic scaling in \Omega_{H} is recovered as the leading order term of the series. Moreover, numerical indications give support to the fact that f(\Omega_{H}) only weakly dependends on the details of the magnetospheric configuration [20], and thus one can expect the expression above to be characteristic of the BZ mechanism in the Kerr background. Given our current understanding of the BZ mechanism it is natural to ask where the strong-gravity nature of this process manifests at the level of Eq. (1), and whether such an expression enables us to test the Kerr paradigm in future horizon-scale observations at EHT, with the aim of understanding if the BHs emitting relativistic jets are well described by the Kerr metric or not. The main goal here [21] is to motivate and provide theoretical support to the idea that the high-spin factor f(\Omega_{H}) is not only necessary to correctly model the energy extraction for rapidly spinning BHs, but it is also the quantity where the details of the background metric enter unambiguously in the power (1). In this regards we notice that truncating the BZ power at the leading order, \dot{E}_{+}\sim\Omega_{H}^{2}, would not be useful to test the nature of a BH, since the angular velocity \Omega_{H} is typically a quantity degenerate in the parameters that characterize the spacetime metric [22, 21]. We support this hypothesis by exploring analytically a concrete example in which the BZ mechanism operates in the context of an alternative theory of gravity, and by studying how the power extracted deviates from the expression derived in the Kerr metric [21]. As a prototype of a non-Kerr background we consider a stationary and axisymmetric BH solution of Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG) [23] – also known in the literature as MOdified Gravity (MOG) – called Kerr-MOG [24]. STVG constitutes a covariant extension of GR still not discharded by observations, in which an additional repulsive Yukawa potential alters the asymptotic value of the effective gravitational coupling constant compared to its value close to the source. In this way the theory provides a possible justification to phenomena like the galaxy rotation curves without invoking dark matter [25]. We refer the reader to the literature for extensive details about STVG, while here we limit to stress that an additional deformation parameter q=(G_{\infty}-G_{N})/G_{N} enters the Kerr-MOG solution, accounting for deviation from the Newton constant at large scales [24]. Explicitly, the Kerr-MOG metric in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates is given by ds^{2}=-\frac{\Delta_{q}\Sigma}{\Pi}dt^{2}+\frac{\Pi\sin^{2}\theta}{\Sigma}% \left(d\phi-\omega_{q}dt\right)^{2}+\frac{\Sigma}{\Delta_{q}}\,dr^{2}+\Sigma\,% d\theta^{2}~{}~{}, (3) with \Sigma=r^{2}+a^{2}\cos^{2}\theta, \Pi=(r^{2}+a^{2})^{2}-a^{2}\Delta_{q}\sin^{2}\theta, \Delta_{q}=r^{2}-2M_{q}r+a^{2}+q/(1+q)M_{q}^{2} and \omega_{q}=a(2M_{q}r-q/(1+q)^{2}M_{q})/\Pi. The Arnoitt-Deser-Misner mass and angular momentum depend on the deformation parameter q according to M_{q}=(1+q)M and J=aM_{q} [26]. The coordinate singularities are located at r_{\pm}=M_{q}\left(1\pm\sqrt{1/(1+q)-(a/M_{q})^{2}}\right) and the BH angular velocity is \Omega_{H}(q)=a/M_{q}\left(2r_{+}-q/(1+q)M_{q}\right)^{-1}. From here we see that the angular velocity is degenerate with respect to the spin a and the deformation parameter q, and therefore the quadratic scaling that characterize the leading order expression of the BZ power, \dot{E}\sim\Omega_{H}^{2}, is not useful to perform tests on the Kerr paradigm. Having clarified the motivations and the context in which this research proceeds, in the following sections we offer a short review of the BH magnetospheric problem and of the analytic techniques that can be employed to construct consistent models. These approaches can be systematically adapted in non-Kerr backgrounds to derive expression of the BZ power emitted in alternative theories of gravity, as we show in the last section by analyzing the case of a Kerr-MOG BH."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08486v1,"Determining parameters of Kerr-Newman black holes 
by shadow observation from finite distance and spatial infinity","We present a method for determining the physical parameters of a Kerr-Newman black hole through shadow observation. In a system comprising a Kerr-Newman black hole, an observer, and a light source, the relevant parameters are mass M, specific angular momentum a, electric charge Q, inclination angle i, and distance r_{o}. We consider the cases where the observer is at either a finite distance or spatial infinity. Using our method, the dimensionless parameters (a/M,Q/M,i) can be determined by observing the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole from spatial infinity. We analytically prove that the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole observed from spatial infinity is unique, where uniqueness is defined as the absence of two congruent shadow contours for distinct sets of dimensionless parameter values. This method is versatile and can be applied to a range of black hole solutions with charge. Additionally, we show analytically that the shadow contour of a Kerr-Newman black hole observed from a finite distance r_{o} is not unique, meaning that the parameters of a Kerr-Newman black hole at finite distance cannot be determined from shadow observations. This result reveals a new challenge and provides a clear direction for further research on black hole shadows.","A black hole is a fascinating celestial object that serves as the ultimate testing ground for studying the physics of strong gravitational fields. Observing a black hole shadow has long been a significant goal in physics. This shadow is formed when light emitted by matter surrounding the black hole is bent by the black hole’s intense gravitational pull. Recently, Earth-sized very long baseline interferometers achieved a milestone by capturing images of two black hole candidates. The first image captured {\rm M87}^{\ast} EventHorizonTelescope:2019dse ; EventHorizonTelescope:2019uob ; EventHorizonTelescope:2019jan ; EventHorizonTelescope:2019ths ; EventHorizonTelescope:2019ggy ; EventHorizonTelescope:2021bee ; EventHorizonTelescope:2021srq , and the second focused on {\rm Sgr~{}A}^{\ast} EventHorizonTelescope:2022xnr ; EventHorizonTelescope:2022vjs ; EventHorizonTelescope:2022wok ; EventHorizonTelescope:2022exc ; EventHorizonTelescope:2022urf ; EventHorizonTelescope:2022xqj . Both images displayed a prominent ring, marking a major advancement in black hole imaging techniques. However, the darker central region, known as the shadow, has yet to be clearly identified. Further enhancements in observation equipment are needed to resolve these shadows with greater precision EventHorizonTelescope:2019ths . Some researchers suggest that the study of black hole imaging began with the derivation of the shadow contour, which is now known as the apparent shape. The apparent shape of a Schwarzschild black hole was first derived in Ref. darwin1959gravity , followed by that of a Kerr black hole in Ref. Bardeen:1973xx . These foundational studies established the basis of shadow theory. Although these calculations focused on the apparent shapes of simple bare black holes without considering surrounding accretion disks, they highlighted the essential role of the photon sphere. This feature remains significant even in the shadow of a black hole with an accretion disk. Many researchers have explored black hole shadows and methods for extracting physical information, such as a specific angular momentum of a black hole, through shadow observations Hioki:2008zw ; Bambi:2010hf ; Amarilla:2010zq ; Amarilla:2013sj ; Wei:2013kza ; Papnoi:2014aaa ; Wei:2015dua ; Singh:2017vfr ; Stuchlik:2019uvf ; Tsukamoto:2024gkz . In this paper, however, we emphasize that there is still potential to improve the accuracy of measuring black hole parameters via shadow analysis. In particular, further study is needed to determine whether information like a specific angular momentum and electric charge of a black hole can be obtained solely from shadow observations. One way to investigate this possibility is examining whether the map from a parameter space to an image library is injective Hioki:2009na ; Hioki:2022mdg . It has been shown that the map from the parameter space to the apparent-shape library for a bare Kerr black hole is indeed injective Hioki:2009na ; Hioki:2023ozd . Here, the apparent-shape library refers to the set of all possible apparent shapes that can be produced within the framework of the given gravitational theory and model. The result suggests that the dimensionless specific angular momentum and inclination angle of a Kerr black hole can be uniquely determined by observing its apparent shape. Determining (1) whether an object is indeed a black hole, (2) identifying the specific black hole solution, and (3) accurately measuring its physical parameters based solely on shadow images is a challenging problem that requires extensive research. It is essential to generate a wide range of models for relativistic objects, thereby building an apparent-shape library that incorporates diverse parameters. Moreover, investigating the injectivity of the map is critical. If the map is not injective, it indicates the presence of images that correspond to different models and parameter configurations, making it impossible to uniquely determine the model based on shadow observations alone. These research efforts are ongoing, and further studies are necessary. As a first step toward addressing this problem, we assume that the black hole solution of the observed object has been identified, and it must be demonstrated that its parameters can be determined from shadow observations. When the target object is a black hole with three physical parameters (mass, angular momentum, and charge), no method has yet been proposed to uniquely determine these parameters from shadow observations alone, rather than merely constraining them. For this purpose, we assume that the observed object is a Kerr-Newman black hole. The system comprising the Kerr-Newman black hole and the observer includes the physical quantities of mass M, specific angular momentum a, electric charge Q, inclination angle i, and distance r_{o}. We consider both cases in which the observer is at a finite distance and at spatial infinity. For the first time in this paper, we show with a concrete method that the dimensionless parameters (a/M,Q/M,i) can be uniquely determined by observing the shadow when the observer is at spatial infinity. The key point is that the aforementioned map from the parameter space to the image library is injective. This method can be applied to various black hole solutions with charge and is highly versatile. We also show analytically that there is uniqueness in the contour of the black hole shadow when the observer is at spatial infinity. Uniqueness is defined as the absence of two congruent apparent shapes for two distinct dimensionless parameter values. The uniqueness of the apparent shape is the basis of our method for determining dimensionless parameters from shadow observations. Surprisingly, we analytically prove that uniqueness does not hold for the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole when the distance r_{o} of the black hole is finite. This is a different feature from the case of the apparent shape of the Kerr black hole at finite distance Hioki:2023ozd . This will be a problem to be solved in the future when there is an opportunity to observe black holes from a finite distance. It would be interesting to consider what would happen to this point if a more realistic model were considered, such as a black hole with an accretion disk. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we begin the analysis by deriving the null geodesic equations around the Kerr-Newman black hole and describing how to construct an apparent shape from these geodesics. In Sec. III, we present examples of the apparent shapes of the Kerr-Newman black hole at finite distances and then analytically demonstrate the non-uniqueness of these shapes. In Sec. IV, we analytically prove the uniqueness of the apparent shape in Bardeen coordinates. We also propose a method to systematically construct observables that characterize the apparent shape of Kerr-Newman black holes, showing that the dimensionless parameters of the system can be determined from shadow observations. In the final section, we summarize our analysis and discuss future prospects. We use geometrized units, where c=G=1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08440v1,Bayesian evaluation of hadron-quark phase transition models through neutron star observables in light of nuclear and astrophysics data,"We investigate the role of hybrid and nucleonic equations of state (EOSs) within neutron star (NS) interiors using Bayesian inference to evaluate their alignment with recent observational data from NICER and LIGO-Virgo (LV) collaborations. We find that smooth hybrid EOSs are slightly favoured in explaining NS mass-radius relations, particularly for pulsars such as PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620. However, this preference is not definitive, as gravitational wave (GW) data does not significantly differentiate between our hybrid and nucleonic models. Our analysis also reveals tensions between older NICER data and recent measurements for PSR J0437-4715, highlighting the need for more flexible EOS models. Through two sampling approaches — one fixing the hadronic EOS set and the other without fixing the same, we demonstrate that the hybrid EOS model can incorporate stiffer EOSs, resulting in a better agreement with NICER data but leading to higher tidal deformability, which is less consistent with GW observations. In some recent publications a parameter d_{c}, related to the trace anomaly and its derivative, is used to indicate the presence of deconfined quark matter. We find that our hadronic model, which does not include phase transition to deconfined matter, under the influence of imposed constraints, is able to predict values below 0.2 for d_{c} at around five times saturation density. The hybrid model goes below this threshold at lower densities under the same conditions.","Recent observational data, particularly from gravitational wave (GW) detections and precise pulsar measurements, have significantly advanced our understanding of neutron star (NS) interiors. Mass-radius estimation by NICER (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer) reported a radius of 12.71_{-1.19}^{+1.14} km and a mass of 1.34_{-0.16}^{+0.15} M⊙ [1] whereas an alternative study[2] found a radius of 13.02_{-1.06}^{+1.24} km and a mass of 1.44_{-0.14}^{+0.15} M⊙ for the pulsar PSR J0030+0451. Furthermore, NICER’s observations for the pulsar PSR J0740+6620 indicated an equatorial circumferential radius of 12.39^{+1.30}_{-0.98} km and a mass of 2.072_{-0.066}^{+0.067} M⊙ (with a 68% confidence interval)[3]. Most recent NICER observations of PSR J0437-4715 have measured its mass and radius 1.418 M⊙ and 11.36_{-0.63}^{+0.95} km respectively[4]. In addition to astrophysical observations, numerous research efforts[5, 6, 7, 8, 9] have focused on determining the EOS of strongly interacting NS matter, considering the saturation properties of nuclear matter. Inferred mass-radius values from the detection of GWs from binary NS merger event GW170817[10, 11, 12], combined with ab initio calculations like perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) at very high densities[13, 14] and chiral effective field theory (\chiEFT) models of neutron matter at low densities, have provided additional insights into the EOS of dense matter. These combined empirical observations and theoretical frameworks are essential for advancing our understanding of nuclear matter under extreme conditions[15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Owing to the incredibly high density within the core of an NS, the highly compressed matter might contain strange particles like hyperons[20, 21, 22], deconfined quarks[23, 24], Bose-Einstein condensates of antikaons[25], etc. In recent decades, numerous quark models (QM) have been investigated, suggesting the possibility of two-flavour colour superconductivity[26, 27, 28], the colour-flavour locked (CFL) phase, and even more complex states such as the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF)[29, 30], and crystalline superconducting phases[31]. The MIT bag model[32, 33] and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model are two widely used frameworks to describe QM within NS [34, 35, 36, 37]. Additionally, the hybrid EOS models often utilize the Mean Field Approximation of QCD (MFTQCD), which is derived from the QCD Lagrangian [38]. This approach considers the decomposition of a gluon field into soft and hard momentum components, where the mean field approximation for hard gluons contributes to stiffening the EOS, allowing for high pressures at high energy densities. On the other hand, the soft gluon fields generate condensates that soften the EOS, resulting in a bag-like term [38]. Usually, strange degrees of freedom soften the EOS, which results in a lower maximum mass and more compact star[23, 39]. However, some model-independent research indicates that the cores of most massive stars may align with the presence of QM[40, 41, 42]. Besides mass-radius, f-mode oscillation frequency is a potential probe of stellar structure[43, 44]. f-mode oscillations are sensitive to EOS. Hence, they can also give clues about the presence of exotic matter in the core of NS[45, 46]. The study of correlations among various aspects of stellar structure, such as mass, radius, tidal deformability, and f-mode frequencies, helps to infer properties that are otherwise difficult to measure directly. For NSs, the correlation between observed data with theoretical model parameters allows stringent limits on the EOS of dense matter. Some recent works[47, 48, 49] have analysed EOSs with hadron-quark phase transitions keeping in mind the latest astrophysical observations. The correlation between the radii of two NSs, like PSR J0030+0451, and PSR J0740+6620, with masses differing by \approx 0.6M_{\odot} as measured by NICER, was found to be noteworthy for EOSs with nucleonic degrees of freedom [50]. However, this correlation weakens during a first-order phase transition [51]. As a result, it might serve as a signature for the existence of hadron-quark phase transitions in NSs. In a recent publication [52], the correlation in the radius domain to f-mode oscillation frequency domain is translated using semi-universal relations. Also, analysis based on a few selected hybrid EOSs from the CompOSE database[53] with NICER data hints at non-nucleonic degrees of freedom for matter inside the NS core [52]. In this letter, we perform a detailed statistical analysis using large sets of hybrid EOSs. Considering the latest astrophysical constraints, we investigate whether NSs with a hadron-quark phase transition are more favourable compared to stars composed solely of nucleonic matter. Using recent observational data, we choose a systematic Bayesian inference approach to evaluate the Bayes Log Evidence for these two scenarios. Specifically, we calculate the Bayes Log Evidence based on astrophysical data for three cases: a purely nucleonic EOS, a hybrid EOS utilizing NICER data for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, and another hybrid EOS incorporating additional mass-radius constraints from the recent observation of PSR J0437-4715[4]. The article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the construction of hybrid EOS. Section 3 reviews the non-radial oscillations of NS. In Section 4, we present our results. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our findings and their implications for the study of NS interiors."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08407v1,Parameter estimation of protoneutron stars from gravitational wave signals using the Hilbert-Huang transform,"Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are potential multimessenger events detectable by current and future gravitational wave (GW) detectors. The GW signals emitted during these events are expected to provide insights into the explosion mechanism and the internal structures of neutron stars. In recent years, several studies have empirically derived the relationship between the frequencies of the GW signals originating from the oscillations of protoneutron stars (PNSs) and the physical parameters of these stars. This study applies the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) [Proc. R. Soc. A 454, 903 (1998)] to extract the frequencies of these modes to infer the physical properties of the PNSs. The results exhibit comparable accuracy to a short-time Fourier transform-based estimation, highlighting the potential of this approach as a complementary method for extracting physical information from GW signals of CCSNe.","Advanced gravitational-wave (GW) detectors now regularly observe signals from compact binary coalescences, with over 90 detections recorded to date [1, 2, 3, 4]. The anticipated next milestone for these detectors is the first observation of the GW signal from a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). A CCSN is an explosion of a massive star, which leads to the formation of either a neutron star or a stellar-mass black hole. This explosion usually emits electromagnetic waves, neutrinos, and GWs. Although the exact explosion mechanism remains unclear, it is widely believed that most stars undergo neutrino-driven explosions [5, 6]. Current GW detectors, like Advanced LIGO [7], Advanced Virgo [8], and KAGRA [9], are predicted to detect neutrino-driven CCSN explosions occurring within our Galaxy, reaching a distance of \sim 10 kpc [10]. Coherent network analysis of GW signal [11] also highlighted several important hydrodynamic features of CCSN. Next-generation ground-based GW detectors, such as the Cosmic Explorer [12, 13] and the Einstein Telescope (ET) [14], are anticipated to enable the detection of these events from other galaxies, such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. The kHz-band detector NEMO [15, 16] has also been proposed in Australia for studying nuclear physics by observing high-frequency GWs. The detection of GW signals and their neutrino counterparts from supernovae yields valuable insights into the inner core of stars, offering crucial information about the explosion mechanism. Modeling the collapse of the stellar core, the bounce, and the subsequent post-bounce evolution is extraordinarily complicated and computationally expensive. However, remarkable progress has been made in multidimensional numerical simulations of CCSN explosions over the last decade. The characteristics of the GW waveform depend on the properties of its progenitor, such as mass, angular velocity, and equation of state, as well as on how the simulations approximate general relativistic effects and treat neutrino transport. Recent developments in these computations have revealed common characteristics of the CCSN signals. While the current standard burst GW search pipeline, the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) [17, 18, 19], does not rely on specific waveform morphologies, studies have begun to utilize known features of GW waveforms in detection algorithms. In particular, the application of machine learning in detection algorithms [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] has been studied extensively. Machine learning has also been employed to classify equations of state or explosion mechanisms using simulated gravitational waveforms [26, 27, 28, 29]. The GW spectrogram of CCSN explosions highlights a noticeable time evolution of the frequency, increasing monotonically over time. This so-called gravity-mode, also known as g-mode, is believed to be associated with the oscillation of PNSs [30, 31]. Characterizing these modes is essential to enable CCSN asteroseismology using GWs (e.g. [32]). In recent years, numerical simulations have investigated the relationship between the frequency of these modes and the mass and radius of PNSs. In their studies [33, 34], Torres-Forné et al., calculated the relations between each f/g/p-mode and the physical parameters of the PNS. These relations are considered universal, as they are independent of the equation of state or the progenitor mass. Sotani et al. [35] suggest that once we observe a GW signal from a CCSN explosion, we can infer the physical parameters of the PNS by extracting the frequencies of these modes and solving the universal relations. In pursuing this goal, Bizouard et al. [36] developed a method to track the g-mode in a spectrogram to estimate the PNS properties with current or next-generation GW detectors. Powell and Müller [37] proposed a reconstruction approach in the spectrogram domain with Bayesian inference and an asymmetric chirplet model to extract the PNS properties. Bruel et al. [38] extended the study in Ref. [36] by combining the data of a multi-detector network and tracking the g-mode with a LASSO regression algorithm. Moreover, Casallas-Lagos et al. [39] used a neural network regression model to estimate the slope of the high-frequency mode in a CCSN. Accurate extraction of GW frequencies is essential for inferring the physical properties of GW sources. Unlike the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transforms, time-frequency maps produced by the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) [40] are not constrained by the tradeoff between temporal duration and bandwidth—this absence of limitation results in high resolutions along both the time and frequency axes. In this context, the HHT has been explored within the GW research domain, as documented by Camp et al. [41], who recorded the first application of the HHT in GW analysis. Numerous studies have highlighted the HHT’s efficacy in identifying the frequencies of GW signals in addition to its use in detection algorithms. This includes postmerger studies of binary neutron star coalescence [42, 43], binary black hole coalescence [44], and low-frequency modes induced by neutrino-driven convection and standing accretion shock instability (SASI) in a CCSN [45]. In this study, we propose an HHT-based approach for estimating M_{\mathrm{PNS}}/R_{\mathrm{PNS}}^{2} from the g-mode GW signal, where M_{\mathrm{PNS}} and R_{\mathrm{PNS}} denote the mass and radius of the PNS, respectively. Our method integrates the cWB technique [17, 18, 19] and the extraction of the g-mode frequencies using the HHT to solve the universal relations from Refs. [33, 34]. We first apply the method to the GW signal-only case, then test it on signals in the ET’s simulated detector noise, and perform a comparative evaluation of the estimation accuracy with an approach based on STFT. This paper is organized as follows. Section II outlines the data used to evaluate our methodology. Section III details our approach for parameter estimation of PNSs. The results are presented in Sec. IV. Finally, we conclude our study in Sec. V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08396v1,Translating current ALP photon coupling strength bounds to the Randall-Sundrum model,"In this article, we look at the current bounds on the coupling strength of axion-like particles (ALPs) with two photons in the context of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We relate the coupling strength to the compactification radius that governs the size of the extra dimension in the RS warped geometry model and show how the current bounds on the ALP can be used to derive appropriate constraints on the size of the extra fifth dimension in the RS model. We show that the resulting constraints fail to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem for light/ultralight ALPs and require a massive ALP of at least m_{a}\gtrsim 0.1 [GeV] to be relevant in the context of the hierarchy problem when the gauge field is in the bulk.","Theories of extra spatial dimensions were originally proposed to achieve electromagnetism and gravity unification through a geometric interpretation. Subsequently, there was a revival of interest in extra-dimensional models in the context of a possible resolution of the unnatural fine-tuning problem associated with the mass of the Higgs boson against large radiative corrections which, in turn, have their roots in the large hierarchy between the electroweak and Planck scale. To achieve a resolution to this problem geometrically, several variants of higher dimensional theories were proposed. Among these, theories with warped extra dimensions drew special attention because of their inherent property to resolve the gauge hierarchy naturalness problem [1, 2] without invoking any intermediate scale other than the Planck scale. It has also been shown that such types of warped geometry models have their natural origin in an underlying string theory which admits of Klebanov-Strassler throat geometry [3] in the backdrop of an appropriate string compactification. The simplest and most popular warped geometry model was proposed by Randall and Sundrum (RS) [4] which portrays the presence of two 3-branes located at the two orbifold fixed points in a 5-dimensional anti-de Sitter bulk compactified on a Z_{2} orbifold. This model mimics the essential features of a stringy braneworld model compactified on \text{AdS}_{5}\crossproduct S_{5}. Due to the anti-de Sitter character of the 5-dimensional bulk, this model also received special attention in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence [5]. The most important aspect of the RS model is its testability where observable signatures can be searched for both in TeV scale collider physics as well as in various astrophysical and cosmological scenarios [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Apart from various scattering and decay processes associated with graviton Kaluza-Klein modes (mass \sim TeV) coupled to the standard model fields with inverse TeV couplings [13, 14], and the phenomenology of the TeV scale radion (the only extra-dimensional modulus in the model) [15, 16, 17, 18, 19], the RS model also gives rise to an axion phenomenology. The origin of such axions and their coupling with standard model photons is due to the coupling of the second-rank massless antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field with the electromagnetic field (photon). Such a coupling arises from the requirement of the Chern-Simons extension to cancel the U(1) gauge anomaly which also restores the U(1) invariance for an appropriate choice of gauge transformation of the KR field [20, 21]. The magnitude of the resulting axion-photon coupling is dictated by the value of the warp factor in this model [22, 23, 24] which, in turn, is determined from the fundamental requirement of the resolution of the gauge hierarchy problem discussed earlier. Whether this requirement is consistent with the available constraints on the mass of the axions and its coupling from various experimental findings is the essential goal of the present work. We assume, here, that the axion acquires a mass through various non-perturbative mechanisms. In the context of string theory, one such mechanism is mass generation through world sheet instanton corrections [25, 26]. In our analysis, we consider two distinct scenarios: (a) the gauge field propagates in the bulk [27, 28, 29, 30] and (b) the gauge field is confined on the brane. In both these cases, the KR field, which appears as closed string excitation, is assumed to reside in the bulk. In both scenarios, our analysis reveals that resolving the gauge hierarchy problem and satisfying the strong experimental bounds of axion-photon coupling simultaneously is strongly disfavoured for ultralight and light axions and allows a window for axion mass \gtrsim 0.1 [GeV] for the bulk gauge field scenario only. On the other hand, when the gauge field is confined on the brane, the current experimental bounds do not permit a possible resolution for the hierarchy problem even up to a few TeV of axion mass. We present our work as follows: We briefly describe the RS model and the origin of the axion-photon coupling in the RS model. Subsequently, we analyse in detail various bounds set by different experiments on the axion-photon coupling and the corresponding axion mass. This is then compared to test the viability of the RS model in the context of the resolution of the fine-tuning/gauge hierarchy problem as discussed earlier."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08104v1,"Radio-AGN activity across the galaxy population: dependence on stellar mass, star-formation rate, and redshift","We characterise the co-evolution of radio-loud AGN and their galaxies by mapping the dependence of radio-loud AGN activity on stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time (out to z\sim 1.5). Deep LOFAR radio observations are combined with large galaxy samples to study the incidence of radio-loud AGN across the galaxy population; the AGN are further split into low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs). We find that LERG activity occurs over a wide range of SFRs, whereas HERGs are typically found in galaxies with ongoing star formation. The LERGs are then split based on their SFRs relative to the main sequence, across redshift. Within quiescent galaxies, LERG activity shows a steep stellar mass dependence with the same normalisation across the past \sim 10 Gyr; this indicates that hot gas fuels LERGs in quiescent galaxies across cosmic time. In massive galaxies (\log_{10}(M/\rm{M_{\odot}})\gtrsim 11), the incidence of LERGs is roughly constant across the galaxy population, suggesting that LERGs in massive galaxies may be fuelled by hot gas regardless of the star-formation activity. At lower masses, however, LERG activity is significantly more enhanced (by a factor of up to 10) in star-forming galaxies compared to quiescent galaxies; this suggests that an additional fuelling mechanism, likely associated with cold gas, may fuel the LERGs in galaxies with higher SFRs. We find that HERGs typically accrete above 1 per cent of the Eddington-scaled accretion rate, and the LERGs typically accrete below this level.","It is now widely believed that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies co-evolve across cosmic time, with evidence for a link between the build-up of stars and the growth of the SMBHs (e.g. Kormendy & Ho, 2013), and a tight correlation between the mass of the SMBH and that of the galaxy bulge component (e.g. Ferrarese & Merritt, 2000; Merritt & Ferrarese, 2001). SMBHs can undergo an active phase, powered by accretion of matter onto the black hole, during which they are referred to as active galactic nuclei (AGN). These AGN can emit vast amounts of energy across the electromagnetic spectrum in the form of ionising outflows or relativistic jets, which can suppress or regulate subsequent star-formation within the host galaxy; this is referred to as AGN feedback (e.g. Best et al., 2005b; Cattaneo et al., 2009; Fabian, 2012; Heckman & Best, 2014; Hardcastle & Croston, 2020). AGN feedback is often invoked in cosmological simulations to suppress the growth of the most massive haloes and reproduce the observed local galaxy luminosity functions (e.g. Bower et al., 2006; Croton et al., 2006; Somerville & Davé, 2015). Of particular importance in the lifecycle of massive galaxies and clusters are radio-loud AGN (hereafter; radio-AGN), which emit powerful bi-polar jets of relativistic ionised material that radiate synchrotron emission, which is visible at radio wavelengths. The energy deposited by these radio-jets into the host galaxy and surrounding environment can balance the radiative cooling losses and regulate star-formation in massive galaxies, with recurrent radio-AGN heating required to ‘maintain’ galaxies as ‘red and dead’ once quenched, in the nearby Universe (see Best et al., 2006, 2007; McNamara & Nulsen, 2007; Heckman & Best, 2014; Hardcastle & Croston, 2020). Radio-AGN are typically classified into two modes, based on the nature of the emission lines in their optical spectra, as low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs). This classification is understood to be linked to the nature of the accretion flow onto the SMBH (see Best et al., 2005a; Allen et al., 2006; Hardcastle et al., 2007; Hardcastle, 2018), where HERGs are associated with radiatively-efficient accretion, typically from cold gas, which leads to the formation of a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disc and a dusty torus (e.g. Shakura & Sunyaev, 1973); as a result, they display high-excitation emission lines due to photoionization of gas from accretion disc photons. In contrast, LERGs are associated with a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow (e.g. Narayan & Yi, 1994, 1995; Yuan & Narayan, 2014), often modelled as arising from cooling hot gas, and as a result, do not display signs of a typical AGN such as an optically thick accretion disc or a torus, and therefore lack high-excitation emission lines in their optical spectra. In this scenario, the HERGs have been argued to typically accrete at \gtrsim 1 per cent of the Eddington-scaled accretion rate, whereas the LERGs accrete at much lower rates of \lesssim 1 per cent of the Eddington-scaled accretion rate (Best & Heckman, 2012; Mingo et al., 2014). Studies of LERGs and HERGs in the nearby Universe have also shown differences in host galaxy properties between the two classes. LERGs are typically found to be hosted in massive, quiescent, red galaxies with massive black holes, and are often found in rich group or cluster environments, whereas HERGs tend to be found in less massive galaxies, with recent or on-going star-formation, and in poorer environments (e.g. Tasse et al., 2008; Smolčić et al., 2009; Best & Heckman, 2012; Gendre et al., 2013; Sabater et al., 2013; Mingo et al., 2014; Ching et al., 2017; Williams & Röttgering, 2015; Williams et al., 2018; Croston et al., 2019; Magliocchetti, 2022). Although both LERGs and HERGs are found across a wide range of luminosities, the characteristic break in the luminosity function for HERGs occurs at higher luminosities, and they are found to also show a stronger space density evolution with redshift (e.g. Best & Heckman, 2012; Best et al., 2014; Pracy et al., 2016; Butler et al., 2019; Kondapally et al., 2022). These observed properties of the host galaxies of LERGs and HERGs can be understood in terms of the different accretion properties of these AGN. The cooling of hot gas within massive, quiescent galaxies is expected to lead to low accretion rates resulting in the formation of a LERG, whereas the plentiful supply of cold gas present in lower mass, star-forming systems may also lead to higher accretion rates, resulting in a HERG. Using deep observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields Data Release 1 (LoTSS-Deep DR1; Tasse et al. 2021; Sabater et al. 2021; Kondapally et al. 2021; Duncan et al. 2021; Best et al. 2023), Kondapally et al. (2022) studied the cosmic evolution of LERGs, finding that at z\gtrsim 1, most of the LERGs are hosted by star-forming galaxies, in contrast to studies at lower redshifts where LERGs are predominantly found in quiescent galaxies (e.g. Best & Heckman, 2012). These results suggest that there may be differences in the host galaxy properties of AGN in the early Universe and at lower luminosities, with some overlap with the host galaxy properties of HERGs (see also Whittam et al., 2018; Whittam et al., 2022). Moreover, the significant population of LERGs hosted in a different galaxy type (star-forming as opposed to quiescent) at early times can have interesting implications for both the fuelling mechanisms (see also Delvecchio et al., 2022) and our current understanding of AGN feedback processes and its effect on the galaxy population (e.g. Cattaneo et al., 2009; Smolčić et al., 2017b; Butler et al., 2019; Hardcastle & Croston, 2020; Kondapally et al., 2023; Heckman et al., 2024). It is well known that in the local Universe, the fraction of galaxies hosting a radio-AGN (which provides a measure of the duty cycle) strongly increases with stellar mass as f_{\rm{radio-AGN}}\propto M_{\star}^{2.5} (Best et al., 2005a; Smolčić et al., 2009), with recent work by Sabater et al. (2019) finding that at low luminosities almost all massive galaxies host a radio-AGN. Janssen et al. (2012) studied the dependence of radio-AGN activity on galaxy properties at z<0.3 using the radio-AGN sample of Best & Heckman (2012). Using this sample, Janssen et al. (2012) measured the incidence of LERGs and HERGs, separately, as a function of stellar mass at z<0.3, finding that LERG activity increases steeply with stellar mass, consistent with M_{\star}^{2.5}, whereas the HERGs showed a much shallower dependence of \propto M_{\star}^{1.5}. Moreover, they found that compared to red galaxies, HERG activity was significantly more enhanced in blue galaxies at fixed stellar mass. These results are consistent with the notion of LERGs undergoing accretion from cooling of hot gas within massive haloes, with the HERGs being fuelled by the abundant cold gas present in their lower mass (bluer), star-forming host galaxies (e.g. Best et al., 2005a). Early and recent works that extended this analysis out to higher redshifts have found a similarly steep stellar mass dependence for the entire radio-AGN population (e.g. Tasse et al., 2008; Smolčić et al., 2009; Simpson et al., 2013; Williams & Röttgering, 2015; Williams et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2024; Igo et al., 2024). Since the radio-AGN population consists of both the LERGs and HERGs, Kondapally et al. (2022) used data from one of the LoTSS Deep Fields to study how the incidence of LERGs, alone, depends on stellar mass within quiescent and star-forming galaxies, separately, to z\sim 1.5. They found that LERGs hosted by quiescent galaxies showed a redshift-invariant steep stellar mass dependence, highly consistent with observations in the local Universe of fuelling occurring from cooling hot gas (see also Williams et al., 2018). On the other hand, the LERGs hosted by star-forming galaxies showed a much shallower dependence on stellar mass, suggesting that LERGs in more star-forming systems may be fuelled in a manner different from those in quiescent galaxies. In this paper, we aim to extend these analyses to understand how radio-AGN are triggered across the galaxy population by measuring the incidence of these radio-AGN as a function of each of stellar mass, star-formation rate, and redshift; using the full LoTSS Deep Fields dataset allows us to split our sample across these parameters simultaneously. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the radio and multi-wavelength dataset, along with the selection of radio-AGN and the parent sample used for comparison. Section 3 presents the results on the incidence of LERGs and HERGs as a function of mass and star-formation rate. In Section 4 we present the results on the dependence of LERG activity as a function of star-formation rate relative to the main sequence of star-formation. In Section 5, we present the Eddington-scaled accretion rate properties of the LERGs and HERGs. In Section 6 we present the interpretation and discussion of our results. Section 7 presents the conclusions of our study. Throughout this work, we use a flat \LambdaCDM cosmology with \Omega_{\rm{M}}=0.3,~{}\Omega_{\rm{\Lambda}}=0.7 and H_{0}=70~{}\mathrm{km~{}s^{-1}~{}Mpc^{-1}}, and a radio spectral index \alpha=-0.7 (where S_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\alpha})."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08099v1,"Evolution of binaries containing a hot subdwarf and a white dwarf to double white dwarfs, and double detonation supernovae with hypervelocity runaway stars","Compact binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs have the potential to evolve into a variety of explosive transients. These systems could also explain hypervelocity runaway stars such as US 708. We use the detailed binary evolution code MESA to evolve hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars interacting in binaries. We explore their evolution towards double detonation supernovae, helium novae, or double white dwarfs. Our grid of 3120 models maps from initial conditions such as orbital period and masses of hot subdwarf and white dwarf to these outcomes. The minimum amount of helium required to ignite the helium shell that leads to a double detonation supernova in our grid is \approx 0.05\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}, likely too large to produce spectra similar to normal type Ia supernovae, but compatible with inferred helium shell masses from some observed peculiar type I supernovae. We also provide the helium shell masses for our double white dwarf systems, with a maximum He shell mass of \approx 0.18\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}. In our double detonation systems, the orbital velocity of the surviving donor star ranges from \approx 450\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}} to \approx 1000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}. Among the surviving donors, we also estimate the runaway velocities of proto-white dwarfs, which have higher runaway velocities than hot subdwarf stars of the same mass. Our grid will provide a first-order estimate of the potential outcomes for the observation of binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs from future missions like Gaia, LSST, and LISA.","Hot subdwarfs are stripped helium (He) stars that burn He in their core with little to no hydrogen (H) envelope (Heber, 1986, 2016). Studies such as Han et al. (2002, 2003) suggest that binary interactions such as stable or unstable mass transfer plays a major role in the formation of hot subdwarfs. Observations provide evidence that most of the hot subdwarfs are found with binary companions (e.g., Pelisoli et al., 2020). Further, a significant fraction of hot subdwarfs are found in close orbits (P_{\mathrm{orb}}\sim 10\,\text{days}) with white dwarfs (WDs), which are likely post common envelope systems (Han et al., 2002, 2003). Figure 1: A schematic diagram representing possible evolution channels of a hot subdwarf + WD binary to a double white dwarf, a double detonation supernova or a He nova. Double detonation supernovae and He novae result from systems that undergo mass transfer and later experience thermonuclear instability in the He layer on the surface of the WD. The differentiation between double detonation supernova and He nova is based on the He layer’s critical density (see Sec. 2.3). Double white dwarfs result from systems that either evolve in isolation or involve episodes of accretion but do not enter unstable nuclear burning. Compact binaries containing hot subdwarfs and WDs have gained significant interest following the discovery of a super-Chandrasekhar binary by Maxted et al. (2000). This binary is particularly interesting as a potential Type Ia supernova progenitor (but, see also Ergma et al. 2001 for other outcomes). The number of discoveries of binaries containing hot subdwarfs with WD companions has steadily increased (e.g., Napiwotzki et al., 2004; Geier et al., 2013; Vennes et al., 2012). Large spectroscopic studies have been characterizing binaries containing hot subdwarfs (e.g., Schaffenroth et al., 2022). In addition to those detached binaries, Kupfer et al. (2020a, b) identified binaries in which the hot subdwarf is Roche-lobe filling. Furthermore, some of recent the observed binaries such as CD-30°11223 (Vennes et al., 2012; Geier et al., 2013) and HD 265435 (Pelisoli et al., 2021) are verification binaries for LISA (for more details see Kupfer et al. 2024) and suggested progenitors of double donation supernovae (Kupfer et al., 2022). Interacting hot subdwarf + WD binaries could potentially result either in an explosion only in the He shell of the WD (a He nova, Kato et al. 2000; Gianninas et al. 2010; Piersanti et al. 2014) or a thermonuclear explosion of a WD (probably as a supernova type Ia, Whelan & Iben 1973; Iben & Tutukov 1984). The thermonuclear explosion of the WD could result from a Chandrasekhar mass explosion (Yoon & Langer, 2003; Wang et al., 2009; Brooks et al., 2016) or from a sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonation explosion due to He accretion. In the double detonation mechanism, He-accreting WDs undergo the first detonation in the He shell that triggers the second detonation in the C/O core leading to a thermonuclear supernova. The He donor channel as a mechanism to produce a double detonation was already investigated in the early 1980s by Taam (1980a, b), Nomoto (1982a, b). Later studies by Livne (1990), Livne & Glasner (1990), Langer (1991), Livne & Glasner (1991), Fink et al. (2007), and Fink et al. (2010) further explored He-accreting WDs and established that they are promising channels for SNe Ia. However, they also estimated that single degenerate double detonations require thick He shells which likely will lead to spectra representing a peculiar supernova Ia. The light curve of ZTF18aaqeasu (also known as SN 2018byg and ATLAS 18pqq), De et al. (2019), suggests that it is a double detonation supernova with a massive He shell (\sim 0.15\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}). This thick He shell aligns with predictions by Bauer et al. (2017) for a hot subdwarf + WD binary (CD-30°11223). On the contrary, studies by Sim et al. (2010), Kromer et al. (2010), and Woosley & Kasen (2011) also explored channels that would enable the synthetic spectra to resemble a “normal” Type Ia supernova. Furthermore, Wang et al. (2013) and Neunteufel et al. (2016) probe the He star + WD binary channels as a potential single-degenerate double detonation mechanism. In addition, some studies explored the effects of WD rotation (Yoon & Langer, 2004) and magnetic fields (Neunteufel et al., 2017) on He ignition. He donor channels are also interesting as a mechanism to produce hypervelocity runway stars such as US 708. Should there be a full explosion of the WD, the hot subdwarf can be ejected at very high velocities (Justham et al., 2009; Wang & Han, 2009). This mechanism can explain some of the observed population of hypervelocity runaway stars with velocities of \sim 1000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}} (Geier et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2015; Neunteufel, 2020; Neunteufel et al., 2022). Given the increasing number of observed hot subdwarf and white dwarf binaries, interest in understanding the fate of these systems has been growing. Our galaxy contains at least 10^{3}-10^{4} hot subdwarf + WD binaries that are likely to interact within the subdwarf lifetime (Bauer & Kupfer, 2021). Despite detailed modeling studies of individual systems, the literature still lacks a broad study of binary spatial configurations that lead to double detonation supernovae. The purpose of this paper is to map the initial binary configurations of hot subdwarf and WD binaries to their fates: double detonation supernovae, He novae, and double white dwarfs. In this study, we use the 1D stellar evolution code mesa to simulate a dense grid of hot subdwarf + WD binaries. Unlike some of the previous studies, we also model the accreting WD. We simultaneously evolve both the donor and accretor, including binary interactions, aiming to address two main objectives: 1) Identifying the region of initial parameter space that distinguishes the fate of the systems, and determining whether they evolve into double detonation supernovae, He novae, or double white dwarfs, and characterize the properties of any surviving system or object 2) Investigating the velocities of the runaway hot subdwarf in the event of double detonation supernovae, thereby providing constraints to observed runaway stars. The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we explain our methods. Section 3 illustrates examples of three distinct outcomes under consideration: a double detonation supernova, He nova, or a double white dwarf. We present the fate of the binaries across our parameter space in Section 4. In Section 5 we give more details about the final state of the binaries, and in particular, runaway velocities in 5.2. We discuss the results in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08089v1,Charged Binaries in Gravitational Tides,"Next-generation low-frequency interferometers are expected to detect binary systems near supermassive black holes, where tidal effects can alter significantly the binary’s motion. This motivates a broader investigation of how external gravitational fields influence the dynamics of physical systems. In this work, we consider a charged black hole binary system subject to a gravitational tide. We first construct a stationary gravitational tide acting on a dyonic Reissner–Nordström black hole and, focusing on the extreme mass-ratio limit, we analyze the motion of a test particle. By calculating the particle’s secular Hamiltonian, we obtain the ISCO and light ring tidal shifts in terms of explicit functions of the binary’s parameters. Our results show that tidal corrections are suppressed as the black hole’s charge increases, but they persist in the extremal limit yielding a finite contribution. This work paves the way towards studying tidal effects on other charged systems, such as topological stars.","The strong-field regime of gravitation has remained both fascinating and elusive for decades. Its most fundamental prediction, black holes, have challenged our deepest ideas about the structure of spacetime and remain at the core of gravitational physics since their theoretical discovery. The fact that gravitational wave astronomy provides a direct channel of observation into such regime of gravity is, consequently, an important milestone in science and motivates studying the effect of strong gravitational fields on physical systems. In particular, understanding the response of self-gravitating systems to slowly-varying tidal fields has proved being very valuable. On the one hand, the deformability properties of stars under gravitational tides reveal information about their structure and can be used, for example, to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter [1, 2, 3]. On the other hand, quite intriguingly black holes exhibit no response to external tides,111In fact, this is true not only for gravitational tides but also for other kinds of fields, like scalar or electromagnetic ones. More exotic environments or curvature corrections can, however, yield nonvanishing tidal responses [4, 5]. a fact that is made somehow precise by showing that their tidal Love numbers vanish [6]. Given that in a binary merger tidal deformations can leave imprints in the last stages of the inspiral phase, this can be used to learn about the nature of the binary’s constituents. Another paradigmatic way of understanding tidal deformations is via the motion of test fields (say, a test particle) in the vicinity of the deformed object. This is, in fact, a case of astrophysical relevance as next generation interferometers are expected to observe black hole binary systems next to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) [7, 8, 9, 10]. An interesting case is when the binary itself has one component much larger than the other, thus yielding a hierarchical triple. These type of systems have been intensively studied in the literature in the Post Newtonian (PN) approximation, where each of the three objects is treated as a test particle, but still keeping the hierarchical regime [11, 12, 13, 14]. However, through processes like the migration trap mechanism, the binary systems may be placed only a few Schwarzschild radii away from the SMBH [15, 16, 17], in which case the PN expansion ceases to hold. In some sense, these systems generalise Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) by endowing the secondary with structure (it gets replaced by another EMRI), and accounting for strong field effects requires a computation in full General Relativity (GR). A first step towards understanding the effect of strong external fields on EMRIs was performed in [18, 19, 20] where, in particular, the smallest object of the triple behaves like a test particle evolving on a tidally deformed black hole. Another interesting situation is the one examined in [21] where it is shown how strong gravitational effects modify the dynamics of a binary system of black holes with comparable masses. In general, it is important to understand from a theoretical point of view the behaviour of self-gravitating systems when subject to external tides. While Love numbers have been studied for a wide variety of objects and theories, the behaviour of matter surrounding the deformed object has remained less explored. In this paper we consider the motion of test particles in the vicinity of a tidally deformed black hole carrying both electric and magnetic charge (a dyonic black hole). In particular, we analyse the dependence on the hole’s charge of the tidal deformations to the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) and the light ring. Being well defined both physically and mathematically, charged black holes have been largely explored in the literature of theoretical astrophysics for decades and yielded very valuable lessons [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. In fact, while typically black holes are expected to quickly neutralise by either friction with interstellar medium or Schwinger pair-decay, there are physical mechanisms that allow them to retain their charge (although small) [28]. Assuming they are near-extremal, charged black holes could constitute a significant fraction of dark matter [29] or, alternatively, their charge could be due to minicharged dark matter, hidden vector fields [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39] or magnetic monopoles [40, 41, 42, 43]. In the latter case one has magnetic black holes, which have gained a lot of attention recently. When interacting with charged matter they behave drastically different than their electric counterparts, and this can be seen at several levels including the binary dynamics [44, 45, 46, 47], black hole superradiance [48], hairy black hole solutions [49, 50], and other physical processes (see [51] and references therein).222For magnetic black holes in some dark matter models see [52]. In addition, some well-defined models of horizonless compact objects, such as topological stars [53] (see also [54, 55]), exhibit charges of magnetic type. These are interesting, yet more complicated, solutions so solving the black hole case first is an instructive example. Finally, given that charged black holes do also share some similarities with rotating ones, such as the existence of an extremal limit, the results in the charged case may anticipate the behaviour in the more complicated scenario where the black hole carries angular momentum. This paper is organised as follows. In Sec. 2 we construct the metric for a tidally deformed dyonic Reissner–Nordström black hole. The leading order (quadrupolar) solution is then used in Sec. 3 to study the dynamics of a test particle moving in such a background. In particular, we focus on the secular effects induced by the tidal deformation and we derive the secular Hamiltonian for the test particle. As an application of our approach, in Sec. 4 we determine how the tidal deformation modifies the location and properties of the ISCO (for neutral and charged particles) and of the light ring. Finally Sec. 5 contains our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06277v1,An analytical model for the magnetic field in the thick shell of (super-) bubbles,"Bubbles and super-bubbles are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium and influence their local magnetic field. Starting from the assumption that bubbles result from violent explosions that sweep matter away in a thick shell, we derive the analytical equations for the divergence-free magnetic field in the shell. The explosion velocity field is assumed to be radial but not necessarily spherical, making it possible to model various-shaped bubbles. Assuming an explosion center, the magnetic field at the present time is fully determined by the initial uniform magnetic field, the present-time geometry of the bubble shell, and a radial vector field that encodes the explosion-induced displacement of matter, from its original location to its present-time location. We present the main characteristics of our magnetic-field model using a simple displacement model which predicts a constant density of the swept-up matter in the bubble shell and magnetic flux conservation. We further estimate the expected contribution of the shell of the Local Bubble, the super-bubbles in which the Sun resides, to the integrated Faraday rotation measures and synchrotron emission and compare these to full-sky observational data. We find that, while the contribution to the former is minimal, the contribution to the latter is very significant at Galactic latitudes |b|>45^{\circ}. Our results underline the need to take the Local Bubble into account in large-scale Galactic magnetic field studies.","Like external galaxies, the Milky Way is permeated by magnetic fields. Magnetic fields are relevant in various processes and scales, from regulating star formation to shaping large-scale structures in the disk and the halo of the Galaxy. Magnetic fields in the Galaxy also affect our ability to study the Universe’s structure and history and to identify the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (e.g., see Beck 2015; Haverkorn 2015 for recent reviews). To gain insight into the general structure and amplitude of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) on the kiloparsec scale, authors have primarily relied on observations of Faraday rotation measures (RM) towards extragalactic sources, Galactic synchrotron emission and, to a lesser extent, polarized emission from Galactic dust. Using forward modeling frameworks, where model predictions are compared to observations, authors have deduced constraints on a variety of three-dimensional (3D) models for the GMF (e.g., see Jaffe 2019 for a recent review on model tuning). One of the main obstacles to such an approach is the line-of-sight-integrated nature of the observables, which leads to degeneracy between models and model parameters and, consequently, uncertainties in the reconstructed picture of the GMF. In the future, this degeneracy will probably be overcome, at least for the first few kiloparsecs around the Sun, by the advent of tomography data derived from both starlight polarization and Faraday tomography (e.g., Pelgrims et al. 2023, 2024; Erceg et al. 2024a, b) which are made possible by major surveys (Magalhães et al. 2005; Tassis et al. 2018; Shimwell et al. 2022). In the meantime, it is difficult to disentangle the respective contributions of the Galaxy’s near and far regions to the line-of-sight-integrated observables. In this context, it should be stressed that most efforts to model the large-scale GMF have overlooked the fact that the Solar system resides in the Local Bubble. The Local Bubble is a cavity with unusually low density of gas (e.g., Cox & Reynolds 1987); Lallement et al. 2003), filled with an X-ray emitting plasma (e.g., Liu et al. 2017), and surrounded by a shell of cold (ionized) gas and dust (e.g., Pelgrims et al. 2020; O’Neill et al. 2024b). This local cavity has most likely been created by successive supernovae explosions that occurred in the past 10-15 Myr (e.g., Maíz-Apellániz 2001; Breitschwerdt et al. 2016; Schulreich et al. 2023), and has currently a radius on the order of 100-300 pc. As for other bubbles in the interstellar medium (ISM), it is expected that supernovae explosions and the resulting motion of the swept-up matter have deformed the initial magnetic field. This is in agreement with the picture obtained from starlight polarization that the magnetic field in the local ISM does not follow the large-scale GMF (e.g., Heiles 1998; Leroy 1999; Santos et al. 2011; Frisch et al. 2012; Berdyugin et al. 2014; Gontcharov & Mosenkov 2019). Although imprints of the magnetized shell of the Local Bubble have recently been detected in tomographic data, from measurements on Faraday depth and starlight polarization, in combination or not with dust polarized emission (Erceg et al. 2024a, b; Skalidis & Pelgrims 2019; Pelgrims et al. 2024; Uppal et al. 2024), its contribution to line-of-sight integrated observables which are sensitive to the GMF is still unknown, or at least little constrained. The chance for its contribution to be dominant naturally increases toward high-Galactic latitudes as less matter is encountered beyond the Local Bubble wall. This is even more likely to be the case the smaller the scale height of the density distribution of the relevant ISM matter. This, for example, has motivated Alves et al. (2018) to use the dust polarized emission at high-Galactic latitudes to constrain a physical model for the magnetic field in the shell of the Local Bubble whose shape was assumed to be spheroidal, and with no thickness. This motivation was later validated by Skalidis & Pelgrims (2019) (but see Halal et al. 2024) and encouraged Pelgrims et al. (2020) to have the analysis of Alves et al. (2018) reworked with a more realistic shape for the Local Bubble shell that they deduced directly from 3D dust density maps available at the time. However, it is difficult to predict how the relative contribution from the Local Bubble shell and the background change with sky regions, toward lower Galactic latitudes. This is primarily due to depolarization effects which happen both along the sightline and within the beam of observation. Surprisingly, perhaps, O’Neill et al. (2024a) suggested recently that the wall of the Local Bubble may be a substantial contributor to the dust-polarized emission for large portions of the sky. Recently, Korochkin et al. (2024) were the first to include a prescription for the magnetic field in the shell of the Local Bubble into the modeling of the regular component of the GMF using full-sky data on Galactic synchrotron polarized emission and Faraday RM from extragalactic sources. They find that the contribution from the shell of the Local Bubble is substantial. However, in their implementation, they use a spherical model for the shape of the Local Bubble and a geometrical prescription to derive the magnetic field in its shell, which does not lead to a divergence-free magnetic field. With this paper, we aim to go beyond this and quantify the effects of a more realistic shape for the shell of the Local Bubble. In their paper, Alves et al. (2018) derive an analytical expression for a divergence-free magnetic field in the shell of the Local Bubble which they assume to be very thin. While in principle this formalism makes it possible to describe the magnetic field in non-spherical shells, it has the important drawback that the shell must be infinitely thin and, as a consequence, that the amplitude of the magnetic field becomes very large (infinite) in the shell. Consequently, this analytical prescription is inadequate for characterizing the magnetic field in a realistic shell of finite thickness, and for predicting the shell’s contribution to Faraday RM and synchrotron, both of which depend on the amplitude of the magnetic field. In this work, we move past the assumption that the bubble shells must be infinitely thin. We propose a general analytical expression for the divergence-free magnetic field in the thick shell of bubbles which, additionally might be non-spherical. We derive our analytical model in Sect. 2 where we also present its main features and some illustrative examples. In Sect. 3, we particularize our model to the case of the Local Bubble and estimate its contribution to the full-sky data on synchrotron polarized emission and Faraday RM, adopting realistic shapes for the shell of the Local Bubble as inferred from a 3D dust map. We discuss the limitations of our model and the possible implications of our findings for the modeling of the large-scale GMF in Sect. 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08021v1,The Meissner effect in neutron stars,"We present the first model aimed at understanding how the Meissner effect in a young neutron star affects its macroscopic magnetic field. In this model, field expulsion occurs on a dynamical timescale, and is realised through two processes that occur at the onset of superconductivity: fluid motions causing the dragging of field lines, followed by magnetic reconnection. Focussing on magnetic fields weaker than the superconducting critical field, we show that complete Meissner expulsion is but one of four possible generic scenarios for the magnetic-field geometry, and can never expel magnetic flux from the centre of the star. Reconnection causes the release of up to \sim 5\times 10^{46}\,\mathrm{erg} of energy at the onset of superconductivity, and is only possible for certain favourable early-phase dynamics and for pre-condensation fields 10^{12}\,\mathrm{G}\lesssim B\lesssim 5\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}. Fields weaker or stronger than this are predicted to thread the whole star.","The hallmark of superconductivity in a material is the Meissner(-Ochsenfeld) effect, characterised by an expulsion of magnetic flux and occurring once the temperature T drops below some critical value T_{c}. The nature of the expulsion depends on the strength B of the magnetic field through the material prior to the onset of superconductivity. For weak fields there is a complete expulsion of flux from the interior of the superconducting sample; for sufficiently strong fields superconductivity is destroyed and the conductivity is normal; for intermediate field strengths there is a partial expulsion of flux. The nature of this latter state depends on the kind of superconductivity that is operative, but generally is characterised by narrow structures of concentrated flux that have returned to the normal regime, surrounded by superconducting regions with zero magnetic field. In the laboratory, the magnetic field is imposed on a sample externally, and once cooled below T_{c} the sample sets up a supercurrent that screens the external field and ensures the sample harbours no internal magnetic flux. But this effect is also important in astrophysics, being operative in one class of magnetic stars: neutron stars. The extremely high density of a neutron-star core leads to a correspondingly high critical temperature for superconductivity, and efficient neutrino cooling allows the star to drop below this value shortly after birth. A few features of the physics of neutron stars indicate that any magnetic-flux rearrangement occurring due to the transition to superconductivity will differ from the Meissner effect familiar from terrestrial physics. For one, their magnetic field is internal to the star, produced by the persistent electric currents within the stellar fluid. As the Meissner effect is not intrinsically dissipative, it is less obvious how to expel this field than in the laboratory setup. Secondly, T_{c} varies considerably throughout the core and is highest close to the crust-core boundary; the Meissner effect will therefore proceed gradually, on the cooling timescale, and rather than expelling the core magnetic field may instead trap some of it. Finally, terrestrial superconductors are solid, and the electron fluid becomes superconducting. A neutron star core is entirely fluid, and instead of the low-mass electrons, it is the proton fluid which forms a superconductor. Because the neutrons, with their lower critical temperature, only become superfluid considerably later on, the core may be treated as a single fluid at the onset of superconductivity. We are therefore in an MHD regime, with the additional restrictions that that places on the fluid flow, and therefore on how Meissner expulsion may be realised. The aim of this paper is to explore how the Meissner effect operates in this setting, and what the result is likely to be on the star’s large-scale magnetic field."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08020v1,Observing the Meissner effect in neutron stars,"We explore the consequences of a new mechanism for the rapid onset of the Meissner effect in a young neutron star, via an interplay of field-line advection by fluid motion and magnetic reconnection. This mechanism provides the first justification for an assumption at the centre of magnetar simulations. Reconnection leads to a characteristic release of energy, which can be used to constrain superconducting gap models. Our model provides a natural explanation for the recently discovered long-period radio sources, and also has important implications for neutron-star rotational evolution and gravitational-wave emission. The Meissner effect is only operative for field strengths 10^{12}\,\mathrm{G}\lesssim B\lesssim 5\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}.","References Haskell and Sedrakian [2018] B. Haskell and A.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07973v1,"The Nature of Optical Afterglows Without Gamma-ray Bursts: 
Identification of AT2023lcr and Multiwavelength Modeling","In the past few years, the improved sensitivity and cadence of wide-field optical surveys have enabled the discovery of several afterglows without associated detected gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We present the identification, observations, and multi-wavelength modeling of a recent such afterglow (AT 2023lcr), and model three literature events (AT 2020blt, AT 2021any, and AT 2021lfa) in a consistent fashion. For each event, we consider the following possibilities as to why a GRB was not observed: 1) the jet was off-axis; 2) the jet had a low initial Lorentz factor; and 3) the afterglow was the result of an on-axis classical GRB (on-axis jet with physical parameters typical of the GRB population), but the emission was undetected by gamma-ray satellites. We estimate all physical parameters using afterglowpy and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods from emcee. We find that AT 2023lcr, AT 2020blt, and AT 2021any are consistent with on-axis classical GRBs, and AT 2021lfa is consistent with both on-axis low Lorentz factor (\Gamma_{0}\approx 5-13) and off-axis (\theta_{\mathrm{obs}}=2\theta_{\mathrm{jet}}) high Lorentz factor (\Gamma_{0}\approx 100) jets.","In the internal-external shocks model for long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs; Piran 2005; Mészáros 2006; Kumar & Zhang 2015), the core of a massive star collapses and forms a neutron star or black hole, which launches an ultra-relativistic collimated outflow, or “jet”. The jet’s internal collisions produce an initial burst of gamma-rays, called the “prompt emission”, followed by the jet’s external collision with the ambient medium, producing an “afterglow” across the electromagnetic spectrum. There are several reasons why we should be able to detect afterglows without associated detected GRBs. First, the Earth might not be within the jet’s opening angle (typically \theta_{c}=5-10^{\circ}; Ghirlanda et al. 2018), which is collimated and relativistically beamed (initial \theta_{c}=\Gamma_{0}^{-1}) (Totani & Panaitescu, 2002). In this “off-axis” GRB scenario, we will miss the prompt emission but still be able to observe an afterglow when the jet decelerates and spreads (Rhoads, 1997). Second, a “dirty fireball” can occur if the outflow is less relativistic than that of a typical GRB (\Gamma_{0}\lesssim 100) due to a baryon-loaded jet (Dermer et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2002; Rhoads, 2003). In this case, the jet will be below the pair-production threshold for gamma-rays (i.e. the compactness problem; Ruderman 1975), so we would not be able to observe a GRB. Still, we might observe a less energetic prompt emission, such as an X-ray flash (Dermer et al., 1999; Heise et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2004; Sakamoto et al., 2005; Soderberg et al., 2007). Third, the source could be an on-axis classical GRB whose prompt emission was undetected by gamma-ray satellites, possibly due to the occultation of the Earth or a weak prompt emission that failed to meet the triggering thresholds of gamma-ray satellites. In recent years, high-cadence optical surveys have enabled the discovery of ten likely afterglows without associated detected GRBs, summarized in Table 1. Prior to the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Graham et al. 2019; Bellm et al. 2019a, b; Dekany et al. 2020; Masci et al. 2019), only one such event, PTF 11agg (Cenko et al., 2013), was discovered, found by the Palomar Transient Factory (Law et al., 2009). Since ZTF’s first light, nine other events have been confirmed as afterglows without associated detected GRBs, largely thanks to ZTF’s high cadence over a wide field-of-view, enabling the rapid identification of fast transients. Still, no convincing dirty fireballs or off-axis LGRB candidates have been discovered. In this paper, we present the identification, follow-up, and multi-wavelength modeling of one of the most recent such events, AT 2023lcr. We only consider the afterglow light curve, although an associated Ic-BL supernova was identified at a later time (Martin-Carrillo et al., 2023a). As shown in Table 1, AT 2023lcr is one of six afterglows discovered in optical-survey data with no detected GRB but with a measured redshift. To put our AT 2023lcr results into context, we also present multi-wavelength modeling of three afterglows in Table 1: AT 2020blt, AT 2021any, and AT 2021lfa. For AT 2019pim, we refer the reader to Perley et al. (2024), who used a similar approach to this work, while AT 2023sva will be modeled in future work (Srinivasaragavan et al. in prep). All afterglows are modeled using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in emcee (version 3.1.4; Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) and afterglow models from afterglowpy (version 0.7.3; Ryan et al. 2020).

For each object, we consider the following explanations for why their prompt gamma-ray emission was missed: 1) the jet was off-axis; 2) the jet had a low Lorentz factor (\Gamma_{0}\lesssim 100); and 3) the afterglow was the result of an on-axis classical GRB but the GRB was undetected by high-energy satellites. Because of imprecise constraints on the burst time, the possibility of an on-axis classical GRB cannot be ruled out for any of the afterglows on the basis of gamma-ray limits alone (Ho et al., 2020, 2022). AT 2020blt was previously modeled in Sarin et al. (2022) (hereafter S22); AT 2021any was previously modeled in Gupta et al. (2022) (G22) and Xu et al.

In this work, we explore additional jet structures, modeling configurations, and constraints on afterglow behavior, discussing comparisons between the mentioned works and this work in Section 5. This paper is organized as follows: we present observations of AT 2023lcr in Section 2. We describe observational features of AT 2023lcr in Section 3. We describe our fitting framework in Section 4. In Section 5, we present the results of our fitting, discuss preferred models and physical interpretations, and compare our results to past works. Finally, we summarize and discuss implications and future work in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07948v1,Numerical simulation of electron magnetohydrodynamics with Landau-quantized electrons in magnetar crusts,"In magnetar crusts, magnetic fields are sufficiently strong to confine electrons into a small to moderate number of quantized Landau levels. This can have a dramatic effect on the crust’s thermodynamic properties, generating field-dependent de Haas–van Alphen oscillations. We previously argued that the large amplitude oscillations of the magnetic susceptibility could enhance the Ohmic dissipation of the magnetic field by continuously generating small-scale, rapidly dissipating field features. This could be important to magnetar field evolution and contribute to their observed higher temperatures. To study this, we performed quasi-3D numerical simulations of electron MHD in a representative volume of neutron star crust matter, for the first time including the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility resulting from Landau quantization. We find that the potential enhancement in the Ohmic dissipation rate due to this effect can be a factor \sim 3 for temperatures of order 10^{8} K and \sim 4.5 for temperatures of order 5\times 10^{7} K, depending on the magnetic field configuration. The nonlinear Hall term is crucial to this amplification: without it the magnetic field decay is only enhanced by a factor \lesssim 2 even at 5\times 10^{7} K. These effects generate a high wave number plateau in the magnetic energy spectrum associated with the small-scale de Haas–van Alphen oscillations. Our results suggest that this mechanism could help explain the magnetar heating problem, though due to the effect’s temperature-dependence, full magneto-thermal evolution simulations in a realistic stellar model are needed to judge whether it is viable explanation.","The astrophysical implications of the quantization of the momentum of electron motion perpendicular to an applied magnetic field, or Landau quantization, have been studied for decades (Canuto & Chiu, 1971; Hernquist, 1984). The strong magnetic fields of neutron stars in particular have become a focus for research in this area (see Harding & Lai (2006) for a review). Restricting the discussion to the interior of neutron stars, Landau quantization can significantly modify electron transport properties (e.g., Kaminker & Yakovlev (1981); Yakovlev (1984); Hernquist (1984); Potekhin et al. (1999)), which become strongly anisotropic and undergo Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillations. This in turn changes neutron star thermal evolution (e.g., Hernquist (1985); Potekhin & Chabrier (2018)). Quantization additionally modifies neutrino emissivity and shifts the threshold density for the direct Urca reaction in the core (Leinson & Pérez, 1998; Maruyama et al., 2022). The equation of state of the neutron star core, where other fermion species are also quantized in the presence of strong fields, is not strongly affected at physically relevant field strengths B\lesssim 10^{18} G (Broderick et al., 2000), though strong fields can shift the muon threshold density (Suh & Mathews, 2001). In the less-dense crust, these effects are more important, and can change the crustal nuclear composition (Chamel et al., 2012; Chamel, 2020) and move the neutron drip-line (Chamel et al., 2015). Landau quantization also induces de Haas–van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations of the differential magnetic susceptibility of matter, which leads to magnetic domain formation within neutron stars (Blandford & Hernquist, 1982; Suh & Mathews, 2010; Rau & Wasserman, 2021, 2023). In the crust, where Landau quantization effects are most pronounced, the magnetic field evolution is usually assumed to be governed by electron magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD), in which the electrons move with respect to an essentially static nuclear lattice and the Hall term \propto\bm{J}\times\bm{B} is dominant within Ohm’s law. EMHD and the related Hall MHD are well-studied topics in neutron star crusts (Cumming et al., 2004; Pons & Geppert, 2007; Pons et al., 2009; Viganò et al., 2012, 2013; Gourgouliatos et al., 2013; Gourgouliatos & Cumming, 2014, 2015; Lander & Gourgouliatos, 2019; Brandenburg, 2020; Gourgouliatos et al., 2022; Viganò et al., 2021; Dehman et al., 2023b), including for magnetar-strength fields \sim 10^{14}–10^{16} G. However, the assumptions underlying EMHD possibly break down for very strong magnetic fields: if the Lorentz force exceeds the maximum elastic stress the crust can support, the crust can undergo plastic failure and the nuclear lattice can no longer be assumed stationary. A recent study (Gourgouliatos & Lander, 2021) has shown that plastic failure of the crust does not appear to completely suppress the Hall effect, and so a description of a magnetar crust’s magnetic evolution based on EMHD should still be valid. In a previous paper (Rau & Wasserman (2023), henceforth RW23), we examined MHD stability in a magnetar crust under the assumption that EMHD (there termed Hall MHD) is still applicable. Using linear mode analysis, we demonstrated the existence of a strong-field Hall MHD instability in a physically-relevant region of magnetic field–density–temperature phase space. However, since this instability disappears upon magnetic domain formation, it is of limited astrophysical interest. We also found that Ohmic dissipation could be enhanced due to the oscillations of the differential magnetic susceptibility caused by Landau quantization. Unlike the oscillations of the magnetization, which are a small fraction \lesssim 1% of the magnetic field \bm{B}, the oscillations of 4\pi times the differential magnetic susceptibility can be of order unity in amplitude, comparable to the value of the susceptibility with zero magnetizaion. This effect is expected to persist for a wide range of temperatures, densities and field strengths, but a numerical study is needed to assess its overall importance to magneto-thermal evolution. The effect of Landau quantization on magnetar thermal evolution has been considered previously in the context of modified thermal conductivity (Hernquist, 1985; Potekhin & Chabrier, 2018), but these calculations have assumed a fixed magnetic field configuration. The joint magneto-thermal evolution of the crusts of magnetars with Landau quantization effects in both conductivities and thermodynamic quantities (e.g., magnetization and differential magnetic susceptibility) has not been considered before, for obvious reasons: the highly spatially-inhomogeneous coefficients are difficult for numerical simulations to handle. There is good motivation to include these effects, however: magnetars are systematically observed to be more luminous than other neutron stars with surface luminosities \mathcal{L}_{s}\sim 10^{35} erg/s, an order of magnitude or more greater than other neutron stars of the same age, and dissipation of their strong fields into heat is a likely explanation. Using magneto-thermal simulations, Viganò et al. (2013) argued that the diversity of magnetars can be explained by a combination of (1) Ohmic dissipation of strong magnetic fields aided by the Hall effect, which generates small-scale field structure and hence promotes dissipation; (2) light element envelopes formed of accreted matter which enhances thermal conductivity and supports a hotter surface. However, they included no Landau quantization effects in their calculation. Beloborodov & Li (2016) examined four possible mechanisms to explain magnetar heating: ambipolar diffusion heating of the core, mechanical dissipation of the crust stressed beyond the elastic limit, Ohmic dissipation of the crustal magnetic field and surface bombardment by accelerated charged particles. They found that the second and fourth mechanisms were insufficient to explain the observed luminosities, and that the lifetime of a magnetar heated by ambipolar diffusion in it core would not have a lifetime consistent with observations. Tsuruta et al. (2023) recently re-examined the ambipolar diffusion heating scenario, finding that it could be consistent with observation in the case of light element contamination of the crust. For the crustal Ohmic dissipation scenario to be able to power the observed surface luminosities without a light element envelope, Beloborodov & Li (2016) argued that fields changing by \gtrsim 10^{16} G over length scales \lesssim 10^{2} cm would be required. Notably the authors did not consider Landau quantization effects, and dHvA oscillations of magnetization and its derivatives could continuously generate rapidly dissipating small length-scale features in the magnetic field, enhancing its Ohmic dissipation and hence crustal heating. In this paper, we perform quasi-3D numerical simulations of the magnetic induction equation for EMHD with Ohmic dissipation in a reference volume of neutron star crust matter. We include the effects of Landau quantization of electrons in the magnetization and its partial derivatives, neglecting for now the SdH oscillations of the electrical conductivity. To perform the simulations we use the spectral method solver Dedalus, which has recently been used for studying the resistive instability of a particular choice of stellar magnetic field (Kaufman et al., 2022) and for simulating ambipolar diffusion in neutron star cores (Igoshev & Hollerbach, 2023). To make the numerics tractable, we use certain simplifying approximations that leave the key novel physics intact and allow us to assess its importance to magnetic field evolution. The most critical of these approximations is that EMHD is applicable throughout the simulation, which is not necessarily true if the field is strong enough to cause the crust to undergo plastic failure. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the effects of dHvA oscillations of magnetization and its partial derivatives on magnetic field evolution in a physically simplified setting. We determined the extent to which this effect increases Ohmic dissipation of the field and the generation of small-scale magnetic field structure, which further promotes Ohmic dissipation of the field. The results of this paper will be applied to full magneto-thermal simulations of the crust in spherical geometry in a later paper. In Section 2 we outline the form of the magnetic induction equation for electron MHD with Landau quantization-induced dHvA oscillations of the magnetization and its partial derivatives. Section 3 describes the numerical method and initial conditions for the simulations, and reviews their limitations. Section 4 provides the simulation results, first those for simple Ohmic decay of the field including magnetization terms, and then including both Ohmic and Hall terms. Comparisons to analogous simulations neglecting the Landau quantization-induced magnetization are performed to show the significance of this effect. The implications of these results on neutron star evolution are discussed in Section 5. We work in Gaussian units throughout."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07938v1,"Et tu, Brute?: The Crab Nebula also exploded by jittering jets","We identify a point-symmetrical morphology comprised of seven pairs of opposite bays in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant Crab Nebula, which is consistent with the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe. We use a recently published infrared image of the Crab Nebula and apply image analysis to fit seven pairs of bays in the Crab, each pair of two bays and a symmetry axis connecting them. The seven symmetry axes intersect close to the explosion site, forming a point-symmetrical structure. We explain the bays as clumps that move slower than the low-density ejecta that the pulsar accelerated. Jittering jets that exploded the Crab formed the clumps during the explosion process. This shows that jittering jets explode even very low-energy CCSNe, as the Crab is, adding to the solidification of the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.","The identification of point-symmetrical morphology in eleven core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants (CCSNRs; e.g., references in Bear et al. 2024; Soker 2024a) strongly supports the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM; e.g., Soker 2024b, c, d; Wang et al. 2024 for recent studies of the JJEM) as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe. The competing neutrino-driven explosion mechanism (e.g., Andresen et al. 2024; Burrows et al. 2024; Janka & Kresse 2024; Müller et al. 2024; Nakamura et al. 2024 for some recent studies), cannot account for these point-symmetrical morphologies (Soker, 2024e; Soker & Shishkin, 2024). This motivates the search for point-symmetrical morphologies in more CCSNRs. We examine the Crab Nebula. Many studies over the years explored the structure of the Crab Nebula, observationally (e.g., Clark et al. 1983; Fesen et al. 1992; Bietenholz & Nugent 2015; Dubner et al. 2017; Martin et al. 2021; Temim et al. 2024) and theoretically (e.g., Porth et al. 2014; Blondin & Chevalier 2017; Dirson & Horns 2023). The explosion energy of the Crab Nebula is very low, E_{\rm exp}\simeq 5\times 10^{49}-10^{50}{~{}\rm erg} (e.g., Yang & Chevalier 2015) although Bietenholz & Nugent (2015) argue for a somewhat larger explosion energy. At the same time, the energy that the pulsar deposited into the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) is E_{\rm P}\simeq 3.5\times 10^{49}{~{}\rm erg} (e.g., Yang & Chevalier 2015). The relevant point to our study is that E_{\rm P} is non-negligible relative to E_{\rm exp}, implying that the PWN has substantially influenced the expanding ejecta (e.g., Bietenholz & Nugent 2015; Blondin & Chevalier 2017). In a recent study, Temim et al. (2024) marked nine indentations in the Crab Nebula similar to the larger bays in the east and west (e.g., Michel et al. 1991; Dubner et al. 2017). Michel et al. (1991) identified only the two opposite east and west bays and suggested that they are the projection of a torus on the plane of the sky. However, with the identification of seven more bays by Temim et al. (2024) and five in this study, this explanation can only hold for some bays or none. Instead, we note that six of the nine bays that Temim et al. (2024) mark form three pairs and that their three symmetry axes (the lines connecting two opposite bays) cross at the same point, coinciding with the projected location of the pulsar at the explosion. In Section 2, we identify more pairs, and in Section 3, we establish the point-symmetrical morphology of the Crab Nebula. In Section 4 we suggest that the bays are dense clumps that the PWN flows around, and we summarize this Letter by further strengthening the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07925v1,Revisiting X-ray Afterglows of Jetted Tidal Disruption Events with the External Reverse Shock,"We investigate the external reverse shock region of relativistic jets as the origin of X-ray afterglows of jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs) that exhibit luminous jets accompanied by fast-declining non-thermal X-ray emissions. We model the dynamics of jet propagating within an external density medium, accounting for continuous energy injection driven by accretion activities. We compute the time-dependent synchrotron and inverse Compton emissions from the reverse shock region. Our analysis demonstrates that the reverse shock scenario can potentially explain the X-ray light curves and spectra of four jetted TDEs, AT 2022cmc, Swift J1644, Swift J2058, and Swift J1112. Notably, the rapid steepening of the late-stage X-ray light curves can be attributed jointly to the jet break and cessation of the central engine as the accretion rate drops below the Eddington limit. Using parameters obtained from X-ray data fitting, we also discuss the prospects for \gamma-ray and neutrino detection.","Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is torn apart by the tidal forces of a supermassive black hole (SMBH, e.g., Hills, 1975; Rees, 1988; Evans & Kochanek, 1989), resulting in a transient lasting from months to years, visible across the electromagnetic spectrum, from the radio, infrared, optical/ultraviolet, to X-ray ranges (e.g., Saxton et al., 2020; Alexander et al., 2020; van Velzen et al., 2021a). A small fraction of TDEs exhibits luminous relativistic jet signatures. Since the discovery of the hard X-ray transient event J164449.3+573451 (hereafter, Sw J1644, Bloom et al., 2011; Burrows et al., 2011; Levan et al., 2011; Zauderer et al., 2011) by the Swift satellite, three additional jetted TDEs – Swift J2058.4+0516 (hereafter, Sw J2058, Cenko et al., 2012; Pasham et al., 2015), Swift J1112.2-8238 (hereafter Sw J1112, Brown et al., 2015, 2017), and AT 2022cmc (Andreoni et al., 2022; Pasham et al., 2023) – have been recorded. The multi-wavelength observations of these four jetted TDEs have provided valuable prototypes for studying the radiation mechanisms, accretion histories, and jet dynamics over a time window of months to years (e.g., Giannios & Metzger, 2011; De Colle & Lu, 2020; Dai et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2024b). The four jetted TDEs exhibit prominent similarities in their X-ray and radio afterglows. The X-ray light curves can be roughly described by a power-law decay, with the index roughly ranging from 5/3 (e.g., Sw J1644, Mangano et al., 2016) to 2.2 (e.g., Sw J2058 and AT 2022cmc, Eftekhari et al., 2024). Late-time follow-up observations have revealed additional steepening in the X-ray light curves, suggesting common changes in jet evolution or the central engine (Zauderer et al., 2013; Pasham et al., 2015; Eftekhari et al., 2024). Additionally, the rapid variability on time scales of \sim{\rm few}\times 100-1000 seconds imposes further constraints on the SMBH mass (Brown et al., 2015; Mangano et al., 2016; Pasham et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2024), e.g., \mathrel{\hbox{\hbox to0.0pt{\hbox{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{$\sim$}}\hss}\hbox{$<$}}}% {\rm few}\times 10^{7}~{}M_{\odot}. In the radio and sub-millimeter bands, observations have shown that these emissions are typically long-lasting compared to the fast-declining X-ray emission. The radio/sub-millimeter light curves are consistent with synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated by the external forward shock of the jet with a Lorentz factor of \Gamma\sim 1-10 propagating through a circumnuclear medium (e.g., Zauderer et al., 2011; Giannios & Metzger, 2011; Metzger et al., 2012; Berger et al., 2012; Zauderer et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2016; Eftekhari et al., 2018; Cendes et al., 2021; Matsumoto & Metzger, 2023; Zhou et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024b). However, the origin of jetted TDE X-ray afterglows still remains unclear. The X-ray emission from jetted TDEs is likely produced in a separate emission region. Theoretical models involving jets powered by SMBH spin energy via large-scale magnetic fields (Tchekhovskoy et al., 2014; Kelley et al., 2014), energy dissipation within magnetically dominated jets (Burrows et al., 2011), variable accretion near the SMBH horizon (Reis et al., 2012), jet shell collisions (Zou et al., 2013) and internal dissipations (Wang & Cheng, 2012; Lei et al., 2013, 2016), and inverse Compton scattering of external photons (Bloom et al., 2011; Crumley et al., 2016) have been investigated to explain the X-ray observations of jetted TDEs. The power-law decaying X-ray light curves align with the mass fallback rates from complete (t^{-5/3}, e.g., Rees, 1988; Phinney, 1989) and partial (t^{-2.2}, e.g., Guillochon & Ramirez-Ruiz, 2013) disruptions. The late-stage sharp steepening of the X-ray light curves may result from jet shutoff, caused by the accretion disk transitioning from thick to thin as the accretion rate decreases from super- to sub-Eddington states (Zauderer et al., 2013; Tchekhovskoy et al., 2014). Moreover, two-component jet model with a fast inner component and slow outer component, has also been exploited to explain the multi-wavelength emission from TDEs (Wang et al., 2014; Mimica et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Teboul & Metzger, 2023; Sato et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024b). Recently, Yuan et al. (2024b) suggested that the external reverse shock powered by a relativitisc jet launched from the active central engines, such as continuous energy injection associated with accretion, can also explain the X-ray observations of AT 2022cmc, where the late-time rapid decay can be attributed to jet breaks. This is also analogous to the long-lasting reverse shock model for shallow-decay afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Following Yuan et al. (2024b), we investigate the external reverse shock scenarios to explain the X-ray spectra and light curves of the four jetted TDEs. We present a generic, self-consistent model based on the TDE accretion history and multi-wavelength observations to describe the jet evolution and the time-dependent emissions in jet reverse shock regions. The motivation is that jet deceleration, combined with an active central engine, jointly determines the reverse shock emission, which can naturally reproduce the t^{-\delta}~{}(\delta\sim 5/3-2.2) X-ray afterglows. Additionally, the cessation of power injection would result in sharply decaying reverse shock emission. We model the time-dependent accretion rate, jet evolution within an external medium incorporating continuous power injection, and reverse shock emission in Sec. 2. In Sec. 3, we apply the reverse shock model to fit the X-ray light curves and spectra of four jetted TDEs and discuss the \gamma-ray and neutrino detectabilities. We discuss and conclude our work in Sec. 4 and Sec. 5. Throughout the paper, we use T_{\rm obs}, t, and t^{\prime} to denote the times measured in the observer’s frame, the SMBH-rest frame, and the jet comoving frame, respectively. The notation Q_{x} represents Q/10^{x} in CGS units unless otherwise specified."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07827v1,A nearby FR I type radio galaxy 3C 120 as the PeV neutrino emitter,"Although connections between flaring blazars and some IceCube neutrinos have been established, the dominant sources for the bulk extragalactic neutrino emissions are still unclear and one widely suggested candidate is a population of radio galaxies. Because of their relatively low gamma-ray radiation luminosities (L_{\gamma}), it is rather challenging to confirm such a hypothesis with the neutrino/GeV flare association. Here we report on the search for GeV gamma-ray counterpart of the neutrino IC-180213A and show that the nearby (z = 0.03) broad line radio galaxy 3C 120 is the unique co-spatial GeV \gamma-ray source in a half-year epoch around the neutrino detection. Particularly, an intense \gamma-ray flare, the second strongest one among the entire 16-year period, is temporally coincident with the detection of IC-180213A. Accompanying optical flare is observed, too. We also find that the IC-180213A/3C 120 association well follows the L_{\gamma}-D_{L}^{2} correlation for the (candidate) neutrino sources including NGC 1068 and some blazars. These facts are strongly in favor of 3C 120 as a high energy neutrino emitter and provide the first piece of evidence for the radio galaxy origin of some PeV neutrinos.","Neutrinos, which interact weakly with matter, can escape from extreme astrophysical environments that are impenetrable to electromagnetic radiations and hence provide unique insights into these intriguing astrophysical environments. The IceCube neutrino observatory at the South Pole111http://icecube.wisc.edu has discovered some high-energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin (e.g., IceCube Collaboration, 2013; Aartsen et al., 2015; Icecube Collaboration et al., 2023). These neutrinos were produced through the interaction of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with ambient matter (i.e., p-p) or radiation fields (i.e., p-\gamma), hence are crucial for revealing the origin of the UHECRs. The production of such neutrinos will generate electromagnetic radiation, in particular \gamma-ray photons, as well. The proposed gamma-ray emitters for extragalactic high energy neutrinos include the blazars (Atoyan & Dermer, 2001), starburst galaxies (Loeb & Waxman, 2006), radio galaxies (Becker Tjus et al., 2014), and galaxy clusters (Murase et al., 2008). The neutrino/gamma-ray association is a powerful tool to probe the origin of the IceCube events. So far, the blazar as well as the very nearby Seyfert II galaxy have been confirmed to be the sources of the PeV neutrinos (IceCube Collaboration et al., 2018a, 2022). The advantage of establishment of a connection between a flaring blazar and an incoming neutrino is that both the spatial and temporal information can be utilized. Cases similar with TXS 0506+056/IceCube-170922A are mounting (e.g., Kadler et al., 2016; Garrappa et al., 2019; Giommi et al., 2020; Franckowiak et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2022; Sahakyan et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024). However, the fraction of contribution from blazars to the total observed neutrino flux is proposed to be limited, since no significant cumulative neutrino excess are found from the Fermi blazar directions (Aartsen et al., 2017). Recently, the IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks (i.e., ICECAT-1) has been released (Abbasi et al., 2023). A 0.111 PeV track-like neutrino event (i.e., IC-180213A, a so-called bronze event), in an arrival directi eventon of R.A. 66.97^{+2.46}_{-2.59}\,{}^{\circ}and decl. 6.09^{+1.95}_{-1.72}\,{}^{\circ} (at a 90% confidence level), is reprorted in ICECAT-1. Interestingly, a nearby Fanaroff-Riley (FR, Fanaroff & Riley 1974) I broad line radio galaxy (BLRG) 3C 120 falls into the localization uncertainty region of the neutrino. It is a well-studied nearby source with z = 0.033 (Burbidge, 1967), \simeq 145 Mpc away, hosting an efficiently accreting black hole with a mass of 5.5\times 10^{7}M_{\sun} by the reverberation mapping approach (Peterson et al., 2004). Radio Observations with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) reveal superluminal components with apparent speed up to > 10c (Lister et al., 2016) and the jet inclination angle to the line of sight is constrained to be \sim 10-20^{\circ}, thus a Doppler factor of \sim 2.4 as well as a bulk Lorentz factor of \sim 5 are suggested (Jorstad et al., 2005; Hovatta et al., 2009). 3C 120 is famous for the strong variability from radio to GeV \gamma rays, with which an accretion-disk-jet connection has been established (Marscher et al., 2002; Abdo et al., 2010a; Kataoka et al., 2011). In this letter, we thoroughly investigate the multiwavelength data of 3C 120, to explore its potential association with the neutrino event IC-180213A. Data Analyses are presented in Section 2; while discussions and a short summary are given in Section 3. We adopt a \LambdaCDM cosmology with \Omega_{M} = 0.32, \Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.68, and a Hubble constant of H_{0} = 67 km-1 s-1 Mpc-1 (Planck Collaboration et al., 2014)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07548v1,Are there Black Hole Symbiotic X-ray Binaries?,"While there are over a dozen known neutron star (NS) symbiotic X-ray binaries (SyXBs) in the Galaxy, none SyXBs containing a black hole (BH) have been detected. We address this problem by incorporating binary population synthesis and the accretion properties of BHs fed by the wind from red giant companions. We investigate the impact of different supernova mechanisms, kick velocity distributions and wind velocities on the formation of both NS and BH SyXBs. Our simulations show that the number of BH SyXBs is at most one-sixth that of NS SyXBs in the Galaxy provided that the common envelope efficiency parameter \alpha\sim 0.3-5. And less than \sim 10 of BH SyXBs could be detectable in X-ray, considering their low radiation efficiencies. These findings indicate a scarcity of BH SyXBs in the Galaxy.","Symbiotic X-ray binaries (SyXBs) are a subgroup of binary star systems consisting of an accreting neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) with a giant companion, typically of late type (K1-M8) (Luna et al., 2013; Kuranov & Postnov, 2015; Sazonov et al., 2020; Bahramian & Degenaar, 2023, for reviews). SyXBs exhibit relatively low X-ray luminosities, ranging from \sim 10^{32} to 10^{36} erg s-1. Since the first SyXB discovered over four decades ago (Davidsen et al., 1977), about a dozen SyXBs have been detected to date, all of which harbor NS accretors (see Yungelson et al., 2019, Table 1). The measured orbital periods of known SyXBs span from 151 days (CGCS 5926, Masetti et al., 2011) to 1161 days (GX 1+4, Hinkle et al., 2006; Iłkiewicz et al., 2017). In two sources, the orbital eccentricities have been measured, that is, e=0.1 for GX 1+4 (Hinkle et al., 2006) and e=0.26\pm 0.15 for 4U 1700+24 (Galloway et al., 2002). Theoretically, Lü et al. (2012) developed a binary population synthesis (BPS) model for SyXBs in the Galaxy, taking account of both stellar/binary evolution and the interaction between the magnetized NS and the accreting wind material. Their simulations, considering varying wind velocities and the angular momentum distribution in the shell of the matter settling on to a NS, predicted a SyXB population of approximately 100-1000 systems currently residing in our galaxy. Yungelson et al. (2019) updated the Lü et al. (2012) model, incorporating advancements in the settling accretion model (Shakura et al., 2018) and updated SyXB observations. Their revised estimates suggested that there are slightly less than 40 SyXBs per 10^{10}M_{\odot} (or \sim 240 SyXBs in the Galaxy). To date, no BH SyXBs have been identified (Bahramian & Degenaar, 2023). Considering the fact that there are at least hundreds of NS SyXBs predicted in the Milky Way, this raises the interesting question: are there or how many are there BH SyXBs in the Galaxy? This question is closely related to the formation of dormant BHs residing in wide binaries, several of which were recently discovered (Chakrabarti et al., 2023; El-Badry et al., 2023a, b; Tanikawa et al., 2023; Gaia Collaboration et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024) based on Gaia astrometric measurements. One of the possible reasons for the rarity of BH SyXBs could be related to their low birth rate: the low-mass secondary may not have enough orbital energy to expel the envelope of the massive primary star (i.e., the BH’s progenitor) during the common envelope (CE) phase, thus likely leading to a merger of the binary (Portegies Zwart et al., 1997; Kalogera, 1999; Podsiadlowski et al., 2003). However, the known Galactic NS low-mass X-ray binaries outnumber BH low-mass X-ray binaries by a factor of \sim2, suggesting that they should have roughly similar birth rates, and this is consistent with theoretical predictions (Kalogera & Webbink, 1998; Podsiadlowski et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2016a). We note that previous studies focused on the formation of low-mass X-ray binaries with relatively short orbital periods (\lesssim tens of days). Little attention had be paid on the formation of NSs and BHs in wide orbits before the discovery of Gaia NSs and BHs. Additionally, even if there are considerable BH+low-mass giant star binaries in the Galaxy, they might not be luminous X-ray sources. Because of the low accretion rate through wind capture, most of the kinetic energy of the accretion flow is not radiated away but advected into the BH event horizon (Ichimaru, 1977; Narayan & Yi, 1994). In addition, a significant fraction of the material captured by the BH may eventually be lost in the form of outflows (Blandford & Begelman, 1999). Consequently, the X-ray emission is too faint to detect (Sen et al., 2024). These qualitative arguments seems reasonable, but systematic quantitative analysis is still lacking. To address these issues, we employ a BPS method to investigate the formation of BH and NS SyXBs simultaneously. The results can help clarify whether there are a large population of quiescent NSs/BHs with wide-orbit companions in the Galaxy. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the method and assumptions. Our simulated results of the BH SyXB population and observational constraints are displayed in sections 3 and 4, respectively. We summarize the results and discuss several issues in our simulation in section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07542v1,Radio Follow-up Observations of SN 2023ixf by Japanese and Korean VLBIs,"We report on radio follow-up observations of the nearby Type II supernova, SN 2023ixf, spanning from 1.7 to 269.9 days after the explosion, conducted using three very long baseline interferometers (VLBIs), which are the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN), the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA), and the Korean VLBI Network (KVN). In three observation epochs (152.3, 206.1, and 269.9 days), we detected emission at the 6.9 and 8.4 GHz bands, with a flux density of \sim 5 mJy. The flux density reached a peak at around 206.1 days, which is longer than the timescale to reach the peak observed in typical Type II supernovae. Based on the analytical model of radio emission, our late-time detections were inferred to be due to the decreasing optical depth. In this case, the mass-loss rate of the progenitor is estimated to have increased from \sim 10^{-6}-10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} to \sim 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} between 28 and 6 years before the explosion. Our radio constraints are also consistent with the mass-loss rate to produce a confined circumstellar medium proposed by previous studies, which suggest that the mass-loss rate increased from \sim 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} to \gtrsim 10^{-2}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} in the last few years before the explosion.","A core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is an explosion of a massive star (\gtrsim 8M_{\odot}) at its final stage of evolution. Recent advances in all-sky surveys have made it possible to conduct follow-up observations of supernovae (SNe) immediately after the explosions (Rau et al., 2009; Law et al., 2009; Bellm et al., 2019; Graham et al., 2019). Optical spectroscopy conducted at such a very early time has revealed the presence of narrow high-ionization emission line features (known as “flash” features), which originate from a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) in the vicinity of the supernova progenitor (e.g., Khazov et al., 2016; Yaron et al., 2017). Currently, a large fraction of Type II SNe is considered to have such a confined dense CSM within \lesssim 10^{15}\,{\rm cm} (e.g., Förster et al., 2018; Bruch et al., 2021, 2023). This implies that their progenitor stars, which are known to be red supergiants (RSGs) for Type II SNe, underwent an enhanced mass-loss activity just decades before the explosion, with a corresponding mass-loss rate of \gtrsim 10^{-3}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}. This mass-loss rate is a few orders of magnitude higher than that of the typical RSG, which is \sim 10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} (e.g., Goldman et al., 2017). The radio emission of CCSNe is interpreted to be the synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons that are accelerated by the SN-CSM interaction (Chevalier et al., 2006; Chevalier & Fransson, 2006). This makes it a unique tool for probing the CSM density structure and mass-loss history of the progenitor star. However, whereas thousands of SNe have been detected in the optical band, only a few hundred have been observed in radio wavelengths, even when undetected events are taken into account (Bietenholz et al., 2021). Only a small fraction of radio SNe have been observed with high cadence and/or in multiple radio frequency bands. It is known from the light curves of extensively observed samples that many of them exhibit complex fluctuations that cannot be explained by simple models that predict monotonic increase and decrease in the expected luminosity evolution (e.g., SN 1979C, Weiler et al. 1992; SN 2001em, Chandra et al. 2020; SN 2001ig, Ryder et al. 2004; SN 2003bg, Soderberg et al. 2006, SN 2004dk Balasubramanian et al. 2021, SN 2014C Anderson et al. 2017, and SN 2018ivc, Maeda et al. 2023). Some cases may be associated with the complexity of the CSM density structure. SN 2023ixf was discovered on 2023 May 19.727 UT, {\rm MJD}=60083.727 (Itagaki, 2023), in the nearby galaxy M101, at a distance of 6.85\pm 0.15 Mpc (Riess et al., 2022), and classified as a Type II SN (Perley et al., 2023). The time of the SN first light is estimated to be {\rm MJD}=60082.743\pm 0.083 (Hiramatsu et al., 2023). Because it is the closest CCSN in a decade, extensive electromagnetic follow-up observations of SN 2023ixf were conducted across a wide range of wavelengths. The early excess in the optical light curve (Jacobson-Galán et al., 2023; Hosseinzadeh et al., 2023; Sgro et al., 2023), the flash features in the optical spectra (Yamanaka et al., 2023; Jacobson-Galán et al., 2023; Smith et al., 2023; Bostroem et al., 2023; Teja et al., 2023), and early X-ray detections (Grefenstette et al., 2023; Chandra et al., 2024) suggest the presence of a dense CSM and the interaction of SN ejecta with it, but there is an apparent inconsistency between the mass-loss rates estimated by optical (\sim 10^{-2}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}, Jacobson-Galán et al., 2023) and X-ray (\sim 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}, Grefenstette et al., 2023) observations. The dense and asymmetric CSM, suggested by a change in its position angle observed by early-time spectropolarimetry (Vasylyev et al., 2023), is considered to be the cause of this discrepancy. The progenitor candidate of SN 2023ixf has been identified in the archival images of the Spitzer Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope (Szalai & Dyk, 2023; Pledger & Shara, 2023). By intensive archival data analyses, the progenitor candidate is identified as a luminous (\sim 10^{5}\,L_{\odot}), dust-obscured RSG, exhibiting a possible periodic variability with a period of \sim 1000 days (Jencson et al., 2023; Kilpatrick et al., 2023; Soraisam et al., 2023; Van Dyk et al., 2024; Niu et al., 2023; Neustadt et al., 2024). The initial mass of the progenitor is, however, controversial, with different values obtained through different methods (e.g., based on luminosity, variability, and stellar populations in the vicinity of SN 2023ixf). The observed progenitor candidate activity disfavors the presence of any outburst events in the last \sim 20 years (Jencson et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023; Neustadt et al., 2024). Although the observational results on SN 2023ixf suggest the presence of a confined dense CSM, the radial density profile of the CSM, including the extended tenuous region, has not been tightly constrained. Radio observations provide information on the SN-CSM interaction and make it possible to estimate the mass-loss rate of the progenitor star independently from the other wavelength observations. Regarding the radio observations of SN 2023ixf, Berger et al. (2023) reported non-detection at 230 GHz during the early time (\lesssim 18 days after the explosion). Observations at other radio wavelengths and with longer time spans will be beneficial to elucidate more details on the progenitor evolution. In this paper, we present the results of radio follow-up observations of SN 2023ixf in the frequency range from 6 GHz to 129 GHz by three Japanese and Korean very long baseline interferometers (VLBIs): the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN), the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA), and the Korean VLBI Network (KVN). VLBI observation for SNe is usually conducted to resolve the spatial structure of nearby objects, but SN 2023ixf is expected to be unresolved at this stage so we used them only to measure the flux densities. The VLBI arrays of our observations consist of fewer antennas than those in recent large-scale VLBIs but are superior in their capability for rapid and flexible scheduling and their use of optimized characteristics for each array. We describe radio observations of SN 2023ixf in Section 2, report measured flux densities in Section 3, discuss the mass-loss history of the progenitor star in Section 4, and summarize our findings in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07531v1,Nuclear burning in an accretion flow around a stellar-mass black hole embedded within an AGN disk,"A stellar-mass black hole, embedded within the accretion disk of an active galactic nuclei (AGN), has the potential to accrete gas at a rate that can reach approximately \sim 10^{9} times the Eddington limit. This study explores the potential for nuclear burning in the rapidly accreting flow towards this black hole and studies how nucleosynthesis affects metal production. Using numerical methods, we have obtained the disk structure while considering nuclear burning and assessed the stability of the disk. In contrast to gas accretion onto the surface of a neutron star or white dwarf, the disk remains stable against the thermal and secular instabilities because advection cooling offsets the nuclear heating effects. The absence of a solid surface for a black hole prevents excessive mass accumulation in the inner disk region. Notably, nuclear fusion predominantly takes place in the inner disk region, resulting in substantial burning of \rm{}^{12}C and \rm{}^{3}He, particularly for black holes around M=10\,M_{\odot} with accretion rates exceeding approximately \sim 10^{7} times the Eddington rate. The ejection of carbon-depleted gas through outflows can lead to an increase in the mass ratio of oxygen or nitrogen to carbon, which may be reflected in observed line ratios such as \rm N\,V/C\,IV and \rm O\,IV/C\,IV. Consequently, these elevated spectral line ratios could be interpreted as indications of super-solar metallicity in the broad line region.","An accretion disk surrounding a compact object can release gravitational energy and is believed to be responsible for various cosmic phenomena, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) or X-ray sources (Ho, 2008; Abramowicz & Fragile, 2013; Yuan & Narayan, 2014; Netzer, 2015; Padovani et al., 2017). Many researchers have developed theoretical models of these accretion disks that operate at different accretion rates (Shakura & Sunyaev, 1973; Abramowicz et al., 1988; Narayan & Yi, 1994). The radiative cooling emitted from the surface of the accretion disk can reduce the disk thickness until viscous heating balances the radiative loss. When this balance is not achieved, especially in the outer regions of the disk, the self-gravity of the disk becomes significant, potentially leading to local instability (Paczynski, 1978; Abramowicz et al., 1984; Lodato, 2007; Wang et al., 2011). As instability develops, it can result in fragmentation through gravitational instability (Shlosman & Begelman, 1987; Goodman, 2003; Goodman & Tan, 2004; Lodato, 2007; Collin & Zahn, 2008; Wang et al., 2011; Mapelli et al., 2012). The fragments may collapse further, eventually forming stars (Shlosman & Begelman, 1989; Goodman & Tan, 2004; Cantiello et al., 2021). Alternatively, stars within nuclear star clusters may be captured by the accretion disk (Artymowicz et al., 1993; Wang et al., 2024). Observations of stellar clusters around the galactic center and the notably top-heavy initial mass function (e.g., Nayakshin & Sunyaev, 2005; Paumard et al., 2006; Bartko et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2018; Nayakshin & Zubovas, 2018; Neumayer et al., 2020; Schödel et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2023) suggest star formation may have occurred in the Galactic center several million years ago. Subsequently, stars and compact objects within these clusters might have slowly drifted towards the SMBHs due to dynamical friction with surrounding gas and stars (Gerhard, 2001). The rate of this drift is affected by the distribution of orbit eccentricity of these stars (Collin & Zahn, 2008; Kennedy et al., 2016). Furthermore, the possible connection between the spatial locations of quasar SDSS J1249+3449 and the gravitational wave event GW190521 (Graham et al., 2020) hints at the possibility of forming massive black hole binaries in AGN disks, where the dense environments promote binary mergers (Samsing et al., 2022). It appears likely that stars or compact objects could reside within the AGN disk. Whether formed due to disk instability or captured from the cluster, these stars or compact objects can continue growing through gas accretion (Dittmann & Miller, 2020; Wang et al., 2021a; Ali-Dib & Lin, 2023; Wang et al., 2024). Unlike field stars in their host galaxies, stars located in self-gravitating AGN disks can accrete gas at rates significantly exceeding the Eddington limit, primarily because of the dense environment of the AGN disk (Wang et al., 2021a). An estimation of the accretion rate towards the central object suggests that the Eddington ratio could reach values around \sim 10^{9} (Wang et al., 2021a). For simplicity, we refer to these rapidly accreting stars as accretion-modified stars (AMSs) (Wang et al., 2021a, b). It is important to note that the central star could be a normal star or a compact object. Certainly, by examining a star age and the AGN lifetime (Schawinski et al., 2015; King & Nixon, 2015), it is still plausible that the compact object could originated from surrounding star clusters and was subsequently captured by the AGN disk. For an AMS, assuming a central black hole (BH), with an accretion rate as high as \sim 10^{9}\dot{M}_{\rm edd}, where \dot{M}_{\rm edd} is the BH Eddington rate, is there a potential for initiating nuclear burning within the accretion disk of this AMS? The sensitivity of nuclear reaction rates to temperature introduces the concept of ignition or threshold temperature (Prialnik, 2009). When this threshold is surpassed, the reaction rates increase significantly. For hydrogen burning, the threshold temperature for the proton-proton chain is around 4\times 10^{6} K, and for the CNO bi-cycle process, it is approximately 1.5\times 10^{7} K. In the numerical simulations (Kitaki et al., 2018), it is implied that for supercritical accretion disks, the temperature within the disk mid-plane can be approximated by a formula T=3.85\times 10^{7}{\rm K}\ (M/{M_{\odot}})^{-0.24}\,(\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm edd% })^{0.24}\,(r/2r_{\rm g})^{-0.54}, where M, \dot{M}, and c are the BH mass, accretion rate, and the speed of light, respectively. The gravitational radius r_{\rm g} is defined as r_{\rm g}\equiv GM/c^{2}. Consequently, the temperature in the accretion disk, by assuming supercritical accretion, could potentially reach the threshold for nuclear burning. The timescale of a nuclear reaction is inversely proportional to the reaction rate (Iben, 2012). For an estimate of this timescale, we consider a density of \rho\sim 1\ \rm g\,cm^{-3} and a temperature of T\sim 1.6\times 10^{7}\ \rm K. Refer to Figure 1, the densities at various accretion rates have already increased to approximately an order of magnitude greater than \sim 1\ \rm g\,cm^{-3} near the inner disk area. Using these parameters, we determine that the lifetime of the isotope \rm{}^{16}O, which has the longest lifetime among the nuclei in the CNO bi-cycle, to be approximately \sim 10^{-4}\ \rm s (see table 6.10.2 in Iben, 2012). This timescale is already shorter than the disk viscous timescale. As the disk accretion rate increases, the density and temperature near the disk center could also increase, and thus the timescale, which also depends on the disk radius, might become even shorter. Therefore, based on the above estimation of the disk temperature and the nuclear timescale, it is expected that the accreting material in the AMS disk may experience phenomena like hydrogen burning or alpha captures. Observational phenomena, such as novae (e.g., Shen & Bildsten, 2007; Hachisu & Kato, 2019) or type I X-ray bursts (e.g., Narayan & Heyl, 2003; Zamfir et al., 2014; Galloway et al., 2017; Galloway & Keek, 2021), are thought to be linked to nuclear reactions that occur in an unstable fashion. It is hypothesized that hydrogen shell burning or thermonuclear explosions may occur on the surface of white dwarfs or neutron stars (for a review, see Lewin et al., 1993; Galloway et al., 2017). Are thermonuclear explosions possible in a super-critical accretion disk? Can nuclear burning affect disk stability or cause variations in the accretion rate? Or could we expect any type of observational flare, caused by these instabilities, in the light curves ? A pertinent question is whether nucleosynthesis can significantly modify the abundance of heavy elements in the disk. Observations suggest that the metallicity of the broad line region (BLR) in high-redshift quasars exceeds solar levels, inferred from specific emission line ratios (Nagao et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2023). This super-solar metallicity might result from star formation in the nuclear region of the AGN host galaxy, where these stars subsequently enhance the metal content of quasars (see the review paper of Hamann & Ferland (1999)). Furthermore, if the energy generated by nuclear reactions within the accretion disk of AMS is considerable, we might also expect some metal contributions from the outflow within the accretion disk. Research on nuclear reactions and nucleosynthesis in accretion flows around black holes has been previously examined by various scholars (Taam & Fryxell, 1985; Chakrabarti et al., 1987; Arai & Hashimoto, 1992; Mukhopadhyay & Chakrabarti, 2000, 2001; Hu & Peng, 2008). However, studies on accretion rates as high as \sim 10^{9}\dot{M}_{\rm edd} have not yet been performed. Furthermore, earlier studies had to assume very inefficient angular momentum transport, with \alpha viscosity levels as low as \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-6} (Arai & Hashimoto, 1992), or ignore the effect of advection cooling, which could be important for the supercritial accretion disk (Taam & Fryxell, 1985). In this paper, we revisit the examination of nucleosynthesis within the fast accretion flow towards an AMS, with a focus on the possibility of nuclear burning. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the equations used to model the disk structure surrounding a black hole. Section 3 delves into the thermodynamic conditions within the disk, presents the findings on the disk structure incorporating nuclear burning, and assesses the stability of the disk. Section 4 explores nucleosynthesis in the disk and considers the potential implications for metal enrichment within the AGN disk. The paper concludes with final remarks in the last section."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07459v1,The long-term variability of a population of ULXs monitored by Chandra,"We present preliminary results of a Chandra Large Program to monitor the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) populations of three nearby, ULX-rich galaxies over the course of a year, finding the ULX population to show a variety of long-term variability behaviours. Of a sample of 36 ULXs, some show persistent or moderately variable flux, often with a significant relationship between hardness and luminosity, consistent with a supercritically accreting source with varying accretion rates. Six show very high-amplitude variability with no strong relationship between luminosity and hardness, though not all of them show evidence of any long-term periodicity, nor of the bimodal distribution indicative of the propeller effect. We find evidence of additional eclipses for two previously-identified eclipsing ULXs. Additionally, many sources that were previously identified as ULXs in previous studies were not detected at ULX luminosities during our monitoring campaign, indicating a large number of transient ULXs.","Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are the brightest X-ray sources found outside of galaxy centres, empirically defined as being non-nuclear X-ray sources with luminosities above 1039 erg s-1, the Eddington luminosity of a \sim10 M⊙ black hole. ULXs are generally thought to be stellar-mass compact objects undergoing super-Eddington accretion (for a recent review, see King \BOthers. \APACyear2023). This has been confirmed for a handful of ULXs for which we have been able to detect X-ray pulsations (Bachetti \BOthers., \APACyear2014; Fürst \BOthers., \APACyear2016; Israel \BOthers., \APACyear2017; Carpano \BOthers., \APACyear2018; Sathyaprakash \BOthers., \APACyear2019; Rodríguez Castillo \BOthers., \APACyear2020), demonstrating that the compact object is a neutron star (NS). Whether or not pulsations are detected, ULXs generally show similar spectra, consisting of two thermal components below 10 keV and a steep power-law excess above 10 keV (e.g. Walton \BOthers. \APACyear2018), attributed to a super-Eddington accretion state involving a geometrically thick supercritical accretion disk, radiatively-driven outflowing winds, and the contribution from an accretion column in the case of NS accretors. Figure 1: Optical DSS images of our selected ULX host galaxies: M51, NGC 4485/4490, and NGC 253. The galaxies M51 and NGC 4485/4490 are shown with a single example ACIS-S detector chip orientation, and NGC 253 is shown with the same for ACIS-I. Aimpoints are marked with a cross, and the regions always within the Chandra field of view or possibly within the field of view (depending on telescope roll angle) are shown with the inner and outer blue dashed circles respectively. Known ULXs at the time of observation are indicated with red circles, and previously-studied sources of note are annotated. Some ULXs show significant long-term variability in flux. For example, several bright, well-studied ULXs have demonstrated significant spectral variation over the time that they have been revisited (e.g. Walton \BOthers. \APACyear2017, \APACyear2020), with variation in either or both thermal components potentially driving these changes. Several ULXs identified as NS accretors show apparent superorbital periodicity on the order of tens to hundreds of days (e.g. Brightman \BOthers. \APACyear2020), due to precession of some part of the accreting system. NSs may also undergo dramatic drops in flux related to the propeller effect, and both effects may be present in the same source (e.g. Fürst \BOthers. \APACyear2023). Superorbital periodicities have also been found in a few ULXs for which pulsations have not been detected (e.g. Earnshaw \BOthers. \APACyear2022) although without understanding the exact mechanism behind the periodicity, this is not by itself conclusive evidence of a NS accretor. Two ULXs have been found to show eclipses (Urquhart \BBA Soria, \APACyear2016). All of these mechanisms can cause dramatic changes in flux between observations, including causing the source to leave and reenter the empirically defined ULX luminosity regime. Our best understanding of long-term variability in ULXs so far comes from the long-term study of ULXs that are already interesting for being particularly bright or for demonstrating pulsations – though these sources alone show a range of different behaviours (e.g. Gúrpide \BOthers. \APACyear2021). Many more ULXs are monitored on a regular basis using short snapshots taken with Swift-XRT, which can track variability within the ULX regime well for reasonably nearby sources. However, the ULX population as a whole is relatively sparsely observed to a depth sufficient to explore the large changes in flux that these sources can exhibit (e.g. Earnshaw \BOthers. \APACyear2018). This motivated performing multiple Chandra observations of three nearby galaxies to explore the variability of a sample of ULXs over the course of a year down to fluxes \sim1038 erg s-1, allowing us to probe order-of-magnitude changes in flux even below the ULX luminosity regime. In these proceedings we share some preliminary results from this program."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07304v1,Phase Space of Binary Black Holes from Gravitational Wave Observations to Unveil its Formation History,"Gravitational Wave (GW) sources offer a valuable window to the physical processes that govern the formation of binary compact objects (BCOs). However, deciphering such information from GW data is substantially challenging due to the difficulty in mapping from the space of observation to the space of numerous theoretical models. We introduce the concept of BCO Phase-Space that connects the observable space to the evolution trajectories of the BCO formation channels with cosmic time and apply it to the third GW transient catalog (GWTC-3) that brings new insights into probable astrophysical formation scenarios of nearly 90 events. Our study reveals that two events, GW190425 and GW230529, show an overlap with a BCO Phase Space trajectory of the same formation channel arising from a sub-solar mass black hole scenario that has grown into a higher mass by accretion, hinting towards the common primordial origin of both these sources. Though the actual formation channel is yet to be confirmed, with the availability of more GW events, the BCO Phase Space can delve into distinguishing features of different formation channels for both astrophysical and primordial origin and opens the possibility of bringing new and deeper insights on the formation and evolution of BCOs across all observable masses over most of the cosmic time.","Acknowledgments The authors express their gratitude to Michela Mapelli for reviewing the manuscript and providing useful comments as a part of the LIGO publication policy.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07287v1,"Type IIn Supernovae. I. 
Uniform Light Curve Characterization and a Bimodality in the Radiated Energy Distribution","We present the largest uniform study to date of Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn), focusing in this first paper on the multi-band optical light curves of 487 SNe IIn. The sample, constructed from multiple surveys, extends to z\approx 0.8, with the majority of events at z\lesssim 0.3. We construct uniform multi-band and bolometric light curves using Gaussian process regression, and determine key observed properties in the rest-frame (e.g., peak luminosity, timescales, radiated energy). We find that SNe IIn span broad ranges in peak luminosity (\sim 10^{42}-10^{44} erg s-1) and timescales (\sim 20-300 days above 50% of peak luminosity), but the sample divides into two clear groups in the luminosity-timescale phase-space around the median peak luminosity (\approx 10^{43} erg s-1): faint–fast and luminous–slow groups. This leads to a strong bimodality in the radiated energy distribution, with peaks at \sim 10^{49} and \sim 2\times 10^{50} erg, with the latter events having a characteristic timescale of \sim 100 days, and the former appearing to bifurcate into two branches with timescales of \sim 40 and \sim 70 days. Therefore, SNe IIn exhibit at least two dominant groupings, and perhaps three, which are likely reflective of different progenitor and/or circumstellar medium formation pathways. We do not find any obvious transition in SN IIn properties at the arbitrary cut-off of \approx-20 mag used for the designation “Type II Superluminous Supernovae”, and we argue that this classification should be abandoned. The absence of SNe IIn with timescales of \lesssim 14 days defines the region occupied by fast transients with evidence for interaction with hydrogen-poor circumstellar medium.","Among the hydrogen-rich, Type II, supernovae (SNe II), Type IIn SNe (SNe IIn) are classified based on the presence of “narrow” Balmer-series emission lines in their spectra (Schlegel, 1990; Filippenko, 1997). The main power source of SNe IIn is thought to be the shock interaction between the SN ejecta and pre-existing circumstellar medium (CSM; see Smith 2017a for a review), resulting in the most heterogeneous SN class in terms of observed properties (see Kiewe et al. 2012; Taddia et al. 2013; Nyholm et al. 2020 for small sample studies). The observed heterogeneity likely reflects the diversity in pre-explosion mass loss responsible for the CSM formation. However, the nature of the underlying SNe and their progenitors remains elusive, as their observational signatures are mostly hidden below the photosphere formed at the CSM interaction layer. It is therefore possible that a diversity of progenitor channels and explosion properties also contribute to the observed diversity. The direct progenitor identification of SN IIn 2005gl in a pre-explosion image pointed to a massive (>50\,M_{\odot}) luminous blue variable as a potential progenitor for that event (Gal-Yam et al., 2007; Gal-Yam & Leonard, 2009). Given the observed heterogeneous properties of SNe IIn, however, various other progenitor channels are also possible, including for example, super-asymptotic giant branch stars (\sim 8-10\,M_{\odot}; e.g., Kankare et al. 2012; Mauerhan et al. 2013; Smith 2013; Moriya et al. 2014; Hiramatsu et al. 2021), extreme red supergiants (\sim 17-25\,M_{\odot}; e.g., Fullerton et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2009; Moriya et al. 2011; Mauerhan & Smith 2012), interacting massive binaries (>20\,M_{\odot}; e.g., Chevalier 2012; Soker & Kashi 2013; Kashi et al. 2013; Schrøder et al. 2020; Metzger 2022; Hiramatsu et al. 2024), and even pulsational pair-instability SNe (\sim 110-140\,M_{\odot}; e.g., Woosley et al. 2007; Blinnikov 2010; Moriya et al. 2013a; Woosley 2017). In an effort to explore and map the diversity of progenitors, CSM, and explosion properties, here we present the first large-scale study of nearly 500 SNe IIn with well sampled light curves and confirmed spectroscopic classification. In this first paper, we focus on a uniform analysis of the optical light curve properties to extract observed features (e.g., peak luminosity, timescales, radiated energy) and study their distributions and correlations. Subsequent papers will present a similar population-level analysis in relation to numerical simulations; detailed analytical modeling of each SN to determine the explosion and CSM properties; a spectroscopic study of the CSM and CSM-SN shock interaction regions; and studies of the host galaxies and SN IIn locations within their hosts. This paper (Paper I) is structured as follows. In §2 we present our methods to construct an unprecedentedly large sample of SNe IIn. In §3 we present the data sources for light curve construction. In §4 we present a uniform Gaussian process regression method to create uniform rest-frame and time-sampled light curves, and describe the measurements extracted from these Gaussian-Process light curves. In §5 we analyze the light curve properties and explore various correlation between measured and/or calculated properties. We summarize our key findings and discuss their implications in §6 and conclude in §7."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08023v1,How neutron star properties disfavor a nuclear chiral density wave,"Cold and dense matter may break rotational symmetry spontaneously and thus form an anisotropic phase in the interior of neutron stars. We consider the concrete example of an anisotropic chiral condensate in the form of a chiral density wave. Employing a nucleon-meson model and taking into account fermionic vacuum fluctuations, we improve and extend previous results by imposing the conditions of electric charge neutrality and electroweak equilibrium, by allowing for a more general form of the vector meson self-interactions, and by including properties of pure neutron matter into the fit of the model parameters. We find that the conditions inside neutron stars postpone the onset of the chiral density wave to larger densities compared to isospin-symmetric nuclear matter. While this still allows for the construction of stars with an anisotropic core, we find that the chiral density wave is energetically preferred only in a corner of the parameter space where matter is too soft to generate stars with realistic masses. Therefore, taking into account constraints from astrophysical data, our calculation predicts an isotropic neutron star core.","The phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at low temperatures and large, but not asymptotically large, baryon densities is poorly understood. Numerous candidate phases have been suggested, including phases that spontaneously break rotational and/or translational invariance. Anisotropies or inhomogeneities are generated for instance through spatial modulations of the chiral condensate Dautry and Nyman (1979); Takahashi and Tatsumi (2001); Takahashi (2002); Buballa and Carignano (2015) or the Cooper pair condensate Alford et al. (2001); Schäfer (2006); Kryjevski (2008); Alford et al. (2008). Locating an anisotropic or inhomogeneous phase in the QCD phase diagram of temperature and baryon chemical potential does not necessarily translate into the existence of this phase in the interior of a neutron star, currently our only “laboratory” for ultra-dense matter. The reason is that, firstly, neutron star conditions require a nonzero isospin chemical potential and, secondly, it has to be calculated if the density within a realistic neutron star is sufficiently large to accommodate the predicted anisotropic phase. In this paper we are concerned with this question on the level of a phenomenological model: We implement neutron star conditions into a nucleon-meson model, where an anisotropic chiral condensate in the form of a chiral density wave (CDW) was predicted for isospin-symmetric nuclear matter Pitsinigkos and Schmitt (2024), and investigate whether the CDW can be found in a realistic star. In a CDW (also known as “dual chiral density wave”, “chiral spiral”, or “axial wave condensation”) the chiral condensate oscillates between scalar and pseudoscalar sectors, characterized by a single wave vector, whose magnitude is dynamically determined. As a consequence, the fermionic dispersion relations become anisotropic. The CDW or one of its variants is expected to occur in the vicinity of the chiral transition Nickel (2009), even if this transition is a smooth crossover Pitsinigkos and Schmitt (2024). Therefore, it is important to work with a model that incorporates chiral symmetry and the spontaneous breaking thereof. Here, we employ a model based on nucleonic degrees of freedom, which interact via meson exchange Boguta (1983); Boguta and Kunz (1989); Floerchinger and Wetterich (2012); Drews et al. (2013); Drews and Weise (2015); Fraga et al. (2019); Schmitt (2020); Fraga et al. (2022); Pitsinigkos and Schmitt (2024). The parameters of the model are chosen to reproduce properties of low-density nuclear matter. Importantly, the nucleon mass is generated purely dynamically. Therefore, this model has a well-defined chiral limit (setting the pion mass to zero), which we include as a benchmark for our main results with a physical pion mass. In the chiral limit, massless fermions exist in the high-density phase. These acquire a small mass once a realistic explicit chiral symmetry breaking is included. The high-density phase can be viewed as a toy version of quark matter or – perhaps somewhat exotic but not excluded by first-principle arguments – as a confined but chirally symmetric phase of QCD. In this sense, our approach is complementary to phenomenological models based on quark degrees of freedom, such as the quark-meson or Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) models, where it is the low-density phase which is a toy version of real-world QCD due to the lack of realistic nuclear matter. It is in these models that the CDW has been studied most frequently Nakano and Tatsumi (2005); Nickel (2009); Frolov et al. (2010); Carignano and Buballa (2012a); Carignano et al. (2014); Buballa and Carignano (2016); Adhikari et al. (2017); Andersen and Kneschke (2018); Ferrer and de la Incera (2020); Carignano and Buballa (2020); Lakaschus et al. (2021); Buballa et al. (2020), while there are much fewer studies of the nuclear CDW Dautry and Nyman (1979); Takahashi and Tatsumi (2001); Takahashi (2002); Heinz et al. (2015); Takeda et al. (2018); Pitsinigkos and Schmitt (2024). In this paper we will not be concerned with more complicated spatial structures, which can be different one-dimensional modulations, or three-dimensional crystalline structures Abuki et al. (2012); Carignano and Buballa (2012b); Buballa and Carignano (2015); Takeda et al. (2018); Pisarski et al. (2020); Winstel and Valgushev (2024). Another class of inhomogeneous phases, also not considered here, arises from spatial separation of two different phases, for instance a quark-hadron mixed phase Glendenning (1992); Heiselberg et al. (1993); Schmitt (2020). Compact stars containing a CDW phase were previously constructed in an NJL model; in a pure quark star (and ignoring electric charge neutrality) Buballa and Carignano (2016) and combined with isotropic nuclear matter from a different model, in the presence of a magnetic field Carignano et al. (2015). External fields – not included in our present study – that explicitly break rotational symmetry tend to favor anisotropic phases such as the CDW Frolov et al. (2010); Ferrer and de la Incera (2021). The (quark) CDW in the context of neutron stars was also considered in Ref. Tatsumi and Muto (2014), where the neutrino emissivity was computed, however without checking whether a stable star with a CDW is realized. Our main novelty compared to these works is that we construct stars with a potential CDW core from a single model that respects low-density nuclear matter properties and basic neutron star conditions, while at the same time allowing for a chiral transition and a dynamical calculation of whether the CDW is energetically preferred or not. Our work builds on the recent study of Ref. Pitsinigkos and Schmitt (2024). The model used in this reference is extended by including rho meson exchange and a more general form of the vector meson self-interactions. This allows us to include properties of pure neutron matter, known from chiral effective field theory (\chiEFT) Tews et al. (2018), into the parameter fit, following the idea of Ref. Alford et al. (2022), where a similar model was considered. Also, we add electrons and muons and implement the conditions of electric charge neutrality and equilibrium with respect to the electroweak interactions. We evaluate the model at zero temperature, neglecting mesonic fluctuations, but, importantly, include the nucleonic Dirac sea, which receives nontrivial contributions from the CDW. We will employ the renormalization scheme introduced in Ref. Pitsinigkos and Schmitt (2024), which ensures boundedness of the effective potential in the direction of the CDW wavenumber and thus alleviates artifacts encountered previously in similar models with quark degrees of freedom Carignano and Buballa (2012a); Carignano et al. (2014). Our paper is organized as follows. We explain the model and our approximations in Sec. II. This includes the CDW ansatz, Sec. II.1, the derivation of the free energy density and the equation of state under neutron star conditions, Sec. II.2, the stationarity equations for the meson condensates, Sec. II.3, and the procedure for fitting our parameters, Sec. II.4. Our results are presented in Sec. III, where we start with the results for the phase diagram, Sec. III.1, and the mass-radius curves for neutron stars, Sec. III.2, before we present and discuss our main results regarding the CDW in neutron stars in Secs. III.3 and III.4. We summarize our results and give an outlook in Sec. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08007v2,Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mass models on a 3D mesh: IV. Improved description of the isospin dependence of pairing,"Providing reliable data on the properties of atomic nuclei and infinite nuclear matter to astrophysical applications remains extremely challenging, especially when treating both properties coherently within the same framework. Methods based on energy density functionals (EDFs) enable manageable calculations of nuclear structure throughout the entire nuclear chart and of the properties of infinite nuclear matter across a wide range of densities and asymmetries. To address these challenges, we present BSkG4, the latest Brussels-Skyrme-on-a-Grid model. It is based on an EDF of the extended Skyrme type with terms that are both momentum and density-dependent, and refines the treatment of {}^{1}S_{0} nucleon pairing gaps in asymmetric nuclear matter as inspired by more advanced many-body calculations. The newest model maintains the accuracy of earlier BSkGs for known atomic masses, radii and fission barriers with rms deviations of 0.633 MeV w.r.t. 2457 atomic masses, 0.0246 fm w.r.t. 810 charge radii, and 0.36 MeV w.r.t 45 primary fission barriers of actinides. It also improves some specific pairing-related properties, such as the {}^{1}S_{0} pairing gaps in asymmetric nuclear matter, neutron separation energies, Q_{\beta} values, and moments of inertia of finite nuclei. This improvement is particularly relevant for describing the r-process nucleosynthesis as well as various astrophysical phenomena related to the rotational evolution of neutron stars, their oscillations, and their cooling.","Nuclear physics predictions are essential to many astrophysics applications, including simulations of the rapid neutron capture process (or r-process) and the modeling of neutron stars (NS). However, accurately describing the properties of the thousands of atomic nuclei involved in the r-process or of nuclear matter remains an arduous task, further complicated by the wide range of densities and neutron-proton asymmetries found in astrophysical environments Arnould20 ; Oertel17 ; Burgio18 . The challenge lies in developing a model that can simultaneously describe the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter in NS Oertel17 and nuclear structure properties (such as binding energies, nuclear level densities, fission probabilities, and photon or beta strength functions) that are crucial for modeling reactions and decays Arnould20 . Methods based on energy density functionals (EDFs) provide an effective tool for supplying nuclear data to astrophysics, offering a quantum description of nuclear systems in terms of neutrons and protons Bender03 . By connecting nucleonic densities to an effective nucleon-nucleon interaction, EDFs allow for tractable calculations of nuclear structure across the entire nuclear chart and of infinite nuclear matter (INM) properties for a wide range of densities. This makes EDFs a powerful framework for advancing global nuclear models relevant to astrophysics. Within this framework, we have been developing the Brussels-Skyrme-on-a-Grid (BSkG) Scamps21 ; Ryssens22 ; Grams23 series of global nuclear structure models. The BSkG family is based on EDF of extended Skyrme type with both momentum- and density-dependent t_{4} and t_{5} terms, and uses the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation to address the many-body problem. These models aim to provide a comprehensive and as microscopic as possible description of nuclear structure and INM, with a specific focus on astrophysical applications. The BSkG series exploits the powerful concept of symmetry breaking, allowing for complex nuclear shapes, such as triaxial and octupole deformations at ground-state Grams23 and along the fission path Ryssens23 . The description of deformed nuclear clusters is also of importance for the deep layers of the NS inner crust, where a competition between the strong and the electromagnetic interactions takes place, leading to exotic nuclear configurations Ravenhall83 ; Hashimoto84 . These so-called nuclear pasta phases may look like “gnocchi"" (droplets), “spaghetti” (rods), “lasagna” (slabs), “bucatini” (tubes), and “Swiss cheese” (bubbles) and are predicted to exist in cold and hot stellar matter. Moreover, BSkG models allow for time-reversal breaking and can hence access spin and current densities; the latter enter so-called ‘time-odd terms’ in the EDF, which contribute to the total energy of odd and odd-odd nuclei and are crucial for describing spin- and spin–isospin polarized INM. Aside from their application to r-process nucleosynthesis Goriely2020 , the BSkG models have shown how relevant their symmetry-breaking approach is to interpret new experimental data in different regions of the nuclear chart: from mass measurements hukkanen2023 ; hukkanen2023a ; Hukkanen22 to charge radii extracted from laser spectroscopy maass_inprep ; warbinek2024 and even the interpretation of newly discovered isomers stryjczykDiscoveryNewLonglived2024 . In this work we concentrate on improving the {}^{1}S_{0} pairing channel of our models, which plays an essential role in both finite nuclei and dense nuclear matter; pairing contributes to binding energy and stability of the former and leads to the emergence of superfluidity and superconductivity in the dense matter of NSs Chamel17 . Pairing arises due to an attractive interaction between fermions, which allows them to form pairs and condense into a superfluid state below a critical temperature Bardeen57 . Odd-even effects associated with the pairing interaction directly influence the neutron separation energies of finite nuclei, a quantity that defines the nuclear path during the r-process neutron irradiation, as well as their Q_{\beta} value that determines the \beta-decay half-lives, hence the timescales against the production of heavy species during the r-process Arnould07 . Similarly, pairing effects are known to influence the prediction of fission probabilities that can affect the recycling and final composition resulting from the r-process nucleosynthesis Goriely15 . For these reasons, a careful description of the pairing interaction is needed for a reliable prediction of absolute masses as well as mass differences and fission properties influencing reaction and decay rates, hence nucleosynthesis simulations. Another interesting physical system to the study of the pairing phenomena is the inner crust of a NS, where nuclear clusters coexist with superfluid neutrons and possibly superconducting protons in the deepest layers. Because the coherence lengths are typically large Okihashi2021 , a consistent and reliable treatment of the pairing phenomenon in both clusters and INM is required for an accurate modeling of superfluidity in the inner crust of NS Chamel2010super . Superfluidity plays a major role in various astrophysical phenomena, such as pulsar frequency glitches antonopoulou2022 , NS cooling potekhin2020 and oscillations Andersson21 . A new toolkit has been recently released Pecak24 to simulate the local superfluid dynamics in NS, allowing for instance to analyze the motion of an impurity through the neutron superfluid in the NS inner crust, and extract the effective mass, determine the critical velocities, study the formation of topological defects and dissipation processes. The tool is based on time-dependent HFB calculations with extended Skyrme functionals such as the BSkG series and will benefit from a more refined treatment of INM pairing gaps at arbitrary asymmetries in the EDF. The last model of our series, BSkG3 Grams23 , describes nucleon pairing at low densities based on a specific prescription built to match the {}^{1}S_{0} pairing gaps in INM as determined by realistic Extended Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (EBHF) calculations Cao06b , rather than relying on the purely phenomenological ansatz used in BSkG1-2 Scamps21 ; Ryssens22 . However, this match to EBHF calculations is limited to pure neutron matter (NM) and symmetric nuclear matter (SM), requiring an interpolation scheme for arbitrary asymmetries. All Brussels models since BSk17 Goriely09 (with the exception of BSk27 goriely2013 ) adopted a simple prescription that later was found to lead to negative proton pairing gaps at high asymmetries. We modified the interpolation prescription for BSkG3 Grams23 to avoid this issue. However, we found that the improvement on BSkG3 was not enough to reproduce the behaviour of pairing gaps at arbitrary asymmetries as given by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) approximation Zhang_Cao_etal_10 . To address this problem we propose a new entry for the BSkG series, which improves the description of pairing gaps in highly asymmetric environments. This is achieved with BSkG4 by modifying the pairing term of the EDF with an improved interpolation ansatz for the pairing gaps, while keeping the other model ingredients similar to those used for BSkG3, as detailed in Sec. 2. BSkG4 description of finite nuclei is discussed in Sec. 3 and its predictions for INM properties and astrophysics applications in Sec. 4. Finally, we reserve the last section to our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07481v1,Imprints of black hole charge on the precessing jet nozzle of M87*,"The observed jet precession period of approximately 11 years for M87* strongly suggests the presence of a supermassive rotating black hole with a tilted accretion disk at the center of the galaxy. By modeling the motion of the tilted accretion disk particle with the spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole, we study the effect of charge on the observation of the precession period, thereby exploring the potential of this strong-gravity observation in constraining multiple black hole parameters. Firstly, we study the spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole and find that their precession periods increase with the charge. Secondly, we utilize the observed M87* jet precession period to constrain the relationship between the spin, charge, and warp radius, specifically detailing the correlations between each pair of these three quantities. Moreover, to further refine constraints on the charge, we explore the negative correlation between the maximum warp radius and charge. A significant result shows that the gap between the maximum warp radii of the prograde and retrograde orbits decrease with the black hole charge. If the warp radius is provided by other observations, different constraints on the charge can be derived for the prograde and retrograde cases. These results suggest that in the era of multi-messenger astronomy, such strong-gravity observation of precessing jet nozzle presents a promising avenue for constraining black hole parameters.","As a prediction of general relativity (GR), the existence of black holes has been supported by the observation of LIGO LIGO . It is widely believed that there exists supermassive black hole in the center of each galaxy. Excitingly, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration released the first-ever image of the black hole at the center of the M87* Akiyama1 , strongly suggesting the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of M87 and providing a pathway for strong field tests of gravity. Subsequently, the EHT collaboration published the image of SgrA* at the center of our Milky Way Akiyama2 , further advancing the progression of the observation and theory. However, due to limitations in image resolution, there remains significant room for further studies. One of the most striking features of M87* is the bright jet of energy and matter emanating from its core. Previous studies of the inner region of M87* indicated that the jet near the black hole exhibits a large opening angle WJunor ; KHada ; RCWalker ; RLu . Recently, Cui et al. Cui reported an analysis of 22 years of radio observations, showing that the jet’s position angle varies periodically. They hypothesized that this is due to a misaligned accretion disk around a rotating black hole, leading to Lense-Thirring precession. Through their analysis, they derived a half-opening angle of the precession cone of 1.25^{\circ}\pm 0.18^{\circ} and a corresponding period of 11.24\pm 0.47 years, with a precession angular velocity of 0.56\pm 0.02 radians per year. This observation strongly indicates that the central black hole in M87* has a tilted accretion disk deviating from the equatorial plane. Subsequently, they examined the imprints of M87’s jet precession on the black hole-accretion disk system, including the disk’s size and the jet’s non-collinear structure Cui2 . For a tilted accretion disk, the disk plane varies with radius. Within the innermost stable orbit (ISCO), matter particles will rapidly fall into the black hole, and thus it can generally regarded that the accretion disk starts at this orbit radius and then extends towards the distance. The inner disk typically undergoes Bardeen-Petterson alignment BardeenPetterson , which means it usually aligns with the equatorial plane. The outer edge of the inner disk is defined by a characteristic radius known as the warp radius. Beyond the warp radius, the tilt angle of the disk relative to the equatorial plane gradually increases. The tilted accretion disk is found in a wide variety of systems, e.g., protostars, X-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) Papaloizou ; Herrnstein ; Begelman ; Wijers ; Chiang ; Martin ; Lodato ; Casassus . Modeling such complex accretion disks is difficult if one considers its internal dynamical mechanisms. However, if the characteristics of the tilted disk are grasped, one can simulate the motion of the accretion disk with simple and manageable model. For example, the quasi-periodic oscillations observed in certain astrophysical black hole systems can be explored by studying the precession of spherical orbits Zahrani . Another interesting application was first proposed in Ref. Wei that the observed jet precession period can be used to constrain the black hole parameters. In the study, the warp radius and black hole spin parameter are constrained based on the following three assumptions. First, the motion of the disk particles at each radial distance can be accurately described by spherical orbit with a constant radius, deviating from the equatorial plane Wilkins ; Goldstein ; Dymnikova ; Shakura ; ETeo ; PRana ; Kopek . Second, the jet is assumed to originate near the warp radius and be oriented perpendicular to the accretion disk. Finally, the precession axis is considered as the axis of the black hole spin. The black holes of general relativity can be completely specified by only three parameters: their mass M, spin angular momentum J, and the electric charge Q according to the “no-hair theorem” Israel1 ; Israel2 ; Carter2 ; Hawking ; Gravitation ; Robinson . The effects caused by the charge are minimal, making it difficult to constrain the charge through observations in weak gravitational fields Sereno ; Ebina . The EHT collaboration, using observations of black hole shadows in strong gravitational fields, constrained multiple parameters, including the charge, but only ruled out certain regions corresponding to specific physical charges Kocherlakota . The precession of M87*’s jet presents another strong gravitational observation following black hole shadow, and we expect to use this observation to constrain multiple parameters. Although very recent study have explored a rotating black hole immersed in a Melvin magnetic field CChen , a simpler and equally meaningful case is the Kerr-Newman black hole. One might argue that the charge of a charged black hole would quickly neutralize in the surrounding plasma, but here we do not consider the neutralization process or the electromagnetic interaction with the astrophysical environment. This assumption is consistent with that made in Refs. Kocherlakota ; Tsukamoto . Our goal is to explore the potential of using black hole jet precession to constrain multiple parameters, with a particular focus on constraining parameters other than the spin, specifically the charge Q in the Kerr-Newman scenario. Besides, some accretion scenario also involve the study of charged rotating black holes Wilson ; Damour ; Ruffini . Thus, here we consider the charged rotating black holes described by the Kerr-Newman solution at the center of M87* Newman . Building on the assumptions proposed in Ref. Wei , we model the tilted accretion disk using spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole and constrain the black hole parameters through the observed jet precession period. First, we calculate the energy and angular momentum of spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole, as well as the radii of the innermost stable spherical orbit (ISSO) and the last spherical orbit (LSO), and focus on the impact of the charge on these quantities. Next, we numerically solve the equations of motion in the \theta and \phi directions to obtain the precession angular velocity of the spherical orbits and investigate its dependence on the black hole parameters. Finally, based on these calculations, we derive the precession period and use the spherical orbits of the Kerr-Newman black hole to model the accretion disk of M87*, constraining the relationships between the spin, charge, and warp radius with the observed jet precession period. We also established a relationship between the maximum warp radius and the charge. Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we carry out a detailed study of spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole, including its special subclasses ISSO and LSO. In Sec. III, we further analyze the precession of spherical orbits. Then we provide some constraints on the black hole parameters using the observed jet precession period in Sec. IV. Finally, we discuss and conclude our results in Sec. V. Here we adopt the metric convention (-,+,+,+) and use geometrical units with G=c=1 in addition to recovering dimensionality in Sec. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07284v1,Full 3D nonlinear dynamics of charged and magnetized boson stars,"Gauged boson stars are exotic compact objects that can potentially mimic black holes or magnetized neutron stars in both their gravitational and electromagnetic signatures, offering a compelling new description or even an alternative explanation for various multimessenger phenomena. As a crucial step toward establishing boson stars as viable multimessenger sources, we perform 3D numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system, focusing on both spherical and axisymmetric boson star configurations that vary in their electromagnetic coupling between the neutral case up to values close to the critical case, and so their magnetic field content. For spherical configurations, we consistently find stable solutions. In contrast, for axially symmetric, electrically neutral, magnetized configurations, the dynamics are highly sensitive to the electromagnetic coupling. Configurations with stronger coupling develop a one-armed mode instability, which leads to collapse into black holes. Configurations with weaker coupling undergo a two-stage process: an initial bar-mode instability that triggers a one-armed spiral deformation. This eventually also results in black hole formation, accompanied by emissions of both gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. A similar instability and two-stage pattern is observed in all charged rotating boson stars analyzed. However, all of these configurations become stable when self-interactions are introduced.","We are in an unprecedented era of astrophysics, where an influx of new observations from gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals to neutrino detections Janka (2012); Aartsen et al. (2013); Abbott et al. (2017); Kocevski et al. (2017), is reshaping our understanding of the Universe. Gravitational wave astronomy began in 2015 with the groundbreaking detection of gravitational waves from the merger of a binary black hole system, event GW150914 Abbott et al. (2016). Two years later, the simultaneous detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star inspiral, event GW170817, along with its post-merger electromagnetic counterpart, marked the dawn of multimessenger astronomy Abbott et al. (2017); Cowperthwaite et al. (2017). Numerical simulations play an essential role in multimessenger astronomy, as they generate the waveforms needed to interpret signals detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration, and anticipate those from upcoming detectors like the Einstein Telescope and LISA Afshordi et al. (2023); Hild et al. (2011). Besides, these simulations also predict electromagnetic counterparts, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and electromagnetic luminosity Paschalidis et al. (2015); Ruiz et al. (2016); Kiuchi et al. (2024); Liebling and Palenzuela (2016), while modeling the fraction of ejected mass responsible for kilonova events Just et al. (2023); Metzger and Fernández (2014); Curtis et al. (2022), which can be observed through X-ray instruments like CHANDRA and XMM-Newton (see e.g. Haggard et al. (2017); D’Avanzo et al. (2018)). However, despite the advances made through multimessenger observations combined with numerical simulations, there are still open questions regarding the nature of the progenitors of some events, such as GW190814 Abbott et al. (2020). This event involved the merger of a black hole with an object in the so-called mass gap Barr et al. (2024); van Son et al. (2020), of around 2.6M_{\odot}, too massive to be a typical neutron star but too light to be classified as a black hole. Additionally, it has been shown that GW190521 is consistent not only with the merger of a black hole binary but also with the collision of vector boson (Proca) stars Calderón Bustillo et al. (2021); Calderon Bustillo et al. (2023), pointing to a degeneracy of the possible sources. These findings suggest the potential involvement of exotic neutron stars or other unknown compact objects. The detection of unusual black hole masses and possible intermediate-mass black holes further emphasizes significant gaps in our understanding of gravitational source in the Universe, emphasizing that gravitational wave astronomy continues to raise important, unresolved questions in astrophysics and general relativity. Exotic compact objects (ECOs), that include quark stars, and strange stars (stars containing strange quarks), have also been proposed as alternative explanations for several “unexplained” electromagnetic phenomena, including fast radio bursts (FRBs) Dai and Lu (1998); Bombaci and Datta (2000); Zhang et al. (2024a). For instance, magnetized exotic compact objects may undergo oscillations or instabilities that trigger violent energy releases, which could manifest as FRBs. When interacting or merging with other compact objects, the strong coupling between scalar and electromagnetic fields might cause bursts of radiation, explaining the millisecond-duration nature of FRBs. Moreover, the intense magnetic fields associated with gauged boson stars could lead to magnetospheric reconnections, similar to mechanisms proposed for neutron stars Cheong et al. (2024), further supporting their role as potential FRB sources. Beyond FRBs, exotic compact objects could also provide explanations for other astrophysical anomalies, such as superluminous supernovae and GRBs. Some theories suggest that exotic stars could form in extreme astrophysical events, such as neutron star mergers or collapses, releasing enormous amounts of electromagnetic energy that are detectable across various wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum Ruiz and Shapiro (2017); Ponce et al. (2014). Furthermore, advances in theoretical modeling and computational techniques have provided new ways to explore the existence of alternative compact objects (see e.g. Bezares and Sanchis-Gual (2024) for a recently review). The study of self-gravitating objects composed of scalar fields has proven especially fruitful. The relative simplicity of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system allows for the exploration of novel geometries, which can be used to explain several astrophysical observations. This approach not only challenges the traditional black hole paradigm but could also help to solve some of the puzzles mentioned above. In the case of a complex scalar field, these self-gravitating and horizonless objects are known as boson stars (for reviews, see Shnir (2023); Liebling and Palenzuela (2023)). When minimally coupled to gravity, the dynamical properties of these solutions are primarily determined by the choice of scalar field potential and whether angular momentum or non-spherical morphologies are introduced. The stability of these families of solutions has been a central focus of discussion for some time Gleiser (1988); Lee and Pang (1989); Seidel and Suen (1990); Balakrishna et al. (1998); Sanchis-Gual et al. (2019, 2021); Siemonsen and East (2021); Alcubierre et al. (2021); Jaramillo et al. (2020); Ildefonso et al. (2023). However, the stability of solutions when the scalar field interacts with a Maxwell field has been less thoroughly studied. The interplay between scalar and electromagnetic interactions in the \mathrm{U}(1)-gauged model of complex scalar fields with minimal electromagnetic coupling opens up the possibility of constructing explicit, self-consistent charged and magnetized spacetimes Jetzer and van der Bij (1989); Delgado et al. (2016); Herdeiro and Radu (2020); Jaramillo et al. (2024); Jaramillo and Núñez (2022); Kunz and Shnir (2023), leading to a rich array of phenomena Sanchis-Gual et al. (2016); Zhang et al. (2024b); Sanchis-Gual et al. (2022). In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of gauged scalar field self-gravitating solitons, commonly known as charged boson stars. We begin with the spherical case, which has previously been considered stable Jetzer and van der Bij (1989); Jetzer (1989). Through numerical evolution, we confirm that stability persists in a manner similar to that of free-field neutral boson stars Kaup (1968); Ruffini and Bonazzola (1969); Gleiser (1988); Lee and Pang (1989); Seidel and Suen (1990), where an entire branch of solutions is present. We then examine the axisymmetric (spinning) case, where the motion of the system generates both electric and magnetic components. While uncharged objects were known to be unstable, our results show that the presence of an electric charge intensifies this instability and plays a role on how the star collapses to a black hole. Next, we introduce a specific configuration in which scalar fields, that interact only through gravity, are superimposed to form a static object with a toroidal morphology Jaramillo and Núñez (2022). This object carries no net charge and, consequently, does not generate an electric field, but it does produce a poloidal magnetic field. This model serves as a simple analog to objects observed in nature, electrically neutral yet exhibiting a magnetic field. However, this configuration is also unstable. Instabilities emerge more rapidly as the individual electric charge of each torus increases. Motivated by the stability properties of the above configurations, we probe the case where a self-interaction term is included in the scalar potential. Previous studies have shown that rotating boson stars with self-interaction are numerically stable Siemonsen and East (2021); Di Giovanni et al. (2020). As expected we find that a rotating, uncharged scalar torus with both squared and quartic terms in the scalar potential remains stable over long evolution times. In particular, our configuration remains stable for 10^{4} times the characteristic oscillation time of the scalar field. Following this, we investigate the impact of the electromagnetic field on stability by gauging the scalar field for various charge values. We then explore the non-spinning magnetic and electrically neutral star described above. This configuration also proves stable across several values of the charge. In cases where the system becomes unstable and undergoes gravitational collapse into a black hole, we observe emissions of gravitational, electromagnetic, and scalar radiation. Therefore, we a provide comprehensive analysis of scenarios involving both scalar and electromagnetic fields, offering insights into their stability and collapse dynamics. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we briefly review the theory of gauged scalar field coupled to gravity and discuss the families of stationary asymptotically flat configurations that can be constructed within this physical model. In addition we describe some of the diagnostics we monitor to verify the reliability of our numerical simulations and outline our numerical methods. In Sec. III we probe the stability properties of both spherical and axisymmetric charged boson star configurations. In Sec. IV, we address the stability of electrically neutral magnetized boson stars, while in IV.1 we describe the evolution of self-interacting axisymmetric stars. Finally, we summarize our results and conclude in Sec. V. Throughout the paper we adopt units in which the speed of light c, gravitational constant G, and the vacuum permeability \mu_{0} are equal to one."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07162v1,Search for Extended GeV Sources in the Inner Galactic Plane,"The recent detection of extended \gamma-ray emission around middle-aged pulsars is interpreted as inverse-Compton scattering of ambient photons by electron-positron pairs escaping the pulsar wind nebula, which are confined near the system by unclear mechanisms. This emerging population of \gamma-ray sources was first discovered at TeV energies and remains underexplored in the GeV range. To address this, we conducted a systematic search for extended sources along the Galactic plane using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data above 10 GeV, aiming to identify a number of pulsar halo candidates and extend our view to lower energies. The search covered the inner Galactic plane (\lvert l\rvert\leq 100∘, \lvert b\rvert\leq 1∘) and the positions of known TeV sources and bright pulsars, yielding broader astrophysical interest. We found 40 such sources, forming the Second Fermi Galactic Extended Sources Catalog (2FGES), most with 68% containment radii smaller than 1.0∘ and relatively hard spectra with photon indices below 2.5. We assessed detection robustness using field-specific alternative interstellar emission models and by inspecting significance maps. Noting 13 sources previously known as extended in the 4FGL-DR3 catalog and five dubious sources from complex regions, we report 22 newly detected extended sources above 10 GeV. Of these, 13 coincide with H.E.S.S., HAWC, or LHAASO sources; six coincide with bright pulsars (including four also coincident with TeV sources); six are associated with 4FGL point sources only; and one has no association in the scanned catalogs. Notably, six to eight sources may be related to pulsars as classical pulsar wind nebulae or pulsar halos.","The detection of spatially extended \gamma-ray emission around several middle-aged pulsars (typically \gtrsim 100 kyr) has been reported in the TeV domain over the past few years (Abeysekara et al., 2017; Aharonian et al., 2021). This diffuse emission, which extends over spatial scales of a few tens of parsecs, is interpreted as inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of background radiation fields by high-energy electron-positron pairs accelerated in pulsars and their wind nebulae, and subsequently released into their surroundings. The observed intensity distribution of these so-called TeV halos or pulsar halos suggests efficient spatial confinement, driven by a physical mechanism yet to be elucidated. In the case of the halos around pulsars PSR J0633+1746 and PSR B0656+14, as observed by the HAWC collaboration (Abeysekara et al., 2017), and around PSR J0622+3749, as observed by the LHAASO collaboration (Aharonian et al., 2021), the diffusion of particles is significantly inhibited within a few tens of parsecs from the pulsars compared to the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM), being reduced by nearly 2-3 orders of magnitude for \sim100 TeV electrons. Pulsar halos offer an opportunity to probe the transport properties of energetic particles in the vicinity of their accelerators. The origin of the suppressed particle diffusion inferred from TeV observations of some pulsars is still under debate, and several theoretical scenarios have been put forward. A first option is self-confinement, where the gradient of pairs escaping the nebula triggers kinetic instabilities out of which turbulence develops and scatters particles themselves (Evoli et al., 2018; Mukhopadhyay & Linden, 2022). A second option is pre-existing external turbulence, in which escaping pairs encounter a region of space where, for some reason like the expansion of the parent supernova remnant (SNR), standard magnetohydrodynamical turbulence has the right properties for efficient confinement of \sim100 TeV particles (López-Coto & Giacinti, 2018; Fang et al., 2019). A third option, that can be combined with the second scenario, is that the pulsar halo develops in turbulence previously generated by cosmic-ray protons as they escaped the parent remnant (Schroer et al., 2021, 2022). A fourth option, involving perpendicular diffusion as the origin of the confinement, and a favorable magnetic field alignment with respect to the line of sight (Liu et al., 2019), seems increasingly unlikely as more pulsar halos are discovered (De La Torre Luque et al., 2022). This question has consequences on the interpretation of the locally measured cosmic-ray positron flux in relation to nearby pulsars. In contrast to the assumption in Abeysekara et al. (2017) that suppressed diffusion inferred from J0633+1746 and B0656+14 observations extends up to Earth and cuts off their contribution to the positron flux, there seems to be a growing consensus on the idea that inhibited diffusion is restricted to a reasonably small region surrounding the pulsars. In this scenario, nearby middle-aged pulsars are likely responsible for the observed positron excess (Profumo et al., 2018; Fang et al., 2018; Tang & Piran, 2019; Martin et al., 2022a). As an emerging population of \gamma-ray emitters, pulsar halos may constitute a rich source class, owing to the large number of pulsars in the Galaxy and possible long duration of the halo phase (hundreds of thousands of years). Some models estimated the number of halos detectable by current and future instruments and have shown that a significant fraction of existing TeV sources currently classified as unidentified or as pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) might actually be halos (Linden et al., 2017; Sudoh et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2022b). Those TeV halos currently below the detection threshold may significantly contribute to the large-scale interstellar diffuse emission in the TeV and sub-PeV domains (Linden et al., 2018; Sudoh et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2022b), until they are resolved into individual sources by future surveys with higher sensitivity. Despite numerous studies on pulsar halos in the TeV domain, their population and properties at lower GeV energies are yet to be explored for the most part. Di Mauro et al. (2019) reported the detection of large extended emission around PSR J0633+1746 above 8 GeV with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT; Atwood et al., 2009). For two other pulsars with TeV halos (B0656+14 and J0622+3749), no significant extended emission is detected from LAT data (Di Mauro et al., 2019; Aharonian et al., 2021). Another search for extended GeV emission around three bright sources, detected with HAWC up to beyond 100 TeV and coincident with pulsars, resulted in the detection of a \gamma-ray halo around two of them, with properties consistent with significant diffusion suppression (Di Mauro et al., 2021). Yet, the corresponding pulsars are relatively young objects with characteristic ages of \sim20 kyr, and it is not clear that these observations are probing a late-stage halo phase and not just a more classical early-stage PWN undergoing particle escape (Martin et al., 2024). In this work, we report the results of a comprehensive systematic search for new extended GeV sources in the Galactic plane, using 14 years of Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data at energies from 10 GeV to 1 TeV. The analysis consisted in both a search for GeV counterparts of known TeV sources and bright pulsars, as well as a blind search for extended sources along most of the Galactic plane. We eventually obtain a catalog of 40 extended sources and present a list of their possible associations with pulsars or higher-energy \gamma-ray sources. This dataset is expected to trigger more in-depth observations and studies to improve our knowledge of particle acceleration and early propagation in a variety of astrophysical setups, for instance pairs released from PWNe, cosmic rays escaping from SNRs, or non-thermal particle transport in star-forming regions. Compared to the First Fermi Galactic Extended Sources catalog (FGES catalog; Ackermann et al., 2017), this study uses a substantially larger dataset and introduces some evolutions in the data analysis strategy, source classification, association, and identification. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the instrument, data selection and preparation, and analysis framework. The methodology that was developed to search for extended sources and study some systematic effects relevant to this analysis is outlined in Section 3. The final catalog of extended sources, labelled the Second Fermi Galactic Extended Sources (2FGES) catalog, is presented in Section 4, where the spatial and spectral information on the 2FGES sources is provided, and their potential associations with known higher-energy \gamma-ray sources and strong pulsars are examined. A discussion of possible pulsar halo candidates is given in Section 5. Finally, we summarize the main findings of this study in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07035v1,Inferring jet physics from neutron star—black hole mergers with gravitational waves,"Neutron star—black hole (NSBH) mergers that undergo tidal disruption may launch jets that could power a gamma-ray burst. We use a population of simulated NSBH systems to measure jet parameters from the gravitational waves emitted by these systems. The conditions during the tidal disruption and merger phase required to power a gamma-ray burst are uncertain. It is likely that the system must achieve some minimum remnant baryonic mass after the merger before a jet can be launched to power a gamma-ray burst. Assuming a fiducial neutron star equation of state, we show how Bayesian hierarchical inference can be used to infer the minimum remnant mass required to launch a gamma-ray burst jet as well as the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to detect a gamma-ray burst. We find that with 200 NSBH observations, we can measure the minimum disk mass to within 0.01\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}} at 90% credibility. We simultaneously infer the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to within 13\,\mathrm{{}^{\circ}} at 90% credibility. We conclude that upcoming upgrades to the LIGO observatories may provide important new insights into the physics of NSBH jets.","Figure 1: Schematic explaining the possible fates of an NSBH merger, depending on the binary parameters. We are interested in answering the question: what threshold remnant baryonic mass is required to launch a GRB jet? We consider the remnant mass and orientation of the system as the only two requirements to measure a GRB from an NSBH merger, however we note that in reality there may be other requirements that need to be satisfied to successfully launch a GRB jet. Neutron star—black hole (NSBH) mergers probably make up at least three of the \gtrsim 90 gravitational-wave events published by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA (LVK) collaboration (Abbott et al., 2021a, 2023a, 2023b, b; Abac et al., 2024).111We refer to the two NSBH detections described in Abbott et al. (2021b) and the recent NSBH binary merger GW230529 (Abac et al., 2024), although 1–2 more NSBH mergers could be counted in the third gravitational-wave catalog (Abbott et al., 2023b). If the black hole in an NSBH system is sufficiently light or spinning rapidly, the neutron star may tidally disrupt. The disruption could provide a progenitor for a gamma-ray burst (GRB) (e.g., Mochkovitch et al., 1993; Janka et al., 1999; Nakar, 2007) by launching a relativistic jet. To date, the only confirmed GRB+gravitational-wave multi-messenger detection was the binary neutron star merger GW170817 (Abbott et al., 2017, 2017) and the corresponding GRB 170817A (Goldstein et al., 2017). Tidal disruption alone is probably not sufficient for the system to launch a jet and for the jet to be detected on Earth as a GRB. We consider two requirements for an NSBH merger to launch a jet that can be measured by gamma-ray observatories at Earth. First, the NSBH must have disrupted and produced a remnant mass large enough to launch a jet that is powered for long enough to break through the merger ejecta material. The required disk mass is likely on the order of a few percent of a solar mass, but this threshold mass is not precisely known (e.g., Lee & Ramirez-Ruiz, 2007). Typical disk mass threshold values used in the literature lie between 0.03 and 0.08 solar masses (Pannarale & Ohme, 2014; Stone et al., 2013; Zappa et al., 2019). Second, the GRB jet must be launched with an opening angle and inclination that makes it possible to be viewed from Earth. It is likely that the binary mergers’ inclination angle must be close to on-axis, i.e, the orbital angular momentum axis is pointed towards Earth, for the GRB jet to be observed (e.g., Chen & Holz, 2013; O’Connor et al., 2024). However, the discovery of a GRB with the off-axis multi-messenger signal GW170817 (Abbott et al., 2017, 2017; Finstad et al., 2018; Ghirlanda et al., 2019) means that jets can be observed off-axis to some degree, perhaps at a reduced luminosity and delayed rise time compared to an on-axis counterpart (e.g., Granot et al., 2002). The maximum viewing angle is also unknown as it depends on uncertain jet physics. We summarize the possible outcomes for NSBH mergers in Figure 1, highlighting the requirements that need to be satisfied before a GRB can be observed. The strict physical requirements for disruption means that disrupting binaries are likely a small minority of NSBH systems (e.g., Zhu et al., 2022; Drozda et al., 2022; Biscoveanu et al., 2023), however, future detectors such as Cosmic Explorer (Reitze et al., 2019) and Einstein Telescope (Maggiore et al., 2020) will allow us to observe a population of potentially disrupting binaries (e.g., Gupta et al., 2023a), some with multi-messenger counterparts. In this Letter, we describe how data from upcoming gravitational-wave observatories can be used to infer the minimum remnant mass and maximum viewing angle to detect a GRB jet with minimal assumptions about the jet physics. We examine a possible population of NSBH mergers that could be detected by a proposed upgrade to the LIGO detectors called A♯ (Fritschel et al., 2024). A♯ will improve on the LVK design sensitivity (Aasi et al., 2015; Acernese et al., 2015; Akutsu et al., 2020) by a factor of approximately two in strain and is intended as a precursor instrument to Cosmic Explorer (Reitze et al., 2019), and is slated to observe in the early 2030s. We show that we can resolve the minimum remnant mass to launch jets and constrain the maximum jet viewing angle with a population of NSBH mergers observed by A♯ in one year, provided some mergers have a multi-messenger counterpart. We note that in some systems a jet could be launched without an accompanying GRB, but for this work we exclusively consider GRB jets. The remainder of this Letter is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe our simulated population that we use to infer the threshold remnant mass. In Section 3 we describe the mathematical framework for our hierarchical inference model. We describe our results in Section 4 and discuss the implications for these results in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06996v1,Flaring gamma-ray emission coincident with a hyperactive fast radio burst source,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright milliseconds-duration radio bursts from cosmological distances [1, 2]. Despite intense observational and theoretical studies, their physical origin is still mysterious [3]. One major obstacle is the lack of identification of multi-wavelength counterparts for FRBs at cosmological distances. So far, all the searches other than in the radio wavelength [4], including those in the \gamma-ray energies [5, 6], have only left upper limits. Here we report a gigaelectronvolt (GeV) \gamma-ray flare lasting 15.6 seconds as well as additional evidence of variable gamma-ray emission in temporal and spatial association with the hyper-active, newly discovered repeating FRB 20240114A, which has been localized to a dwarf galaxy at a redshift of 0.13 [7]. The energetic, short GeV \gamma-ray flare reached a prompt isotropic luminosity of the order of {10}^{48}~{}{\rm ergs~{}{s}^{-1}}. The additional less-significant \gamma-ray flares, if true, also have similar luminosities; such flares could contribute to a 5-day average luminosity of the order of {10}^{45}~{}{\rm ergs~{}{s}^{-1}}. These high-luminosity flares challenge the traditional FRB engine scenario involving a seconds-period magnetar. Rather, it suggests a powerful, long-lived but newborn energy source at the location of this active repeater, either directly powering the bursts or indirectly triggering bursts in the vicinity of the FRB engine.","References [1] Lorimer, D.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06918v1,Study of the muon component in the core-corona model using CONEX 3D,"The discrepancy between models and data on the muon content in air showers generated by ultra-high energy cosmic rays still needs to be solved. The CONEX simulation framework provides a flexible tool to assess the impact of different interaction properties and address the muon puzzle. In this work, we present the multidimensional extension of CONEX and show its performance compared to CORSIKA by discussing muon-related air-shower features for three experiments: KASCADE, IceTop, and the Pierre Auger Observatory. We also implement an effective version of the core-corona model to demonstrate the impact of the core effect, as observed at the LHC, on the muon content in air showers produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays. At a primary energy of E_{0}=${10}^{19}\text{\,}\eV$, we obtain an increase of 15\% to 20\% in the muon content.","1 The muon puzzle Several riddles remain open in the fields of high and ultra-high energy cosmic rays. For energies above {10}^{15}\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}, we can detect cosmic rays only indirectly through the secondary particles, or extensive air showers, produced when they interact with nuclei in the Earth’s atmosphere [engel2011extensive]. The Heitler-Matthews model [matthews2005heitler] describes the particle production in air showers in a simplified way: neutral pions, created along the shower, decay to photons that feed the electromagnetic component (encompassing photons, electrons, and positrons) by subsequent pair creation and Bremsstrahlung processes. Alongside neutral pions, charged pions typically decay into muons, forming the muonic component. This model reveals two mass- and energy-sensitive observables [kampert2012measurements]: the atmospheric depth at the maximum development of the cascade, X_{\mathrm{max}}, mainly determined by the electromagnetic component of the shower, and the number of muons at ground level, N_{\mu}, driven by the shower’s hadronic core. Then, we use simulations to interpret air shower measurements and to deduce, for example, the mean logarithmic mass of cosmic rays \langle\ln{A}\rangle from X_{\mathrm{max}} and N_{\mu}. Most of the uncertainty in \langle\ln{A}\rangle stems from the discrepancies in these models. This uncertainty ultimately challenges our understanding of the astrophysical scenarios in which cosmic rays are produced and accelerated. Currently, the discrepancy between the muon density measured with surface arrays and that predicted by hadronic interaction models [albrecht2022muon] represents one of the most pressing questions in air shower physics. Refs. [albrecht2022muon, Cazon:2020zhx] report on the so-called muon puzzle, observed in a broad energy range from about {10}^{16}\text{\,}\mathrm{eV} up to {10}^{20}\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}, and in experiments measuring showers under different atmospheric conditions with diverse detection techniques. In addition, the number of muons is also sensitive to hadronic multiparticle production at lower energies [meurer2006muon], which further expands the energy range that needs to be revised in the models. Air-shower experiments located at different altitudes measure the shower development at different stages, challenging the data interpretation. Following [albrecht2022muon, Cazon:2020zhx], we categorized the experiments into three groups: the IceCube Neutrino Observatory with its surface array IceTop at around 2800\text{\,}\mathrm{m} a.s.l., the Pierre Auger Observatory and the HiRes/MIA Experiment at ca. 1500\text{\,}\mathrm{m} a.s.l., all other experiments are located between 100 - 250\text{\,}\mathrm{m} a.s.l.. To compare simulations associated with different conditions, we discuss the cases of IceTop at IceCube, the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the KASCADE Experiment [aab2016pierre, abbasi2013icetop, apel2010kascade]. These cover different altitudes, energy ranges, distances to the shower core, and experimental configurations. The Pierre Auger Observatory is a hybrid detector comprising a 3000\text{\,}{\mathrm{km}}^{2} surface array of over 1600 water Cherenkov detectors and 24 fluorescence telescopes overlooking the layout from the periphery [pierre2020pierre, aab2016pierre]. It is located close to Malargüe, in Argentina, at an average altitude of \sim$1400\text{\,}\mathrm{m}$. The original triangular grid of surface detectors with a 1500\text{\,}\mathrm{m} spacing is sensitive to cosmic-ray energies above \sim$e18.5\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}$ [ranchon2005response]. Later, two denser arrays with 750\text{\,}\mathrm{m} and 433\text{\,}\mathrm{m} spacings were deployed to extend the energy range of the observatory to \sim$e16.5\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}$. The underground muon detector consists of scintillators deployed next to the water Cherenkov detectors that constitute these denser arrays [aab2016pierre]. At each position, three 10\text{\,}\mathrm{m}^{2} modules are buried at a depth of 2.3\text{\,}\mathrm{m} to shield electromagnetic particles [aab2021design]. IceCube, located at the geographic South Pole, is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov detector, fundamentally designed as a neutrino observatory [abbasi2013icetop]. Complemented by its surface array IceTop, situated at an altitude of 2835\text{\,}\mathrm{m}, it extends its capabilities to cosmic ray physics. IceTop consists of a 1\text{\,}\mathrm{k}\mathrm{m}^{2} array with 162 water Cherenkov detectors in 81 stations with a 125\text{\,}\mathrm{m} spacing. It measures the electromagnetic component and predominantly low-energy muons from extensive air showers generated by cosmic rays exceeding {10}^{14}\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}. High-energy muons are detected in coincidence in the in-ice detector IceCube. Finally, the KASCADE Experiment was located at the Forschungzentrum Karlsruhe in Germany at an altitude of 110\text{\,}\mathrm{m} a.s.l. [apel2010kascade, antoni2003cosmic]. It consisted initially of an electromagnetic and muon detector array upgraded to KASCADE-Grande by extending the array area to detect cosmic rays with energies between {10}^{14}\text{\,}\mathrm{eV} and {10}^{18}\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}. The muon detector component, which is of interest for this work, encompassed 252 detector stations arranged on a rectangular grid with a spacing of 13\text{\,}\mathrm{m} covering an area of 0.04\text{\,}\mathrm{k}\mathrm{m}^{2} with plastic scintillators of 90\times90\times3\text{\,}\mathrm{c}\mathrm{m}^{3} with 10\text{\,}\mathrm{cm} lead and 4\text{\,}\mathrm{cm} iron shields. To shed light on the muon puzzle, improving the air shower simulation frameworks and enhancing their technical capabilities to integrate new theoretical models is of utmost importance. In this work, we present advancements in these aspects: we introduce a software extension in Sec. 2 to improve computing times, enabling the massive simulation of ultra-high energy showers in 3D. Then, in Sec. 3, we use this extension to compare muon-related air shower observables for different experiments. Finally, in Sec. 4, we discuss the impact on the muon content of air showers after a theoretical model modification based on the core-corona approach [baur2023core]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06902v2,A Systematic Search for Candidate Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Using Periodic Mid-Infrared Light Curves of Active Galactic Nuclei,"Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a promising method for studying sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are a challenging detection target. While extensive searches have been made in the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray bands, systematic infrared (IR) studies remain limited. Using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), which provides unique decade-long mid-IR light curves with a six-month cadence, we have conducted the first systematic search for SMBHB candidates based on IR periodicity. Analyzing a parent sample of 48,932 objects selected from about half a million AGNs, we have identified 28 candidate periodic AGNs with periods ranging from 1,268 to 2,437 days (in the observer frame) by fitting their WISE light curves with sinusoidal functions. However, our mock simulation of the parent sample indicates that stochastic variability can actually produce a similar number of periodic sources, underscoring the difficulty in robustly identifying real periodic signals with WISE light curves, given their current sampling. Notably, we found no overlap between our sample and optical periodic sources, which can be explained by a distinct preference for certain periods due to selection bias. By combining archived data from different surveys, we have identified SDSS J140336.43+174136.1 as a candidate exhibiting periodic behavior in both optical and IR bands, a phenomenon that warrants further validation through observational tests. Our results highlight the potential of IR time-domain surveys, including future missions such as the Nancy Grace-Roman Space Telescope, for identifying periodic AGNs, but complementary tests are still needed to determine their physical origins such as SMBHBs.","1 introduction Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are intriguing celestial objects that reside at the centers of galaxies (Kormendy & Ho, 2013). When galaxies merge, it is anticipated that the central black holes will form binary systems known as SMBH binaries (SMBHBs, Begelman et al. 1980). These binary systems offer valuable insights into various astrophysical phenomena, including galaxy formation (Colpi & Dotti, 2011), gravitational wave (GW) emission (Hughes, 2009), and the evolution of SMBHs (Merritt, 2013). More massive binaries are pulsar-timing array (PTA) sources (e.g., Arzoumanian et al. 2018), while less massive binaries are targeted by space-based experiments such as LISA (Klein et al., 2016). They provide a laboratory to directly test strong-field general relativity (Hughes, 2009; Centrella et al., 2010). However, despite their theoretical significance, the direct electromagnetic detection of close SMBHBs below sub-parsec separation has proven to be a challenging endeavor (see recent reviews such as De Rosa et al. 2019; D’Orazio & Charisi 2023) while numerous SMBH pairs at larger scales have been identified through the presence of dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) (e.g., Komossa et al. 2003; Zhou et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2010, 2011, 2013; Koss et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2022). When a binary has exhausted its interactions with stars but has not approached close enough to emit significant gravitational radiation, its orbit does not have an obvious mechanism for decay. This long-standing challenge presents a major uncertainty in estimating the abundance of SMBHB mergers as GW sources. In theory, the bottleneck may be overcome in gaseous environments (e.g., Gould & Rix 2000; Cuadra et al. 2009; Chapon et al. 2013; del Valle et al. 2015), in triaxial or axisymmetric galaxies (e.g., Khan et al. 2016; Kelley et al. 2017), and/or by interacting with a third BH in hierarchical mergers (e.g., Blaes et al. 2002; Kulkarni & Loeb 2012; Bonetti et al. 2018). A recent and promising approach for identifying potential close SMBHB candidates has emerged in the thriving field of time-domain astronomy, which focuses on analyzing the periodic light curves of AGNs. The periodicity observed in these light curves can arise from changes in the accretion rate onto the black holes (Graham et al., 2015b) or from the relativistic Doppler boost resulting from the highly relativistic motion of gas in the mini accretion disk around the smaller black hole in the binary system (D’Orazio et al., 2015). Extensive research has been conducted using optical light curves to search for SMBHBs, and the methods employed in these studies have become well-established (Graham et al., 2015a; Charisi et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019b; Chen et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2024). However, many of the known candidates have been shown to be subject to false positives due to stochastic quasar variability (e.g., Vaughan et al. 2016). Additionally, recent findings suggest that some AGNs may display periodic variations only at some specific epochs (e.g., Jiang et al. 2022; O’Neill et al. 2022) further enhance the difficulties of periodic searches. Furthermore, previous surveys were only sensitive to the most massive quasars at high redshift (z\gtrsim 2) which should have already gone through their major merger process (e.g., Shen 2009). Regardless of the process that imprints periodicity, it is generally accepted that the timescale is primarily determined by the binary orbital period. SMBHBs with masses between 10^{6}-10^{10} M_{\odot} and separations of 0.01 pc possess orbital periods that span from years to several decades, making them possibly detectable by current time-domain surveys. In addition to the optical band, the periodic searches have also been conducted in other wavelength regimes, such as in X-ray (Serafinelli et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) and gamma-ray bands (Sandrinelli et al., 2018; Holgado et al., 2018). Periodic infrared (IR) light curves are also expected as a result of reverberation mapping of the circumbinary dusty torus in periodic AGNs. However, the search for SMBHBs using IR data has not been extensively explored, despite the detection of an IR time lag in an individual SMBHB candidate (Jun et al., 2015), which highlights the potential of utilizing periodic IR light curves for SMBHB identification (D’Orazio & Haiman, 2017). The IR band not only provides an alternative approach to searching for SMBHBs but also offers distinct advantages. Firstly, IR photons are less susceptible to dust extinction, allowing them to penetrate through obscuring material, which is often abundant in galactic nuclear regions and galaxy merger systems. By extending the search to the IR wavelength range, we can uncover a population of SMBHB candidates that may have been previously overlooked, thereby expanding our knowledge of the prevalence and characteristics of these elusive systems. Even for unobscured AGNs, the variability amplitudes in the mid-IR band are typically larger compared to the optical band due to lower background contamination. Additionally, as discussed in D’Orazio & Haiman (2017), the dust-echo model can assist in determining the origin of central periodicity and place constraints on the physical characteristics of SMBHBs and their dust torus. To address this, we perform the first systematic search for SMBHB candidates via periodic IR light curves. The data we use come from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, Wright et al. 2010) and its successor NEOWISE (Mainzer et al., 2014), which have provided us with a public dataset from February 2010 to December 2023 with a half-year cadence except for a 2.5-year gap for each object. In this study, we primarily focus on sinusoidal periodic signals, which have been commonly adopted in modeling the optical light curves of SMBHB candidates (e.g., D’Orazio et al. 2015), and on modeling the IR light curves using the dust-echo model (D’Orazio & Haiman, 2017). The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the data and methods employed to search for IR periodic AGNs. Section 3 presents the search and corresponding analysis results, where we show compelling evidence demonstrating the highly improbable nature of these periodic light curves being generated by random processes. Section 4 compares selected candidates with normal AGNs and with previous studies that utilized optical light curves. Additionally, we discuss SDSS J140336.43+174136.1 as a candidate exhibiting periodic behavior in both optical and IR bands. Finally, we summarize the main results and suggest directions for future work in Section 5. We assume a cosmology with H_{0}=66.88 km s-1 Mpc-1, \Omega_{m}=0.32, and \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.68, adopted from Planck Collaboration et al. (2020)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06730v1,Proof of Shock-cloud interaction within parts of \gamma-Cygni region,"We reanalyze 15 yr data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in a region around supernova remnant (SNR) \gamma-Cygni from 100 MeV to 1 TeV, and find that the spectra of two extended sources associated with the southeast radio SNR arc and the TeV VERITAS source can be described well by single power-laws with photon indices of 2.149\pm 0.005 and 2.01\pm 0.06, respectively. Combining with high resolution gas observation results, we model the emission in the hadronic scenario, where the \gamma-ray emission could be interpreted as escaped CRs illuminating a surrounding Molecular Cloud (MC) plus an ongoing shock-cloud interaction component. In this scenario, the difference between these two GeV spectral indices is due to the different ratios of the MC mass between the escaped component and the trapped component in the two regions. We further analyze, in a potential pulsar halo region, the relationship between energy density \varepsilon_{\rm{e}}, spin-down power \dot{E}, and the \gamma-ray luminosity L_{\gamma} of PSR J2021+4026. Our results indicate that the existence of a pulsar halo is unlikely. On the other hand, considering the uncertainty on the SNR distance, the derived energy density \varepsilon_{\rm{e}} might be overestimated, thus the scenario of a SNR and a pulsar halo overlapping in the direction of the line of sight (LOS) cannot be ruled out.","The supernova remnant (SNR) \gamma-Cygni (G78.2+2.1) is known as a puzzling \gamma-ray source located in the complex Cygnus region. The multi-wavelength analysis towards it from radio to \gamma-ray have never ceased, while the origins of its \gamma-ray emission has remained unconfirmed. Ladouceur & Pineault (2008) revealed the radio flux spectral index \alpha_{v} varies between \sim 0.8 and \lesssim 0.4 across the SNR. The softest index is found in the bright south-eastern part, and the north-west part is harder (\sim 0.55) (MAGIC Collaboration et al., 2023). Near the center, there is an energetic GeV-bright pulsar PSR J2021+4026, for which it has been proved that the state and pulse profile vary (Wang et al., 2023; Razzano et al., 2023). Also, the unknown distances make the \gamma-ray emission in this region more puzzling. In the VHE energy band, VERITAS suggests a \sim 0.23\arcdeg extended source in the northwest part (Aliu et al., 2013), which is updated by an ellipse template (0.29\arcdeg\times 0.19\arcdeg) with photon index of 2.79 \pm 0.39_{\rm stat}\pm 0.20_{\rm sys} (Abeysekara et al., 2018), which location is roughly consistent with part of the MAGIC source, while inconsistent with 2HWC J2020+403 measured by HAWC (Abeysekara et al., 2017a). Furthermore, MAGIC Collaboration et al. (2023) found that there is a bright arc-like TeV source located on the west side outside the SNR, which is dim in the GeV band, and makes the origins of the \gamma-ray emission in this region even more puzzling. Pulsar halos are a new type of \gamma-ray sources identified in recent years. As Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWN) age, high-energy electrons and positrons may escape from the nebula and diffuse in the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM), after \gtrsim 100 kyr (Giacinti et al., 2020). The electrons and positrons diffusing out of the PWN produce \gamma-ray emission through Inverse Compton scattering of ambient photon fields (López-Coto et al., 2022). The recent detection of extended TeV emission around Geminga and Monogem(Abeysekara et al., 2017a, b), and the slow diffusion region around them, has sparked a widespread discussion about TeV halos. Di Mauro et al. (2020) argue that extended GeV emission can be measured with Fermi satellite around, while this is not confirmed by Xi et al. (2019). It is also noted that pulsar halos may exhibit an asymmetric morphology when the coherence length is large enough (López-Coto & Giacinti, 2018). However, limited by the resolution and systematic uncertainties, an asymmetric morphology of these pulsar halos has not been confirmed by experiments yet (Abeysekara et al., 2017b; H. E. S. S. Collaboration et al., 2023). In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the GeV \gamma-ray emission towards the \gamma-Cygni area, utilizing 15 years of data from the Fermi-LAT instrument. The photon events are selected in an energy range from 100 MeV to 1 TeV, and the results are presented in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, we presents the gas observation results of 12CO(J = 1-0) obtained from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP). Sect. 4 is dedicated to discussing potentially origins of the \gamma-ray emission, comparing multi-wavelength observations with theoretical expectations. Lastly, Sect. 5 provides our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06621v1,Pulsed and Polarized X-ray Emission from Neutron Star Surfaces,"The intense magnetic fields of neutron stars naturally lead to strong anisotropy and polarization of radiation emanating from their surfaces, both being sensitive to the hot spot position on the surface. Accordingly, pulse phase-resolved intensities and polarizations depend on the angle between the magnetic and spin axes and the observer’s viewing direction. In this paper, results are presented from a Monte Carlo simulation of neutron star atmospheres that uses a complex electric field vector formalism to treat polarized radiative transfer due to magnetic Thomson scattering. General relativistic influences on the propagation of light from the stellar surface to a distant observer are taken into account. The paper outlines a range of theoretical predictions for pulse profiles at different X-ray energies, focusing on magnetars and also neutron stars of lower magnetization. By comparing these models with observed intensity and polarization pulse profiles for the magnetar 1RXS J1708-40, and the light curve for the pulsar PSR J0821-4300, constraints on the stellar geometry angles and the size of putative polar cap hot spots are obtained.","Neutron stars are the most magnetic and among the most luminous compact objects in the Milky Way. Their pulsed steady X-ray emission enables the estimation of their surface field strengths, which for magnetars normally exceeds \,10^{14}\,Gauss. Soft X-ray pulsation is the telltale signature of non-uniform emission across a neutron star surface. This feature has been exploited by several groups to probe the size of the hot emission region(s), the value of the star’s magnetic inclination angle \,\alpha\, to rotation axis \,\boldsymbol{\Omega}\, in a dipolar field morphology, and the observer’s viewing direction angle \,\zeta\, relative to \,\boldsymbol{\Omega}\,. For instance, [Albano \BOthers. (\APACyear2010)] fit the pulse profiles of the magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216 (finding \,\alpha\sim 80^{\circ}\, and \,\zeta\sim 25^{\circ}\,), employing blackbody emission from the whole surface, and including gravitational light bending. With a similar construct, [Guillot \BOthers. (\APACyear2015)] found that a very small polar region with a temperature a factor of 6 larger than the equatorial zone is required to fit the single-peaked soft X-ray profile for the “low field magnetar” SGR 0418+572. For a non-magnetar example, [Gotthelf \BOthers. (\APACyear2010)] modeled the energy-dependent light curves of the pulsar PSR J0821-4300 in the supernova remnant Puppis A, finding that their best solution was for a quasi-orthogonal rotator viewed almost down the spin axis. Omitted from these and other similar studies are detailed treatments of local radiation anisotropy, which varies in atmospheres as the direction and magnitude of B changes across the stellar surface. 00footnotetext: Abbreviations: IXPE: Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer Figure 1: Left: Simulation geometry for transfer of photons through an atmospheric slab of Thomson optical depth \,\tau_{\hbox{\sixrm T}}\, with a normal direction along the \,z\, axis (zenith), and magnetic field putatively in the \,x-z\, plane, at an angle \,\theta_{\hbox{\fiverm B}}\, to the local zenith.

X-ray polarimetry enables a new dimension in diagnostic space. IXPE has delivered key polarization results for four magnetars in its sensitive 2-8 keV band. For 1RXS J1708-40, the pulse profile is single-peaked at 2-4 keV energies, and the polarization degree (PD) is anti-correlated with the intensity, while the polarization angle (PA) was the same at all energies (Zane \BOthers., \APACyear2023). This constant PA strongly contrasts the wide-ranging IXPE PA values seen in 4U 0142+61 between \,<4\,keV (where the PD is 14%) and \,>5.5\,keV (PD is 42%) energies (Taverna \BOthers., \APACyear2022). The \,90^{\circ}\, PA dichotomy is perhaps most naturally interpreted as the \,>5.5\, keV signal emanating from a coronal region where resonant cyclotron scattering of surface photons occurs. SGR 1806-20 provided a further puzzle, with significant PD levels of 40% only in the 4-5 keV window, and less than 5% below 4 keV, leading to the suggestion (Turolla \BOthers., \APACyear2023) that the thermal emission may originate in a condensed part of the star’s surface. In this paper, the influences that both the anisotropy and polarization of radiation emergent from NS surfaces imprint upon their pulsed soft X-ray signals are addressed. Our tool is a high fidelity, polarized radiative transfer code that is designed for treating neutron star atmospheres. It is applied to extended surface regions, with the radiation trajectories in the magnetosphere being modified by general relativity. Intensity and PD pulse profiles for a magnetar and a low-field pulsar are explored in two case studies that illustrate the codes efficacy."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06617v1,Deep drilling in the time domain with DECam II: characterizing the light curves of candidates in the extragalactic fields,"In this second paper on the DECam deep drilling field (DDF) program we release 2,020 optical gri-band light curves for transients and variables in the extragalactic COSMOS and ELAIS fields based on time series observations with a 3-day cadence from semester 2021A through 2023A. In order to demonstrate the wide variety of time domain events detected by the program and encourage others to use the data set, we characterize the sample by presenting a brief analysis of the light curve parameters such as time span, amplitude, and peak brightness. We also present preliminary light curve categorizations, and identify potential stellar variables, active galactic nuclei, tidal disruption events, supernovae (such as Type Ia, Type IIP, superluminous, and gravitationally lensed supernovae), and fast transients. Where relevant, the number of identified transients is compared to the predictions of the original proposal. We also discuss the challenges of analyzing DDF data in the context of the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its Legacy Survey of Space and Time, which will include DDFs. Images from the DECam DDF program are available without proprietary period and the light curves presented in this work are publicly available for analysis.","The term ""deep drilling"" refers to an astronomical survey strategy in which a specific area of sky, typically a small field or the field-of-view of the telescope being used, is observed repeatedly with high frequency (""drilled"") to detect time-variable sources and to build up depth by stacking the sequence of images. This strategy is especially well-suited to explorations of the faint, fast, and high-redshift (high-z) universe of Galactic and extragalactic transients and variables. Two of the most well known modern optical deep fields are the Hubble Deep and Ultra Deep fields. Even without the ""drilling"" component and just two to five epochs of observations, high-z supernovae111Granted, high-z SNe can be found without the ”drilling” component as they last for weeks to months in the rest frame and benefit from an extended visibility window thanks to cosmological time dilation. (SNe) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) were discovered and analyzed (e.g., Blakeslee et al., 2003; Sarajedini et al., 2003; Strolger et al., 2004; Strolger & Riess, 2006). Ground-based time-domain surveys also began obtaining deep observations of small-area fields with low cadence (weeks or more between observations) to find high-redshift SNe (e.g., Barris et al., 2004; Poznanski et al., 2007). The first optical multi-band time-domain survey that could be considered to employ a ""deep drilling"" strategy was the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), which was based on the four one-square-degree Deep fields of the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) Legacy Survey (CFHTLS; e.g., Astier et al. 2006). At the time, the CFHTLS Deep field survey was referred to as a ""rolling search"" to represent how the multi-band observations were repeated frequently and continuously over the months when each of the four Deep fields was accessible. The rolling nature of the SNLS led to better characterizations for Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves, especially at early times, which in turn led to more efficient use of the limited resources for spectroscopic follow-up (Sullivan et al., 2006) and better constraints on any cosmological evolution in the SN Ia light curves (Conley et al., 2006). More recent examples of deep, well-cadenced time-domain optical imaging surveys include the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (Tonry et al., 2012) and the Dark Energy Survey Supernova program (DES-SN; Kessler et al., 2015). In the near future, the 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) executed by the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory will include at least five deep fields with a multi-band ""deep drilling"" strategy, along with its wide-area time-domain coverage of the southern sky (Ivezić et al., 2019; Bianco et al., 2022). At the time of this publication the strategy had yet to be finalized, but proposals included, e.g., an hour-long series of \sim 30 second exposures for a single 9.6 deg2 field which rotates through the griz filters and is repeated every 2-3 nights for a few months (Ivezić et al., 2019), or a combination of rolling surveys in ultradeep fields (z<1.1) with a high cadence for a limited number of seasons and in deep fields (z<0.7) with a three-night cadence every season (Gris et al., 2024). Regardless of the exact strategy adopted, the LSST deep drilling fields will provide unprecedented access to time-domain astrophysics on timescales of minutes to days, and by stacking the nightly sequences will provide access to the faint and high-z variable and transient universe. In order to prepare for the LSST era of time domain astronomy a new deep drilling program with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam; DePoy et al., 2008) began in 2021. The survey strategy, processing pipelines, and the first two semesters of data was presented in Graham et al. (2023). In this work, we present and make a preliminary analysis of the first five semesters of data for the two extragalactic deep drilling fields (DDFs) and release 2,020 light curves in the gri filters. The main goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the data available, and to encourage and enable public use. In Section 2 we describe the observations and how objects were detected and measured in difference images; the construction of nightly-epoch light curves from the difference image photometry; how we cross-matched to other transient- and static-sky catalogs of the extragalactic DDFs; and where these results are publicly accessible. In Section 3 we make preliminary classifications for potential variables and transients, and illustrate the difference-image photometry that is available by showing a variety of representative light curves. Full photometric classification with, e.g., template fits, machine learning algorithms, or direct-image photometry is beyond the scope of this paper and left for future work. In Section 4 we conclude and describe future planned work for the DECam DDF, which restarted observations in the 2024A semester."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06440v1,A neutrino flare associated with X-ray emission from TDE ATLAS17jrp,"Tidal disruption events (TDEs), where stars are captured or tidally disrupted by supermassive black holes, are potential sources of high-energy neutrinos. We report the discovery of a potential neutrino flare that is spatially and temporally associated with X-ray emission from TDE ATLAS17jrp. The best-fit spectrum of the neutrino flare follows a power-law with an index of \rm{\gamma=2.7\pm 0.4} and a flux normalization of \rm{\Phi_{0}=1.7^{+6.3}_{-1.5}\times 10^{-18}\;GeV^{-1}cm^{-2}s^{-1}} at 100 TeV based on an analysis of 10-year track data from IceCube, and the flare duration is 61 days. We calculate that the probability of this association occurring by chance is 0.17\%. Therefore, ATLAS17jrp is the second TDE (not including candidates) associated with high-energy neutrinos, following TDE AT2019dsg associated with an IceCube neutrino alert. This association can be attributed to the interaction of X-ray photons produced by the hot corona with high-energy particles accelerated by disk winds or outflows, resulting in the production of neutrinos.","IceCube first detected astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range in 2013, opening a new window for astrophysics and particle physics (Aartsen et al., 2013, 2014). Neutrinos interact weakly with matter and magnetic fields during their journey to Earth, offering crucial insights into the extreme environments of their cosmic sources (Abbasi et al., 2023). This characteristic highlights the importance of neutrinos in demonstrating the feasibility of multi-messenger astrophysics for pinpointing the origins of cosmic rays (Ahlers & Halzen, 2017; Guépin et al., 2022; Murase & Bartos, 2019). High-energy astrophysical neutrinos are primarily produced through hadronic processes via the interaction between the accelerated protons and dense matter or \gamma-rays in the source or in the surround environment, and probably further produce secondary particles and photons. Therefore, identifying the association between electromagnetic counterparts and neutrinos is an effective approach to tracing origins of astrophysical neutrinos. Electromagnetic follow-up observations of IceCube real-time neutrino alerts have identified several candidate sources, which exhibit spatial and temporal associations with high-energy neutrino events. TDE AT2019dsg, TDE candidate AT2019fdr and AT2019aalc have been identified as temporally and spatially coincident with high-energy neutrinos IC191001A (Stein et al., 2021), IC200530A (Reusch et al., 2022a), and IC191119A (van Velzen et al., 2024), respectively, via the follow-up observations by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, Bellm et al., 2019). Recently, Yuan et al. (2024a) revealed that the super-bright TDE candidate AT2021lwx, similar to these three neutrino emitting TDEs, may have a delayed neutrino counterpart. Furthermore, Jiang et al. (2023) reported two cases of associations between neutrino alerts and TDE candidates from the sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies (MIRONG). These investigations suggest that TDEs are likely to be an important class of neutrino sources. TDEs are among the brightest transients in the optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavelengths, lasting from several months to years. They occur when a star comes close to a supermassive black hole and is disrupted by tidal forces (Rees, 1988; Phinney, 1989; Evans & Kochanek, 1989; Cannizzo et al., 1990). Typical features proposed in TDE models include accretion disks (Hayasaki & Yamazaki, 2019), coronae (Reusch et al., 2022b), sub-relativistic outflows or winds (Fang et al., 2020), and potentially jets and dust tours (Wang et al., 2011; Wang & Liu, 2016; Dai & Fang, 2017; Lunardini & Winter, 2017; Dai et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2024b). High-energy astrophysical neutrinos are typically produced by accelerated cosmic rays interacting with target photons or dense matters. In the TDE, high energy cosmic rays can be accelerated in coronae, jets, disks, and winds (Murase et al., 2020b), and produce high energy neutrinos via interacting with thermal optical-ultraviolet (OUV), infrared (IR), X-ray photons or the surrounding matters. Winter & Lunardini (2023a) presented time-dependent interpretations for the three TDEs associated with alert events discovered by ZTF, and proposed three models in which X-ray, OUV, and IR photons serve as target photons for hadronic processes. Subsequent multi-messenger diagnoses, taking into account the accompanying electromagnetic emissions, indicate the consistency of this model with the X-ray and \gamma-ray constraints (Yuan & Winter, 2023). Notably, delayed IR emissions from dust echos and prolonged p\gamma interaction times in the region near the dust torus naturally explain the time delay between the neutrino arrival time and the optical peak of the TDE light curve. ATLAS17jrp (Wang et al., 2022; Onori et al., 2022) is a TDE, exhibiting exceptionally bright emissions across OUV, X-ray, and IR wavelengths. Most optical-selected TDEs are weak in the infrared (Jiang et al., 2021a), while most infrared-selected candidates are optically faint (Jiang et al., 2021b), and optical-selected TDEs often lack bright X-ray emissions (Guolo et al., 2024). In contrast, ATLAS17jrp stands out due to its multi-wavelength brightness, providing a uniquely clean and comprehensive dataset for the study of TDEs and neutrino physics. In this work, we utilize time-dependent analysis to identify the neutrino flare signal associated with the electromagnetic emission from TDE ATLAS17jrp. Using 10-year muon-track data released by IceCube (Abbasi et al., 2021), we identify a neutrino flare that is spatially and temporally coincident with the X-ray emission from TDE ATLAS17jrp. In Section 2, we introduce the observation data for ATLAS17jrp and the muon-track data from IceCube. In Section 3, we present a time-dependent analysis method for the search of neutrino flares and the searching result. In Section 4, we provide a multi-messenger model to fit the neutrino spectrum and multi-wavelength observations. We discuss the implication of our results in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06366v1,SMBH binary candidate PKS J2134-0153: Possible multi-band periodic variability and inter-band time lags,"Studying the periodic flux-variation behavior of blazars is vital for probing supermassive black hole binaries and the kinematics of relativistic jets. In this work, we report the detection of the multi-band possible periodic variations of the blazar PKS J2134-0153, including the infrared (1.6(\pm 0.4)\times 10^{3} days) and optical (1.8(\pm 1)\times 10^{3} days). The periods in the infrared and optical bands are statistically consistent with the period in the radio band (P_{\mathrm{Radio}}=1760\pm 33 days, obtained from our previous work). Moreover, flux variations in different bands are correlated with evident inter-band time delays, and the time lags of infrared and optical emission with respect to radio emission are (3.3\pm 2.3)\times 10^{2} days and (3.0\pm 2.3)\times 10^{2} days, respectively. The cross-correlations indicate a common origin of radio, infrared, and optical emission. The relative positions between emission regions of infrared and optical emission to radio emission are estimated according to the time lags, i.e., 0.37\pm 0.26 pc and 0.33\pm 0.26 pc. The relative distances seem to be quantitatively consistent with the theoretical prediction.","Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) emit strong non-stellar emission in the Universe. Blazars are an important subclass of radio-loud AGNs, whose relativistic jets point towards our Earth. Blazars emit a broad range emission from radio to \gamma-ray (e.g., Urry & Padovani, 1995; Ulrich et al., 1997). The central engines of blazars are often difficult to be resolved directly because of their small physical scales and the large distance from Earth (i.e., the high redshift); their corresponding angular scales are too small to resolve by current facilities. The multi-band light variations offer an alternative possibility to resolve the central engine in the time domain (e.g., Blandford, 1996; Fan et al., 1998). The flux variations provide valuable insights into various aspects of blazar studies, including structures, physical parameters of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, with masses larger than 10^{6}\ M_{\odot}), and emission processes (e.g., Ulrich et al., 1997; Gupta, 2018). For instance, the minimum variability timescale (minutes to hours) can effectively constrain the emission-region sizes of blazars. Combined with theoretical models and measured time lags between two different light curves via the reverberation mapping (RM) technique (e.g., Blandford & McKee, 1982), one can constrain physical parameters of the relativistic jets, e.g., the magnetic field (e.g., Tavecchio et al., 1998). Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which includes two orbiting SMBHs, are fascinating sources. The merging of SMBHBs produces gravitational waves (GW; e.g., Thorne & Braginskii, 1976; Haehnelt, 1994; Jaffe & Backer, 2003; Dou et al., 2022) detectable by low-frequency GW experiments (e.g., PTA - Hobbs et al. 2010; LISA - Amaro-Seoane et al. 2023). Spatially correlated signals consistent with the ultra-low-frequency GW background are detected by the pulsar timing arrays (e.g., Agazie et al., 2023; EPTA Collaboration et al., 2023; Reardon et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023). Although searching SMBHBs is attractive, the direct identification of close SMBHBs (< 1 pc) is highly challenging because of the angular resolution limit of current telescopes (e.g., Dou et al., 2022). Searching for periodicity in multi-band light curves is an attractive method for identifying SMBHB candidates. Year-like periodic flux variations can probe the presence of SMBHB systems (e.g., Begelman et al., 1980; Lehto & Valtonen, 1996; King et al., 2013; Ackermann et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Bon et al., 2016; Charisi et al., 2016; Severgnini et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Kovačević et al., 2020; Zhang & Wang, 2022; Kun et al., 2023). A notable example is OJ 287, which shows a quasi 12-year periodicity in its light curves (e.g., Valtonen et al., 2006, 2008; Gupta et al., 2022; Sinitsyna & Sinitsyna, 2022; Valtonen et al., 2024). This periodicity is explained by a SMBHB system where the secondary SMBH crosses the accretion disk of the primary SMBH, leading to the observed quasi-periodic variations (e.g., Dey et al., 2018). The quasi-periodic behavior over year-like timescales can be explained by models with jet precession (e.g., Romero et al., 2000; Stirling et al., 2003; Caproni, Abraham, & Monteiro, 2013) or helical jets (e.g., Conway & Murphy, 1993; Tateyama et al., 1998; Mohan & Mangalam, 2015). In the SMBHB scenario, the jet precession is driven by the gravitational torque from the secondary black hole in the misaligned orbits and the intrinsic helical jet structure could be driven by a coiled magnetic field (e.g., Vlahakis & Königl, 2004; Miller et al., 2006). As a result, the viewing angle between the observer and the jet changes periodically, which is responsible for the observed periodic variations (e.g., Villata & Raiteri, 1999). It should be noted that the jet precession may happen in single SMBH system. According to the disk-driven precession model (e.g., Sarazin et al., 1980; Lu, 1990; Lu & Zhou, 2005), the misalignment between the SMBH’s spin axis and the accretion disk and the Lense-Thirring effect makes the inner disk and the jet precess. The periods produced by this model are often much longer than ten years (more details, see Section 5.1). Hence, it is important to find AGNs that show short-period (less than several years) periodic flux variations. A number of works have been devoted to identifying SMBHB candidates via periodic variations. Graham et al. (2015) reported a possible close supermassive black-hole binary in PG 1302-102 with optical periodicity (the period is P=1,884\pm 88 days, but also see Liu, Gezari, & Miller, 2018, questioning this source). Sesana et al. (2018) selected 111 SMBH binary candidates from approximately 250,000 quasar light curves observed by the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) due to their potentially periodic nature. Bhatta (2018) proposed that the blazar, J1043+2408, is an SMBH binary candidate because of the periodic flux variation. Li et al. (2018) reported a \sim 6.1 year quasi-periodicity of the blazar S5 0716+714, which is also a SMBH binary candidate. Serafinelli et al. (2020) found that the Seyfert 1.5 galaxy Mrk 915 emerges as a candidate SMBHB from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) 105-month light curves of 553 AGNs. In our previous work, we reported a \sim4.69 years period in the radio-band light curve of BL Lac PKS J2134-0153 (Ren et al. 2021; hereafter R21; see also O’Neill et al. 2022; hereafter ON22), and we speculate that this is a close SMBH binary candidate with a small orbital separation of \sim 0.006 pc. In this work, we report the multi-wavelength (including the infrared, optical, and \gamma-ray) study of PKS J2134-0153. We also find inter-band correlations with evident time delays. Hence, we also constrain the emission-region sizes of PKS J2134-0153. This manuscript is formatted as follows. In Section 2, we describe the multi-band light curves of PKS J2134-0153. In Section 3, we introduce the data analysis methods. In Section 4, we present the results. In Section 5, we give the discussions. Conclusions are made in Section 6. Throughout this paper, a \LambdaCDM cosmological model with \Omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.27, \Omega_{\mathrm{\Lambda}}=0.73, H_{\mathrm{0}}=70\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}} is adopted for calculating the luminosity distance."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06351v1,A shock crashing into confined dense circumstellar matter brightens the nascent SN 2023ixf,"Red supergiants may experience a short-lived period of episodic mass loss rather than steady winds before their core collapses, leading to dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Interaction of SN ejecta with such nearby CSM can generate additional radiation, appending to the cooling radiation from the shock breakout of the progenitor envelope, to brighten the nascent SN explosion. This phenomenon is conspicuous for SN 2023ixf as its V-band brightness showed a rapid increase of about three magnitudes from the first to the third day after the explosion, which is distinctive among type II SNe with flash ionized signatures. In this paper, we employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate the radiative diffusion process in the unshocked CSM. Considering a wide range of mass-loss rates from 10^{-5} to 10^{-2} M⊙ yr-1, we found that the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf can be fitted by the interaction of the SN ejecta with a CSM having a mass-loss rate of about 10^{-2} M⊙ yr-1 located within 10^{15} cm to the progenitor.","When massive stars deplete their nuclear fuel, the collapse of the core creates an explosive event known as core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Several pre-explosion detections support the scenario that red supergiants (RSGs) are the progenitor of type II SNe with plateau-shaped light curves (e.g., Smartt 2009). Thanks to the wide-field optical survey programs and the fast-responding spectroscopically follow-up observations, a relatively large fraction of type II SNe were found to display short-lived narrow emission lines in their early-phase spectra (Gal-Yam et al., 2014; Khazov et al., 2016; Yaron et al., 2017; Hosseinzadeh et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020; Bruch et al., 2021; Tartaglia et al., 2021). These emission lines arise from the recombination of the highly ionized gas in the compact circumstellar matter (CSM) due to the emerging shock breakout (Kochanek, 2019). Apart from the cooling radiation of the shock breakout, the subsequent interaction between the ejecta and the nearby CSM could also generate additional radiation, resulting in an early-phase fast-rising light curve relating to a scenario of an RSG embedded in the dense confined CSM. SN 2023ixf, a type II SN exploded in Messier 101 (M101) (Itagaki, 2023) and was serendipitously captured by amateur astronomers; this provides a crucial chance for constraining the SN progenitor systems. The intra-night observations of SN 2023ixf over the first few days since the discovery delineate the early-phase evolution of its ionized flash signatures. The narrow emission lines from the recombination of the ionized gas rapidly decrease and mostly disappear a week later, suggesting the existence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to the progenitor star (Bostroem et al., 2023; Hiramatsu et al., 2023; Jacobson-Galán et al., 2023; Smith et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). Pre-explosion archival images from the HST and the Spitzer Space Telescope indicate that the progenitor of SN 2023ixf is an RSG with a dusty environment and it experienced eruptive or episodic mass loss shortly before the explosion (Dong et al., 2023; Jencson et al., 2023; Kilpatrick et al., 2023; Soraisam et al., 2023; Neustadt et al., 2024; Xiang et al., 2024). Therefore, SN 2023ixf is an excellent example to investigate the mass-loss history of massive stars before core collapse. M101 is an attractive target to amateur astronomers who monitor it frequently, leading to the first detection of SN 2023ixf about one day earlier than the discovery (Mao et al., 2023). These rare chromatic images recorded the radiation from the shock breakout of the RSG envelope and exhibited a color redder than the typical model predictions. Li et al. (2024) suggest that there is time-variant extinction due to the sublimation of circumstellar dust during the spherical phase of the shock breakout. On the other hand, shock cooling and the ejecta-CSM interaction contribute to the radiation a few days after the explosion, resulting in the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf (Li et al., 2024; Zimmerman et al., 2024). In this paper, we focus on the ejecta-CSM interaction process to fit the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf. Section 2 describes our Monte Carlo method to simulate the radiative diffusion process in the unshocked CSM, and Section 3 displays the results. The discussions and conclusions are given in Section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05977v1,Simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of the transitional millisecond pulsar candidate 3FGL J1544.6-1125,"Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) are neutron-star systems that alternate between a rotation-powered radio millisecond pulsar state and an accretion-disk-dominated low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB)-like state on multi-year timescales. During the LMXB-like state, the X-ray emission from tMSPs switches between ‘low’ and ‘high’ X-ray brightness modes on a timescale of seconds to minutes (or longer), while the radio emission shows variability on timescales of roughly minutes. Coordinated VLA and Chandra observations of the nearby tMSP PSR J1023+0038 uncovered a clear anti-correlation between radio and X-ray luminosities such that the radio emission consistently peaks during the X-ray low modes. In addition, there are sometimes also radio/X-ray flares that show no obvious correlation. In this paper, we present simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of a promising tMSP candidate system, 3FGL J1544.6-1125, which shows optical, \gamma-ray, and X-ray phenomena similar to PSR J1023+0038, but which is challenging to study because of its greater distance. Using simultaneous VLA and Chandra observations we find that the radio and X-ray emission are consistent with being anti-correlated in a manner similar to PSR J1023+0038. We discuss how our results help in understanding the origin of bright radio emission from tMSPs. The greater sensitivity of upcoming telescopes like the Square Kilometre Array will be crucial for studying the correlated radio/X-ray phenomena of tMSP systems.","Fast-spinning, rotation-powered millisecond pulsars (RMSPs) are valuable laboratories for fundamental physics experiments (e.g., gravity tests Kramer et al. 2021; Archibald et al. 2018; constraining the equation-of-state of dense matter Demorest et al. 2010; and low-frequency gravitational wave studies Agazie et al. 2023). Understanding the origin of RMSPs is, thus, of great importance as it can provide insights into the minimal rotational period they can attain, their maximum mass, and the evolution of their magnetic field. The prevalent theory for the origin of RMSPs is the pulsar recycling mechanism (Alpar et al., 1982a; Radhakrishnan & Srinivasan, 1982). In this scenario, an old (spun-down) pulsar can be rejuvenated and spun-up to millisecond rotational periods through the transfer of angular momentum and mass via disk-fed accretion from the low-mass binary companion star — during the low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) phase of its evolution. This scenario was supported by the discovery of accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars (AMXPs; see Wijnands & van der Klis 1998) — systems that exhibit coherent X-ray pulsations, which illustrated that material from the accretion disk was being channelled directly onto the magnetic polar caps of the neutron star). Moreover, in the last decade three systems — PSR J1023+0038, hereafter J1023 (Archibald et al., 2009; Stappers et al., 2014); PSR J1824-2452I (also known as M28I; Papitto et al. 2013), and PSR J1227-4853 (also known as XSS J12270-4859; Bassa et al. 2014) — have been observed to transition between accretion-disk-dominated LMXB-like and disk-free RMSP states on timescales of months to years, directly confirming the evolutionary link between LMXBs and RMSPs. These systems are thus called transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs). Since 2013, XSS J12270-4859 and M28I have remained in the RMSP state, while J1023 has persisted in the LMXB-like state. The LMXB-like state of the three known tMSPs is quite different from that of typical Galactic LMXBs with black hole (BH) or neutron star (NS) primaries. Firstly, tMSPs are the only X-ray binaries known to be bright \gamma-ray emitters. Secondly, two tMSPs — J1023 and XSS J12270-4859 — have been observed to stay in the intermediate X-ray luminosity regime with L_{\mathrm{X}}\sim 10^{32-34} erg s-1 for years (similar L_{\mathrm{X}} to that of very faint X-ray transients; Wijnands et al. 2006), while the majority of known BH and NS-LMXBs reside in either of two states: (i) an active accretion state, called an X-ray outburst (with X-ray luminosities of L_{\mathrm{X}}>10^{36} erg s-1) or (ii) a little-to-no accretion state, called X-ray quiescence (L_{\mathrm{X}}<10^{32} erg s-1). Only one out of three confirmed tMSPs, M28I, has ever been observed to reach a luminosity typical of outbursting LMXBs (Papitto et al., 2013). In their intermediate X-ray luminosity state (often called the sub-luminous X-ray state), the X-ray emission of J1023 (Archibald et al., 2015) and XSS J12270-4859 (de Martino et al., 2013) have shown peculiar moding behaviour111It is worth noting that the X-ray lightcurve of M28I obtained at similar intermediate luminosities is also bimodal (Linares et al., 2014), but the duty cycles of the high and low modes are much longer (several hours).: they exhibit a bi-stable X-ray light curve (see Figure 11) characterised by rapid switching between X-ray ‘low’ (L_{\mathrm{X}}\sim 5\times 10^{32} erg s-1) and ‘high’ modes (L_{\mathrm{X}}\sim 5\times 10^{34} erg s-1) on minutes timescales. Occasional flares are also seen, with X-ray luminosities reaching up to L_{\mathrm{X}}\sim 3\times 10^{34} erg s-1. This moding is also seen in optical (Shahbaz et al., 2015) and UV (Jaodand et al., 2021a; Miraval Zanon et al., 2022) lightcurves of tMSPs and is a unique feature of tMSPs among NS- and BH-LMXBs, although a similar moding behaviour was recently observed in an accreting white dwarf system with longer timescales (from 30 minutes to hours; Scaringi et al. 2022). All three tMSP systems show coherent X-ray pulsations in their LMXB-like state. In the case of J1023 and XSS J12270-4859 these pulsations (at the 1.69-ms spin period in both systems) have been observed at much lower X-ray luminosities (L_{\mathrm{X}}\sim1033 erg s-1; Archibald et al. 2015) than previously observed in other AMXPs. In both J1023 and XSS J12270-4859 coherent X-ray pulsations were only detected in the high X-ray mode and appear to switch off during the low X-ray mode. In J1023 they were also detected in the UV (Jaodand et al., 2021a; Miraval Zanon et al., 2022) and optical (Ambrosino et al., 2017) bands, again only in the high X-ray mode,222Optical pulsation were also detected in J1023 with reduced flux during X-ray flares (Papitto et al., 2019). and appear to be exceptionally stable (the same pulse profile persisting for years). Long-term X-ray timing of J1023 (Jaodand et al., 2016; Burtovoi et al., 2020) showed that its rotation period is slowing down in its LMXB-like state and its spin-down is actually enhanced (by 4%, compared to the RMSP state) possibly because of negative torques on the neutron star from accretion material being ‘propeller-ed’ away and because the radio pulsar mechanism is still active despite the presence of the accretion disk (Coti Zelati et al., 2014). 1.1 Radio and X-ray observations of LMXBs It is now clear that the behaviour of the accreting matter in tMSPs during their persistent intermediate X-ray luminosity state differs significantly from what is seen in other types of LMXBs. The X-ray outbursts of Galactic LMXBs can be detected across all wavelengths, with high energies (optical, UV and X-rays) mostly (but not exclusively) originating from the accretion inflow (the accreting disk and corona) and low energy (mm and radio) originating from the accretion outflow (e.g., a collimated jet, wind or discrete outflow ejecta). Multi-wavelength observations are an effective way to trace the interaction between the in-falling and out-flowing accretion matter in LMXBs (Corbel et al., 2003; Fender et al., 2004; Migliari & Fender, 2006; Russell et al., 2006). The radio emission of BH-LMXBs behaves mostly in a predictable way. At lower luminosities, during quiescence or in the early part of outburst, BH-LMXBs are in a hard X-ray state (associated with the truncated accretion disk). During this state the radio emission is believed to originate from the optically thick collimated jet of accelerated out-flowing particles: it has a flat radio to mm spectrum (\alpha\sim 0) where S_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\alpha} and its radio luminosity scales as a power law with the X-ray luminosity (and thus mass accretion rate) of the binary L_{\mathrm{R}}\proptoL_{\mathrm{X}}0.59 (Corbel et al., 2003; Gallo et al., 2018) over many orders of magnitude333This correlation holds for ‘standard track’ BH-LMXBs such as V404 Cyg and GX 339-4, whereas the so-called ‘outlier’ sources (such as H1743-322 Coriat et al. 2011 and Swift J1753.5-0127 Plotkin et al. 2017) follow a steeper correlation near the peak of their outbursts, but break to move horizontally back to the standard track near quiescence. down to quiescent levels (see black dots in Figure 10). In the soft X-ray state (associated with dominant X-ray emission coming from a bright accretion disk that extends close to the primary) the radio emission is usually undetected, as the radio jet appears to switch off and detach during the hard-to-soft state transition (Russell et al., 2020). Around this time, optically thin (steep spectrum) radio flares may be detected, which are associated with discrete jet ejections around the transition from the hard to soft state. In contrast, the radio emission behaviour of NS-LMXBs appears to be much more complex. Firstly, NS-LMXBs are on average about 20 times fainter in radio than their BH counterparts (e.g. Migliari & Fender, 2006; Gallo et al., 2018) and display a much broader scatter in radio luminosities (Gusinskaia et al., 2020) at the same L_{\mathrm{X}}. This difference cannot be explained by differences in the mass of the primary star alone. In the past decade, substantial effort was put into studying the radio emission from NS-LMXBs with the number of radio/X-ray measurements having increased by almost an order of magnitude (Tudor et al., 2017; van den Eijnden et al., 2021; Panurach et al., 2021), mostly thanks to the increased sensitivity of available radio interferometers, such as the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and MeerKAT. Nonetheless, a substantial fraction of NS radio measurements are upper limits (more than 60% for L_{\mathrm{X}}<10^{36} erg s-1), which underlines that we do not yet have the capabilities to study the faintest NS jets. Moreover, it should be noted that most systems are only observed once or twice and such measurements provide limited to no insight into how the radio emission evolves over a large X-ray luminosity range. From what we see now, there is no single model that can explain the production of radio emission in all classes of accreting neutron stars. The two classes that stand out the most are highly magnetised NSs and tMSPs, with the former being statistically fainter (van den Eijnden et al., 2021) and the latter being statistically brighter (Gallo et al., 2018) than the rest. The less-magnetised NS-LXMBs show radio/X-ray behaviour similar to that of BH-LMXBs but with fainter radio jets in the hard X-ray state and less pronounced jet quenching in the soft X-ray state (Gusinskaia et al., 2017; van den Eijnden et al., 2021). Given the observational limitations pointed out above, it is not clear whether there is a single L_{\mathrm{R}}/L_{\mathrm{X}} correlation for NS-LMXBs as found for BH-LMXBs. Nonetheless, using the available observational data, Gallo et al. (2018) proposed the shallower (compared to BHs) correlation L_{\mathrm{R}}\proptoL_{\mathrm{X}}0.44 for less-magnetised NS-LMXBs. The low luminosities of the radio counterparts of NS-LMXBs, together with the limited sensitivity of current instruments, prevent good measurements of the spectral and polarimetric properties of their radio emission. This complicates the study of the origin of the radio emission from NS-LXMBs (i.e., distinguishing between a collimated jet, a wind, or another type of outflow). Furthermore, and relevant for the present study, most previous L_{\mathrm{R}}/L_{\mathrm{X}} measurements are done in a quasi-simultaneous way (observations in the two bands may be up to three days apart). While this methodology can be justified for many LMXBs that do not seem to exhibit short-term variability, quasi-simultaneous observations are insufficient for studying more complex and rapid accretion inflow-outflow interactions (e.g., Tetarenko et al. 2021), and tMSPs are the most obvious example of this issue.

Initially, tMSPs were targeted in much the same way as other LMXBs: via quasi-simultaneous X-ray and radio observations. This revealed that all three tMSPs are active radio sources in their accretion-disk-dominated LMXB-like state with radio emission being consistent with a compact, partially self-absorbed synchrotron jet (similar to what is often observed in other LMXBs). However, tMSPs tend to be much brighter in the radio than other NS-LMXBs, with radio luminosities comparable to those of BH-LMXBs (Deller et al., 2015). On closer inspection, the radio emission of J1023 in its sub-luminous X-ray state was observed to be rapidly variable (by a factor of a few on minutes timescales), while its flat radio spectrum was still consistent with an optically thick radio jet. Currently, the only tMSP that is in an LMXB-like state is J1023. Thus, most of our knowledge about the complex behaviour of tMSPs comes from extensive follow-up studies of this single system. Bogdanov et al. (2018) performed a 5-hr-long, strictly simultaneous Chandra and VLA observation of J1023 that revealed that its variable radio emission also exhibits modes of high and low flux density and that they are strongly anti-correlated with the low modes of J1023’s X-ray light curve. During each one of the nine low X-ray modes captured in that observational campaign, the radio flux density rapidly increased by a factor of a few at the start of the low X-ray mode and returned to its original level at the end of the X-ray low mode. Additional radio flaring was also observed in the 5-hr radio lightcurve of J1023: one flare that seems to be related to an X-ray flare and multiple ‘orphan’ radio flares that have no X-ray counterpart and occur during the X-ray high mode. More extensive multi-wavelength campaigns have been carried out to study this complex modality of J1023’s emission (Jaodand et al. 2021a; Baglio et al. 2023), revealing that J1023 is ‘moding’ at nearly all wavelengths and X-ray modes are correlated all the way from hard X-rays to UV wavelengths and switch to being anti-correlated from mm waves to radio. The simultaneous multi-wavelength observational campaigns on J1023 (Bogdanov et al., 2018; Baglio et al., 2023) also uncovered intriguing spectral behaviour of its radio emission. During the radio mode flaring, the high radio frequencies clearly lead the low frequencies — typical for an expanding, synchrotron-emitting plasma. A joint analysis of all the X-ray low modes shows that the average spectral index evolves from optically thick to thin from the first to the second half of an X-ray low mode (\alpha_{1}=0.67\pm 0.12 to \alpha_{2}=-0.27\pm 0.05), indicating an evolving synchrotron spectrum. More puzzling is the fact that the duration of the X-ray low mode matches that of the radio flare. This is most straightforwardly explained if there is a causal connection between the ejected plasma and events at the inner edge of the accretion disk (and the magnetosphere of the NS). The classic collimated jet-like outflow (a common interpretation of radio emission from NS-LMXBs) would not have a sufficiently fast reaction time to match the X-ray mode switches so closely. Baglio et al. (2023) suggest that the radio emission from J1023 originates from two separate mechanisms: (i) an optically thick jet that is active at all times and is responsible for the radio emission visible during the high X-ray modes, and (ii) discrete mass ejections in the low X-ray modes that are caused by rapid stripping and expulsion of the inner-most material of the accretion disk. Those ejections, however, cannot explain the ‘orphan’ radio flares that occur during the high X-ray modes. An alternative scenario, proposed by Bogdanov et al. (2018), involves an active radio pulsar: the radio flares are attributed to the expulsion of plasma from the pulsar’s magnetosphere or the inflation of a short-lived compact pulsar wind nebula. In both cases, it is still unknown what can cause such rapid changes in or near the magnetosphere of the NS. Understanding the mechanisms behind the unusual outflow behaviour of tMSPs can bring valuable insights into how the NS magnetosphere interacts with the inflowing accreting matter, providing more context for the pulsar recycling scenario (Alpar et al., 1982b). However, most of what we know about the radio emission of tMSPs comes from only one system (J1023), and the question remains whether this behaviour is common to all tMSPs or the peculiarities of this individual system. Multiple properties of tMSPs that happen to be unique to this class (X-ray moding, \gamma-ray counterpart, etc.) make it easier to identify new systems that are potential tMSP candidates (Jaodand et al., 2018). The most straightforward way of identifying such candidates is the cross-association of Fermi \gamma-ray sources with known X-ray sources. A handful of sources have been found in this way and most of them indeed appear to be rapidly variable X-ray sources with similar intermediate X-ray luminosities (Papitto & de Martino, 2022). A few strong X-ray/\gamma-ray candidates have been followed up with multi-wavelength X-ray and radio campaigns to investigate their accretion inflow-outflow interactions, all displaying a complex, variable behaviour in both radio and X-ray. CXOU J110926.4-650224, as reported by Coti Zelati et al. (2019), shows clear X-ray moding light curves with high, low and flare X-ray modes. The radio counterpart of this source is undetected at high radio frequencies (5.5 and 9 GHz) with ATCA (Coti Zelati et al., 2019, 2021), but MeerKAT observations at low frequencies (\sim 1.28 GHz) revealed its bright radio counterpart (33 \muJy on average, with up to 266 \muJy flares; Coti Zelati et al. 2021), with radio luminosities comparable to those of BH-LMXBs and consistent with those of other tMSPs (see Figure 10). The observed variable radio flux density of CXOU J110926.4-650224 was not found to be in anti-correlation with the X-ray low modes444This non-detection is not due to sensitivity constraints. An anti-correlated variability similar to that of J1023 would have been detected with \mathrel{\hbox{\hbox to0.0pt{\hbox{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{$\sim$}}\hss}\hbox{$>$}}}% 10\sigma significance (Coti Zelati et al., 2021)., but instead potentially linked to the X-ray flaring in the system (Coti Zelati et al., 2021). Two other candidates 3FGL J0427.8-6704 (Kennedy et al., 2020) and NGC 6652B (Paduano et al., 2021) were also observed to be rapidly variable in X-rays, but instead of showing clear low and high X-ray moding, they tend to stay in the flare-dominated mode. They are both radio-loud sources (4-8 GHz flux densities of \sim0.3 mJy and \sim0.07 mJy for 3FGL J0427.8-6704 and NGC 6652B, respectively) that also populate the same space as BH-LMXBs in the L_{\mathrm{R}}/L_{\mathrm{X}} diagram. The radio emission of 3FGL J0427.8-6704 (Li et al., 2020), similarly to that of CXOU J110926.4-650224, seems to brighten during X-ray flares, showing no anti-correlation with the X-ray flux555As with CXOU J110926.4-650224 (Coti Zelati et al., 2021), this non-detection is not limited by sensitivity, as the source has a relatively high radio flux density; see Table 3 of Li et al. (2020).. NGC 6652B, observed by Paduano et al. (2021), showed hints of anti-correlation between radio and X-ray fluxes: in this case the radio flux density seems to be lower during X-ray flares of the source compared to its level in between the flares. Both the radio and the X-ray luminosity of NGC 6652B are much brighter than in other tMSPs in the low-luminosity state (see Figure 10). Finally, a multi-wavelength study of the very strong tMSP candidate 3FGL J1544.6-1125 is the subject of this paper. Figure 1: Left panels: Chandra 0.5-8 keV (grey) background-subtracted count rate time series of J1544 grouped in 30-s intervals from the Epoch 1 (top) and Epoch 2 (bottom). The data show abrupt changes of the X-ray flux with clear low modes. Highlighted in blue and yellow are parts of the X-ray lightcurves for when we classify the source in a low or high X-ray mode, respectively. No obvious X-ray flares (typical for known tMSP) are present. Right panels: Distribution of X-ray count rate per interval bin. The horizontal red dashed line corresponds to the count rate separation used to distinguish between the low and high mode in our analysis. 1.3 3FGL J1544.6-1125 3FGL J1544.6-1125 (hereafter J1544; found by Bogdanov & Halpern 2015) is one of the most promising tMSP candidate systems. It was discovered through a targeted search of previously unassociated Fermi sources. J1544 was found to be a faint X-ray source (flux \sim 10^{-12} erg s-1 cm-2), with an X-ray spectrum well described by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of \Gamma\approx1.7, similar to other tMSPs. The optical spectrum of J1544 displayed notable H and He emission lines, indicating the presence of an accretion disk. Archival X-ray and radio data showed that J1544 had not transitioned to an RMSP state over the course of at least 15 years prior to its discovery (Bogdanov, 2016). The XMM-Newton X-ray light curve of J1544 demonstrated distinct high and low modes over a timescale of tens of seconds (Bogdanov, 2016). The moding behaviour was also observed in the optical lightcurve with \sim 0.5 mag amplitude variability together with sporadic optical flaring of \sim 1-1.5 mag. Optical time-resolved spectroscopy revealed a period of 5.8 hr (Britt et al., 2017), indicating that J1544 is in a binary system with a main sequence companion of intermediate mass (0.2–0.7 {\rm M}_{\odot}; similar to the 3 confirmed tMSPs) and a likely face-on orientation (i\sim 5-8^{\circ}). Photometric modelling of J1544’s companion placed the system at a distance of 3.8\pm0.7 kpc (Britt et al., 2017), which is consistent with the recent distance estimate from the Gaia DR3 parallax of 3.1\pm0.5 kpc (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2023; Bailer-Jones et al., 2021). Finally, quasi-simultaneous VLA and Swift-XRT observations (Jaodand et al., 2021b) revealed radio emission from the source at levels of up to 40 \muJy (in the 8–12 GHz band) that placed J1544 on the L_{\mathrm{R}}/L_{\mathrm{X}} diagram close to J1023 in the low-luminosity state. Importantly, this analysis showed that the radio flux density suddenly increases by a factor of \sim 2-3 between hour-long observations separated by a few days. The radio flux measurements across these observations varied from <13, <16 (3\sigma upper limits), 24, to 40 \muJy. This inter-epoch variability is consistent with that observed in J1023 and could similarly be linked to radio/X-ray moding or sporadic radio flaring in the system. However, this analysis used quasi-simultaneous radio/X-ray observations, whereas truly simultaneous radio/X-ray observations are critical to investigate this further. In this paper we present strictly simultaneous VLA and Chandra observations of J1544. We use these observations to investigate the nature of its radio emission and to compare it with J1023 and other tMSPs. We also place the observed radio emission in the context of other accreting systems. In §2 we present the observations and data analysis. In §3 we report our findings and discuss their interpretation in §4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05948v1,Repeated Partial Tidal Disruptions and Quasi-Periodic Eruptions in SwJ023017.0+283603,"SwJ023017.0+283603 (SwJ0230) exhibited soft X-ray (0.3-1.0 keV) eruptions recurring roughly every 22 days. We present results from an extended monitoring campaign of SwJ0230 using Swift, NICER, and deep XMM-Newton observations. Our main findings are: 1) SwJ0230 did not display any eruptions during two 80-day periods (June-September 2023 and July-September 2024) of high-cadence monitoring with NICER and Swift, suggesting that the eruptions have ceased, implying an eruption lifetime of less than 536 days; 2) quiescent/non-eruption emission is detected with XMM-Newton, with a 0.3-2.0 keV luminosity of 4\times1040 erg/s (bolometric luminosity of <0.1% Eddington assuming a black hole mass of 106-7 M⊙), that is consistent with a thermal disk spectrum peaking at 0.11{}^{+0.06}_{-0.03} keV; 3) SwJ0230 exhibited multiple, rapid eruptions (duration<5 hours, similar to quasi-periodic eruptions; QPEs), and there is tentative evidence that they recur, on average, on roughly the same timescale of 22 days. Swift J0230+28 therefore exhibited (when active) both rapid, QPE-like outbursts and longer-duration outbursts, more akin to those from repeating partial Tidal Disruption Event (rpTDE) candidates. These findings are difficult to explain with existing models that invoke an orbiter interacting with a persistent disk and those involving disk instabilities. We propose a hybrid model wherein an object of smaller mass (e.g., a Jupiter-sized planet) being repeatedly partially stripped and subsequently punching through its own, fallback-induced disk, can explain many of the observed properties, including the long-duration flares (from accretion), the short-duration outbursts (from the planet-disk interaction), and the turn-off of the flares (when the planet is totally stripped of gas).","Two classes of repeating extragalactic nuclear transients (RENTs; see e.g. Suková et al., 2024, for a review) have been uncovered in the X-ray (0.2–10.0 keV) bandpass: those that repeat on “long” timescales of a few\times(months—years) (e.g., Wevers et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023b, 2024) and those that have “short” recurrence timescales of a few\times(hours—days) (e.g., Miniutti et al., 2019; Giustini et al., 2020; Arcodia et al., 2021; Pasham et al., 2024c, d)111Within the context of this work the term short-period RENTs includes Quasi-Periodic Eruptions/QPEs and Quasi-Periodic Outflows/QPOuts (Pasham et al., 2024c).. These discoveries were facilitated largely by all-sky optical and X-ray surveys, including ASAS-SN (Shappee et al., 2014), Zwicky Transient Facility (Bellm, 2014), and eROSITA (Merloni et al., 2012), that repeatedly scan large areas of the sky. While modulations are not seen in the optical/UV (except in the cases of ASASSN-14ko: Payne et al. 2021a, 2023 and AT2018fyk/ASASSN-18ul: Pasham et al. 2024a), optical surveys have been used to identify outbursts and provide the impetus for X-ray follow-up in several cases. A leading hypothesis for the origin of long-period RENTs is the repeated partial tidal disruption of a star (rpTDEs) (e.g., Zalamea et al., 2010; Cufari et al., 2022; Wevers et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023b; Pasham et al., 2024a; Evans et al., 2023b) (but see Wen et al. 2024 for an alternative interpretation). For the short-period RENTs, two additional categories of models have been proposed: those that invoke an orbiting secondary object around a primary massive black hole (mass \gtrsim104 M⊙)(e.g., see Pasham et al., 2024c; Wu et al., 2024; Ressler et al., 2024; King, 2023) or disk instabilities (e.g., Śniegowska et al., 2023; Kaur et al., 2023; Pan et al., 2022; Raj & Nixon, 2021). In both classes of models, a newly formed accretion disk is necessary to explain the accompanying overall long-term decay (e.g., Pasham et al., 2024e; Miniutti et al., 2023; Arcodia et al., 2024; Chakraborty et al., 2024) (however, Pasham et al. 2024b where such a long-term decay is not evident for eRO-QPE2) or optical/X-ray outburst (e.g. Pasham et al., 2024c; Guolo et al., 2024; Nicholl et al., 2024; Bykov et al., 2024), which can plausibly originate from a past tidal disruption of a star. Swift J023017.0+283603 (hereafter Swift J0230+28) was identified as an X-ray transient by the Living Swift-XRT Point Source catalog (LSXPS; Evans et al. 2023a) and announced publicly on 22 June 2022 (Evans et al., 2022). The field of view was observed by Swift’s X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on several occasions between 1 December 2021 (MJD 59549) and 8 January 2022 (MJD 59587) to follow up a nearby supernova (\sim 4′ away from Swift J0230+28’s position). X-ray emission was not detected from the nucleus of the host in any of these exposures, yielding a combined 0.3-2.0 X-ray upper limit of about 2\times10-14 erg s-1 cm-2. Observations taken on 22 June 2022 (MJD 59752) revealed an X-ray source with a flux of 8\times10-13 erg s-1 cm-2, suggesting an enhanced flux by more than a factor of 40. The X-ray spectrum was soft and thermal with a temperature of roughly 0.12 keV. Based on the spatial coincidence of the source with the center of a galaxy at z=0.036 and a soft/thermal X-ray spectrum, it was initially reported to be a flare resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole (Evans et al., 2022). Daily XRT and NICER monitoring of Swift J0230+28 between 22 June 2022 (MJD 59752) and 1 February 2023 (MJD 59976) revealed the presence of intense X-ray eruptions, during which the observed 0.3-2 keV flux varied between 3\times10-14 erg s-1 cm-2 and \approx2\times10-12 erg s-1 cm-2 (see Fig. 3 of Evans et al. 2023b and Fig. 1 of Guolo et al. 2024). The optical and UV emission remained roughly constant during this period (Fig. 1 of Guolo et al. 2024)–consistent with the host galaxy. In this work, we present an extended monitoring campaign of Swift J0230+28 with NICER and Swift, and a deeper XMM-Newton exposure to characterize the quiescent emission. We discuss the data reduction/analysis in the appendix sections A, B and C, and in section 2 we describe our main results. One of our main findings is that Swift J0230+28 displayed no outbursts over a span of >160 days, during which multiple eruptions222The words eruption, outburst and flare are used interchageably throught the text should have been detected if the source was still active at the same flux level, suggesting that the eruptions have ceased and the mechanism responsible for powering them is no longer active. In Section 3.3 we provide a model, consisting of the repeated partial disruption of a low-mass object, that can explain every feature of this source, and we discuss the (generally disfavoring) implications of our results for various other models in Appendix E.

The vertical dashed lines are uniformly separated by 22 days, the best-fit period estimated from the periodogram by Guolo et al. (2024).

The vertical dashed lines are uniformly separated by 22 days with the same reference date as Fig. 1. XRT’s 3\sigma upper limit is based on a scaling factor of 44 between 0.3-2.0 keV XRT count rate and 0.3-1.0 keV NICER rate (See Appendix section B for details on this estimate). Data prior to MJD 59976 was published in Guolo et al. (2024). Figure 3: A summary of the rapid flares from Swift J0230+28. The top four panels show sample rapid flares.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05906v1,"Galaxy Tomography with the Gravitational Wave Background 
from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries","The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar timing arrays suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole binary population. Although the observed spectrum generally aligns with predictions from orbital evolution driven by gravitational wave emission in circular orbits, there is a discernible preference for a turnover at the lowest observed frequencies. This turnover could indicate a significant hardening phase, transitioning from early environmental influences to later stages predominantly influenced by gravitational wave emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. By analyzing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we assess how the gravitational wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile prior to disruption by binary ejections, accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. Our findings suggest a parsec-scale galactic center density around \displaystyle 10^{6}\,M_{\odot}/\textrm{pc}^{3} across most of the parameter space, offering insights into the environmental effects on black hole evolution and combined matter density near galaxy centers.","Recent advances by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), leveraging precise measurements of timing residuals within a galactic-scale detector, have ushered in a new era of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) detection. The SGWB, defined by a superposition of incoherent gravitational waves (GWs), initially emerged as a common-spectrum process [1, 2, 3, 4]. Subsequent data provided robust evidence of a quadrupolar correlation function [5, 6, 7, 8], famously known as the Hellings-Downs curve [9], further affirming the SGWB’s presence and characteristics. The observed spectrum of the SGWB is consistent with expectations for a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), dominated by binaries with comparable mass ratios, total masses in the range of \displaystyle 10^{9.2-10.4}\,M_{\odot}, and redshifts from \displaystyle 0.15 to \displaystyle 0.9 [10, 11], where \displaystyle M_{\odot} represents the solar mass. Although the spectrum is consistent with a steady spectral slope driven by GW emission from circular binaries, it also suggests a low-frequency turnover [10, 12]. This feature implies an acceleration in the rate of orbital hardening, offering a potential solution to the final parsec problem [13, 14]. Possibilities include interactions with environmental factors—such as gas [15, 16], stars [17], and dark matter (DM) [18]—and the impact of significant initial orbital eccentricities [19, 20, 21]. An intriguing aspect of environmental interactions involves the role of stars and particle DM, which are noted for their potentially high density in galactic centers (GCs) [22, 23, 24]. Both stars and DM can be expelled from the system through gravitational slingshots during encounters with binary components, thereby extracting orbital energy [17]. This process involves three-body scattering, where the energy extraction efficiency is significantly higher than that of two-body dynamical friction [25], especially when the binary components have comparable masses and are sufficiently close. Such three-body slingshot interactions can substantially alter the density profile of the GC, particularly flattening the inner distribution [18, 26]. This underscores the importance of considering the co-evolution of the density profile and the binary orbit. A pivotal study by Ref. [27] demonstrates that the orbital hardening rate observed in N-body simulations can be effectively approximated by results from scattering experiments [17] within environments characterized by the GC distribution at the SMBHB influence radius [28] prior to disruption. In this study, we examine the impact of initial GC density profiles and SMBHB eccentricities on the SGWB spectrum, utilizing NANOGrav’s 15-year dataset to constrain the parameter space of these two factors."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07164v1,"Gravitational wave propagation beyond General Relativity: 
geometric optic expansion and lens-induced dispersion","The nature of gravity can be tested by how gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted, detected, and propagate through the universe. Propagation tests are powerful, as small deviations compound over cosmological distances. However, GW propagation tests of theories beyond Einstein’s general relativity (GR) are limited by the high degree of symmetry of the average cosmological spacetime. Deviations from homogeneity, i.e. gravitational lenses, allow for new interactions, e.g., between standard GW polarization and new scalar or vector fields, with different spin. Therefore, GW lensing beyond GR offers novel tests of cosmological gravity. Here we present the theory of GW propagation beyond GR in the short-wave expansion, including corrections to the leading-order amplitude and phase for the first time. As an example, we compute the dispersive (frequency-dependent) corrections to all metric and scalar field perturbations in Brans-Dicke, the simplest modified theory exhibiting GW dispersion. GW lensing effects are too small to observe in Brans-Dicke theories compatible with solar system and binary pulsar limits. Nevertheless, our formalism opens the possibility of novel tests of gravity, including dark-energy theories and screening mechanisms.","Einstein’s General Relativity (GR) has been remarkably successful in describing gravitational phenomena on a wide range of systems, across vastly different scales. However, open questions remain on both extremely small and large scales. Small-scale/high-energy problems of GR include the nature of spacetime singularities and the quantum completion of the theory. On cosmological scales, GR has led to the need to include dark matter and dark energy, accounting for 95% of the universe’s content today [1, 2, 3, 4]. In particular dark energy, responsible for cosmic acceleration [5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 9, 10, 11], could be interpreted as a breakdown of the attractive nature of gravity on the largest scales. This hypothesis has resulted in a widespread investigation of alternative theories [12, 13, 14], as well as an ambitious observational program to test them using cosmological observations [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. The detection of GWs [24] opened a new frontier in the study of gravitational physics, both illuminating the foundations of GR and casting away alternative theories to the shadows. Observed GW signals are emitted by relativistic compact objects, thus probing the regime of strong-field and dynamical gravity [25, 26, 27]. In addition to emission, GW propagation across the universe are highly sensitive to other properties of gravity, such as the GW speed [28] and the graviton mass [29]. GW propagation tests probe gravitational interactions directly and can achieve high sensitivity, as anomalous effects accumulate over cosmological distances. Most crucially, they apply directly to theories that modify cosmological dynamics, constraining many dark-energy theories [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. Many GW propagation tests, including measuring the anomalous speed and amplitude, are limited by require an electromagnetic counterpart or otherwise determining the redshift of the source. Moreover, only a handful of effects exist on the homogeneous and isotropic Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological background [42, 43] that describes the average universe. GW propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes, i.e. GW lensing, drastically extend the range of phenomena that can be used to test gravity. The basic principle is that lenses/inhomogeneities break the FRW symmetries, allowing interactions between fields of different spin. In alternative theories, this means that the GR standard degrees of freedom (d.o.f.), the +,\times metric polarizations, mix with new fields such as scalars or vectors. In addition to the many gravitational lensing effects in GR [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57], lens-induced effects provide a powerful discriminant between theories through novel wave-optic pheonomena. Interactions with new fields involving two derivatives cause lens-induced birefringence (LIB), a difference in speed between the + and \times components of GWs [58]. The absence of birefringence in GW data provided constraints on cosmological theories of gravity comparable to those based on the GW speed [59]. Related birefringent effects are predicted in strong gravitational fields in GR [60, 52, 53], as well as in parity-violating theories [61]. Although progress has been made to characterize GW lensing beyond GR [58, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], computational difficulties and the wide landscape of theories have prevented a systematic characterization of these phenomena. One of the ways in which the theory of GW lensing beyond GR needs to be developed is by including frequency-dependent propagation effects. Most analyses rely on the geometric optics (GO) approximation [67, 63, 62, 68, 69, 60, 70, 71], which holds when the signal’s wavelength is significantly smaller than the local curvature scale, the i.e. short-wave approximation. In this regime, GWs travel along null geodesics, and their polarization is parallel-transported along them [60, 69, 51]. Corrections beyond geometric optics (bGO) [72, 73, 74, 75, 55, 76] include lens-induced dispersion (LID) on GW signals. Such modifications, by the nature of the short-wave approximation, are frequency-dependent and can be probed by GW interferometers.The characterization of the bGO regime beyond GR remains an open problem. A significant step forward was the first explicit computation of bGO corrections in GR [72, 73], showing how bGO effects modify the amplitude and phase of GWs and discussing the emergence of apparent additional scalar polarizations modes, absent in the geometric optics limit. GW lensing beyond GR offers potential for even richer phenomena due to the presence of additional degrees of freecom [77]. In this work, we extend the study of GW lensing beyond GR, developing a formalism that incorporates bGO corrections that describe dispersive phenomena. For simplicity, we focus on the Brans-Dicke theory as an example of scalar-tensor models [78, 79]. Using the short-wave expansion approximation, we compute the bGO corrections to the leading-order scalar observables for tensor and scalar waves passing through a point-like gravitational lens. The work is organized as follows: In Sec. II we will introduce a general framework describing the full-propagation of the gravitational and scalar radiation. By employing the short-wave approximation we will show the general equations, order by order in the expansion parameter, the equations governing the geometric optics regime and the first corrections to it. Sec. III will be devoted to review calculations for GR, thus introducing the null-tetrad formalism and thereby presenting the geometric and beyond geometric optics equations and the respective formal solutions for the gravitational radiation. In Sec. IV we will present the full propagation in the BD theory and show the solution in the geometric optics regime of the leading-order scalar and tensor amplitude. Then we will present, for the first time up to our knowledge, the general expression describing beyond geometric optics (bGO) corrections. In Sec. V, we will explicitly evaluate the dispersive bGO corrections, analytically, in the special case of a point-like lens, reviewing the GR case shown in Ref. [73] and subsequently extending to BD.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06960v1,Collective modes in relativistic cold asymmetric nuclear matter within the covariant Vlasov approach,"A covariant relativistic approach based on the Vlasov equation is applied to the study of infinite asymmetric nuclear matter. We use several Walecka-type hadronic models and obtain the dispersion relations for the longitudinal modes. The isovector and isoscalar collective modes are determined for a wide range of densities as a function of isospin asymmetry and momentum transfer within a set of eleven relativistic mean field models with different nuclear matter properties. Special attention is given to beta-equilibrium matter. It is shown that the possible propagation of isoscalar and isovector-like modes depends directly on the density dependence of the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and of the symmetry energy, with a stiff equation of state favouring the propagation of isoscalar like collective modes at high densities, and a stiff symmetry energy defining the behavior of the isovector like modes which propagate for densities below two times saturation density. The coupling of the nuclear modes to the electron plasmon is also discussed.","A multidisciplinary theoretical effort involving astrophysics, nuclear and particle physics, and statistical physics is required to understand compact stars, supernova cores, and neutron stars. From low densities up to several times nuclear saturation, these stellar objects are essentially composed of neutrons, protons, electrons, muons above a density close to saturation density, and possibly, if their mean free path is short enough, neutrinos. The electrons and muons neutralize the proton charge and thus suppress the divergent Coulomb energy contribution. In addition to understanding the equation of state of the stellar matter, a good description of the mean free path of the neutrinos in the medium is required. Neutrino opacity has been shown to be influenced by nucleon-nucleon interactions through coherent scattering of density fluctuations Horowitz et al. (2004a, b). Both the single particle contribution and the collective contribution must be considered. It is therefore important to understand the collective modes in asymmetric nuclear matter in order to predict the behavior of neutrinos. Low-density stellar matter consists of neutron-rich nuclei immersed in a gas of neutrons, a consequence of the liquid-gas phase transition that characterizes nuclear matter in this density range. This matter plays an important role in the collapse of supernovae into neutron stars, see for instance Oertel et al. (2017); Hempel et al. (2012); Fischer et al. (2014). At very low densities, the competition between long-range Coulomb repulsion and short-range nuclear attraction defines the properties of the inhomogeneous matter formed, which is known as nuclear pasta Ravenhall et al. (1983). It can occur in different structures and its properties have important consequences in the crust of neutron stars and in the core collapse of supernovae Chamel and Haensel (2008). It was shown that the isovector channel of nuclear matter is important to define the properties of the transition to the neutron star core Ducoin et al. (2011). In fact, the curst-core transition may be determined studying the response of nuclear matter to small perturbations, since the appearance of collective unstable modes is intrinsically linked to the existence of a non-homogeneous phase. In the present work, we are interested in studying the longitudinal nuclear collective stable modes arising from small oscillations around an equilibrium state in nuclear matter using the covariant Vlasov approach Zhuang and Heinz (1996); Avancini et al. (2018). We will analyze the behavior of several nuclear models used to describe neutron star matter. The collective modes of nuclear matter have already been studied in Ref. Matsui (1981) within a Landau-Fermi liquid formalism considering a relativistic mean field description. In this study both symmetric matter and neutron matter isoscalar modes were discussed. Later, in Ref. Lim and Horowitz (1989), a relativistic Hartree calculation was carried out and the zero sound, longitudinal and transverse modes were obtained for symmetric matter. A similar study was undertaken within a semiclassical approach in Nielsen et al. (1991), also for symmetric matter. Subsequently, in Refs. Greco et al. (2003); Avancini et al. (2005), both isoscalar and isovector collective modes were discussed also within an RMF description. One of the main goals of this work is to obtain dispersion relations for neutron-proton-electron (NPE) matter within the formalism of the covariant Wigner function, which allows us to calculate the propagation of density modes. The dispersion relations are used to calculate the longitudinal collective modes, both stable and unstable. The unstable modes determine the dynamical spinodal zones that define the boundaries of the inhomogeneous region of the neutron star crust. This formalism is of particular interest because it can be easily generalized to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity in the magnetized/non-magnetized matter, which is fundamental to the study of neutron star cooling. In a previous work Avancini et al. (2018), we have studied, in the context of the covariant Vlasov approach, neutron-proton-electron matter under a strong magnetic field. In this work, the dispersion relations for the longitudinal and transverse modes were calculated within a Walecka-type hadronic model and the instability regions for longitudinal and transverse modes were studied. In particular, the crust-core transition of a magnetized neutron star was discussed in detail. We investigate the role of isospin and the presence of the Coulomb field and electrons on the longitudinal collective nuclear modes. It has been shown Greco et al. (2003); Avancini et al. (2005) that at lower densities an isovector-like collective mode exists. The onset density of the mode depends on the isospin asymmetry. At higher densities, two to three times the saturation density, this mode changes to an isoscalar-like mode and the authors of Ref. Greco et al. (2003) have even suggested that the experimental observation of the neutron wave would identify the transition density. We expect the presence of electrons to affect the properties of these modes, namely the excitations with large wavelengths when protons and electrons must move together. We restrict ourselves to the zero-temperature case. In the following, we will refer to neutral matter composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons as npe matter, and to charged matter composed only of protons and neutrons as np matter. In Sec. II we present the covariant Vlasov equation formalism for nuclear matter, including electrons and the electromagnetic field already discussed in Refs. Providência et al. (2006a); Brito et al. (2006). A brief discussion of the plasmon modes predicted within the present formalism is also included. In Sec. III the numerical results are presented and discussed. Finally, in the last section, the main conclusions are drawn."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06706v2,Gravitational Wave Propagation in Starobinsky Inflationary Model,"In this work, we linearize the field equations in the f(R) theory using the Starobinsky model, R+R^{2}/(6m^{2}), and explore the impact of modifications to the gravitational field equations on the propagation and structure of gravitational waves. An equation for the trace of the perturbation was then derived and decomposed with the aid of an auxiliary field that obeyed the pure wave equation and was sourced by the matter-energy distribution, while also acting as a fictitious source for generating the actual perturbation via the Klein-Gordon equation. The fields were expressed in terms of Green’s functions, whose symmetry properties facilitated the solution of the trace equation. This trace value was then substituted into the linearized field equation to determine the perturbation tensor in terms of a modified or effective matter-energy distribution. We subsequently calculated the components of the quadrupole moment tensor as well as the perturbation tensor for a binary star system and compared them to the General Relativity case. The results indicate that the amplitude of the oscillation depends on the orbital parameters, specifically: the angular frequency and radius of the system. This suggests that high-frequency binary systems could be promising candidates for detecting the effects of this modified gravity theory.","In recent decades, modified gravity theories have emerged as a significant alternative for explaining cosmological phenomena tied to fundamental physics [1, 2]. These theories are motivated by the need to expand our understanding of gravity to address problems that General Relativity (GR) cannot solve without invoking dark matter and dark energy, such as the accelerated expansion of the universe [3, 4] and the dynamics of large-scale structures [5, 6]. Among these, f(R) theories generalize the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian by introducing nonlinear terms in the Ricci scalar R, offering new perspectives on the curvature effects of spacetime across various gravitational regimes [7, 8, 9]. Viable models within f(R) gravity theories [10, 11, 12], show promise in addressing both cosmological and astrophysical phenomena beyond standard GR [13, 14, 15, 16]. These models introduce a broader range of gravitational behaviors that remain consistent with observations while avoiding many of the issues found in alternative theories [5, 17, 18, 19]. Consequently, f(R) gravity provides a compelling framework for exploring modifications to GR, with applications ranging from large-scale cosmic expansion to localized strong gravitational fields, such as black holes, where they predict modified horizon structures and unique stability properties [20, 21, 22]. In this sense, Starobinsky’s model [23], f(R)=R+\alpha R^{2}, with \alpha being a parameter; initially proposed within the framework of cosmic inflation, stands as one of the earliest alternatives to scalar-field inflation models [24, 25]. This model is characterized by the inclusion of an R^{2} term, introducing new degrees of freedom in the field equations, resulting in additional modes that can impact the early Universe’s behavior [26, 24], particularly during inflation, where quantum effects may play a significant role [27, 28], as well as in producing perturbations that affect the evolution of large-scale structures such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. With the successful detection of gravitational waves [29], the framework of f(R) gravity could gain significant attention [30, 31, 32, 33], since important works have been developed in order to explore how these modified theories could influence wave propagation, polarization modes, and potential deviations from predictions in GR [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. Hopefully the next-generation detectors will allow to observe a wider range of astrophysical events, providing further evidence of gravitational waves and their properties [40, 41]. These advancements may reveal distinctive features in gravitational wave signals that could indicate the influence of f(R) modifications, potentially setting them apart from standard relativistic predictions. Considering this context, we focus this work on linearizing the field equations of f(R) gravity in the Starobinsky model within the weak-field approximation, analyzing the propagation of perturbations under this modified gravity theory to identify distinctive differences between this model and GR. This paper is organized as follows: in Section II, we linearize the field equations of the f(R) theory for the model R+R^{2}/(6m^{2}) in the weak-field regime, expressing the field equations in terms of the perturbation \bar{h}_{\mu\nu} relative to the background Minkowski metric. In Section III, we solve the trace equation using Green’s functions and auxiliary fields. In Section IV, we calculate the components of \bar{h}_{\mu\nu}, considering both the massive contribution induced by the quadratic term and the propagation effects of the field. Then, in Section V, we calculate the perturbation found for a binary star system, and its differences compared to GR. Finally, in Section VI, we discuss and analyze the results."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06170v1,The effect of pressure anisotropy on quark stars structure in the Starobinsky model,"The structure and stability of quark stars (QSs) made of interacting quark matter are discussed in this study, taking color superconductivity and perturbative QCD corrections into account. By combining this EoS with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, we explore the mass-radius (M-R) relations of QSs. The analysis is conducted within the framework of R^{2} gravity, where the gravity model is described by f(R)=R+aR^{2}. Our primary goal is to investigate how variations in the R^{2} gravity parameter a affect the mass-radius and mass-central density (M-\rho_{c}) relationships of QSs. Furthermore, we study the dynamical stability of these stars by analyzing the impact of anisotropy parameters \beta and the interaction parameter \lambda derived from the EoS, on their stability. Our results demonstrate that the presence of pressure anisotropy plays a significant role in increasing the maximum mass of QSs, with potential implications for the existence of super-massive pulsars. These findings are in agreement with recent astronomical observations, which suggest the possibility of neutron stars exceeding 2M_{\odot}.","The study of compact objects, such as QSs, has driven extensive research efforts due to their unique role as astrophysical laboratories for high-density matter and potential indicators of physics beyond general relativity (GR). Numerous modified gravity theories have been proposed to address fundamental cosmological questions, including dark energy and inflation. Among these theories, the Starobinsky model, which augments the Einstein-Hilbert action with a term proportional to the Ricci scalar squared, f(R)=R+aR^{2}, offers a simple yet compelling framework. This model not only addresses early-universe inflation but is also compatible with cosmic microwave background data, making it a promising candidate for investigating gravitational interactions at astrophysical scales [1, 2]. Astrophysical observations of supermassive neutron stars [3, 4] and recent gravitational wave detections, such as GW190814 [5], suggest the need for theories that extend GR in strong-field regimes [6]. These detections challenge traditional models, particularly in describing stellar structures under high densities and extreme conditions. In this context, the f(R) models [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and their particular realization in Starobinsky gravity offer insight into stellar stability and compactness properties that may deviate from GR predictions, thus making them attractive for modeling compact stars like QSs [22, 23, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. The gravitational wave signal from GW 190814 has initiated the possibility on the secondary object as a neutron star with a mass 2.6 M_{\odot}. The modified gravity theories have been proposed on this phenomena [22, 23] Another essential aspect of QS structure is pressure anisotropy, where the radial pressure, P_{r}, differs from the tangential pressure, P_{\perp}. Pressure anisotropy in compact stars is a natural consequence of various physical phenomena, including strong magnetic fields, rotation, and interactions among particles at ultra-high densities [24, 25]. In quark matter, pressure anisotropy affects the star’s mass-radius relation, stability, and compactness, making it crucial to include such anisotropic features when studying QSs under modified gravity [16, 26]. Indeed, pressure anisotropy has been shown to significantly alter the maximum mass and radius of compact stars, highlighting its relevance in the structure of QSs modeled within the Starobinsky framework [27]. This paper aims to investigate the effect of pressure anisotropy on the structural properties of QSs within the Starobinsky model. We employ a quark matter equation of state (EoS) tailored for anisotropic conditions, combined with the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) [28] equations in Starobinsky gravity, to analyze the impact on mass-radius relationships and compactness. Our results extend existing studies on compact stars in f(R) theories by specifically addressing how anisotropy modifies the predictions of Starobinsky gravity regarding QS structure. The plan of the paper is as follows: In Sec. II, we formulate the problem and derive the field equations for Starobinsky’s model under spherical symmetry. Section III presents the anisotropic quark matter EoS used in this study. In Sec. IV, we discuss our numerical results, focusing on the mass-radius relationship and stability conditions under varying anisotropic parameters. Section VI provides concluding remarks and future perspectives. Throughout the paper, we adopt the signature (-,+,+,+), and set c=1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05909v1,Constraints to the inert doublet model of dark matter with very high-energy gamma-rays observatories,"We investigate the constraints on the Inert Doublet Model (IDM), a minimal extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics featuring a scalar dark matter candidate, using data from recent and future gamma-ray observatories. The relevance of the model for indirect searches of dark matter stems from two key features: first, in the high-mass regime, IDM can achieve the correct dark matter relic abundance for masses between approximately 500 GeV and 25 TeV, aligning perfectly with the energy sensitivity of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. Second, this regime is dominated by co-annihilation processes, which elevate the thermal-relic velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section to the range of 0.5–1.0\times 10^{-25} cm3 s-1, thereby enhancing the potential gamma-ray signal from dark matter annihilation. Analyzing recent H.E.S.S. observations of the Galactic Center region, we find that dark matter particle masses within the 1–8 TeV range are excluded by current data. Furthermore, we project that the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will comprehensively probe the remaining viable parameter space of the IDM. Our findings are further examined in the context of the most recent theoretical constraints, collider searches, and direct detection results from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment.","The true nature of dark matter (DM) remains one of the most pressing questions in modern physics, driving extensive experimental efforts across multiple platforms. Colliders, direct detection experiments, and indirect detection methods have been employed to search for signals of DM particles, spanning a wide range of masses. Among the most compelling candidates are weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which are theorized to have masses in the GeV to TeV range [1, 2]. Despite numerous attempts, no definitive detection has yet been achieved, leading to stringent constraints on various extensions of the Standard Model (SM) that predict WIMP candidates within this mass range [3, 4]. As a result, the exploration of multi-TeV DM scenarios has gained increasing importance. However, probing this mass range presents significant challenges for direct detection experiments, which lose sensitivity at such high masses, and for colliders, which struggle to reach the required energy scales. Consequently, alternative methods, such as indirect detection via very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays, have become crucial in the search for WIMPs [5]. In indirect detection, it is hypothesized that DM may self-annihilate in dense astrophysical environments, producing SM particles that could be observed on Earth. These include charged cosmic rays, neutrinos, and gamma rays. Charged particles, such as electrons, positrons, and protons, are deflected by astrophysical magnetic fields, making it difficult to trace them back to their origin. Neutrinos, although capable of traveling vast distances unimpeded, are notoriously challenging to detect due to their weak interactions with matter. In contrast, gamma rays offer distinct advantages: they are not deflected by magnetic fields and are only mildly affected by absorption within the Galaxy, making them valuable messengers for indirect DM searches. With current technology, gamma rays can be detected with high precision, providing a crucial window into possible DM interactions. Several instruments, including H.E.S.S. [6], MAGIC [7], VERITAS [8], HAWC [9] and LHAASO [10], have been searching for a VHE gamma-ray signal from generic WIMPs. Notably, H.E.S.S. observations of the Inner Galaxy halo have provided the most stringent constraints on multi-TeV DM, excluding annihilation cross-sections below the thermal relic value [11] for DM masses between 200 GeV and a few TeV, particularly for annihilation via the \tau^{+}\tau^{-} channel [6]. However, it is important to note that these limits were obtained using a model-independent approach, where the annihilation is assumed to happen with a 100% branching ratio into SM particle/anti-particle pairs. The next generation of gamma-ray observatories, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) [5] and the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) [12], are expected to enhance sensitivity to DM signals by an order of magnitude, especially for DM masses above the TeV scale. In this work, we update the indirect detection limits for one of the simplest yet specific DM models, the Inert Doublet Model (IDM). The IDM is a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM), where a new Higgs doublet is added. This new doublet is stabilized by a discrete Z_{2} symmetry, which allows the lightest neutral particle to be a DM particle candidate. In the IDM, the observed abundance of DM can be obtained in two distinct regimes: the low-mass regime (m_{DM}<m_{W},m_{Z}), and the high-mass regime (m_{DM}>500\,\text{GeV}) [13]. The former is already highly constrained by collider and direct detection data, and therefore is not the current focus of indirect searches [13, 14, 15]. On the other hand, the high-mass regime is very promising for indirect detection searches for two important reasons. First, in this regime, the DM particle is expected to annihilate, producing gamma rays in the TeV energy scale. Second, the annihilation cross-section is enhanced by co-annihilation effects in the high-mass limit, leading to a higher gamma-ray signal. These characteristics make the IDM one of the best models of DM to be probed in indirect searches by VHE gamma-ray telescopes, such as H.E.S.S. and CTAO. In this paper, we provide new limits to the IDM from recent data of the experiments H.E.S.S. (indirect detection) and LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ, direct detection). The projected limits of the CTAO are also estimated. In the end, we describe the complementarity of these three constraints, and the remaining available scenarios of the model are obtained."
