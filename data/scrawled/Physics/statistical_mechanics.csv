https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10146v1,Heat exchange for oscillator strongly coupled to thermal bath,"The heat exchange fluctuation theorem (XFT) by Jarzynski and Wójcik [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 230602 (2004)] addresses the setting where two systems with different temperatures are brought in thermal contact at time t=0 and then disconnected at later time \tau. The theorem asserts that the probability of an anomalous heat flux (from cold to hot), while nonzero, is exponentially smaller than the probability of the corresponding normal flux (from hot to cold). As a result, the average heat flux is always normal. In that way, the theorem demonstrates how irreversible heat transfer, observed on the macroscopic scale, emerges from the underlying reversible dynamics. The XFT was proved under the assumption that the coupling work required to connect and then disconnect the systems is small compared to the change of the internal energies of the systems. That condition is often valid for macroscopic systems, but may be violated for microscopic ones. We examine the validity of the XFT’s assumption for a specific model of the Caldeira-Leggett type, where one system is a classical harmonic oscillator and the other is a thermal bath comprised of a large number of oscillators. The coupling between the system and the bath, which is bilinear, is instantaneously turned on at t=0 and off at t=\tau. For that model, we found that the assumption of the XFT can be satisfied only for a rather restricted range of parameters. In general, the work involved in the process is not negligible and the energy exchange may be anomalous in the sense that the internal energy of the system, which is initially hotter than the bath, may further increase.","Consider two systems A and B, initially disconnected and prepared in thermal equilibrium at temperatures T_{A} and T_{B}, respectively. At time t=0 the systems are placed in thermal contact, exchange heat during the time interval (0,\tau), and then disconnected at time t=\tau. For this settings, Jarzynski and Wójcik derived a fluctuation theorem for heat exchange, christening it as XFT JW . The theorem states that the probability distribution f(q) of heat q transferred from A to B satisfies the relation \displaystyle\frac{f(+q)}{f(-q)}=\exp\left(q\,\Delta\beta\right), (1) where \Delta\beta=T_{B}^{-1}-T_{A}^{-1}. This relation quantifies the probabilities of the normal (from hot to cold) and the anomalous (from cold to hot) heat transfer. It shows that while anomalously directed transfer is possible as a fluctuation, the average transfer is always normally directed. Suppose T_{A}>T_{B}, \Delta\beta>0, and the heat q is defined to be positive when it transferred from A to B. Then Eq. (1) predicts that the normal transfer of heat q>0 from hot A to cold B is exponentially more probable than the anomalous transfer of heat -q<0, i.e. of heat q>0 from cold B to hot A. As a result, the average heat Q=\langle q\rangle transferred from hot A to cold B is positive, \displaystyle Q=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(q)\,q\,dq=\int_{0}^{\infty}f(q)\,q\,% \left(1-e^{-q\Delta\beta}\right)\,dq>0. (2) For the isothermal process, T_{A}=T_{B}, \Delta\beta=0, the average transferred heat is zero, Q=0. These results hold for any values of the process duration \tau and account for the second law of thermodynamics in the form that the average heat on any time scale flows from hot to cold. The XFT (1) was derived in the weak coupling approximation, i.e. under the assumption that the (coupling) work W, required to connect and later disconnect A and B, is negligible. In that case, the (microscopic) heat q transferred from A to B is naturally defined as the change of the energy u_{B}(t) of system B, \displaystyle q=\Delta u_{B}=u_{B}(\tau)-u_{B}(0). (3) It also equals the negative change of the energy u_{A}(t) of system A, \displaystyle q=-\Delta u_{A}=-u_{A}(0)+u_{A}(\tau). (4) The microscopic energy changes of the two systems may have arbitrary but opposite signs (or both be zero), \displaystyle\Delta u_{B}=-\Delta u_{A}=q. (5) Taking the average one gets \displaystyle\Delta U_{B}=-\Delta U_{A}=Q, (6) where U_{A}=\langle u_{A}\rangle and U_{B}=\langle u_{B}\rangle are the internal energies of the systems, and the average heat Q transferred from A to B equals to the change of the internal energy of system B, \displaystyle Q=\Delta U_{B}. (7) As noted above, the fluctuating energy changes \Delta u_{A} and \Delta u_{B} may be of arbitrary (but opposite) sign. In contrast, the signs of average energy changes \Delta U_{A}, \Delta U_{B} are not arbitrary, but determined by the sign of the temperature difference. For T_{A}>T_{B} Eq. (2) gives Q=\Delta U_{B}>0 and Eq. (6) prescribes \Delta U_{A}<0. Statistical properties of the energy fluxes, using setups similar to that of the XFT, have been studied experimentally, numerically, and theoretically in many works, see Sancho ; Ciliberto ; Ciliberto2 ; Berut ; Naert ; Landi ; Pal and references therein. Although the findings are commonly consistent with the XFT, they are often limited to the asymptotic case \tau\to\infty. Another often adopted limit is that the two involved systems are both macroscopic and can be treated as thermal baths with infinite heat capacities, whose temperatures are fixed and do not change during the process. For such case, Gomez-Marin and Sancho Sancho addressed the question of how to extend the XFT beyond the weak coupling limit. For a specific model (where two baths are connected by a Brownian transducer), they found a heat fluctuation theorem in the form similar to Eq. (1), but with \Delta\beta replaced by a more complicated function of the two temperatures. The sign of that function, however, coincides with that of \Delta\beta. Then, the evaluation similar to Eq. (2) shows again that the average heat flows from hot system A to cold system B. It was found in Sancho that the heat flux can be reversed (to flow from cold to hot) but only when, in addition to the coupling work, an external work (not related to connection and disconnection of the systems) is applied. One difficulty of extending the XFT beyond the weak coupling limit is that the definition of heat may be ambiguous JW ; Sancho ; Landi ; Pal . Assuming that the combined system AB is thermally isolated, the coupling work equals the change of the internal energy of the combined system AB, W=\Delta U_{AB}=U_{AB}(\tau)-U_{AB}(0). For the XFT setting, at t=0 and t=\tau the two systems are disconnected, therefore the energy of the combined system equals merely the sum of those for systems A and B, \Delta U_{AB}=\Delta U_{A}+\Delta U_{B} and does not include the interaction energy. Therefore we can write \displaystyle W=\Delta U_{A}+\Delta U_{B}. (8) Let us emphasize that for the XFT setup this relation is exact and does not assume that the interaction between A and B is weak. Instead of Eq. (6), \Delta U_{B}=-\Delta U_{A}, which holds only for W=0, we have in general \displaystyle\Delta U_{B}=-\Delta U_{A}+W. (9) If we still adopt expression (7) as the definition of the average heat Q involved in the process, Q=\Delta U_{B}, i.e. as the energy received by system B, then Eq. (9) can be re-written as \displaystyle Q=-\Delta U_{A}+W. (10) This relation has the inviting form of the first law for system A, which may be useful in some situations Aurell . However, in general the interpretation of Eq. (10) as the first law for A ought to be taken with reservations. First, one may argue that definition (7), Q=\Delta U_{B}, is inconsistent with the notion of heat as the form of energy which is distinct from work. For the given process the work does contributes to the energy change of system B, and therefore to Q. Second, the coupling work W in Eq. (10) is not the work on A alone, but on the combined system AB. In general, the extension of thermodynamic concepts to microscopic scale is a subtle problem which was addressed in recent years in many works Gelin ; Seifert ; TH ; Jar2 ; Esposito ; PP . In the XFT setting, the problem is simpler than in general because Eq. (8) does not involves the interaction energy but only bare energy changes of individual systems, \Delta U_{A} and \Delta U_{B}. Together with the coupling work W, those quantities are sufficient to characterize XFT-like processes, and the concept of heat is actually unnecessary. Thus, instead of the standard set of variables \displaystyle S_{1}=(W,\,Q,\,\Delta U), (11) for a system of interest only, A or B, for the XFT protocol it is more natural to use the set \displaystyle S_{2}=(W,\,\Delta U_{A},\,\Delta U_{B}), (12) which characterizes both systems involved in the process. While the variables of set S_{1} are related by the first law Q=W-\Delta U, the variables of set S_{2} are connected by Eq. (8). The latter can be referred to and interpreted as the first law for the XFT protocol. Using set S_{2}, one can describe a broader range of processes than with set S_{1}. One can consider S_{1} as a subset of S_{2} for which the additional constrain \Delta U_{A}=-\Delta U_{B}=-Q holds. One expects that the standard description of heat exchange in terms of set S_{1} is still relevant and the XFT provides a good approximation if the coupling work is much smaller than the internal energy changes \displaystyle|W|\ll|\Delta U_{A}|,\qquad|W|\ll|\Delta U_{B}|. (13) While these conditions appear reasonable and intuitive for macroscopic systems, for small systems they are difficult to justify in general because the process depends on many parameters. The goal of this paper is to consider the validity of conditions (13) for a specific model which allows an explicit evaluation of W, \Delta U_{A}, \Delta U_{B}. To this end, we exploit the standard Caldeira-Leggett model CL ; Weiss modified for the XFT setup. Although the XFT can be formulated in both classical and quantum cases, we restrict the discussion to the former. System A, referred to as “the system”, is represented by a classical oscillator with initial temperature T_{0}, and system B is a thermal bath at temperature T represented by a large set of oscillators. We denote the internal energy of the system and the bath as U and U_{b}, respectively. We do not attempt to define heat involved in the XFT process. Instead, we describe the process in terms of the variables \displaystyle(W,\,\Delta U,\,\Delta U_{b}) (14) connected by the first law (8) \displaystyle W=\Delta U+\Delta U_{b}. (15) For the presented model one can evaluate W and \Delta U independently, then \Delta U_{b} is determined by Eq. (15). We found that conditions (13) may be satisfied only for a limited range of parameters. In general, the values of W, \Delta U, \Delta U_{b} are comparable, so the assumption of the XFT is not satisfied. As a result, the average energy transfer is not determined by the temperatures only, as both thermodynamics and the XFT imply. In particular, for finite process duration \tau the internal energy of a hotter system may increase. Such behavior does not contradict the second law because the process is not spontaneous but involves non-zero coupling work W. We found that the latter may be positive or negative, depending on parameters of the model."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09989v1,Diffusion Equation and Rare Fluctuations of the Biased ACTRW Model,"We explore the fractional advection-diffusion equation and rare events associated with the ACTRW model. When waiting times have a finite mean but infinite variance, and the displacements follow a narrow distribution, the fractional operator is defined in terms of space rather than time. The far tail of the positional distribution is governed by rare events, which exhibit a different scaling compared to typical fluctuations. Additionally, we establish a strong relationship between the number of renewals and the positional distribution in the context of large deviations. Throughout the manuscript, the theoretical results are validated through simulations.","The continuous-time random walk (CTRW) model is widely used to describe a variety of phenomena across disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biophysics, and biochemistry. For a comprehensive review, see Metzler2000random ; Klafter2011First . Over the past two decades, the aging phenomenon has found significant applications in fields ranging from biology to chemistry and materials science. Examples include statistical aging and ergodicity breaking in semiconductor CdSe nanocrystals Brokmann2003Statistical , time-ensemble-averaged mean squared displacement (MSD) in studies of diffusion within the plasma membrane of living cells Weigel2011Ergodic , anomalous transport in cellular flows Patrick2016Anomalous , and neuronal messenger ribonucleoprotein transport Song2018Neuronal . One widely used approach for addressing aging is the aging continuous-time random walk (ACTRW) model. Theoretically, aging behavior has been investigated through a deterministic dynamical system within the framework of the aging diffusion equation Barkai2003Agingin . Time averages of single-particle trajectories demonstrate population splitting and aging effects in scale-free anomalous diffusion processes Schulz2013Aging . The self-similarity property of the uncoupled ACTRW was explored in Busani2014AgingUC , and for more details on aging renewal theory and its applications, see Schulz2014Aging . Furthermore, equilibrium initial conditions have been discussed in the contexts of both renewal processes Wang2019Transport and CTRW models Hou2018Biased . See also discussions related to aging Lévy walk Marcin2017Aging . Most previous studies have focused on cases where the waiting times have an infinite mean. In such scenarios, the system is strongly influenced by the aging time, as the mean of the first waiting time is infinite. However, the situation changes when waiting times have a finite mean but an infinite variance. In this case, the average of the first waiting time asymptotically scales as t_{a}^{2-\alpha} Wang2018Renewal , where t_{a} is the aging time of the system. When t_{a}\to\infty, corresponding to equilibrium initial conditions, the average of the first waiting time tends to infinity. On the other hand, for a finite t_{a}, the mean of the first waiting time remains finite. In that sense, observing aging effects in the ACTRW model would be difficult. This manuscript explores these properties in detail. Fractional kinetic equations are widely used to model anomalous diffusion, ranging from sub-diffusion Metzler1999Anomalous ; Barkai2001Fractional ; Magdziarz2008Equivalence ; Deng2008Finite ; Chechkin2005Fractional to super-diffusion Wang2020Fractional ; Wang2024Fractional . When the waiting times have a finite mean, but an infinite variance, and the displacement follows a narrow distribution with a finite, non-zero mean, the fractional operator applies to the spatial domain rather than the temporal domain for a CTRW model, which makes a significant departure from the scenario discussed in Metzler1998Anomalous . The introduction of aging into the system has been shown to result in a sub-diffusion-type equation Barkai2003Agingin when waiting times have an infinite mean. However, when waiting time has a finite mean and an infinite variance, the behavior of the diffusion equation with aging remains unknown, which we address in this manuscript. The second aim of this manuscript is to investigate rare events of the positional distribution. These rare events are linked to large deviation theory, which focuses on the tails of distributions of observables, as opposed to typical fluctuations that characterize the central region of the PDF. For instance, recently, one of the hot topics in large deviations theory is the exponential decay investigated in Pinaki2007Universal ; Barkai2020Packets ; Wang2020Large ; Burov2022Exponential . This work concentrates on the statistics of positional distribution within the long-time limit. Recall that the large deviations in the far tail for t_{a}\to\infty were previously explored in Wang2019Transport ; here, we extend this to a more general case where t_{a} is finite. We further investigate the relationship between the positional distribution and the number of renewals, exploring the strong connection between these two quantities. We focus on small values of the position x, which stems from extremely long trapping times. Similarly, long sojourn times lead to a small number of renewals in the context of renewal processes. Therefore, we expect a correlation between small positional values and a low number of renewals. This spirit aligns with the single big jump principle discussed in Alessandro2019Single ; Wang2019Transport , as applied to Lévy walks and the CTRW model. In this sense, rare events of one observable can provide insights into another. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the CTRW and ACTRW models, including the specific case of the equilibrium process. In Sec. III, we derive the aging fractional advection diffusion equation using the subordination approach. Sec. V explores rare fluctuations in the positional distribution and the number of renewals. Finally, a summary is provided in Sec.VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09880v1,Maximum entropy inference of reaction-diffusion models,"Reaction-diffusion equations are commonly used to model a diverse array of complex systems, including biological, chemical, and physical processes. Typically, these models are phenomenological, requiring the fitting of parameters to experimental data. In the present work, we introduce a novel formalism to construct reaction-diffusion models that is grounded in the principle of maximum entropy. This new formalism aims to incorporate various types of experimental data, including ensemble currents, distributions at different points in time, or moments of such. To this end, we expand the framework of Schrödinger bridges and Maximum Caliber problems to nonlinear interacting systems. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach by modeling the evolution of (i) a morphogen across the fin of a zebrafish and (ii) the population of two varieties of toads in Poland, so as to match the experimental data.","Introduction Reaction-diffusion equations serve as dynamical models widely applicable across science. They arise naturally in chemistry but also in biology, ecology, physics, and geology. The rich behavior emerging from their nonlinear interactive nature, together with their relative simplicity, makes them a useful playing field to test theories and make predictions. Specifically, reaction-diffusion models have been used to study biological pattern formation [1], spatial ecology [2, 3], epidemic dynamics [4], tumor growth [5], chemotaxis [6], and intracellular transport [7], to name a few. Not limited to modeling natural interactive systems, reaction-diffusion processes have also proven useful in recent developments in machine learning and image denoising [8, 9, 10]. Due to the inherent level of complexity of the underlying physical systems, typical reaction-diffusion models are phenomenological. In turn, the relevant parameters often need to be fitted or inferred from experimental data. Recent works have introduced multiple ways of doing so, ranging from machine learning techniques [11, 12, 13], to inverse problems [14, 15], or diverse variational approaches [16, 17, 18]. Here, we take an alternative route and infer reaction-diffusion dynamics from a fundamental principle, Jaynes’ maximum entropy principle [19]. The maximum entropy principle seeks to represent the current state of knowledge about a system via a probability distribution that is maximally non-committal to unavailable information, that is, the distribution with the largest entropy [19]. In a dynamical context, this implies that the model that best describes the current knowledge of the dynamics of a system of interest, when no other information is available, is the one induced by the probability distribution on paths that maximizes entropy [20]. This idea is encapsulated in the dubbed Maximum Caliber principle, which allows for incorporating various types of data, while maintaining maximum uncertainty about the remainder of the system [21, 22]. It has proven highly effective as an inference method, particularly in the context of complex systems [23] such as gene circuits [24], protein folding [25, 26], or bird flocking [27]. A related approach has been developed in parallel that dates back to E. Schrödigner’s work in 1931 [28, 29]. Therein, Schrödigner showed that, given knowledge about the stochastic dynamics of a cloud of particles, the most likely evolution of the particles traversing between two observed endpoint distributions that are inconsistent with the prior dynamics, is the one that minimizes the relative entropy from the prior. It is noted that minimizing relative entropy with respect to a uniform prior is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of a distribution on paths. Thus, this so-called Schrödinger bridge problem, which was originally conceived as a large deviations problem [30], in light of Jaynes’s work, can be interpreted as an inference problem. In addition, the Schrödinger bridge problem can also be seen as a stochastic optimal control problem, where particles are driven from one endpoint distribution to another through a control action of minimum energy [31]. Whether it is seen as an inference, large deviations, or control problem, it has had a multitude of applications, from machine learning [32] to biology [33], meteorology [34], or robotics [35]. It turns out that Maximum Caliber and Schrödinger bridge problems can be solved in a unified form [36]. In the present work, we develop and apply maximum entropy principles (and in particular, Maximum Caliber and Schrödinger bridge theories) to nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems. To this end, we introduce a stochastic process in which particles interact, whose ensemble behavior follows any given reaction-diffusion equation. This allows us to quantify distance between reaction-diffusion models via a relative entropy functional between the corresponding stochastic processes. Leveraging tools originating from classical Schrödinger bridges, we obtain structured analytical solutions that are computationally approachable, as illustrated through two examples. In the first example, we adapt the dynamics of a bone morphogenetic responsive element in the pectoral fin of a zebrafish to match the gradient obtained in [37]. In the second, we model the evolution of the population of two varieties of toads across southern Poland to match experimental data [38]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09785v1,Thermal rectification in segmented Frenkel-Kontorova lattices with asymmetric next-nearest-neighbor interactions,"In this work we conduct an extensive study of the asymmetric heat flow, i.e. thermal rectification, present in the two-segment Frenkel Kontorova model with both nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interactions. We have considered systems with both high and low asymmetry and determined that, in the weak-coupling limit, thermal rectification is larger when NNN interactions are relevant. The behavior of the heat fluxes as a function of the coupling strength between the two segments is largely consistent with a well-defined rectification for larger system sizes. The local heat fluxes present a very different behavior for systems with high and low asymmetry. The results of this work may help in the design of molecular bridges, which have recently been shown to be able to function as thermal rectification devices.","A thermal diode is an elementary device capable of sophisticated manipulation of heat flux. When reversing the temperature difference imposed on the two boundaries of such device, the forward and backward heat flows across the material can by asymmetrical, a phenomenon known as thermal rectification (TR). The first successful theoretical implementation [1] was rapidly followed by proposals to use it as a foundation of a wide range of applications such as phononic transistors [2], logical gates [3], and phononic memories [4] among others. Furthermore, effective control of heat currents requires the development of nanoscale thermal devices that could efficiently harness waste thermal energy that hinders the performance of the smallest chips present in everyday electronic devices [5]. Therefore, there has been a sustained effort to experimentally implement TR, such as by employing convection (thermosyphon) [6], by means of a semiconductor quantum dot [7], by phonon transport in a thin silicon membrane [8], or thermal expansion-contraction [9]. However, the straightforward approach of connecting two materials with different temperature-dependent thermal conductivities remains the most promising alternative to construct a thermal rectifier that operates at room temperature, as exemplified by the implementation of a thermal rectifier by means of two coupled cobalt oxides [10]. One of the first systems wherein a highly efficient asymmetric heat conduction was reported is a one-dimensional (1D) system composed of two coupled dissimilar Frenkel-Kontorova (FK) anharmonic lattices [11]; the forward and backward heat fluxes differed by a factor of 100. In this work the explanation of this phenomenon was that the phonon bands of the different segments of the lattice change from overlap to separation when the heat reservoirs are reversed. However it was later determined that the rectification effect in this very same model is possible only in the weak interfacial coupling limit and is reversed when the properties of the interface and the system size change [12]. Now, since the asymmetric heat conduction depends critically on the properties of the interface and system size, it was concluded that that it would be very difficult to fabricate a practical thermal diode from two coupled systems. However, recent advances in nanomaterials and nanotechnology have, in fact, made fabrication of thermal diodes at micro- and nanoscales feasible, which affords new possibilities for high-efficiency thermal diodes [13, 14]. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the rectification mechanisms at small scales becomes critical. Several models have been proposed, including those based on asymmetric geometry of nanostructures [15, 16, 17], asymmetric coupling with thermal contacts [18], and 1D oscillator chains with asymmetric mass distribution [19, 20]. One of the most recent models where a significant TR has been observed correspond to molecular bridges (MBs) that covalently bond gold and carbon nanotubes [21]. The performed analysis suggests that TR can be attributed to the mismatch of vibrational modes between neighboring sulfur and carbon atoms in the MBs. This result is particularly interesting, since it is essentially the same mechanism responsible of the rectification effect in the 1D asymmetric lattice with onsite potentials previously mentioned [11]. Furthermore, the coupled 1D oscillator model could be considered as a very simplified model of the interface between the MB and the metal lead in these types of systems [22, 23, 24]. Therefore, it is important to study if any modification of the 1D model could improve its rectification efficiency since it could provide useful insights to improve the TR of the recently studied MBs. In this paper we explore the effect on TR in the aforementioned 1D model of the inclusion of next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interactions. With this structural modification it becomes feasible to study in a systematic way the effect of forces with significant magnitude beyond the nearest-neighbor (NN) range. The importance of this possibility is highlighted by the recently reported computation of the relative contributions of NN, NNN, and higher-order interactions to the overall energy flow in MBs composed of alkanedithiol molecules and gold substrates [24]. An additional motivation stems from the fact that the thermal transport properties of systems with such a type of interactions are significantly altered by their presence. For example, in a 1D oscillator lattice with randomly distributed NNN interactions —being thus a model of a glass— it has been determined that the observed energy localization increases the relaxation time of the system [25]. Furthermore, the presence of NNN interactions can change the size dependence of the thermal conductivity when the heat-carrying phonons are scattered by a quartic anharmonicity [26, 27]. And finally, the asymmetric heat flow, i.e. TR, of some 1D oscillator systems has been shown to improve by the addition of those same interactions [28]. Therefore, it is reasonable that there might be an appreciable influence of the NNN interactions on TR of the herein considered system. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2 the model system and methodology are presented. Our results on the dependence of the TR on the structural parameters of the model in the presence of NNN interactions are reported in Sec. 3. The discussion of the results, as well as our conclusions, are presented in Sec. 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09775v1,Effect of external potential on the energy transport in harmonically driven segmented Frenkel-Kontorova lattices,"Thermal resonance, that is, the heat flux obtained by means of a periodic external driving, offers the possibility of controlling heat flux in nanoscale devices suitable for power generation, cooling, and thermoelectrics among others. In this work we study the effect of the onsite potential period on the thermal resonance phenomenon present in a one-dimensional system composed of two dissimilar Frenkel-Kontorova lattices connected by a time-modulated coupling and in contact with two heat reservoirs operating at different temperature by means of molecular dynamics simulations. When the periods of the onsite potential on both sides of the system are equal the maximum resonance is obtained for the lowest considered value of the period. For highly structurally asymmetric lattices the heat flux toward the cold reservoir is maximized, and asymmetric periods of the onsite potential afford an extra way to control the magnitude of the heat fluxes in each side of the system. Our results highlight the importance of the substrate structure on thermal resonance and could inspire further developments in designing thermal devices.","I INTRODUCTION With the shrinkage of electronic devices down to the nanoscale Yan11 ; Lu07 and the increasing interest in thermoelectrics Yan22 , the thermal transport properties of nanomaterials have attracted much attention in recent years. In particular, with the emergence of single-molecule electronics Cuevas10 ; Xuefeng14 ; Su16 , where long-chain molecules attached to tiny electrodes are used to transport and switch electrons, the related problem of thermal transport through molecular junctions has received considerable theoretical and experimental attention. When an electron is transported through a molecule, a fraction of its kinetic energy is transformed into molecular vibrational energy. It has been estimated that 10% to 50% of the electron’s energy could be converted to heat, so that a power of 10^{11} eV/s may be dissipated on a molecular electronic bridge carrying 10 nA under a bias of 1 eV Segal03 . The ensuing temperature jump can affect the stability and integrity of the molecular junction. Therefore the rate at which heat is transported away from the conducting junction is crucial to the successful realization of such nanoscale electronic devices. One way to attain this goal is to employ a temporal modulation to direct heat from one part of the device to another or to a thermal reservoir by means of an applied external work. Such a strategy has been tested in a simplified model, the so-called Frenkel-Kontorova (FK) model Braun04 —which is a one-dimensional (1D) harmonic lattice affected by an onsite potential. Previously a 1D model consisting of two dissimilar FK lattices connected together by a time-modulated harmonic coupling under the influence of a static thermal bias was considered, showing that the overlap or separation of the phonon bands associated with the dissimilar segments determines the appearance or absence of thermal resonance (TR), that is, the maximization of a heat flux directed toward the thermal reservoirs obtained for a specific frequency of the external periodic driving Bao-quan10 ; Cuansing10 ; Zhang11 ; Romero20 . Thus this proposal offers an option to solve the problem of carrying away the heat from the junction between two dissimilar systems. Since the onsite FK potential takes into account, in a very simplified way, the influence of a substrate on the thermal conductivity of the harmonic lattice, it is important to recall some previous work on the effects of coupling to substrates on thermal conductivity. It is known that, in certain regions, the negative effect of phonon scattering can be suppressed and the thermal conductivity of nanomaterials can be significantly increased due to the coupling-induced shift of the phonon band to the low-wave vector; thus the thermal conductivity can be efficiently manipulated via coupling to different substrates without altering the conducting structures. The systems so far considered are an anharmonic oscillator chain, a modified double-walled carbon nanotube Guo11 , and, very recently, Tungsten ditelluride flakes coupled to various substrates Laxmi23 . Also in an study of thermal transport in graphene supported on a silicon dioxide substrate it was determined that increasing the strength of the graphene-substrate interaction enhances the heat flow and effective thermal conductivity along supported graphene, contrary to expectations Ong11 . Very recently it was determined that the higher phonon group velocity and relaxation time caused by the weak phonon anharmonicity lead to higher thermal conductivity of gallium indium antimonide alloys Zhu23 . It is also known that heat transfer in multicomponent nonmetallic and semiconductor nanomaterials is dramatically affected by scattering of phonons at surfaces and interfaces Varshney12 . Therefore, by simulating heat transfer in nanostructures based on a model of FK lattices interacting via van der Waals interactions it was determined that such interface interaction can adjust the thermal conductivity parallel to the interface; this result agrees well with experimental results for carbon nanotube bundles, multiwalled carbon nanotubes, multilayer graphene, and nanoribbons Sun13 . It is then clear that the detailed structure of the substrate can have a significant influence on heat transport properties of the attached material. Therefore we expect that this is also the case for the TR phenomenon studied by means of the dissimilar FK lattice previously mentioned. In this work we begin to address the influence of substrate structure on the TR phenomenon previously studied in the dissimilar FK lattice by considering the effect of the potential period on the aforementioned phenomenon. The onsite potential in the FK model plays the role of the substrate. Therefore, a modification of the period amounts to considering, in a simplified way, the influence of the substrate on TR. The previously considered setup for the study of TR in the FK model Romero20 corresponds to the commensurate case where all oscillators occupy the minima of the substrate potential. In this case the lattice constant and the potential period have the same value and thus did not appear explicitly in the model. However, in the more general considered case the FK possesses two competing length scales. The interoscillator interaction favors an equidistant separation between oscillators, whereas the interaction with the substrate tends to force the oscillators into a configuration in which they are regularly spaced at a distance that corresponds to the period of the external potential. It is then expected that the aforementioned competition of length scales has a significant effect on the TR phenomenon previously observed in the dissimilar FK lattice. This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II the model system and methodology are presented. Our results on the dependence of the TR on the period of the FK potential as well as other structural parameters of the model are reported in Sec. III. The discussion of the results and our conclusions are presented in Sec. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10247v1,Anderson localization induced by structural disorder,"We examine the onset of Anderson localization in three-dimensional systems with structural disorder in form of lattice irregularities and in the absence of any on-site disordered potential. Analyzing two models with distinct types of lattice regularities, we show that the Anderson localization transition occurs when the strength of the structural disorder is smoothly increased. Performing finite-size scaling analysis of the results, we show that the transition belongs to the same universality class as regular Anderson localization induced by onsite disorder. Our work identifies a new class of structurally disordered lattice models in which destructive interference of matter waves may inhibit transport and lead to a transition between metallic and localized phases.","Introduction. The role of disorder in the localization of quantum systems continues to be a subject of extensive research to date [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The phenomenon of Anderson localization (AL) [8, 9, 10], wherein single-particle wave-functions of non-interacting quantum systems spatially localize in the presence of spatial disorder is fairly well understood [2] and has been demonstrated experimentally [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In lattice systems, the disorder is traditionally introduced locally by an onsite potential at each lattice site sampled randomly from a distribution whose width determines the disorder strength. While any amount of disorder localizes all the eigenstates in one-dimensional (1D) systems, disorder exceeding a critical strength is necessary to induce the AL transition in three-dimensional (3D) systems (see e.g. [16] and references therein). Two-dimensional (2D) systems present a marginal case where wavefunctions localize over a spatial extent increasing rapidly with the decrease of the disorder strength, rendering AL in 2D difficult to observe experimentally [17, 18] Figure 1: Destructive interference on a structural disorder if form of lattice irregularities results in AL transition between a localized phase (left panel, strong structural disorder) and a delocalized phase (right panel, weak structural disorder). Fundamentally, localized eigenstates result from the superposition of propagating wavefunctions with randomly distributed phases acquired from scattering off the random onsite potentials [17]. One can therefore envisage that the presence of onsite disorder is not a necessary condition for AL; random phases can also be acquired from scattering off irregular surfaces or edges of the system which we shall henceforth refer to as a structural disorder. This leads to the following questions: (i) can the structural disorder, analogously to the onsite disorder, lead to an AL transition that separates localized and delocalized phases, and (ii) if such a localization transition exists, does it belong to the same universality class as the regular AL in the presence of onsite disorder. In this letter, we demonstrate that a 3D AL transition can indeed be induced by a smooth increase of strength of the structural disorder. To this end, we examine a tight-binding lattice model with structural disorder introduced by removing lattice sites from a regular 3D honeycomb lattice, shown in Fig. 1. The process of removing sites is described by a classical statistical model defined on the chosen lattice. Focusing on a tight-binding Hamiltonian defined on the largest cluster of the remaining lattice sites, we show that the structural disorder strength can be increased by varying parameters of the underlying statistical model, leading to AL transition. We investigate the critical properties of the transition and consider an alternative 3D lattice with structural disorder to illustrate the robustness of our findings. Figure 2: (a) The averaged gap ratio \langle r\rangle captures the AL transition on \mathcal{C} for different system sizes L in the honeycomb model as a function of p, where p is the fraction of sites remaining in the lattice. The inset shows a critical scaling collapse with exponent \nu=1.57. (b) A similar AL transition is also observed for the link model in which case P_{link} represents the probability of added links in the random spanning tree."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10244v1,Entanglement asymmetry in CFT with boundary symmetry breaking,"We examine the behavior of the entanglement asymmetry in the ground state of a (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory with a boundary condition that explicitly breaks a bulk symmetry. Our focus is on the asymmetry of a subsystem A originating from the symmetry-breaking boundary and extending into a semi-infinite bulk. By employing the twist field formalism, we derive a universal expression for the asymmetry, showing that the asymptotic behavior for large subsystems is approached algebraically, with an exponent which is twice the conformal dimension of a boundary condition-changing operator. As a secondary result, we also establish a similar asymptotic behavior for the string order parameter. Our exact analytical findings are validated through numerical simulations in the critical Ising and 3-state Potts models.","The most widely used approach to symmetry and symmetry breaking in many body quantum systems is through an appropriate local order parameter [1]. A symmetry is said to be broken in a particular state if the expectation value of the order parameter is non-zero. This approach, despite its many successes, contains some important and consequential drawbacks. Aside from the difficulty of appropriately identifying and then actually calculating the value of the order parameter, the method provides no determination on whether a symmetry is broken or not if the order parameter is zero. Thus, an order parameter cannot always distinguish between symmetry breaking and symmetry preserving states. The problem is exacerbated if one is interested in the symmetry properties of an extended subsystem, in which case the spatially averaged order parameter may vanish despite being locally non zero. To surmount these issues and study symmetry breaking at the subsystem level, one can instead make use of the entanglement asymmetry [2]. This observable independent quantity, allows one to study symmetry breaking directly at the level of the reduced density matrix of the subsystem without recourse to any order parameter and faithfully distinguishes between symmetry breaking and symmetry preserving states. It has been studied in a wide range of systems at equilibrium; for ground states with explicit [3, 4, 5, 6] and spontaneous symmetry breaking [7], in matrix product states [8], excited states of conformal field theories [9, 10], mixed states in free models [11] and Haar random states [12]. It is also applicable out of equilibrium and has been used to reveal several exotic phenomena such as the quantum Mpemba effect [2, 13, 14, 15, 16, 3, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], which has been observed experimentally [28]. Such studies have focused, for the most part, on the global breaking of symmetry. A thus far under investigated scenario is the case wherein the symmetry is instead broken locally, either by a defect or the choice of boundary conditions. The effects of local symmetry breaking can, however, be just as interesting and consequential, particularly in the case of one-dimensional critical systems, which we focus on here. In this paper, we employ the entanglement asymmetry to study the ground state properties of (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theories in the presence of symmetry breaking boundary conditions. We consider the ground state of a conformal field theory, T on the half-infinite line x\in[0,\infty), with a boundary condition, a, at x=0. Unless otherwise stated our subsystem of interest, A shall extend from the boundary such that A=[0,\ell], see Fig. 1. The CFT is assumed to possess a global symmetry, G, which is however broken by the boundary condition a. We use the methods of boundary conformal field theory to derive analytic expressions for the entanglement asymmetry, as well as a related quantity known as the full counting statistics (aka string order parameter), and unveil an interesting scaling relationship between the symmetry breaking in the subsystem and the dimension of the boundary condition changing operators of the theory. We then benchmark these against numerical results obtained using tensor network methods on lattice systems, specifically the Ising spin chain and the 3-state Potts model. 1.1 Entanglement Asymmetry a\ell0+\inftyA Figure 1: We consider a one dimensional, G symmetric CFT on the half line subject to a conformal boundary condition, a on the left edge which breaks the G symmetry. We invetigate properties of the subsystem A which extend from the boundary a distance \ell into the bulk. The entanglement asymmetry is an information-theory-based quantity that measures how much a state breaks a certain symmetry group G [29, 2]. Assuming that the group is represented by operators U_{g},g\in G that factorize over the subsystems’ Hilbert spaces as U_{g}=U_{A,g}\otimes U_{\bar{A},g}, the method entails comparing the reduced density matrix \rho_{A} of a certain state \rho with its symmetrized version \rho_{A,G}. This is defined as [8], \rho_{A,G}=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}U_{A,g}\rho_{A}U_{A,g}^{\dagger}. (1.1) Here, we have restricted to G being a finite group, but continuous Lie groups can also be treated, see [5] for the definition of \rho_{A,G} in that case, as can space-time symmetries [30]. The entanglement asymmetry is then defined as the quantum relative entropy between \rho_{A} and \rho_{A,G} [2], \Delta S_{A}=S(\rho_{A}||\rho_{A,G})=\operatorname{tr}[\rho_{A}(\log\rho_{A}-% \log\rho_{A,G})]. (1.2) The properties of relative entropies mean that \Delta S_{A}\geq 0 with equality if and only if \rho_{A}=\rho_{A,G}, i.e. if the state is symmetric. Moreover, it can be shown that \rho_{A,G} is the symmetric state which minimizes the relative entropy with \rho [31], thereby justifying the choice (1.1) as opposed to some other symmetric state. Thus, the entanglement asymmetry quantifies how far a state is from being symmetric by measuring how different it is from its symmetrized version. The larger the value of \Delta S_{A} the more the state breaks the symmetry. Note that, by construction, any symmetric state obeys \rho_{A,G}=\rho_{A} and hence we automatically overcome the pitfall of the order parameter. The tradeoff of this approach is that, in general, \Delta S_{A} is a much more complicated quantity to compute, however, there are now numerous methods to achieve this. Using the cyclicity of the trace and the properties of \rho_{A,G} one can show that \Delta S_{A} can expressed as the difference of the von Neumann entropies of the two states, \Delta S_{A}=S(\rho_{A,G})-S(\rho_{A}), (1.3) where S(\rho)=-\operatorname{tr}[\rho\log(\rho)]. As a result, the entanglement asymmetry can be obtained as the limit n\to 1 of the Rényi entanglement asymmetry, \Delta S^{(n)}_{A}=\frac{1}{1-n}\log\frac{\operatorname{tr}\rho_{A,G}^{n}}{% \operatorname{tr}\rho_{A}^{n}}. (1.4) Upon substituting (1.1) in the above one gets \Delta S^{(n)}_{A}=\frac{1}{1-n}\log\left[{\frac{1}{|G|^{n-1}}\sum_{\begin{% subarray}{c}g_{1},\dots,g_{n}\in G\\ \prod_{j}g_{j}=e\end{subarray}}\mathcal{Z}_{n}(g_{1},\dots,g_{n})}\right], (1.5) where e is the identity element of the group and \mathcal{Z}_{n}(g_{1},\dots,g_{n})=\mathcal{Z}_{n}(\mathbf{g})=\frac{% \operatorname{tr}(\rho_{A}U_{A,g_{1}}\dots\rho_{A}U_{A,g_{n}})}{\operatorname{% tr}\rho_{A}^{n}}, (1.6) which we refer to as the normalized charged moment. Note that for the purposes of evaluating the entanglement asymmetry, it is the neutral charged moment, where \prod_{j}g_{j}=e, which is used. This property will be crucial in determining the correct behaviour of \Delta S_{A}. 1.2 Full counting statistics and the string order parameter The normalized charged moments are quantities of interest in their own right. In particular, the simpler case n=1 has been widely discussed in the literature. For Lie groups, this case is also known as the full counting statistics and carries special importance. It is the moment generating function of the generators of the group restricted to the subsystem. For discrete groups, this interpretation does not persist, however, it can nevertheless unveil information about the symmetry breaking properties of the state. This is the spirit of an alternative approach to boundary symmetry breaking [32], which is motivated by the concept of string order parameter [33, 34]. According to Ref. [32], one takes A to be the full system and establishes that the state is symmetric if and only if \log{|\mathcal{Z}_{1}(g)|}=0,~{}~{}\forall g\in G, (1.7) whereas the symmetry is broken if it attains a non zero value. Similarly to \Delta S_{A}, this measure faithfully detects symmetry breaking of the full state and works for both continuous and discrete groups. Notice that, despite its name, it is a non-local quantity and indeed is often referred to as a non-local order parameter. It is certainly simpler to calculate than entanglement asymmetry. However, although it has been studied in both equilibrium [32] and out-of-equilibrium settings [35], it remains less powerful as a diagnostic tool than the entanglement asymmetry. In particular, its effectiveness as an indicator of symmetry breaking for mixed states and, consequently, for subsystems is less conclusive. Nevertheless, we will investigate the string order parameter, \log{|\mathcal{Z}_{1}(g)|}, restricted to the subsystem A and compare the obtained results with those from the asymmetry. 1.3 Main results Let us briefly present our main results with their derivation following in the next section. We consider a boundary condition a at x=0 and the subsystem A=(0,\ell]. We find that the string order parameter admits the scaling form \mathcal{Z}_{1}(g)\propto\ell^{-2h_{\mu}-h_{\Psi_{(ga,a)}}} (1.8) where h_{\mu} is the scaling dimension of the (diagonal) disorder operator associated to the group element g\in G and h_{\Psi_{(ga,a)}} the conformal dimension of the boundary-condition-changing operator \Psi_{(ga,a)} that changes the boundary condition from a to ga. For a finite group G of cardinality |G|, we find that the entanglement asymmetry scales as \Delta S^{(n)}_{A}=\log|G|-c_{n}\ell^{-2h^{\mathrm{min}}}+o(\ell^{-2h^{\mathrm% {min}}}) (1.9) with h^{\mathrm{min}} being the minimal dimension of the boundary-condition-changing operators within the group G, i.e., h^{\mathrm{min}}=\min_{g\in G,g\neq e}h_{\Psi_{(ga,a)}}. (1.10) The constant c_{n} is just a non-universal amplitude. Note that, as the string order parameter approaches zero for large subsystems, cf. Eq. (1.8), one might be tempted to infer that the subsystem becomes increasingly symmetric as its size grows. However, the result for the entanglement asymmetry in Eq. (1.9) demonstrates otherwise, highlighting the greater effectiveness of entanglement asymmetry in detecting symmetry breaking at the subsystem level. Moreover, the string order parameter on the subsystem remains nonzero even in the presence of a symmetry preserving boundary, h_{\Psi_{(ga,a)}}=0. We emphasize also that, while the traditional order parameter approach may yield a nonzero value in certain cases, its value decays algebraically away from the symmetry breaking boundary. Moreover, its value provides no direct information on the symmetry being broken. In contrast, the asymmetry does not decay as the subsystem increases correctly reflecting the fact that the symmetry is not restored and its value indeed provides information on the broken symmetry group. 1.4 Organization of the manuscript The manuscript is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 our main results anticipated above for the string order parameter and the asymmetry are derived. Sec. 3 is devoted to provide concrete examples of the general results and to their numerical verification in both the critical Ising and 3-state Potts models. Sec. 4 reports our conclusions and outlooks."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10220v1,Escape-from-a-layer approach for simulating the boundary local time in Euclidean domains,"We propose an efficient numerical approach to simulate the boundary local time, as well as the time and position of the associated reaction event on a smooth boundary of a Euclidean domain. This approach combines the standard walk-on-spheres algorithm in the bulk with the approximate solution of the escape problem in the boundary layer. In this way, the most time-consuming simulation of reflected Brownian motion near the boundary is replaced by an equivalent escape event. We validate the proposed escape-from-a-layer approach by comparing simulated statistics of the boundary local time with exact results known for simple domains (a disk, a circular annulus, a sphere, a spherical shell) and with the numerical results obtained by a finite-element method in more sophisticated domains. This approach offers a powerful tool for simulating diffusive processes in confinements and for solving the related partial differential equations. Its applications in the context of diffusion-controlled reactions in chemical physics are discussed.","The boundary local time \ell_{t} plays the central role in the theory of stochastic processes [1, 2, 3]. For instance, reflected Brownian motion \bm{X}_{t} inside a given Euclidean domain \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{d} with a smooth boundary \partial\Omega can be constructed as the solution of the Skorokhod stochastic equation [2, 3] d\bm{X}_{t}=\sqrt{2D}\,d\bm{W}_{t}+\bm{n}(\bm{X}_{t})\,d\ell_{t},\qquad\bm{X}_% {0}=\bm{x}_{0},\qquad\ell_{0}=0, (1) where \bm{W}_{t} is the standard Wiener process in \mathbb{R}^{d}, D is the diffusion coefficient, \bm{x}_{0}\in\Omega is the starting point, \bm{n}(\bm{x}) is the unit normal vector at a boundary point \bm{x}\in\partial\Omega oriented inward the domain \Omega, and \ell_{t} is a nondecreasing stochastic process that increments at each encounter of \bm{X}_{t} with the boundary. Qualitatively, the first term in Eq. (1) describes ordinary Brownian motion inside \Omega, whereas the second term ensures that \bm{X}_{t} is reflected back normally into \Omega at each encounter with the boundary. From the physical point of view, one can think of the second term as an infinitely local force field that pushes the diffusing particle back to the confining domain [4]. Curiously, the single stochastic equation (1) determines simultaneously two tightly related stochastic processes: the position \bm{X}_{t} and the boundary local time \ell_{t} (which has, despite its name, units of length). The latter should not be confused with a point local time, which represents the residence time of Brownian motion in a vicinity of a bulk point (see [5, 6, 7]). Note that the boundary local time can be expressed as \ell_{t}=\lim\limits_{\varepsilon\to 0}\frac{D}{\varepsilon}\int\limits_{0}^{t% }dt^{\prime}\,\Theta(\varepsilon-|\bm{X}_{t^{\prime}}-\partial\Omega|), (2) where |\bm{x}-\partial\Omega| is the Euclidean distance between a point \bm{x} and the boundary \partial\Omega, and \Theta(z) is the Heaviside step function: \Theta(z)=1 for z>0 and 0 otherwise. The integral represents the residence time of the process \bm{X}_{t} in a thin layer \partial\Omega_{\varepsilon}=\{\bm{x}\in\Omega:\left|\bm{x}-\partial\Omega% \right|<\varepsilon\} of width \varepsilon near the boundary \partial\Omega, which is rescaled by \varepsilon to get a nontrivial limit, as \varepsilon\to 0. Alternatively, one has \ell_{t}=\lim\limits_{\varepsilon\to 0}\varepsilon\,\mathcal{N}_{t}^{(% \varepsilon)}, (3) where \mathcal{N}_{t}^{(\varepsilon)} is the number of crossings of the layer \partial\Omega_{\varepsilon} up to time t. In other words, the boundary local time \ell_{t} can be understood either as the rescaled residence time in a thin boundary layer, or as the rescaled number of encounters with that boundary. Apart from its major role in the theory of stochastic processes, the boundary local time was recently employed as the conceptual pillar to build the encounter-based approach to diffusion-controlled reactions [4]. This approach laid a theoretical ground for assessing the statistics of encounters between the diffusing particle and the boundary, provided an intuitively clear probabilistic interpretation of partial reactivity and allowed one to consider much more general surface reaction mechanisms [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Moreover, these concepts were further extended to describe permeation across membranes [16, 17, 18], diffusive exchange between adjacent compartments [19], and the related snapping out Brownian motion [20, 21]. Despite these advances, the fundamental relation between the statistics of the boundary local time \ell_{t} and the geometrical structure of the confining domain \Omega remains poorly understood. For instance, the distribution of \ell_{t} is known explicitly only for two simple domains: a half-line and the exterior of a sphere [8, 22, 23]. Indeed, the symmetries of these domains allow for the separation of variables and thus reduction to a one-dimensional problem that can be solved exactly. In contrast, most diffusive processes in nature and industrial applications occur in multi-scale media with irregular, sophisticated boundaries, for which numerical tools are needed to access the statistics of encounters. Even though the spectral expansions developed in [4] are formally still applicable in such domains, their numerical implementation (e.g., by a finite-element method) can be very costly and time-consuming, especially in three dimensions. In this light, one may prefer Monte Carlo techniques that offer great flexibility and moderate computations costs [24, 25, 26]. While these techniques are broadly used for simulating stochastic processes and diffusion-controlled reactions in complex domains [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49], their adaptation for studying the boundary local time is not straighforward. The most basic way to simulate the boundary local time consists in approximating reflected Brownian motion by a random walk on a lattice with spacing \varepsilon and counting the number \mathcal{N}_{t}^{(\varepsilon)} of its encounters with the discretized boundary \partial\Omega. According to Eq. (3), \varepsilon\mathcal{N}_{t}^{(\varepsilon)} is an approximation of \ell_{t}, if \varepsilon is small enough. The need for boundary discretization and excessively long trajectories (with 2dDt/\varepsilon^{2} steps) are major drawbacks of this method. The first drawback can be relaxed by performing off-lattice random walks, i.e., a sequence of centered Gaussian jumps of variance \sigma^{2} with normal reflections on the boundary. In this case, one can either count the number \mathcal{N}_{t}^{(\sigma)} of reflections and use again Eq. (3) with \sigma instead of \varepsilon, or calculate the residence time of this random walk inside a boundary layer of width \varepsilon\sim\sigma and use Eq. (2) to approximate \ell_{t} (see also [50] for the discussion of Euler schemes). Since a typical one-jump displacement \sigma should be the smallest length scale of the problem, this method can be efficient for simple domains (see, e.g., [51]) but it becomes too time-consuming in multi-scale media. This issue was partly resolved by Zhou et al. who combined the standard walk-on-spheres (WOS) algorithm by Muller [52] and the fixed-length displacements in a thin layer near boundary [53]. Their hybrid method exploits the well-known advantages of the WOS algorithm for fast simulations of large-scale displacements far from the boundary (see details in Sec. 2.1). As a consequence, the major computational limitation is caused by modeling small displacements inside the boundary layer of small width \varepsilon. This method was further improved and adapted to simulating snapping out Brownian motion in 2D bounded domains by Schumm and Bressloff [54]. In particular, they suggested using walk-on-spheres even inside the boundary layer of width \varepsilon, with the jump distance being fixed to be 2\varepsilon, in order to speed up simulations within that layer. Despite this progress, an accurate estimation of the boundary local time \ell_{t} within a boundary layer requires taking \varepsilon sufficient small so that modeling of reflected Brownian motion within this layer remains the critical bottleneck of these Monte Carlo simulations. In this paper, we propose a different approach to simulate the stochastic process (\bm{X}_{t},\ell_{t}) inside a confining domain. We still employ the WOS algorithm for fast simulations of large-scale displacements far from the boundary. In turn, we replace the detailed time-consuming simulation of the stochastic process within a boundary layer by a single escape event from that layer. A similar approach was recently implemented for simulating the escape of a sticky particle [55]. In fact, once the process arrives inside the layer, we introduce the random escape time \tau from that layer, i.e., the first-passage time to the set \Gamma_{\varepsilon}=\{\bm{x}\in\Omega~{}:~{}|\bm{x}-\partial\Omega|=\varepsilon\} of equidistant points from the boundary (Fig. 1a). The central quantity of interest is the joint probability density of the escape time \tau, the escape position \bm{X}_{\tau}, and the acquired boundary local time \ell_{\tau}. Its exact spectral expansion was recently derived by means of the encounter-based approach [56]. As a smooth boundary is locally flat, the spectral expansion takes a simple form that allows its direct implementation in Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, when the boundary is composed of flat elements, the simulation of the escape event becomes almost exact. In addition, we propose an improvement to account for the curvature of the boundary in order to enable using a larger width \varepsilon of the boundary layer. In this way, there is no need for simulating multiple reflections on the boundary that was the most time-consuming step and the main source of accumulating errors in former techniques. (a)(b) Figure 1: (a) A zoom near the boundary \partial\Omega: once the WOS arrives inside the boundary layer \partial\Omega_{\varepsilon} of width \varepsilon, one aims at replacing a costly detailed simulation of the random trajectory (in green) from the entrance point \bm{x}_{k} to the exit point \bm{x}_{k+1} by a single escape event. For this purpose, one needs to generate the escape position \bm{x}_{k+1}, the escape time \tau, and the acquired boundary local time \ell^{\prime}_{\tau}. (b) Flat layer approximation: starting from a point (0,y_{0}) (yellow circle), a random trajectory (in blue) experiences numerous reflections on the flat boundary before escaping an infinite stripe of width \varepsilon at the random escape time \tau in a random escape position (x_{\tau},\varepsilon) (red circle). These reflections are characterized by the acquired boundary local time \ell^{\prime}_{\tau}. The random trajectory is thus replaced by a simple jump from (0,y_{0}) to (x_{\tau},\varepsilon). The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we describe the escape-from-a-layer (EFL) approach. We start with a simpler approximation of a flat boundary layer and then discuss its improvement to curved boundary layers. Section 3 summarizes an algorithmic implementation of the EFL approach. Section 4 validates this method for several confining domains by comparing simulated results to either exact values, or numerical values obtained by a finite-element method. We also compare the performance of our method to the state-of-the-art method by Schumm and Bressloff [54]. In Sec. 5, we discuss further improvements, extensions, applications and future perspectives of this method."

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09792v1,Entanglement asymmetry and symmetry defects in boundary conformal field theory,"A state in a quantum system with a given global symmetry, G, can be sensitive to the presence of boundaries, which may either preserve or break this symmetry. In this work, we investigate how conformal invariant boundary conditions influence the G-symmetry breaking through the lens of the entanglement asymmetry, a quantifier of the ""distance"" between a symmetry-broken state and its symmetrized counterpart. By leveraging 2D boundary conformal field theory (BCFT), we investigate the symmetry breaking for both finite and compact Lie groups. Beyond the leading order term, we also compute the subleading corrections in the subsystem size, highlighting their dependence on the symmetry group G and the BCFT operator content. We further explore the entanglement asymmetry following a global quantum quench, where a symmetry-broken state evolves under a symmetry-restoring Hamiltonian. In this dynamical setting, we compute the entanglement asymmetry by extending the method of images to a BCFT with non-local objects such as invertible symmetry defects.","How conservation laws influence the entanglement structure is a subject that has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Indeed, in equilibrium settings, studying the entanglement in the presence of a conserved charge can reveal non-trivial information about the underlying symmetry of the Hilbert space. Out-of-equilibrium, conservation laws in many-body quantum systems can impact the time evolution of entanglement, thermalization, operator growth. Therefore, a natural question one can ask is what happens when the symmetry is broken and, especially, how it is possible to quantify the breaking effects. In Ares2023 , this topic has been investigated by introducing the concept of entanglement asymmetry. In this paper, we initiate the study of entanglement asymmetry through the lens of symmetry defects in boundary conformal field theory (BCFT). The formalism of BCFT has been proven to be useful in studying various quantum information motivated quantities such as entanglement entropy Cardy_2016 ; Ohmori2015 , symmetry resolved entanglement DiGiulio:2022jjd ; Kusuki:2023bsp ; Northe2023 , which has further been generalized to the setup of non-invertible symmetry in Heymann:2024vvf ; Choi:2024wfm ; Das:2024qdx . 1.1 Review of known results about entanglement asymmetry We refer to the following section for a formal definition of the entanglement asymmetry and here we review the interesting physics that this quantity can probe. The notion of asymmetry was first given in the context of quantum information and resource theory vawj-08 ; gms-09 ; t-19 ; ms-14 . Only several years later, Ref. Ares2023 introduced the concept of entanglement asymmetry in many-body quantum systems. Beyond providing a new framework to study symmetry breaking through the lens of entanglement, it can also detect interesting phenomena. The first application concerned the evolution after a quantum quench of a spin chain from a state that breaks a global U(1) symmetry to a Hamiltonian that preserves it. It turns out that the more the symmetry is initially broken, the smaller the time to restore it is and this phenomenon has been dubbed the quantum Mpemba effect. Since then, the entanglement asymmetry for arbitrary groups has been studied in several contexts, such as generic integrable systems lack_neel ; makc-24 ; Rrkacmb-23 ; bkccr-24 ; fac-23m ; cm-23 ; klobas2024 ; Rylands2024 ; Maric2024 , mixed states avm-24 ; cma-24 , random or dual unitary circuits tcdl-24 ; lztz-24 ; krb-24 ; ampc-23 ; foligno2024 , higher dimensions yac-24 ; Yamashika2024 , holography Benini2024 , in the presence of confinement Khor-23 or many-body localization liu2024 . Moreover, the definition of the asymmetry using the replica trick has made it suitable for an experiment in an ion trap simulator, where the quantum Mpemba effect has also been observed for the first time joshi-24 . However, dynamics is not the only setup in which it is interesting to study symmetry breaking. In this spirit, Ref. capizzi2023universal found a universal behavior of the entanglement asymmetry in matrix product states for both finite and continuous groups, and this result has been extended to compact Lie groups in conformal field theories in fadc-24 . Other field theoretical results concern the behavior of the entanglement asymmetry in certain coherent states of the massless compact boson chen-23 , and the SU(2) to U(1) symmetry breaking in the critical XXZ spin chain lmac-24 . The main upshot of these computations in macroscopic models is that the asymmetry exhibits a leading-order behavior which is fixed by the dimension of the group under study and, at least for continuous symmetries, conformal invariance imprints subleading corrections in the subsystem size \ell of the form \log\ell/\ell. 1.2 Take-home message After a broad review of the main results related to the entanglement asymmetry, we explain here its formal definition and the main conclusions of the present paper. We consider a conformal field theory (CFT) with global symmetry G. The interplay of CFT data such as asymptotic density of states and symmetry defects has been explored in Pal:2020wwd ; Harlow:2021trr ; Lin:2022dhv ; Kang:2022orq ; Choi:2024tri . Here our goal is to understand the entanglement structure of a state |\Psi\rangle in CFT, in relation to the global symmetry G, which we assume to be non-anomalous. A way to quantify the entanglement structure of a state is to bi-partite the CFT Hilbert space and consider the reduced density matrix \rho_{\text{\tiny{A}}} supported on some interval A \rho_{\text{\tiny{A}}}:=\mathrm{Tr}_{\text{\tiny{A}}^{c}}|\Psi\rangle\langle% \Psi|, (1) where \text{A}^{c} is complementary to A. The global symmetry G is implemented by unitary operators U(g) acting on the Hilbert space of states. Assuming U(g) can be factorized as U_{\text{\tiny{A}}}(g)\times U_{\text{\tiny{A}}^{c}}(g), there is a well defined action of U_{\text{\tiny{A}}}(g) on the reduced density matrix \rho_{\text{\tiny{A}}}. If there exists g\in G such that U_{\text{\tiny{A}}}(g)\rho_{\text{\tiny{A}}}U_{\text{\tiny{A}}}(g)^{\dagger}% \neq\rho_{\text{\tiny{A}}}\,, (2) we can infer that the symmetry is broken by \rho_{\text{\tiny{A}}}. The entanglement asymmetry is a quantitative measure of how much the symmetry generated by G is broken. Given \rho_{\text{\tiny{A}}}, we construct a new density matrix \rho_{\text{\tiny{A}};\texttt{sym}}:=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g}U_{\text{\tiny{A}}}(% g)\rho_{\text{\tiny{A}}}U_{\text{\tiny{A}}}(g)^{\dagger}\,, (3) which satisfies U_{\text{\tiny{A}}}(g)\rho_{\text{\tiny{A};{sym}}}U_{\text{\tiny{A}}}(g)^{% \dagger}=\rho_{\text{\tiny{A};{sym}}}\,. (4) The n-th Renyi entanglement asymmetry is defined by \Delta S_{A}^{(n)}:=\frac{1}{1-n}\log\left[\frac{\mathrm{Tr}\ \rho^{n}_{\text{% \tiny{A}};\texttt{sym}}}{\mathrm{Tr}\ \rho_{\text{\tiny{A}}}^{n}}\right], (5) and the replica limit n\to 1 yields \Delta S_{A}:=\lim_{n\to 1}\Delta S_{A}^{(n)}=\mathrm{Tr}(\rho_{\text{\tiny{A}% }}\log\rho_{\text{\tiny{A}}})-\mathrm{Tr}(\rho_{\text{\tiny{A}}}\log\rho_{% \text{\tiny{A}};\texttt{sym}}). (6) By using the linearity in the definition (3), \Delta S_{A} can rewritten as the relative entropy between \rho_{\text{\tiny{A}};\texttt{sym}} and \rho_{\text{\tiny{A}}}, whose positivity implies that \Delta S_{A}\geq 0. This property is valid also for \Delta S^{(n)}_{A} and the equality \Delta S^{(n)}_{A}=0 is satisfied if and only if \rho_{\text{\tiny{A}}}=\rho_{\text{\tiny{A}};\texttt{sym}}. The unitary operator U(g) is a topological codimension 1 operator. However, one needs to be careful about the topological property of U_{\text{\tiny{A}}}(g) since the subsystem A has boundaries. For a system with a boundary, we also need to specify whether U_{\text{\tiny{A}}}(g) ends topologically on the boundary. Thus we can envision a scenario where U_{\text{\tiny{A}}}(g) is topological in the bulk, but it does not end topologically on the boundary. As a result, we can deform such codimension 1 operator in the bulk freely, but keeping the anchoring points of the operator on the boundary fixed. The non-topological nature on the boundary leads to Eq. (2). An example of this setup can be the ground state of a Hamiltonian with boundary terms breaking the symmetry, G: in their presence, the ground state is no longer an eigenstate of G, even though the symmetry is only locally broken at the boundary. In this paper, we show that the entanglement asymmetry is a way to quantify the failure of a bulk topological line to end topologically. Subsequently, we compute the entanglement asymmetry coming from the breaking of the symmetry by the boundary condition using the framework of BCFT. Using this tool to compute \Delta S_{A}^{(n)} allows us to find a result for a generic CFT. In particular, if G is a finite group and A is an interval of size \ell attached to the symmetry breaking boundary, we find that \Delta S_{A}=\log|G|-\left(\frac{\epsilon}{\ell}\right)^{2\Delta_{*}}W(\Delta_% {*})+o(\ell^{-2\Delta_{*}}), (7) where |G| is the order of the group, \Delta_{*} is a universal number depending on the broken symmetry and on the CFT, \epsilon is an ultra-violet cutoff and finally W(\Delta_{*}) is a quantity that depends on the broken symmetry and on the CFT, which can be read from Eq. (28). The term (\epsilon/\ell)^{2\Delta_{*}}W(\Delta_{*}) depends on the cutoff as a power law. Hence, beyond the leading order, the only other universal information is the fact that subleading correction to \Delta S_{A} decays as a power law and the corresponding exponent of the power law. Up to this last non-universal contribution, our result is independent of the microscopic details of the theory. Moreover, this result shows that the first correction to the leading order term \log|G| is negative, which is consistent with the inequality \Delta S_{A}^{(1)}\leq\log|G| proven in fac-23m . We can repeat a similar analysis if G is a compact Lie group of dimension \mathrm{dim}(G) and we find that \displaystyle\Delta S_{A}^{(n)} \displaystyle=\frac{\mathrm{dim}(G)}{2}\log(\log(\ell/\epsilon))+O(1)\,. (8) We can also reliably compute the O(1) terms, which are universal and explicitly given in Eq. (35) and they depend on the volume of the group G as well as on the symmetry breaking pattern. The key point that we want to highlight is that in contrast to the \log(\ell) scaling found in Ref. fadc-24 , the leading order behavior here scales as \log(\log(\ell)). This difference is due to the fact that the symmetry is broken only at the boundary, while it is still preserved in the bulk of the system. We also study the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry after a global quantum quench, i.e. we start from a state that breaks a discrete symmetry G, and we let it evolve with a CFT Hamiltonian H, that, on the other hand, respects the symmetry. We show that, under reasonable approximations that we will describe in the dedicated section, the entanglement asymmetry of a subsystem of size \ell behaves as \displaystyle\Delta S_{A}(t) \displaystyle\simeq\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}\log\left|G\right|,&0<t<\frac{% \ell}{2},\\ 0.&\frac{\ell}{2}<t\\ \end{array}\right. (9) At the initial time, the entanglement asymmetry is non-zero, reflecting the symmetry breaking. On the other hand, the state is indistinguishable from a thermal state at late time, which implies the restoration of the symmetry. For this purpose, we extended the method of images to a BCFT with non-local objects. We expect that this idea will have a wide range of applications, not limited to entanglement asymmetry. The structure of the paper is as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the definition of the entanglement asymmetry, and we focus on a conformal invariant system with a symmetry breaking boundary. In this setup, we leverage BCFT to compute the asymmetry both for finite and compact Lie groups. We corroborate our findings with some examples for the Potts model (G=\mathbb{Z}_{3}) and for a compact boson (G=U(1)). In Section 3 we study the asymmetry after a global quantum quench by connecting this quantity to invertible symmetry defects. We finally draw our conclusions in Section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09784v1,Reinforced Disentanglers on Random Unitary Circuits,"We search for efficient disentanglers on random Clifford circuits of two-qubit gates arranged in a brick-wall pattern using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm [1]. Disentanglers are a set of projective measurements inserted between consecutive entangling layers. An efficient disentangler is a set of projective measurements that minimize the averaged von Neumann entropy of the final state with the least number of total projections possible. The problem is naturally amenable to reinforcement learning techniques by taking the binary matrix representing the projective measurements along the circuit as our state and actions as bit-flipping operations on this binary matrix that add or delete measurements at specified locations. We give rewards to our agent dependent on the averaged von Neumann entropy of the final state and the configuration of measurements, such that the agent learns the optimal policy that will take him from the initial state of no measurements to the optimal measurement state that minimizes the von Neumann entropy. Our results indicate that the number of measurements required to disentangle a random quantum circuit is drastically less than the numerical results of measurement-induced phase transition papers. Additionally, the reinforcement learning procedure enables us to characterize the pattern of optimal disentanglers, which is not possible in the works of measurement-induced phase transitions.","Measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] is a relatively new class of phase transition observed in random quantum circuits when measurements are incorporated alongside unitary operations. In these circuits, random unitary operations generate entanglement across the system, while measurements tend to collapse quantum states, reducing the overall entanglement. The competition between these processes—entanglement generation and destruction—results in a critical transition. Specifically, as the measurement rate increases, the system undergoes a phase transition from a volume-law phase, where entanglement entropy or von Neumann entropy of a subsystem scales with system size, to an area-law phase, where entanglement entropy scales with the boundary of a subsystem. The volume-law phase represents a highly entangled quantum state, while in the area-law phase, frequent measurements collapse the quantum state, leading to low entanglement. The transition is non-thermal, emerging from the nature of quantum dynamics rather than thermal fluctuations, making it an example of a non-equilibrium phase transition. This critical point depends on the rate of measurements, and numerical techniques such as tensor networks and Monte Carlo simulations are often used to explore the phase diagram. MIPTs have been explored in various contexts, including random Clifford circuits, stabilizer circuits, and hybrid quantum systems. These transitions are significant for understanding the limitations of quantum error correction and how information scrambling behaves in quantum systems [7]. Li et al. (2018) [8] discussed how the quantum Zeno effect plays a role in this transition from volume to area law in random circuits. Skinner et al. (2019) [3] presented the numerical evidence for the existence of these transitions in entanglement dynamics. Chan et al. (2019) [9] extended the understanding of the entanglement dynamics in unitary-projective hybrid circuits. Together, these works lay the theoretical and numerical foundation for studying MIPTs. Even though great insight has been gained regarding entanglement properties of one-dimensional qubit systems through numerical simulations studying measurement-induced phase transitions, the probabilistic nature of the projections blur the essential properties of the disentanglers. To address that issue, we consider a bottom-up approach for constructing efficient disentanglers in random quantum circuits. In the MIPT literature, brick-wall circuits are composed of consecutive layers of projections and random two-qubit unitaries. In that sense, constructing efficient disentanglers can be framed as a game, in which the disentangler plays against the brick-wall structure, learning how to pick the positions of projections aiming to minimize the reward function consisting of averaged von Neumann entropy of the final state and a configuration of measurements on the circuit. To solve the disentangling problem, we can take inspiration from reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks [10]. In RL, an agent interacts with an environment and learns a policy to maximize a cumulative reward. For our case, the agent (the disentangler) would act within the quantum circuit (the environment), learning optimal strategies for placing projections to minimize the von Neumann entropy. This setup naturally fits the RL paradigm, where actions correspond to the placement of projections, and the reward could be inversely related to the final entropy of the state. In particular, policy-based methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have shown strong performance in complex, high-dimensional spaces, making them a suitable candidate for this task [1]. PPO operates by iteratively improving the policy based on the expected return while ensuring updates remain within a trust region to avoid overly large policy shifts, which can destabilize learning. The disentangler’s task can be framed as learning a policy \pi_{\theta}(a|s), where a are the actions (placement of projections) and s is the current state of the system, aiming to minimize the entropy after several layers of the quantum circuit. PPO’s key advantage is its balance between exploration and exploitation, allowing the disentangler to efficiently search for better placements without getting stuck in sub-optimal policies. Moreover, PPO’s clipped objective function ensures stable learning by penalizing drastic changes in the policy, which is particularly important in stochastic environments like random quantum circuits. Over time, the disentangler would learn a robust policy that can generalize across different configurations of the brick-wall circuit, leading to low-entropy final states with high efficiency. We organize this letter as follows. In section II, we review stabilizer states and random Clifford structures. Most importantly, the entanglement entropy can be calculated much more efficiently compared to direct diagonalization methods. We also introduce key reinforcement learning concepts and provide the essential features of the PPO algorithm while explaining the reward profile that we used in training efficient disentanglers. In section III, we present the result of our numerical simulations. Our results enable the understanding of the pattern for efficient disentanglers, which is currently unattainable with the current random projection models studied in the MIPT literature. We conclude the letter with section IV, where we discuss modifications to the reinforcement learning algorithms and reward functions and comment on possible applications."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09761v1,"An EFT for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets: gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones, and phase transitions","We build and discuss a low energy effective field theory for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets in presence of an external magnetic field. Such an effective theory is simple yet rich, and features a number of phenomena such as the appearance of gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones and a “spin flop” phase transition, all within the regime of validity of the theory. We also discuss in detail, the quantization procedure of the free theory in the presence of a magnetic field, which is made non-trivial by the presence of a single-time derivative term. This class of materials make a precious test field for exotic phenomena in quantum field theory. Moreover, we explicitly perform the matching of the effective theory to the short distance theory of a specific anti-ferromagnet, namely, nickel oxide. The latter is particularly relevant in light of recent proposals of employing this material towards the hunt for light dark matter. As a byproduct of our study, we also re-evaluate the role played by discrete symmetries in magnetic materials, presenting it in a way that is completely consistent with the proper low energy EFT ideology.","Anti-ferromagnets are magnetic materials which, below a certain critical temperature, exhibit long range order but no net magnetization. Contrary to ferromagnets, they were initially thought to have limited practical applications Néel (1971). Recent years, however, have witnessed the development of a plethora of such applications, ranging from electron transport controlled by the spin degrees of freedom (e.g., Baibich et al., 1988; Binasch et al., 1989), the so-called spintronics, the development of quantum sensors (e.g., Lachance-Quirion et al., 2019, 2017), and, recently, light dark matter detection Esposito and Pavaskar (2023); Marsh et al. (2019). Moreover, magnetic materials, both ferromagnets and anti-ferromagnets, are typically regarded as the textbook example for the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the emergence of Goldstone bosons (e.g., Burgess, 2000). These are indeed nothing but the spin collective excitations of these systems, the so-called magnons. Yet, in reality, the spectrum of most anti-ferromagnets feature tiny but non-zero gaps. This can be attributed to magneto-crystalline anisotropies, which provide small effects of explicit symmetry breaking. This is due to the presence of certain energetically favorable directions for the spins of the material, which are dictated by the underlying crystal structure of the anti-ferromagnet. These anisotropies, along with the exchange interaction, in turn determine the ground state of the system as well its behavior under the application of an external magnetic field. In this work we extend the well known effective field theory (EFT) for magnons in anti-ferromagnet (e.g., Burgess, 2000; Chandra et al., 1990; Pavaskar et al., 2022) to include these anisotropic effects. In particular, we will consider the case where the system features two distinct anisotropies, the so-called “easy plane” anti-ferromagnets Rezende et al. (2019). The other class of anisotropic anti-ferromagnets, so-called “easy axis”, feature only one anisotropy, but their spectrum can be obtained from that the previous class, simply setting one the parameters to zero. We will show that this extended EFT, while being eventually rather simple, features a number of interesting phenomena, such as the presence of the so-called gapped Goldstones (e.g., Nicolis and Piazza, 2013; Nicolis et al., 2013; Watanabe et al., 2013; Cuomo et al., 2021), their lifting to pseudo-Goldstones, as well as the presence of the so-called “spin flop” phase transition triggered by a varying external magnetic field, where the spin alignment in the ground state suddenly changes its direction (e.g., Rezende et al., 2019). All this, is computable within the regime of validity of the EFT. Moreover, in the presence of a magnetic field, as we will see, the theory cannot be diagonalized by a local redefinition. Hence it requires a careful quantization procedure, which we address in this work. Finally, we match our EFT to the short distance theory for a particular anti-ferromagnet, namely nickel oxide (NiO). The latter, thanks to its simple structure and spin-interactions, is often considered as the prototypical room-temperature anti-ferromagnet. Indeed, this material has been used to study a number of different processes, such as inelastic light scattering (e.g., Grimsditch et al., 1998; Milano et al., 2004) and magnetic response to terahertz frequencies Sievers III and Tinkham (1963); Satoh et al. (2010). Moreover, as mentioned, it has recently been realized that such a system offers an optimal target to look for the scattering of dark matter with spin-dependent interactions and masses as low as the keV Esposito and Pavaskar (2023), as well as to look for axion-like dark matter with masses in the meV range Catinari et al. (2024). The goal of this work is also to present everything in a framework which can bridge the linguistic gap that is often present between the standard condensed matter and high energy physics literature. This is particularly important in light of the role that anti-ferromagnets might play in future searches for light dark matter, a genuinely high energy physics question which, however, requires condensed matter tools to be tackled. Conventions: We adopt natural units, \hbar=c=1, and an index notation such that i,j,k=1,2,3 label spatial coordinates. We also employ Einstein’s notation for summing over repeated indices."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09746v1,A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography,"The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large N. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.","A question whether given initial quantum states undergo equilibration and thermalization in closed many-body quantum systems is a deep problem in a wide range of physics, including statistical physics, high energy physics, quantum information, and so on. More concretely, for a given sufficiently high energy shell with energy window (E,E+\Delta E), the general initial state constructed from a superposition of energy eigenstates within the shell reaches a state close to the equilibrium ensemble, like the microcanonical ensemble, through unitary time evolution. It is known that the strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for this problem Neumann1929 ; Srednicki_1999 ; Deutsch_1991 . See Gogolin:2015gts ; D_Alessio_2016 ; Mori_2018 for reviews. The statement of the strong ETH is as follows: for any relevant operator \mathcal{O} in some thermodynamic limit and for any sufficiently high energy eigenstates \ket{E_{n}},\ket{E_{m}} in the energy shell, the matrix elements shows the following suppression for the microcanonical entropy S_{\mathrm{mc}}(E), \begin{split}\text{Diagonal}&\quad\absolutevalue{\bra{E_{n}}\mathcal{O}\ket{E_% {n}}-\expectationvalue{\mathcal{O}}_{\rm{mc}}^{E,\Delta E}}=e^{-O\quantity(S_{% \mathrm{mc}}(E))}\\ \text{Off-diagonal}&\quad\absolutevalue{\bra{E_{n}}\mathcal{O}\ket{E_{l}}}=e^{% -O\quantity(S_{\mathrm{mc}}(E))}.\end{split} (1.1) Here \expectationvalue{\mathcal{O}}_{\rm{mc}}^{E,\Delta E} denotes the expectation value of the microcanonical ensemble with energy E. There is considerable evidence that the ETH is valid in complex chaotic systems. For example, it is known that a typical Hamiltonian sampled from a Haar random unitary measure shows the above two conditions Neumann1929 ; Goldstein:2010ate . Also, it is known that for typical Hamiltonians with local interactions or some long-range interactions can show strong ETH for the local observables via elaborated random matrix theory Sugimoto:2020nnw ; Sugimoto:2021aao . Additionally, there are numerical computations for non-integrable spin chains in the thermodynamic limit where we take the large volume limit Kim:2014jfl . Thus, it is natural to expect that sufficiently chaotic quantum systems satisfy the strong ETH for some simple operators in some thermodynamic limit. However, it is not an easy task to show the strong ETH for a given single Hamiltonian since doing so requires almost all microstates information. Indeed, we need to compute all of the relevant matrix elements, \bra{E_{n}}\mathcal{O}\ket{E_{m}}, which seems hopeless for chaotic systems. Indeed, even though the ETH is expected to be hold in wide class of chaotic theories, there is a only a few concrete illustration for it and such examples are shown because of kinds of integrability. For example, in Tasaki:2024bvh , the strong ETH is shown in free fermion chain with specific case of ETH. As an alternative approach, we may think of the statistical collective behavior of the energy eigenstates in the energy shell. To this end, we introduce the set of energy eigenstates denoted by \mathcal{E}_{E,\Delta E} and consider a uniform measure on \mathcal{E}_{E,\Delta E}. Then, we consider the following probability, \Delta_{\mathrm{diag,ETH}}^{\epsilon}\quantity[\mathcal{O}]:=\mathrm{Prob}_{% \mathcal{E}_{E,\Delta E}}\quantity[\absolutevalue{\bra{E_{n}}\mathcal{O}\ket{E% _{n}}-\expectationvalue{\mathcal{O}}_{\rm{mc}}^{E,\Delta E}}>\epsilon], (1.2) for a small positive number \epsilon. This probability evaluates the ratio between the number of energy eigenstates in the shell which violate the diagonal ETH with the order \epsilon and the whole number of energy eigenstates in the shell. If the probability \Delta_{\mathrm{diag,ETH}}^{\epsilon}\quantity[\mathcal{O}] converges to zero in the thermodynamic limit, then we say that the system shows the weak ETH Biroli_2010erf . Actually, the weak ETH is too weak as it holds even in integrable systems and does not conclude the thermalization from any initial states Biroli_2010erf ; Mori:2016wet ; Iyoda:2017ftm . However, it provides some information on the thermalization. To see this, we notice that for any quantum many-body systems, any bounded operator \mathcal{O}, and any initial states constructed from the energy shell \ket{\psi_{0}}=\sum_{\ket{E_{n}}\in\mathcal{H}_{E,\Delta E}}c_{n}\ket{E_{n}}, (1.3) and for any positive number \epsilon, it holds that Mori:2016wet ; Mori_2018 , \begin{split}\absolutevalue{\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}dt\bra{% \psi(t)}\mathcal{O}\ket{\psi(t)}-\expectationvalue{\mathcal{O}}_{\rm{mc}}^{E,% \Delta E}}<\lVert\mathcal{O}\rVert_{\rm{op}}\quantity(\epsilon+\sqrt{\frac{D_{% E,\Delta E}}{D_{\rm{eff}}}\Delta_{\mathrm{diag,ETH}}^{\epsilon}\quantity[% \mathcal{O}]}).\end{split} (1.4) Here we meet only the initial state dependent quantity D_{\rm{eff}} called the effective dimension, which counts the effective number of energy eigenstates contributing to the initial state \ket{\psi_{0}}. This inequality states that if {\frac{D_{E,\Delta E}}{D_{\rm{eff}}}\Delta_{\mathrm{diag,ETH}}^{\epsilon}% \quantity[\mathcal{O}]}\leq e^{-O\quantity(S_{\mathrm{mc}}(E))} (1.5) holds and if we choose \epsilon in order of e^{-O\quantity(S_{\mathrm{mc}}(E))} , we can conclude the thermalization from the given initial state \ket{\psi_{0}}. Thus, for a given quantum many-body system, if we can find {\frac{D_{E,\Delta E}}{D_{\rm{eff}}}\Delta_{\mathrm{diag,ETH}}^{\epsilon}% \quantity[\mathcal{O}]}\leq e^{-O\quantity(S_{\mathrm{mc}}(E))} for any initial state, then we can conclude thermalization for any initial state. To confirm this condition, we need to consider the scaling of the involved quantities in the thermodynamic limit. In PhysRevLett.120.200604 , it is conjectured that for integrable systems, the actual scaling of \Delta_{\mathrm{diag,ETH}}^{\epsilon}\quantity[\mathcal{O}] will be \Delta_{\mathrm{diag,ETH}}^{\epsilon}\quantity[\mathcal{O}]\approx e^{-O% \quantity(S_{\mathrm{mc}}(E))}, (1.6) but for non-integrable systems, the scaling is conjectured to be \Delta_{\mathrm{diag,ETH}}^{\epsilon}\quantity[\mathcal{O}]\approx e^{-\#e^{O% \quantity(S_{\mathrm{mc}}(E))}},\;\#>0, (1.7) that is, doubly exponential in the thermodynamic entropy. Note that \# is some constant independent of S_{\mathrm{mc}}(E). If this is true for some non-integrable systems, the condition (1.4) holds for any initial state, and we can conclude thermalization for any initial state. In this paper, we try to prove the double exponential scaling (1.7) for some highly chaotic quantum many-body systems. Especially, we mainly consider what are called holographic systems as such chaotic systems. Roughly speaking, holographic systems are quantum many-body systems which have higher-dimensional gravity duals via the holographic principle Susskind:1994vu ; tHooft:1993dmi , such as the AdS/CFT correspondence Maldacena:1997re ; Witten:1998qj ; Gubser:1998bc , where the gravity dual is Einstein gravity in the low energy limit El-Showk:2011yvt ; Heemskerk:2009pn . The AdS/CFT correspondence states that some classes of d-dimensional quantum field theories are dual to string theory on (d+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime times some compact manifold. Well-known examples include ”four-dimensional \mathcal{N}=4 SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory”=”Type \mathrm{IIB} superstring theory on AdS{}_{5}\times\mathbb{S}^{5},” ”Schwarzian sector of the SYK model”=”AdS2 JT gravity” Kitaev ; Maldacena:2016hyu , and so on. Holographic theories usually have parameters expressing the effective number of degrees of freedom. For example, the central charge c in two-dimensional CFT, the number of gluon indices \sim N^{2} in SU(N) gauge theories, and the number of Majorana fermions in the SYK models. These parameters are directly related to the thermodynamic entropy. This means that the large degrees of freedom limit, like the large N limit or large central limit, can define the thermodynamic limit for the holographic theories. In this paper, we refer to this thermodynamic limit as the large N limit for all holographic theories. Importantly, the large N limit is the semi-classical limit G_{N}\to 0 of the dual gravity theories, which provides black hole thermodynamics Bekenstein:1972tm ; Bekenstein:1973ur ; Gibbons:1976ue ; Bardeen:1973gs ; Wald_1993 , representing the thermodynamics of the dual holographic theories. Notice that the large N limit defines a different thermodynamic limit from the large volume limit discussed in usual quantum many-body systems like quantum spin chains. The large N limit introduces a different type of thermodynamics and phase transitions, like Hawking/Page transitions dual to confinement/deconfinement phase transitions in large N gauge theories Hawking:1982dh ; Witten:1998zw . Interestingly, the large N limit induces phase transitions even in (0+1)-dimensional quantum mechanics like SYK models Maldacena:2018lmt . Importantly, black holes and holographic theories are considered to be highly chaotic Hayden:2007cs ; Sekino:2008he ; Shenker:2013pqa ; Maldacena:2015waa ; Cotler:2016fpe . Additionally, from the general relativity insights, massive heavy objects like stars undergo gravitational collapse and form black holes. Since black holes follow thermodynamics and are dual to thermal equilibrium ensembles in the dual holographic theories, these gravitational collapse processes are considered to be equilibration and thermalization in the dual holographic theories Chesler:2008hg ; Bhattacharyya:2009uu ; Abajo-Arrastia:2010ajo ; Aparicio:2011zy ; Balasubramanian:2011ur ; Hartman:2013qma ; Liu:2013iza ; Anous:2016kss . From these insights, we naively expect that holographic theories show strong ETH or the double exponential scaling (1.7) in some chaotic sector Fitzpatrick:2015zha . Related to these insights, there are several investigations of the ETH in large central charge CFTs, for example, Fitzpatrick:2015dlt ; Dymarsky2016SubsystemE ; Kraus:2016nwo ; Hikida:2018khg ; Brehm:2018ipf ; Basu:2017kzo ; Karlsson:2021duj , mainly using techniques like the conformal bootstrap and modular invariance specific to conformal field theory. There is also work on SYK models Sonner:2017hxc . Note that the problem of the ETH is highly related to the black hole information problems Hawking:1976bpg ; Maldacena:2001kr in the sense of how single pure states undergo gravitational collapse and mimic thermal equilibrium ensembles. In this paper, we attempt to prove the double exponential scaling (1.7) from some conditions that we expect to hold in highly chaotic systems. Key mathematical tools are concentration inequalities Concentration_Inequalities:A_Nonasymptotic_Theory_of_Independence ; Vershynin_2018 or the large deviation property of the probability (2.12) for large microcanonical entropy. We find that if the thermal Wightman correlators show the two conditions, quantum mixing conditions and the clustering conditions, then, we can conclude that the (2.12) and (2.14) is sub-Gaussian with an exponentially small parameter for the thermodynamic entropy. Here we refer to the quantum mixing condition as a statement the long time average of the thermal two point functions is exponentially small compared to the entropy. The clustering condition is that the higher order Wightman function can be decomposed to the products of the two point function in the long time average. As an example of theories showing sub-Gaussianity, we give large N generalized free fields (GFF) and 1/N perturbation for GFF, which are considered a toy model of the AdS/CFT correspondence. With these examples, we give some comments for more realistic holographic systems with wormhole contribution in the gravity path integrals. For examples, it is highly expected that the results in JT gravity Saad:2019pqd shows that the matter correlation functions satisfies sufficient conditions for strong ETH. We expect similar mechanisms work for higher dimension holographic theories like some kinds of two dimensional large central charge CFTs or some sector of large N gauge theories. In our discussion, conformal symmetry is not important. Rather it appears as a difficulty for strong ETH since the conformal algebra makes the spectrum highly degenerate and brakes non-resonance conditions. We will give a few comments on this problem. Also we find that the quantum mixing property of the Wightman function appears only when we take the energy window in exponentially small in typical quantum many body systems. This means the Sredniki’s ETH ansatz Srednicki_1999 hold only in very narrow energy window. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we provide a quick review of the strong and weak eigenstate thermalization hypotheses and the actual scaling of the probability (2.12). In section 3, we discuss the sets of sufficient conditions that derive the double exponential scaling. In section 4, we give simple holographic examples that satisfy the conditions. In 5 we give a discussion how our discussion for the thermalization and equilibration related to the Srednicki’s ETH ansatz. In section 6, we summarize our conclusions and discuss future problems. In Appendix A, we provide proofs of the propositions used in the paper. In Appendix B.1 we discuss some generalization of the theorem in the main part of the paper which is useful for conformal field theories. In Appendix C and D, we give some numerical evidence for the inequality used to show the small deviation from sub-Gaussianity."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09563v1,Numerical prediction of the steady-state distribution under stochastic resetting from measurements,"A common and effective method for calculating the steady-state distribution of a process under stochastic resetting is the renewal approach that requires only the knowledge of the reset-free propagator of the underlying process and the resetting time distribution. The renewal approach is widely used for simple model systems such as a freely diffusing particle with exponentially distributed resetting times. However, in many real-world physical systems, the propagator, the resetting time distribution, or both are not always known beforehand. In this study, we develop a numerical renewal method to determine the steady-state probability distribution of particle positions based on the measured system propagator in the absence of resetting combined with the known or measured resetting time distribution. We apply and validate our method in two distinct systems: one involving interacting particles and the other featuring strong environmental memory. Thus, the renewal approach can be used to predict the steady state under stochastic resetting of any system, provided that the free propagator can be measured and that it undergoes complete resetting.","Stochastic resetting (SR) refers to the abrupt random interruption of a dynamical process, followed by its immediate re-initiation [1, 2]. Repeated resettings of a diffusive process drive it to a nontrivial, out-of-equilibrium, steady state, which is characterized by a stationary density profile [1, 2, 3]. Stochastic resetting has been widely applied to model various physical and natural phenomena [2, 4, 5], including the height distribution of fluctuating interfaces [6, 7] and the thermodynamics governing cell division [8]. When resetting occurs at a constant rate with exponentially distributed times, the resulting steady-state density exhibits a Laplacian form determined by the ratio of the resetting rate to the diffusion coefficient [1]. The shape of the steady state position distributions depends on the resetting time distribution [9], on the resetting protocol, e.g. partial resetting, where resetting is done only part of the way to the origin [10, 11, 12, 13], and on the underlying process, e.g. processes with memory or ballistic motion [14, 15]. One method commonly used to calculate the steady-state position distribution function (PDF) under resetting is solving the renewal equation [1], \rho(x|x_{0})=r\int_{0}^{\infty}\Psi(t)C(x,t|x_{0})dt. (1) Here, x_{0} is the initial position, \Psi(t)=\int_{t}^{\infty}p(t)dt is the probability of a process to survive without resetting until time t, under a resetting time distribution p(t) with a constant mean resetting rate r, and C(x,t|x_{0}) is the conditional reset-free propagator which satisfies the initial condition C(x,t=0)=\delta(x-x_{0}). For example, the propagator of a Brownian particle is given by, C(x,t|x_{0})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi Dt}}e^{-\frac{(x-x_{0})^{2}}{4Dt}}. (2) where D is the diffusion coefficient. Under stochastic resetting, with instantaneous returns and exponentially distributed resetting times we obtain for t\geq 0, \rho(x|x_{0})=\sqrt{\frac{r}{4D}}e^{(-\sqrt{\frac{r}{D}}|x-x_{0}|)}, (3) where r is the mean resetting rate [1]. Importantly, the renewal equation indicates that the steady-state distribution of the system can be determined solely from the reset-free propagator and the resetting time distribution without the need for direct measurement. This has significant ramifications for the design of resetting protocols and for the analysis of systems in which the resetting appears naturally. Specifically, in applications such as accelerating state-to-state transitions [16] and search processes [2], the efficiency depends on the resetting rate [17]. Having the ability to evaluate the steady-state distribution at any resetting rate, based only on the knowledge of the free propagator, is highly desirable and is expected to reduce the characterization time significantly. However, in realistic and complex systems, the free propagator and the resetting time distributions are not always known in advance. For example, in many-body interacting systems, the free propagator is not readily calculated. The resetting time distribution in natural processes may be governed by the internal properties of the systems and can not be prescribed externally or known a-priory. In this paper, we tackle this issue by developing a numerical approach to solve the renewal equation based on measurements. Specifically, we measure the free propagator and, if needed, the resetting time distribution in cases where either the free propagator, the resetting time distribution, or both are unknown. We first validate our method by applying it to a single diffusing colloidal particle for which analytical results are known (Eq. 2 and Eq 3). We then apply our method to two different experimental systems. The first is a many-body system consisting of six colloidal particles undergoing stochastic resetting with holographic optical tweezers (HOT)[18], with exponentially distributed resetting times. We will refer to this system as the Colloidal system. The second system is a self-propelled particle moving through an array of mobile obstacles, which it can push aside as it moves. The particle is reset conditionally, either when it reaches the boundaries of the arena or, if it survived, after 20 seconds [19]. We will refer to this system as the Bug system."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09457v1,Scaling theory for the collapse of a trapped Bose gas in a synthetic magnetic field,"We have analytically explored both the zero temperature and the finite temperature scaling theory for the collapse of an attractively interacting 3-D harmonically trapped Bose gas in a synthetic magnetic field. We have considered short ranged (contact) attractive inter-particle interactions and Hartree-Fock approximation for the same. We have separately studied the collapse of both the condensate and the thermal cloud below and above the condensation point, respectively. We have obtained an anisotropy, artificial magnetic field, and temperature dependent critical number of particles for the collapse of the condensate. We have found a dramatic change in the critical exponent (from \alpha=1 to 0) of the specific heat (C_{v}\propto|T-T_{c}|^{\alpha}) when the thermal cloud is about to collapse with the critical number of particles (N=N_{c}) just below and above the condensation point. All the results obtained by us are experimentally testable within the present-day experimental set-up for the ultracold systems in the magneto-optical traps.","The observation of the Bose-Einstein condensation Anderson ; Davis ; Bradley as well as the collapse of an attractively interacting 3-D harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) Roberts drew an extensive attention of both the experimentalists and the theoreticians on the ultra-cold systems in magneto-optical traps over the last two decades Dalfovo ; Pitaevskii ; Stock ; Bloch ; Giorgini ; Fetter ; Dalibard ; Goldman ; Proukakis . The collapse of the BEC has a similarity with the gravitational collapse of a white-dwarf star Gerton . While essentially the outward Pauli pressure of the electrons (fermions) and the inward pressure due to the gravitation pull of He++ ions compete for the stability of a white-dwarf star Chandrasekhar , the outward quantum pressure due to the zero-point motion of the condensate and the inward pressure due to the attractive interactions of the bosons compete for the stability of the condensate Gerton . The attractive interactions dominate beyond a critical number of particles and cause the collapse of either of the systems Gerton . The Bose-Einstein condensate essentially becomes metastable due to attractive interactions and undergoes a macroscopic quantum tunnelling resulting in the collapse for the number of particles close to a critical number N_{c} Ueda . The theoretical study of the collapse of the harmonically trapped attractively interacting BEC well below the condensate point (T_{c}) started with nonliner dynamics with the Gross-Pitaevskii equation by Ruprecht et al from numerical point Ruprecht ; Pitaevskii of view and Pitaevskii from analytic point of view Pitaevskii2 soon after the observation of the Bose-Einstein condensation in the magneto-optical traps Anderson ; Davis ; Bradley . Dynamic properties of such a system in a time-dependent harmonic trap were also analytically studied this time Kagan . Parallelly, a static theory for the same was proposed with a scaling ansatz by Baym and Pethick Baym . Their scaling ansatz results in the critical number of particles for the collapse as N_{c}\simeq 0.671\frac{l}{a} Dalfovo ; Pitaevskii where l=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m\omega}} is the typical length scales of a single 3-D isotropic harmonic oscillator (particle of mass m and (angular) frequencies \omega_{x}=\omega_{y}=\omega_{z}=\omega) in the condensate and a=-a_{s}>0 is the magnitude of the s-wave scattering length (a_{s}<0) for the attractive inter-particle g\delta^{3}_{p}(\vec{r}) interactions111In 3-D, a particle truly is not scattered by another identical particle due to 3-D Dirac delta interaction V_{int}(\vec{r})=g\delta^{3}(\vec{r}) where g is the coupling constant. The scattering in 3-D, however, is possible for a 3-D renormalized Dirac delta interaction (V_{int}(\vec{r})=g\delta^{3}(\vec{r})\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\vec{r}) for which the scattering amplitude takes the form f(\theta,\phi)=-\frac{mg}{4\pi\hbar^{2}(1+ikmg/4\pi\hbar^{2})} for the momentum of incidence \hbar\vec{k} for the elastic scattering. Here, by g\delta_{p}^{3}(\vec{r}) interaction, we mean the renormalized Dirac delta interaction for a very low (\hbar\vec{k}) momentum of incidence. The s-wave scattering length in such a case takes the form a_{s}=\frac{mg}{4\pi\hbar^{2}} which becomes negative for g<0, i.e., for an attractive interaction. This result is same as the one within the Born approximation for the 3-D Dirac delta interaction g\delta^{3}(\vec{r}) Pitaevskii1 ; Bhattacharya . Later, the collapse and the subsequent growth/explosion of the condensate were also investigated both theoretically Sackett ; Adhikari and experimentally Donley . For the same system, the critical number of particles was numerically obtained as N_{c}=0.575\frac{l}{a} Ruprecht ; Dalfovo ; Pitaevskii . The typical length scale, however, is considered to be as \bar{l}=\big{[}\frac{\hbar}{m\omega_{x}}\frac{\hbar}{m\omega_{y}}\frac{\hbar}{% m\omega_{z}}]^{1/6} for an anisotropic trap as well as for an axially symmetric trap (\omega_{z}\neq\omega_{x}=\omega_{y}=\omega_{\perp}) Dalfovo . The critical number of particles was observed to be as N_{c}=[0.459\pm 0.012\pm 0.054]\frac{\bar{l}}{a} for 85Rb atoms in a nearly axially symmetric trap (\omega_{x}\simeq\omega_{y}\simeq\sqrt{\omega_{x}\omega_{y}}=\omega_{\perp}) with \frac{\omega_{z}}{\omega_{\perp}}=\frac{2\pi\times 6.80~{}\text{Hz}}{2\pi% \times 17.35~{}\text{Hz}}\simeq 0.39 Roberts . The collapse of the BEC beyond the mean-field approximation was also theoretically studied after this Scavage . An indication of the collapse was also mentioned even during an original observation of the BEC for 7Li atoms Bradley . The critical number of particles for the collapse of the BEC was further obtained numerically for long-ranged interactions which resulted in a better agreement with the experimental data Haldar ; Biswas . The effect of temperature on the collapse had also been studied parallelly from the theoretical point of view. The stability of the same system at a finite temperature was analyzed within the Hartree-Fock approximation Houbiers . Temperature dependence in the critical number for the collapse of the BEC was also obtained within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation with the Popov approach Davis2 . The collapse of the trapped Bose gas was also analytically studied separately for the BEC for T\rightarrow 0 and the thermal cloud for T\gg T_{c} within the Hartree-Fock approximation Mueller . The temperature dependence of the critical number was later studied by one of us as an extension of the Baym-Pethick scaling theory within the Hartree-Fock approximation for both the condensate and the thermal cloud together for 0\leq T<T_{c} Biswas2 . The applicability of the Hartree-Fock approximation though has a limitation for T\rightarrow T_{c}, it is useful for 0\leq T<T_{c} and results the condensate fraction in reasonably good agreement Giorgini2 ; Dalfovo ; Biswas3 with the experimental data Ensher . The creation of the artificial magnetic field Lin , on the other hand, has been drawing a lot of interest for two-photon Raman dressed (electrically neutral) ultracold atoms in a magneto-optical trap Lin2 ; Dalibard . The Bose-Einstein condensation and many other interesting phenomena such as superfluid Hall effect LeBlanc has observed in the artificial magnetic field. Landau level phenomena such as artificial Landau diamagnetism and artificial de Haas-van Alphen effect Biswas1 have also been theoretically studied for the neutral atoms in the artificial magnetic field Biswas4 . However, the collapse of the harmonically trapped Bose gas in artificial magnetic field has not been studied so far. We want to study the same from analytic point of view with a scaling theory for both the BEC and the thermal cloud separately within the Hartree-Fock approximation for the interacting potential of type g\delta^{3}_{p}(\vec{r}) for any two particles of separation r. Essentially, we want to extend both the zero temperature scaling theory and the finite temperature scaling theory for the collapse of the same system exposed to the artificial magnetic field below and above the condensation point. It is expected for a mean-field theory with the Hartree-Fock approximation that the critical exponent (\alpha) of the specific heat (C_{v}\propto|T-T_{c}|^{\alpha}) of the system becomes 0. This must be true when the system is stable. However, our system is not stable rather metastable. For such a system we would like to study the criticality of the specific heat when the thermal cloud is about to collapse with the critical number of particles (N=N_{c}) just below and above the condensation point. The calculation in this article begins in Section-2 with the Hamiltonian for an uncharged particle in a 3-D simple harmonic trap exposed to a uniform artificial magnetic field. Then we write the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the BEC in such a trap for short ranged attractive inter-particle interactions of the type g\delta^{3}_{p}(\vec{r}) for T\rightarrow 0. We describe our scaling ansatz for the collapse of the BEC as an extension of Baym-Pethick scaling theory for the consideration of the artificial magnetic field. Section-3 starts with the energy functional for the BEC with a perturbative finite temperature effect from the thermal cloud for 0\leq T\lnsim T_{c} with the consideration of the Hartree-Fock approximation. We describe our finite temperature scaling for collapse of the BEC for 0\leq T\lnsim T_{c} as an extension of the previous finite temperature scaling theory Biswas2 for the consideration of the artificial magnetic field. We also describe the collapse of the thermal cloud within the scaling theory for T\gg T_{c} and T\simeq T_{c} in Section-4. In this section, we also analyse the criticality of the specific heat (C_{v}\propto|T-T_{c}|^{\alpha}) when the thermal cloud is about to collapse with the critical number of particles (N=N_{c}) just below and above the condensation point. Finally, we conclude in Section-5."

We address this problem analytically for both hard-core and soft-core interactions, using minimal yet paradigmatic models in d spatial dimensions. In both cases, we derive analytical expressions for the spatial correlation profiles in the reference frame of the tracer. We reveal unexpected universal features in their large-distance behavior, characterized by power-law tails with exponents that depend solely on the spatial dimensionality of the system. Beyond these simple models, we demonstrate the robustness of our results across different regimes using particle-based numerical simulations.","References Squires and Mason [2010] T. M.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09172v1,Coarsening and universality on a growing surface,"We introduce a model in which particles belonging to two species proliferate with volume exclusion on an expanding surface. If the surface expands uniformly, we show that the domains formed by the two species present a critical behavior. We compute the critical exponents characterizing the decay of interfaces and the size distribution of domains using a mean-field theory. These mean-field exponents agree very accurately with those fitted in numerical simulations, suggesting that the theory is exact.","Many biological systems are composed of dense proliferating cells [1]. Due to proliferation, these systems often grow [2, 3], or alternatively, occupy a tissue undergoing its own expansion [4, 5]. From a theoretical perspective, the way a domain grows can profoundly affect dynamical processes taking place on it. For example, the formation of Turing patterns can be controlled by domain growth [6, 7, 8]. The case of uniform stretch, besides being the simplest, has revealed peculiar properties, akin to those of critical systems, in morphogen gradient dynamics [9] and in disordered packing [10]. More generally, domain growth can generate long-term temporal correlations in dynamics. Examples include genetic drift at the growing perimeter of a bacteria colonies and tumors [11, 12, 13], and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang dynamics in liquid crystals [14]. Complex behavior due to expansion emerges in discrete (lattice) models as well, where surface growth can control competition outcomes by affecting spatial correlations [15, 16]. In this work, we present a model in which two neutral species proliferate on an expanding surface with volume exclusion. We call the model the “growing voter model”, in analogy with the traditional voter model in non-equilibrium statistical physics. We demonstrate that coarsening in the growing voter model becomes critical for uniform growth. We calculate the critical exponents associated with the decay of interfaces and the cluster size distribution by a mean-field approach. Simulation results are consistent with the mean-field exponents to a high degree of accuracy, suggesting that the mean-field solution is exact."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09687v1,"Superposition of plane waves in high spatial dimensions:
from landscape complexity to the deepest minimum value","In this article, we introduce and analyse some statistical properties of a class of models of random landscapes of the form {\cal H}({\bf x})=\frac{\mu}{2}{\bf x}^{2}+\sum_{l=1}^{M}\phi_{l}({\bf k}_{l}% \cdot{\bf x}),\,\,{\bf x}\in\mathbb{R}^{N},\,\,\mu>0 where both the functions \phi_{l}(z) and vectors {\bf k}_{l} are random. An important example of such landscape describes superposition of M plane waves with random amplitudes, directions of the wavevectors, and phases, further confined by a parabolic potential of curvature \mu. Our main efforts are directed towards analysing the landscape features in the limit N\to\infty,M\to\infty keeping \alpha=M/N finite. In such a limit we find (i) the rates of asymptotic exponential growth with N of the mean number of all critical points and of local minima known as the annealed complexities and (ii) the expression for the mean value of the deepest landscape minimum (the ground-state energy). In particular, for the latter we derive the Parisi-like optimisation functional and analyse conditions for the optimiser to reflect various phases for different values of \mu and \alpha: replica-symmetric, one-step and full replica symmetry broken, as well as criteria for continuous, Gardner and random first order transitions between different phases.","High-dimensional random landscapes play a central role in the description of many complex systems, ranging from spin-glasses to non-convex optimisation problems underlying inference and machine learning models, all the way to modelling biological fitness, see [1] for a review on this subject and further references. One of the central questions associated to these landscapes is to describe properties of its global minimum, also frequently called in the spin glass context the ground-state energy, and developing methods and/or algorithms to reach the ground-state configuration. Recent years have seen phenomenal progress in obtaining accurate approximate solutions of such problems via machine-learning algorithms, whose use has now become widespread. A detailed description of the arrangement and properties of critical points (maxima, minima and saddles) as well as understanding statistics of the ground state and associated Hessians in the simplest models of random landscapes already provided a deeper understanding of such non-convex optimisation problems and helped to create efficient algorithms, see [2, 3] for discussions of recent developments. A large body of literature in theoretical physics as well as in mathematics has been devoted in recent years to studying these questions in the framework of a few simple models, mainly with Gaussian disorder. Obviously, adding to the pool of analytically tractable models is of considerable interest both to get closer to realistic situations and to investigate questions of universality. In this article, we will analyse both the mean ground-state energy and the problem of counting the number of critical points and local minima for random landscapes {\cal H}({\bf x}) of a particular form {\cal H}({\bf x})=\frac{\mu}{2}{\bf x}^{2}+\sum_{l=1}^{M}\phi_{l}({\bf k}_{l}% \cdot{\bf x}),\,\,\mu>0 (1) defined on a continuous configuration space {\bf x}\in\mathbb{R}^{N}. Here the disordered part is the sum of M random stationary processes \phi_{l}(z) with zero mean \mathbb{E}\left[\phi_{l}(z)\right]=0, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) for different l, whose statistical properties remain invariant with respect to translations in the argument z\to z+a for any real shift a. Two explicit particular examples of such functions \phi_{l}(z) are described in more detail below, and we frequently concentrate on them in our exposition, but most of the obtained results remain valid for a larger class of functions satisfying the assumption of stationarity. 1. Our first example corresponds to Gaussian-distributed stationary random processes \phi_{l}(z) with zero mean, all the statistical properties being therefore controlled by the covariance, which is assumed to be of the form \mathbb{E}_{\phi}\left[\phi_{l}(z)\phi_{m}(z^{\prime})\right]=\delta_{lm}R% \left(|z-z^{\prime}|\right)\;,\;\;R(w)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{dq}{2\pi}% \tilde{R}(|q|)\cos(qw)\;. (2) Realisations of such random functions are most conveniently generated via introducing its Fourier transform \phi_{l}(z)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{dq}{2\pi}\,\left[u_{l}(q)\cos(qz)+v_{% l}(q)\sin(qz)\right] (3) with Gaussian-distributed delta-correlated Fourier coefficients \mathbb{E}\left[u_{l}(q_{1})u_{m}(q_{2})\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[v_{l}(q_{1})v_% {m}(q_{2})\right]=2\pi\delta_{lm}\tilde{R}(|q_{1}|)\delta(q_{1}+q_{2})\;,\;\;% \mathbb{E}\left[u_{l}(q_{1})v_{m}(q_{2})\right]=0\;. (4) One of the simplest representative of this class is the process \phi_{l}(z)=u_{l}\cos(z)+v_{l}\sin(z)\;, (5) where u_{l},v_{l} are i.i.d. standard real normal random variables (with zero mean and unit variance). In this particular case characterized by the covariance \mathbb{E}\left[\phi(z)\phi(z^{\prime})\right]=\cos(z-z^{\prime}) some properties of the arising random landscape Eqs.(1), notably its expected number of critical points, have been investigated in our earlier paper [4]. 2. Another class of random functions considered in our present paper corresponds to random fields explicitly constructed as \phi_{l}(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\gamma^{(n)}_{l}\cos\left(n\left(z+\theta^{(n)}% _{l}\right)\right)\;, (6) with phases \theta^{(n)}_{l}’s that are i.i.d. random variables for different n, uniformly distributed over [0,2\pi), which ensures stationarity of the process. The random amplitudes \gamma^{(n)}_{l} are independent of the phases \theta^{(n)}_{l}, independent between different n, and can be drawn from any distributions with a finite value of \mathbb{E}\left[\left|\phi_{l}(z)\right|\right]<\infty. Every realization of such processes is obviously 2\pi-periodic. The simplest example of such periodic random functions corresponds to including only the first harmonic (n=1) in the above sum \phi_{l}(z)=\gamma_{l}\cos(z+\theta_{l})\;. (7) Note that choosing in (7) \gamma_{l}>0 with the probability density p(\gamma_{l})=\gamma_{l}e^{-\frac{\gamma^{2}_{l}}{2}} makes this case equivalent to (5). In Eq. (1) the random functions \phi_{l}(z) are evaluated at random argument values z_{l}={\bf k}_{l}\cdot{\bf x} where {\bf k}_{l}’s are wavevectors taken either as i.i.d. random vectors uniformly sampled on the sphere \sqrt{N}{\cal S}_{N-1} or, alternatively, as vectors with N i.i.d. normally distributed entries, each with zero mean value and variance 1/N. It is worth noting that the random potential built by superposition of \phi_{l}(z) described in (7) has an interesting connection to the context of semiclassical chaos. In the latter framework one may consider a Riemannian manifold {\cal D} with strongly chaotic classical flow, and exploit the so-called Berry’s conjecture[5] for the eigenfunctions of the associated quantum Laplacian -\Delta\psi_{n}({\bf x})=E_{n}\,\psi_{n}({\bf x})\;,\;\;{\bf x}\in{\cal D}% \subset\mathbb{R}^{N}\;, (8) where \Delta is the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator together with appropriate boundary conditions. For the case of Euclidean space the latter is the usual Laplacian and the eigenfunctions can be expressed as a sum over plane waves with fixed length of the wave vectors: \psi_{n}({\bf x})=\sum_{l}\gamma_{l}\cos({\bf k}_{n,l}\cdot{\bf x}+\theta_{l})% \;,\;\;{\bf k}_{n,l}^{2}=E_{n}\;. (9) According to Berry such eigenfunctions for high enough eigenvalues E_{n} should be described in the form Eq. (9) with i.i.d. Gaussian amplitudes \gamma_{l} and taking the wavevectors {\bf k}_{n,l} independent and randomly equidistributed over the unit sphere of radius \sqrt{E_{n}}. The random part of the potential defined in Eq. (1) is then identical with a specific realisation of such semi-classical chaotic wave-function \psi_{n}({\bf x}), considering the number of contributing wavevectors to be essentially infinite: M=\infty. In that context the problem of analysing statistics of minima, maxima and saddles of arising wavefunctions and closely related random fields on two-dimensional manifolds N=2, as well as of topology of the associated nodal set was intensively studied over the years both in mathematical [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] as well as physical (see e.g. [11]) literature. The statistics of the height of the global maximum for such eigenfunctions has been addressed in that context as well [12]. In the present paper we analyse not dissimilar questions employing however a somewhat different limit N,M\to\infty\;,\;\;{\rm with}\;\;\alpha=\frac{M}{N}=O(1)\;. (10) Although we do not pursue this line explicitly in the paper, we believe some of our results may still be relevant for statistical properties of the chaotic semi-classical wave-functions on high-dimensional manifolds, after interpreting the parameter \mu as the inverse squared radius of the domain occupied by the wavefunction and further considering \alpha\to\infty. Whether our results for finite \alpha may still have some meaning in the context of semiclassical quantum chaos on high-dimensional manifolds remains an interesting open question. To put our research in a proper context let us recall that random potential landscapes of the form Eq. (1) but with random part replaced with a Gaussian-distributed function V({\bf x}) with zero average \mathbb{E}\left[V({\bf x})\right]=0 and covariance of the form \mathbb{E}\left[V({\bf x}_{1})V({\bf x}_{2})\right]=N\,F\left(\frac{({\bf x}_{% 1}-{\bf x}_{2})^{2}}{2N}\right)\; (11) have been attracting much of attention in the disordered systems’ literature since the 90’s as a toy model for an elastic manifold of zero internal dimension placed in a random potential. Its dynamical properties [13, 14], thermodynamic properties [15, 16, 17, 18, 19], the number of critical points [20, 21] and Hessian spectrum at the ground state [22] have all been studied extensively in the physical literature, predominantly by the heuristic replica approach. The rigorous mathematical studies of the toy model as well as its extensions to elastic manifolds of finite internal dimension have been very recently developed in greater generality as well[23, 24, 25, 26]. Most importantly, it has been established that this class of random landscapes displays a glass-like ergodicity breaking transition which translates into many observables of these disordered systems. The perhaps simplest characterisation for this transition is obtained by computing the so-called ""annealed complexity"" of critical points, defined in the high-dimensional limit N\to\infty as \Sigma_{\rm tot}(\mu)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\ln\mathbb{E}\left[{\cal N}_% {\rm tot}\right]\;, (12) where {\cal N}_{\rm tot} denotes the total number of stationary points of the random landscape. The topology trivialisation transition [20, 21, 27, 28] describes the transition in the number of critical points from exponential in N to sub-exponential beyond a critical value of the control parameters (in the present model its role is played by the curvature parameter \mu). The true location of the ergodicity breaking/topology trivialization transition should however be obtained from the point of vanishing of the associated quenched complexity, defined instead as \Xi_{\rm tot}(\mu)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1}{N}\ln{\cal N}_{% \rm tot}\right] and thus upper-bounded by the annealed complexity. Although in general the quenched and annealed complexities are expected to differ, they nevertheless were found to coincide in a few cases of the models of not dissimilar nature, see [29, 30]. Similar annealed complexities can be computed for the number of minima [31], as well as for critical points of any index conditioned on the height of the landscape, see [32, 33]. The latter is especially important as it allowed to relate the annealed complexities computations to the properties of the ground state, the ultimate goal of optimisation problems. An alternative characterisation of the ergodicity breaking transition in the landscape paradigm can be obtained by computing the mean (which is simultaneously typical) value of the ground-state energy e_{0}=\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\min_{{\bf x}}{\cal H}({\bf x})=\lim_{N\to%"
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09631v1,NEP-MB-pol: A unified machine-learned framework for fast and accurate prediction of water’s thermodynamic and transport properties,"Water’s unique hydrogen-bonding network and anomalous properties present significant challenges for accurately modeling its structural, thermodynamic, and transport behavior across varied conditions. Although machine-learned potentials have advanced the prediction of individual properties, a unified computational framework capable of simultaneously capturing water’s complex and subtle properties with high accuracy has remained elusive. Here, we address this challenge by introducing NEP-MB-pol, a highly accurate and efficient neuroevolution potential trained on extensive MB-pol reference data with coupled-cluster-level accuracy, combined with path-integral molecular dynamics and quantum-correction techniques to incorporate nuclear quantum effects. This NEP-MB-pol framework reproduces experimentally measured structural, thermodynamic, and transport properties of water across a broad temperature range, achieving simultaneous, fast, and accurate prediction of self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Our approach provides a unified and robust tool for exploring thermodynamic and transport properties of water under diverse conditions, with significant potential for broader applications across research fields.","I Methods The NEP model. In the NEP approach, the site energy U_{i} of atom i can be written as U_{i}=\sum_{\mu=1}^{N_{\mathrm{neu}}}w^{(1)}_{\mu}\tanh\left(\sum_{\nu=1}^{N_{% \mathrm{des}}}w^{(0)}_{\mu\nu}q^{i}_{\nu}-b^{(0)}_{\mu}\right)-b^{(1)}, (1) where \tanh(x) is the activation function, \mathbf{w}^{(0)}, \mathbf{w}^{(1)}, \mathbf{b}^{(0)}, and b^{(1)} are the weight and bias parameters. The descriptor q_{i}^{\nu} is an abstract vector whose components group into radial and angular parts. The radial descriptor components q_{n}^{i} (0\leq{n}\leq n_{\rm max}^{\rm R}) are defined as q_{n}^{i}=\sum_{j\neq{i}}g_{n}(r_{ij}), (2) where r_{ij} is the distance between atoms i and j and g_{n}(r_{ij}) are a set of radial functions, each of which is formed by a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials. The angular components include n-body (n=3,4,5) correlations. For the 3-body part, the descriptor components are defined as (0\leq{n}\leq n_{\rm max}^{\rm A}, 1\leq{l}\leq l_{\rm max}^{\rm 3body}) q_{nl}^{i}=\sum_{m}(-1)^{m}A_{nlm}^{i}A_{nl(-m)}^{i}; (3) A_{nlm}^{i}=\sum_{j\neq i}g_{n}(r_{ij})Y_{lm}(\hat{\bm{r}}_{ij}). (4) Here, Y_{lm} are the spherical harmonics and \hat{\bm{r}}_{ij} is the unit vector of \bm{r}_{ij}. Note that the radial functions g_{n}(r_{ij}) for the radial and angular descriptor components can have different cutoff radii, which are denoted as r_{\rm c}^{\rm R} and r_{\rm c}^{\rm A}, respectively. These and other hyperparameters used in our NEP-MB-pol and NEP-SCAN models are presented in Supplementary Notes 1. Density-functional theory. The SCAN dataset is generated using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP, version 6.3.0)[68] to calculate energy, force, and virial. The SCAN energy functional is employed to model the exchange-correlation energy. To account for the non-spherical contributions to the gradient correction within the PAW sphere, the flag LASPH is set to TRUE. A kinetic energy cutoff of 1500 eV is applied for the plane waves, with a reciprocal space sampling grid spacing of 0.5 Å-1. The self-consistent field (SCF) iterations are considered converged when the difference in total energy and band structure is below 10-6 eV. Molecular dynamics. For all the MD simulations for computing the physical properties presented in the main text, the simulation system is a periodic cubic box with 24\,567 atoms, which has a dimension of about 6.2 nm in each direction. The time step for integration is set to 0.5 fs for both classical and path-integral MD simulations. To calculate the density of water at each temperature, the system is equilibrated for 50 ps in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. The pressure of the system is set to 1 bar, and the temperature is varied from 280 K to 370 K with an interval of 10 K. Isobaric heat capacity. The isobaric heat capacity Cp is defined as the rate of change of enthalpy H with respect to temperature under constant pressure conditions: C_{p}=(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T})_{P} (5) where, H=U+PV, and U,T,P,V represent the internal energy, temperature, pressure, and volume, respectively. Substituting this expression into the above formula, we obtain the following convenient relation for calculating isobaric heat capacity in molecular dynamics simulations C_{p}=\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}+P\frac{\partial V}{\partial T} (6) To compute Cp, the value of H is calculated at a series of temperature points with the same pressure P. A quadratic function is then fitted to the relationship between H and T, and its first derivative provides the Cp as a function of T. Self-diffusion coefficient. The running SDC for water is calculated using the following Green-Kubo relation: D(t)=\frac{1}{3}\int_{\tau=0}^{t}C_{vv}(\tau)\rm{d}\tau (7) where the velocity auto-correlation function is defined as C_{vv}(\tau)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^{N}\langle\mathbf{v}_{i}(0)\cdot\mathbf{v}_{i% }(\tau)\rangle.. Here, N is the number of atoms in the systems, and \mathbf{v}_{i} is the velocity of atom i. Shear viscosity. The shear viscosity is defined as \eta=\frac{1}{3}\left(\eta_{xy}+\eta_{xz}+\eta_{yz}\right), where the running integral of \eta_{\alpha\beta} is calculated using the following Green-Kubo relation: \eta_{\alpha\beta}(t)=\frac{V}{k_{\rm B}T}\int_{0}^{t}C_{PP}(\tau)\rm{d}\tau. (8) Here, C_{PP}(\tau)=\langle(P_{\alpha\beta}(0)-\langle P_{\alpha\beta}\rangle)(P_{% \alpha\beta}(\tau)-\langle P_{\alpha\beta}\rangle)\rangle is the pressure auto-correlation function, V is the volume, k_{\rm B} is Boltzmann’s constant, T is temperature, and P_{\alpha\beta} is the pressure tensor. Thermal conductivity. Similarly, we can use a Green–Kubo relation to calculate thermal conductivity: \kappa(t)=\frac{1}{k_{\rm B}T^{2}V}\int_{0}^{t}dt^{\prime}\langle\mathbf{J}(t^% {\prime})\cdot\mathbf{J}(0)\rangle, (9) where \mathbf{J}(t) is the heat current and \langle\mathbf{J}(t^{\prime})\cdot\mathbf{J}(0)\rangle is the heat current auto-correlation function. For liquid system, the heat current has two contributions, \mathbf{J}=\mathbf{J}^{\rm k}+\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}. The kinetic term is \mathbf{J}^{\rm k}=\sum_{i}{\mathbf{v}_{i}E_{i}}, where, E_{i} and \mathbf{v}_{i} are the total energy and velocity of atom i, respectively. The potential term for many-body potentials is [69] \mathbf{J}^{\rm p}=\sum_{i}\mathbf{W}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{v}_{i}, where \mathbf{W}_{i}=\sum_{j\neq i}\mathbf{r}_{ij}\otimes\frac{\partial U_{j}}{% \partial\mathbf{r}_{ji}} is the virial tensor of aotm i and \mathbf{r}_{ij}=\mathbf{r}_{j}-\mathbf{r}_{i}, \mathbf{r}_{i} being thee position of atom i. According to the decomposition of the heat current, the thermal conductivity can be decomposed into three terms: \kappa(t)=\kappa^{\rm pp}(t)+\kappa^{\rm kk}(t)+\kappa^{\rm pk}(t), where the potential-potential term \kappa^{\rm pp}, the kinetic-kinetic term \kappa^{\rm kk}, and the cross term \kappa^{\rm pk} correspond to the following heat current auto-correlation functions: \langle\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}(t)\cdot\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}(0)\rangle, \langle\mathbf{J}^{\rm k}(t)\cdot\mathbf{J}^{\rm k}(0)\rangle, and \langle\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}(t)\cdot\mathbf{J}^{\rm k}(0)\rangle+\langle\mathbf{J% }^{\rm k}(t)\cdot\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}(0)\rangle. Besides, we use the homogeneous nonequilibrium MD method [64] to calculate the thermal conductivity of water. In this method, an external driving force \mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{ext}}=E_{i}\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{e}}+\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm% {e}}\cdot\mathbf{W}_{i} is exerted on each atom i, driving the system out of equilibrium. Here, \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{e}} is the driving force parameter with the dimension of inverse length. In this work, the magnitude of F_{\mathrm{e}} was chosen as 0.001 Å-1, which has been tested to be small enough to keep the system within the linear response regime. The driving force will induce an ensemble-averaged steady-state non-equilibrium heat current \mathbf{J}, which is related to the thermal conductivity tensor \kappa^{\alpha\beta}: \frac{\left\langle J^{\alpha}\right\rangle}{TV}=\sum_{\beta}\kappa^{\alpha% \beta}F_{\mathrm{e}}^{\beta}.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09615v1,Noise-driven odd elastic waves in living chiral active matter,"Chiral active matter is predicted to exhibit odd elasticity, with nontraditional elastic response arising from a combination of chirality, being out of equilibrium, and the presence of nonreciprocal interactions. One of the resulting phenomena is the possible occurrence of odd elastic waves in overdamped systems, although its experimental realization still remains elusive. Here we show that in overdamped active systems, noise is required to generate persistent elastic waves. In the chiral crystalline phase of active matter, such as that found recently in populations of swimming starfish embryos, the noise arises from self-driving of active particles and their mutual collisions, a key factor that has been missing in previous studies. We identify the criterion for the occurrence of noise-driven odd elastic waves, and postulate the corresponding phase diagram for the general chiral active crystals. Our results can be used to predict the experimental conditions for achieving a transition to self-sustained elastic waves in overdamped active systems.","References Toner et al. [2005] J. Toner, Y.

We discuss the conditions on couplings that enable perfect state transfer, examine how heat currents scale when the chains are coupled to thermal baths, explore the role of tridiagonal matrices in approximating the entanglement Hamiltonian and investigate bulk and boundary entanglement negativity and correlation decay. These findings underscore some of the distinctive physical behavior of inhomogeneous spin chains and their potential applications in quantum information and thermal transport.","Spin chains offer a fruitful test-bed to study entanglement and non-equilibrium steady states in quantum many-body systems. While most of these analyses have focused on homogeneous models with uniform couplings between neighboring sites, realistic physical systems often contain defects and inhomogeneities. This can be addressed by considering spin chains with non-homogeneous couplings and it turns out that the corresponding models exhibit a range of intriguing and specific properties, including perfect state transfer (PST) and fractional revival (FR). Nevertheless, inhomogeneous chains remain comparatively much less explored relative to their homogeneous counterparts. Recent works realized with collaborators have initiated a systematic examination of inhomogeneous XX spin chains. This paper reviews key findings from these studies. In Sec. 2, we introduce the Hamiltonian of the generic non-uniform XX spin chain and present its connection with a free fermion model. We further outline the standard approach to diagonalizing this Hamiltonian and highlight the links to the theory of orthogonal polynomials. Section 3 reviews the perfect state transfer protocol, detailing the special role of inhomogeneous chains in this context. Section 4 addresses the behavior of these chains in open settings when coupled to thermal baths, with a focus on the scaling of heat currents and their relation to PST. Sections 5, 6 and 7 explore entanglement and correlation properties in these models, emphasizing a simple tridiagonal matrix that commutes with the truncated correlation matrix and approximates the entanglement Hamiltonian, as well as unusual boundary correlation decay."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09448v1,Diffusive dynamics of charge regulated macro-ion solutions,"Onsager’s variational principle is generalized to address the diffusive dynamics of an electrolyte solution composed of charge-regulated macro-ions and counterions. The free energy entering the Rayleighian corresponds to the Poisson-Boltzmann theory augmented by the charge-regulation mechanism. The dynamical equations obtained by minimizing the Rayleighian include the classical Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations, the Debye-Falkenhagen equation, and their modifications in the presence of charge regulation. By analyzing the steady state, we show that the charge regulation has an important impact on the non-equilibrium macro-ion spatial distribution and their effective charge, deviating significantly from their equilibrium values. Our model, based on Onsager’s variational principle offers a unified approach to the diffusive dynamics of electrolytes containing components that undergo various charge association/dissociation processes.","References [1] Lund, M.; Jönsson, B.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09388v1,A survey of probabilistic generative frameworks for molecular simulations,"Generative artificial intelligence is now a widely used tool in molecular science. Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: Neural Spline Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) Neural Spline Flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) Conditional Flow Matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models appears the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib9 peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.","In recent years, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to produce convincing images, text, audio, and videoRombach et al. (2022a); Achiam et al. (2023); Ho et al. (2022). The domain of applicability of generative AI has recently extended to the molecular sciences Tiwary et al. (2024), where generative AI has demonstrated the ability to predict protein tertiary structure from amino acid sequence Zheng et al. (2024); Jumper et al. (2021); Abramson et al. (2024); Krishna et al. (2024), protein-ligand complex tertiary structure from chemical identity Qiao et al. (2024); Corso et al. (2022) and the temperature dependence of the equilibrium distribution of solvated molecular systems Noé et al. (2018); Wang et al. (2022); Herron et al. (2023). While these methods differ in many aspects, all generative models share the common goal of sampling from an unknown underlying probability distribution based on an empirical dataset. While there are many classes of generative models, recently, probabilistic generative models have seen widespread usage. These models represent a framework that broadly encompasses flow-based Dinh et al. (2016); Tong et al. (2023a) and diffusion modelsSong et al. (2021). The probabilistic generative framework explicitly seeks to directly model the data distribution through a series of invertible transformations (in flow-based models) or by iteratively refining noisy samples back into data space (in diffusion models), providing a flexible method for generating new data points that obey the underlying distribution of the observed data. There is now a range of probabilistic generative models for use in different domains. Arguably, the most popular ones include Neural spline FlowsDurkan et al. (2019) (NS) models, Conditional Flow MatchingLipman et al. (2022a) (CFM) models, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic ModelsHo et al. (2020) (DDPM). All of these have already been used for exciting and novel applications, including sound field reconstruction Karakonstantis et al. (2024) (NS), zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis Kim et al. (2023) (CFM), and medical image segmentation Guo et al. (2023) (DDPM), demonstrating the utility of probabilistic generative models across different modalities. We describe these methods in Section III. However, the scientific literature in this field lacks a systematic comparison of these methods for benchmark problems with tunable complexities that could establish the conditions under which one particular framework out of NS, CFM, and DDPM might be advantageous. This is particularly true for applications to molecular systems. In this work, we address this gap by carefully applying NS, CFM, and DDPM to different benchmark systems. We realize that the field is moving extremely quickly, with new variants of flow and diffusion methods appearing regularly. In this vein, we expect that the datasets used here will serve as useful benchmarks for these new methods. Our systems include a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and an explicit water molecular dynamics trajectory for the Aib9 peptide Mehdi et al. (2022); Botan et al. (2007), where we collect information on the \{\Phi,\Psi\}_{i} dihedral angles for all 9 residues. For the Gaussian mixture model dataset, we are interested in how generative model accuracy scales with data dimensionality and with training dataset size and which model best estimates probability density differences between asymmetric modes in the training dataset. We also measure sample generation speed and model network size as data dimensionality varies. For Aib9, we are interested in model performance on molecular dynamics data at varying levels of complexity, which we tune by looking at different residues within the peptide. We also examine model accuracy in the low training data limit for the Aib9 dataset. Overall, our findings are: • NS exhibits superior performance estimating probability density differences. However, NS accuracy decreases for high-dimensional data. • CFM displays the highest accuracy at high dimensionality but diminished performance in the presence of complex, multiple modes. • DDPM most accurately models the complex, multimodal Aib9 dihedral angle distribution. However, DDPM is less accurate than other methods at high data dimensionality."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09309v1,A Krylov space approach to Singular Value Decomposition in non-Hermitian systems,"We propose a novel tridiagonalization approach for non-Hermitian random matrices and Hamiltonians using singular value decomposition (SVD). This technique leverages the real and non-negative nature of singular values, bypassing the complex eigenvalues typically found in non-Hermitian systems. We analyze the tridiagonal elements, namely the Lanczos coefficients and the associated Krylov (spread) complexity, appropriately defined through the SVD, across several examples including Ginibre ensembles and the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We demonstrate that in chaotic cases, the complexity exhibits a distinct peak due to the repulsion between singular values, a feature absent in integrable cases. Using our approach, we analytically compute the Krylov complexity for two-dimensional non-Hermitian random matrices within a subset of non-Hermitian symmetry classes including time-reversal, time-reversal†, chiral, and sublattice symmetry.","Although chaos is well-understood in classical systems, its definition in the quantum domain remains elusive, often relying on statistical correlations amongst the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H describing the system Haake (1991); Bohigas et al. (1984); Wigner (1955); Dyson (1962); Oganesyan and Huse (2007); Atas et al. (2013); Brézin and Hikami (1997); Cotler et al. (2017); del Campo et al. (2017). The eigenvalues E_{i} are obtained by standard diagonalization H=W\Lambda W^{\dagger}, where W is a unitary and \Lambda=\mathrm{diag}(E_{1},\cdots,E_{n}). Instead of diagonalization, it is often useful to consider tridiagonalizing the Hamiltonians, as an efficient alternative. This approach has two clear advantages. First, finding the eigenvalues through tridiagonalization is substantially faster, as demonstrated by the seminal work of Dumitriu and Edelman Dumitriu and Edelman (2002) in random matrix theory (RMT) Mehta (1991). Second, from a physics perspective, utilizing powerful recursion methods, this approach broadly aims to ‘reduce practically any problem to one dimension’, with a chain model represented by a Hamiltonian where only nearest-neighbor interactions are present Viswanath and Müller (2008). For Hermitian systems, tridiagonalization can be achieved as H=P\Lambda_{h}P^{\dagger}, where P is unitary and \Lambda_{h} is a tridiagonal matrix whose eigenvalues are identical to those of H. The tridiagonal matrix elements, known as the Lanczos coefficients, are straightforwardly obtained in the Krylov space approach Lanczos (1950); Viswanath and Müller (2008). These coefficients describe hopping amplitudes in a chain known as the Krylov chain 1d Krylov chain and are crucial for revealing how the eigenvalue correlations manifest in early and late-time dynamics of complex quantum systems. Understanding these dynamics for unitary evolution has been at the forefront of active research in recent years Parker et al. (2019); Barbón et al. (2019); Dymarsky and Gorsky (2020); Jian et al. (2021); Rabinovici et al. (2021); Cao (2021); Dymarsky and Smolkin (2021); Kar et al. (2022); Caputa et al. (2022); Rabinovici et al. (2022); Balasubramanian et al. (2022); Hörnedal et al. (2022); Bhattacharjee et al. (2022a, b); Balasubramanian et al. (2023a); Avdoshkin et al. (2024); Erdmenger et al. (2023); Craps et al. (2024a); Balasubramanian et al. (2023b); see Nandy et al. (2024a) for a comprehensive review. In certain scenarios, for instance, for a system interacting with a dissipative environment, the Hermiticity condition must be relaxed. Such a system is described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, leading to entirely new dynamics in Krylov space Bhattacharya et al. (2022); Liu et al. (2023); Bhattacharjee et al. (2023); Bhattacharya et al. (2023); Srivatsa and von Keyserlingk (2024); Bhattacharjee et al. (2024); Beetar et al. (2024); Bhattacharya et al. (2024a); Carolan et al. (2024); Bhattacharya et al. (2024b). Due to non-Hermiticity, the eigenvalues become complex and are distributed in the complex plane. This results in two-dimensional level statistics Mehta (1991); Hamazaki et al. (2020); Sá et al. (2020); Li et al. (2021). In such cases, the underlying physics often becomes obscure due to, for example, the cubic level repulsion irrespective of the universality classes Grobe and Haake (1989); Oas (1997); Hamazaki et al. (2020). Additionally, the parametrization in a two-dimensional plane Sá et al. (2020), the use of complex time coordinates in temporal evolution Li et al. (2021), and finite-size rescalings make the analysis challenging Luo et al. (2021). To address this, Ref. Kawabata et al. (2023a) proposed to consider the statistics of singular values of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian instead of its complex eigenvalues. Singular values are real and non-negative, simplifying the corresponding statistics to be one-dimensional. Singular values are derived from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians H=U\Sigma V^{\dagger} (see Table 1), where the unitary matrices U and V^{\dagger} are formed by the orthonormal eigenvectors of HH^{\dagger} and H^{\dagger}H respectively. The elements \sigma_{i} of the diagonal matrix \Sigma=\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_{1},\cdots,\sigma_{n}) are known as the singular values of H. Alternatively, they are equal to the eigenvalues of \sqrt{H^{\dagger}H} or \sqrt{HH^{\dagger}}, obtained by the Hermitization method Feinberg and Zee (1997) which involves embedding the Hamiltonian into a space of twice its original dimension. The singular value statistics have proven to be powerful enough Kawabata et al. (2023a) to probe the 38-fold symmetry classification Kawabata et al. (2019) in non-Hermitian random matrices, extending beyond the Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) tenfold symmetry classification Altland and Zirnbauer (1997) in the Hermitian case. Hamiltonian Diagonalization Tridiagonalization EVD H=H^{\dagger} H=W\Lambda W^{\dagger} H=P\Lambda_{h}P^{\dagger} SVD H\neq H^{\dagger} H=U\Sigma V^{\dagger} {\color[rgb]{0,0,1}\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,1}H=S\,\Sigma_% {h}T^{\dagger}} Table 1: The table illustrates the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) and singular value decomposition (SVD) for Hermitian and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A single unitary matrix suffices to diagonalize or tridiagonalize a Hermitian matrix, while two unitary matrices are required for non-Hermitian cases. The expression highlighted in blue is one of the main results of this paper. Compared to complex spectral statistics, this simplification through SVD allows Hermitian probes to be straightforwardly extended to non-Hermitian settings by substituting eigenvalues with singular values Kawabata et al. (2023a); Roccati et al. (2024); Hamanaka and Kawabata (2024); Nandy et al. (2024b); Tekur et al. (2024). In the Hermitian limit, singular values reduce to the absolute values of the eigenvalues. This raises several intriguing questions: Is it possible to tridiagonalize non-Hermitian Hamiltonians while preserving the singular values, in line with the vision of Dumitriu and Edelman Dumitriu and Edelman (2002)? Can we use this framework to distinguish the dynamics in integrable and quantum chaotic systems in the non-Hermitian case? The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the Krylov space approach to SVD to compute the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity using the singular value spectrum. In Sec. III, we explore three different examples, including Ginibre ensembles and the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and compute the Krylov (spread) complexity in these contexts. We discuss the emergence of the peak and its relation to the repulsion between singular values in the non-Hermitian setting. Section IV discusses the symmetry classification of non-Hermitian random matrices from the perspective of Krylov (spread) complexity, providing analytic examples in two dimensions and numerical results for the non-Hermitian SYK model. We conclude with the summary and a brief outlook in Sec. V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09196v1,Coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior and level spacing statistics in a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor,"Motivated by recent studies of the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian [K. Swaminathan et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043215 (2023)], we introduce the on-site/bond singlet (OBS) model, a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor, in order to better understand the quasiparticle localization and interesting coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior present in the former model. The OBS model is the sum of terms that have direct counterparts in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian, each of which is parameterized by a coupling constant. Exact diagonalization reveals that the energy spectrum and non-equilibrium dynamics of the OBS model are essentially the same as that of the dice lattice for some values of the coupling constants. The quasiparticle localization and breaking of ergodicity manifest in a striking manner in the level spacing distribution. Its near Poissonian form provides evidence for the existence of local integrals of motion and establishes the OBS model as a non-trivial integrable generalization of the projected Creutz ladder Hamiltonian. These results show that level spacing statistics is a promising tool to study quasiparticle excitations in flat band superconductors.","The groundbreaking discovery of superconductivity in magic angle-twisted bilayer graphene [1] has been an important milestone in unveiling the origin of unconventional superconductivity. In unconventional superconductors, the attractive force that holds Cooper pairs together does not appear to originate from the electron-phonon interaction. Rather, it may be mediated by other bosonic modes of purely electronic origin such as spin excitations [2]. In many unconventional superconductors including twisted bilayer graphene, superconducting domes in the temperature-density phase diagram arise when doping away from commensurate values of the electron density, where insulating phases characterized by various forms of broken symmetries reside. This is the case of copper and iron-based superconductors [3, 4, 5] and also of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene in which the nature of the symmetry breaking in the correlated insulating phases is currently under intense investigation [6, 7, 8]. Twisted bilayer graphene and related moiré materials offer exciting possibilities since their properties can be tuned even in-situ in ways that are not possible with bulk superconductors such as copper and iron-based ones [9, 10, 11]. For instance, it is possible to easily change the electron density by electrostatic gating without the need for doping, which inevitably introduces disorder [12, 13, 14]. Thus, using a single sample it is possible to explore the entire phase diagram. Another way to tune the electronic properties, which has proven crucial for twisted bilayer graphene, is the possibility of carefully controlling the relative twist angle between the two graphene sheets. Depending on the angle, the reconstruction of the electronic band structure can be very pronounced with almost flat bands forming near the Fermi level. It is precisely at the magic angle, at which the relevant bands have minimal bandwidth, that superconductivity emerges together with a wide variety of other correlated phases. Remarkably, the ratio between superconducting critical temperature and Fermi energy in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene is among the highest in known superconducting materials, even if the critical temperature is small in absolute sense (\sim 1.7\,\mathrm{K}) [1]. Therefore, twisted bilayer graphene represents the first experimental validation of the general idea of increasing the critical temperature of the superconducting transition by means of band structure engineering, more specifically by realizing flat bands [15, 16, 17, 10, 18] characterized by nontrivial geometrical and topological properties. Indeed, only if the quantum metric of the flat band is nonzero, long range phase coherence can be established and the ensuing superconducting phase is robust against thermal fluctuations [19, 20, 10]. Figure 1: (a) Initial state \ket{\psi(0)}=\hat{d}^{\dagger}_{6\uparrow}\hat{d}^{\dagger}_{9\uparrow}\hat{d% }^{\dagger}_{9\downarrow}\hat{d}^{\dagger}_{12\uparrow}\ket{\emptyset} with an on-site pair on site l=6 and two unpaired particles on sites l=3 and 12 (N_{\uparrow},N_{\downarrow}=3,1) in a chain of length L=12 with periodic boundary conditions. The size of the circles denotes the particle density and the color denotes the spin density on a scale from white S_{z}=0 to red S_{z}=+1/2. (b) Time-averaged asymptotic density obtained from the time evolution with the Hamiltonian \mathcal{\hat{H}}_{\lambda_{2},\lambda_{3}} of the on-site/bond singlet (OBS) model (8) with \lambda_{2}=\lambda_{3}=0. The on-site pair is trapped in between the localized particles and the spin density is frozen. (c) Same as b, but for \lambda_{2}=0 and \lambda_{3}=1. The evolution dynamics is non-ergodic as the asymptotic particle and spin density distributions retain memory of the positions of the unpaired particles. (d) Same as b and c but for \lambda_{2}=\lambda_{3}=1. In this case the asymptotics particle and spin density distributions are almost uniform, an indication of ergodic behavior. Whereas the general idea of using flat bands for increasing the critical temperature is very promising, there are considerable obstacles on the way to make it practical. One of the most serious ones is the theoretical challenge posed by the class of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, which naturally includes materials with quasi-flat bands in the band structure. A typical approach for simplifying the many-body problem is to reduce the Hilbert space size by projecting the full Hamiltonian on a subset of relevant bands, some of which may be flat [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. This is a technique used extensively in the context of the fractional quantum Hall effect for instance [28, 29, 30, 31]. When projecting onto a flat band or a group of degenerate flat bands, the result consists of a Hamiltonian that departs substantially from the Hubbard model paradigm since it contains many different interaction terms (product of four field operators). Particularly important for the transport properties and superconductivity in the flat band limit are terms of the form \hat{d}_{i\uparrow}^{\dagger}\hat{d}_{i\downarrow}^{\dagger}\hat{d}_{j% \downarrow}\hat{d}_{j\uparrow}, where i and j label different electronic orbitals, that enable the correlated hopping of a whole Cooper pair at once [22, 23]. These terms are ignored in a Hubbard-like model, where the only interaction term is strictly local, but they are important if the flat band Wannier functions have a large spatial spread. In general the projected Hamiltonian, that is the Hamiltonian obtained by projecting a given interaction term, including a Hubbard interaction, onto a flat band of a multiorbital lattice model is a complicated object, which is difficult to tackle with available analytical and numerical methods. A possible way out is to study simple idealized models first and then proceed to tackle more realistic and complicated ones. In two dimensions, one of the simplest lattices with flat bands is the dice lattice [32, 33]. Due to the compact nature of the Wannier functions in the dice lattice, the number of terms obtained after the projection on the two lowest flat bands is limited. Moreover, for attractive interactions, the ground state of the projected Hamiltonian is given exactly by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) wave function [23, 25, 34], that is the wave function describing the superconducting state at the mean-field level. The ground state is also stable against thermal fluctuations since the quantum metric is nonzero [35]. Contrary to the ground state, very little is known regarding the nature of the excited states in the dice lattice and in general in flat band superconductors, in particular an outstanding question is whether the quasiparticle excitations are localized [25, 36]. Recent results obtained with exact diagonalization have provided evidence that the dice lattice is an instance of a localized superconductor, that is a superconductor in which the quasiparticle excitations are localized, at least at the level of the projected Hamiltonian. The concept of localized superconductor was introduced originally in the context of strongly disordered materials [37, 38], while the results of Ref. 25 refer to the disorder-free dice lattice. Localization in the latter case is purely a consequence of the band flatness. As shown in Ref. 25, by simulating the exact out of equilibrium dynamics of three and four particles, quasiparticle localization manifests as a weak form of ergodicity breaking, since Cooper pairs are free to propagate and thermalize rapidly, while quasiparticles with nonzero spin diffuse very slowly and retain memory of the initial state for very long times and possibly indefinitely. The breaking of ergodicity and thermalization in closed quantum systems has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years [39, 40, 41], after the idea of many-body localization was put forward as a theoretical concept [42, 43, 44, 45, 46] and subsequently realized with ultracold gases in optical lattices [47, 48, 49]. The fundamental characterization of many-body localization is as a form of emergent integrability, in which the dynamics is frozen and particles remain localized due to an extensive number of local integrals of motion (LIOMs) that appear for strong enough disorder [50, 51, 52, 45, 53]. A form of weak ergodicity breaking called Hilbert space fragmentation can also be the result of the presence of an extensive number of LIOMs since these break up the Hilbert space in many disconnected sectors within which the dynamics is fully ergodic [54, 55]. Hilbert space fragmentation is probably the best way to characterize the non-ergodic quasiparticle dynamics observed in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian. It is highly desirable, but generally very difficult, to be able to produce explicitly an extensive number of LIOMs for a many-body Hamiltonian [56, 57]. By doing so, the Hilbert space dimension can be dramatically reduced and it becomes feasible to numerically simulate large systems. As shown in Ref. 25, in the case of one term in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian the LIOMs are known explicitly and take the same form as the ones of the Creutz ladder and other one-dimensional lattice models with flat bands [24, 58]. More specifically, the conserved quantities are the parities of the occupation numbers of all lattice sites. This means that particles can move around only if they form on-site pairs with zero total spin, while single unpaired particles carrying a nonzero spin are immobile. As a consequence, the spin density distribution is frozen. On the other hand, the remaining terms in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian do not respect this strong dynamical constraint as evidenced by the slowly diffusive spin dynamics. However, this does not rule out that LIOMs with a somewhat more complicated structure may be present and could be at the root of the weak ergodicity breaking observed in the case of the dice lattice. Given that it is very hard to construct explicity the LIOMs of a generic many-body Hamiltonian, if they exist, we resort here to a powerful method for establishing the integrability of a quantum system, namely level spacing statistics [59, 60, 61, 62, 63]. Moreover, rather than tackling directly the projected Hamiltonian of the two-dimensional dice lattice, here we introduce a new model, called the on-site/bond singlet (OBS) model, which is designed to capture as faithfully as possible the symmetries and the dynamics of the dice lattice, but at the same time it is much easier to analyze being one-dimensional and also integrable for some parameters values. The Hamiltonian of the OBS model is introduced in Sec. II, its discrete symmetries are discussed in Sec. II.1, while in Sec. II.2 the considerations that have lead us to conceive this model are presented by relating it to other lattice models, in particular the dice lattice. Indeed, the Hamiltonian of the OBS model \mathcal{\hat{H}}_{\lambda_{2},\lambda_{3}} (8) is parameterized by two coupling constants \lambda_{2} and \lambda_{3}, that multiply terms with direct counterparts in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian [25]. In Sec. III, the same analysis of Ref. 25 is repeated in the case of the OBS model. In particular, it shown in Sec. III.1 that for \lambda_{2}=0 the pattern of degenerate and quasidegenerate states in the OBS model is remarkably similar to that of the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian. The asymptotic particle and spin density distributions obtained under time evolution with the OBS model are illustrated in Fig. 1 and further discussed in Sec. III.2. Depending of the value of the parameters, qualitatively different behaviors are obtained. For \lambda_{2}=\lambda_{3}=0 (Fig. 1b) the propagating on-site pair remains trapped between two localized unpaired particles, which act as impenetrable barriers. This is a direct consequence of the LIOMs imposing the constraint that the parity of the particle number on each site is conserved. For \lambda_{3}\neq 0 and \lambda_{2}=0 (Fig. 1c) the two-particle bound state can propagate throughout the whole chain and the spin density is nonzero also away from the initial positions of the two unpaired particles. However, the dynamics is clearly non-ergodic since both the particle and spin densities are inhomogeneous and retain memory of the initial positions of the unpaired particles. This inhomogeneity disappears for \lambda_{2}\neq 0 since the particle and spin density are almost uniform and compatible with a rapidly thermalizing dynamics (Fig. 1d). In Sec. IV the scattering problem consisting of a two-body bound state impinging on a single unpaired particle is solved in the case \lambda_{2}=0 and the results are used to explain several features of the energy spectrum and the out of equilibrium dynamics of the OBS model. In Sec. V, the level spacing statistics of the OBS model is investigated. The main finding is that the level spacing distribution for \lambda_{2}=0 and arbitrary values of \lambda_{3} is essentially identical to that of the special case \mathcal{\hat{H}}_{0,0}, in which an extensive number of LIOMs is known explicitly. On the other hand, for \lambda_{2}\neq 0 the level spacing distribution closely matches the prediction of random matrix theory. In view of these results, it is possible to conclude that for \lambda_{2}=0 the OBS model is integrable and the partial breaking of ergodicity in the out of equilibrium dynamics is the manifestation of an extensive number of LIOMs obtained by continuously deforming the known LIOMs for \lambda_{3}=0. Finally, in Sec. VI the main results of the present work are summarized and the perspectives for future applications of level spacing statistics to the study of quasiparticle localization and weak ergodicity breaking in lattice models with flat bands are discussed."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09088v1,Precision bounds for multiple currents in open quantum systems,"Thermodynamic (TUR) and kinetic (KUR) uncertainty relations are fundamental bounds constraining the fluctuations of current observables in classical, non-equilibrium systems. Several works have verified, however, violations of these classical bounds in open quantum systems, motivating the derivation of new quantum TURs and KURs that account for the role of quantum coherence. Here, we go one step further by deriving multidimensional KUR and TUR for multiple observables in open quantum systems undergoing Markovian dynamics. Our derivation exploits a multi-parameter metrology approach, in which the Fisher information matrix plays a central role. Crucially, our bounds are tighter than previously derived quantum TURs and KURs for single observables, precisely because they incorporate correlations between multiple observables. We also find an intriguing quantum signature of correlations that is captured by the off-diagonal element of the Fisher information matrix, which vanishes for classical stochastic dynamics. By considering two examples, namely a coherently driven qubit system and the three-level maser, we demonstrate that the multidimensional quantum KUR bound can even be saturated when the observables are perfectly correlated.","One of the most consequential discoveries in the field of stochastic thermodynamics has been the interconnection between fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities and dissipation in non-equilibrium systems at the small scale. Concepts from stochastic thermodynamics, such as stochastic entropy production [1], which corresponds to the entropy change of the system and reservoir due to their stochastic exchanges of heat within a given trajectory, have laid the foundation for a broader understanding of irreversibility and dissipation [2]. In turn, the number of stochastic transitions or jumps in a non-equilibrium system is related to time-symmetric frenetic aspects at the level of a single trajectory, with its average over a large number of trajectories, the dynamical activity, being a quantity which characterizes the volume of transitions in the system [3, 4, 5]. Seminal findings such as detailed [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and integral [11, 12] fluctuation theorems evidenced the interconnection between fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities and dissipation. More recently, the discovery of precision bounds such as thermodynamic (TUR) [13] and kinetic (KUR) [4] uncertainty relations, led to new foundational results in relation to the interplay between the relative fluctuation of observables and dissipation or dynamical activity in non-equilibrium systems. Both precision bounds, the TUR and KUR, were originally derived for classical systems and Markovian dynamics in the long time limit. Specifically, the original TUR can be expressed as [13] \frac{{\rm Var}(\Theta)}{\langle\Theta\rangle^{2}}\geq\frac{2}{\Sigma}, (1) where \Theta is a time-integrated current with mean \langle\Theta\rangle and variance {\rm Var}(\Theta) and \Sigma is the system’s entropy production (we set k_{B}=1 throughout). In turn, the KUR is given by [4] \frac{{\rm Var}(\Theta)}{\langle\Theta\rangle^{2}}\geq\frac{1}{\mathcal{A}}, (2) where \mathcal{A} is the dynamical activity. These bounds imply that reducing the relative fluctuation of the current on the left-hand side of Eqs. (1) and (2) has a cost in terms of increased entropy production or dynamical activity. Soon after their original derivation using large-deviation theory [14, 15], it was realised that these precision bounds can also be obtained with tools from the theory of parameter estimation [16, 17, 18]. In that context, observables, such as currents, are identified with estimators, and their fluctuations are interpreted as statistical errors in the estimate. The TUR and KUR can then be derived as a consequence of the Cramér-Rao bound, which imposes a fundamental lower limit on estimation error [19]. This approach has unlocked novel uncertainty relations for classical systems, encompassing multiple observables [16, 20], Langevin dynamics [21, 22], and first-passage times [23, 24], to name just a few examples. In many cases, TURs and KURs are obtained by imagining a fictional estimation of parameters representing a virtual (unphysical) perturbation to the dynamics, but nonequilibrium precision bounds can also be obtained by considering the estimation of physical parameters such as time [25]. Going beyond the scope of classical systems, significant efforts have been made to answer the question of whether classical bounds, such as those in Eqs. (1) and (2), would be fulfilled by stochastic currents generated in non-equilibrium open quantum systems. In this context, several works have shown instances of violations of classical bounds by quantum dynamics described by Markovian quantum master equations in the long time limit, e.g. for quantum dot arrays [26, 27, 28, 29], the three-level maser [30], and other nanoscale quantum engines [31]. Altogether, these results demonstrate that classical precision bounds do not generally constrain the relative fluctuation of observables in open quantum systems. Indeed, new bounds on the fluctuations of time-integrated currents or counting observables have been derived for quantum non-equilibrium steady states [32] and for open quantum systems within the Markov approximation [33, 34, 35], which allow for reduced fluctuations compared to their classical counterparts. Notably, these results were all obtained using the Cramér-Rao bound of estimation theory, appropriately extended to open quantum systems. Despite this progress, the physical origin of quantum TUR violations remains an open question. To address this, recent works have studied the contribution of quantum coherence [33, 31, 34, 35] and entanglement [29] to the fluctuations of a single counting observable. However, while certainly relevant, coherence and entanglement paint an incomplete picture, because they depend only on the quantum state. By contrast, current fluctuations depend on both the state and the dynamics [36], e.g. two distinct processes could yield the same nonequilibrium steady state but exhibit completely different current fluctuations. It is therefore natural to consider dynamical quantities, such as the correlations generated between sequentially measured observables. It is well known that these correlations may depart significantly from classical behavior due to quantum measurement invasiveness [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. In this work, we take the first steps towards understanding how such correlations influence nonclassical current fluctuations far from equilibrium. Specifically, we derive bounds on the covariance of multiple counting observables that are measured simultaneously along the trajectories of an open quantum system. Our derivation exploits tools from multi-parameter estimation theory, thus generalizing the results of Ref. [34] to yield a multidimensional KUR and TUR. By capturing correlations between observables, our new bounds are tighter than previously derived TURs and KURs for quantum systems with Markovian dynamics. Our results are complementary to those of Ref. [32], which reported multidimensional precision bounds in the near-equilibrium regime without any Markovian assumption, whereas our bounds apply arbitrarily far from equilibrium so long as the Markov approximation is valid. Our results also reveal a novel quantum signature of correlations between pairs of simultaneously measured counting observables: namely, the off-diagonal element of the Fisher information matrix, which quantifies correlations between estimated parameters. We show that this quantity leads to an increased lower bound on the covariance of observables in generic quantum dynamics, whereas it vanishes for purely classical stochastic dynamics. This article is organized as follows. In Section II, we briefly present a general description of continuously monitored quantum systems. Section III contains a brief overview of parameter estimation and the multi-parameter Cramér-Rao bound, and we review previously derived quantum KUR and TUR for single counting observables in Section IV. In Section V, we present the multidimensional KUR and TUR derived in this work. Focussing on the multidimensional KUR, we illustrate the application of our results to two examples of non-equilibrium quantum systems, namely a coherently-driven qubit and the three-level maser system. Finally, we present our conclusions in Section VII."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09067v1,Critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces,"The critical states of disordered systems are intriguing subjects within the realm of condensed matter physics and complex systems. These states manifest in materials where disorder plays a significant role, and are distinguished by their multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, accurately characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we argue that critical states exhibit a certain invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both domains. More specifically, it is expected that typical physical quantities characterizing critical states, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, should exhibit invariance in both position space and momentum space. Subsequent numerical simulations validate the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.","The concept of critical states Critical in various physical systems pertains to the behaviors and characteristics exhibited during phase transitions or as they approach critical points. The examination of critical states provides profound insights into the nature of order, disorder, and collective behavior across diverse disciplines Sachdev1 . These states are fundamental for comprehending a wide range of phenomena in statistical physics Critical0 , condensed matter physics Critical1 , and complex systems Critical2 . As a defining feature of critical phenomena Critical3 , fluctuations in critical states become correlated over large distances, with the system demonstrating self-similar behavior at different scales. Critical fluctuations have been observed in various systems, including phase transitions in ferromagnets-antiferromagnets Critical4 , percolation thresholds in complex networks Critical5 , and photonic quasicrystals photonic . As research continues to advance, the exploration of critical states holds promise for unveiling new phenomena and deepening our understanding of complex systems. Recently, significant advancements have been achieved in the investigation of critical states of wave functions, specifically focusing on critical states of quantum disordered systems Liu-self-duality ; Li1 ; Li2 ; You ; g1 ; g2 ; zhou ; Biddle ; Zhang ; Chen ; q1 ; q2 ; q3 ; q4 ; q5 ; q6 ; q7 ; q8 ; Yao1 ; Yao2 ; cai ; Slager ; SSHQ ; gg3 ; gg4 ; gg5 ; gg6 ; gg7 ; gg8 ; gg0 ; gg9 . Novel concepts and phenomena such as anomalous mobility edges Liu-Anomalous , the utilization of renormalization groups for critical states RG1 ; RG2 , real eigenvalues determined through recursion of eigenstates Liu-Real1 ; Liu-Real2 , critical states induced by coupling of two chains twochain , and critical states of two-dimensional quasicrystals Duncan are continuously emerging. Nevertheless, the primary challenge in comprehending critical states lies in determining the conditions under which they arise and accurately characterizing them. Bohr’s complementarity principle MQM provides us with inspiration to bridge this gap. According to the complementarity principle, it is impossible to simultaneously observe the wave nature and particle nature of matter under different representations, such as position space and momentum space. Matter exhibits different properties in these representations. The relationship between position space and momentum space is primarily established through the Fourier transform; position space serves as a mathematical framework for describing the location of particles or objects in physical space, while momentum space is perceived as the duality of position space QM . The critical state can be considered as a third state in addition to particle and wave properties, thus it can be reasonably inferred that the critical state may exhibit some invariance in both position space and momentum space. Figure 1: (Color online) (a) and (b) demonstrate an application of Bohr’s complementarity principle, showing that a localized state in position space must be delocalized in momentum space, and vice versa for an extended state. (c) and (d) illustrate that critical states can simultaneously exhibit delocalization, multifractality, and self-similarity in both position space and momentum space. Based on this duality perception, Liu and Xia propose an explicit criterion Liu-Critical for precisely characterizing critical states. They assert that the Lyapunov exponents of critical states should simultaneously be 0 in both position space and momentum space. The criterion definitively distinguishes critical states from extended and localized states, as the Lyapunov exponents of the latter two are not equal in position space and momentum space. If one exponent is 0, then the dual exponent must be greater than 0. In physics, this also implies that extended and localized states cannot simultaneously exhibit delocalization in position space and momentum space, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a) and (b). In contrast, critical states should demonstrate delocalization, multifractality, and self-similarity in both position space and momentum space, as depicted in Fig. 1(c) and (d). These findings clearly illustrate that critical states maintain a certain kind of invariance across two dual spaces. A natural question arises: can the invariance of the critical state extend beyond the Lyapunov exponent to include other physical quantities in both position and momentum spaces? This study demonstrates that the invariance of the critical state is universal, encompassing various physical quantities such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08988v1,Single-File Diffusion of Active Brownian Particles,"Single-file diffusion (SFD) is a key mechanism underlying transport phenomena in confined physical and biological systems. In a typical SFD process, microscopic particles are restricted to moving in a narrow channel where they cannot pass one another, resulting in constrained motion and anomalous diffusion at long times. In this study, we use Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical theory to investigate the SFD of active Brownian particles (ABPs) – a minimal model of active colloids. Using a combination of scaling relations and heuristic arguments, we derive an accurate analytical expression for a tagged ABP’s mean square displacement (MSD). We find the MSD exhibits ballistic behavior at short times, which can quantitatively be related to the reduced kinetic temperature of the single-file ABP system. We also find that while the characteristic subdiffusive scaling of SFD [\langle(\Delta x)^{2}\rangle\sim t^{1/2}] is preserved at long times, self-propulsion introduces significant modifications to the 1D-mobility, which can be directly related to the constant Péclet (Pe) compressibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized 1D-mobility, initially proposed by Kollmann for equilibrium systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 180602 (2003)], can be extended to active systems with minimal modification. These findings have important implications for tuning particle transport at the microscale and provide a basis for understanding active matter in geometries with highly restricted motion.","For over half a century, single-file diffusion (SFD) has captivated researchers across the physical and biological sciences, finding broad applications in quantifying transport at the microscale [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. In a typical SFD process, microscopic particles are confined to move within a narrow channel where they cannot pass one another (See Fig. 1 for a schematic illustration of SFD). This form of confinement leads to subdiffusive behavior at long times, making SFD one of the simplest examples of anomalous diffusion [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. As a result, SFD provides a fundamental framework for understanding transport in highly confined systems, with far-reaching implications for both theoretical studies and practical applications. Most studies of SFD have focused on equilibrium Brownian particles (i.e., passive particles), where it is nearly universally observed that, at long times, the mean square displacement (MSD) of a tagged particle scales as \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}\langle(\Delta x)^{2}\rangle=2Ft^{1/2}\,, (1) where F is a proportionality constant known as the 1D-mobility. This characteristic subdiffusive scaling of SFD has been thoroughly explored computationally and experimentally in various systems, including colloidal particles in microchannels [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33] and molecular transport in zeolites and carbon nanotubes [34, 35, 36, 37]. In addition to experimental studies, several theoretical approaches have been developed to describe the SFD of passive Brownian systems, including fluctuating hydrodynamics [38, 39, 40], fractional Langevin formalisms [41, 42, 43], and asymptotic methods [44, 45, 46]. We refer the reader to Refs [25, 47, 48, 49], for a more comprehensive discussion on passive SFD. The central theoretical challenge in SFD is to capture the many-body effects that give rise to subdiffusive behavior at long times and to quantitatively predict the 1D mobility. In one of the earliest studies of SFD, Harris [20] derived the fundamental result for the 1D-mobility of passive hard particles F_{HR}=\frac{1-\phi}{\rho}\sqrt{\frac{D}{\pi}}=\lambda\sqrt{\frac{D}{\pi}}\,, (2) where D is the free diffusion coefficient of the particle, \phi=\rho\sigma_{p} is the packing fraction, \sigma_{p} is the particle diameter, and \rho is the particle line density. The mean free path \lambda, which represents the average distance a particle can move before encountering its neighbor, can be calculated analytically for single-file passive hard particles and is given by \lambda=(1-\phi)/\rho [50]. In Harris’s derivation of the 1D-mobility, the mean free path is a fundamental quantity that provides a measure of the confinement experienced by a tagged particle and can be introduced to further simplify Eq. (2). We also find the mean free path plays a similar pivotal role in the SFD of active colloids. More recently, using an asymptotic approach, Kollmann generalized the 1D-mobility for passive particles to systems with arbitrary finite-range interactions [10]. In such systems, the 1D-mobility is expressed as F=\frac{1}{\rho}\sqrt{\frac{D\mathcal{X}}{\pi}}\,, (3) where \mathcal{X} is the reduced isothermal compressibility, defined as the ratio between the compressibility of an interacting system to that of an ideal system. We should note that for more complicated interparticle interactions, the quantity \sqrt{\mathcal{X}}/\rho plays a similar role to the mean free path introduced in Eq. (2). This generalized result has been verified across various systems, including attractive particles, mixtures, and particles with long-ranged interactions [29, 32, 51]. Interestingly, the work of Kollmann and others illustrates a peculiar feature of single-file systems: the 1D-mobility, a single-particle transport property, can be related to a thermodynamic response function of the system (i.e., the isothermal compressibility). Figure 1: Schematic of SF-ABP system. Each purely repulsive active particle moves at a constant speed of U_{a}\cos\theta while undergoing rotational Brownian motion with a reorientation time of \tau_{R}. Much of the prior work on SFD has focused on passive particles, motivating the natural question: how is single-file diffusion altered when particle dynamics deviate from passive Brownian motion? To answer this question, we focus on active colloids capable of self-propulsion at the microscale. Interestingly, this novel class of colloids exhibits persistent directed motion at short times and undergoes diffusive motion at long times. The self-driven nature of active colloids has spurred extensive investigations into their phenomenology and use in potential applications ranging from transport, self-assembly, and fluid mixing at the microscale [52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]. This includes several studies that have explored different aspects of single-file active matter systems [68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76]. However, there has been no systematic attempt to quantify the role of activity in single-file systems and how it influences observables such as the 1D-mobility. Understanding the SFD of active colloids is critical, as many proposed applications operate in environments where such conditions are likely. In this work, we investigate the single-file diffusion (SFD) of active colloids within the context of the active Brownian particle (ABP) model. Here, we analyze the long- and short-time behavior of the mean square displacement (MSD), focusing on how self-propulsion modifies both the ballistic motion at short times and the subdiffusive scaling at long times. Our results demonstrate that Kollmann’s generalized 1D-mobility expression for passive systems [Eq. (3)] can be extended to active systems with minimal modification. This work provides new insights into the behavior of confined active matter informing the design of microfluidic systems and targeted transport technologies, where precise control of particle dynamics is essential. I.1 Model In this study, we consider a periodic single-file active Brownian particle (SF-ABP) model [77], where N purely-repulsive active Brownian disks are confined to move along a narrow channel of length L, as depicted in Fig. 1. The channel is sufficiently narrow to prevent particles from passing one another, enforcing a single-file condition that restricts their motion to one spatial dimension. Each particle experiences a self-propelling force F_{a}=\gamma U_{a}\cos{\theta}, where \theta is the angle between the particle’s orientation vector and the positive x-axis, \gamma is the translational drag coefficient, and U_{a} is the constant self-propelling speed. The orientation of each particle undergoes rotational Brownian motion with a characteristic reorientation time \tau_{R}. The following overdamped equations describe the motion of a tagged particle: v=\dot{x}=U_{a}\cos(\theta)+\gamma^{-1}F_{c}\ , (4a) \dot{\theta}=\xi(t)\ , (4b) where F_{c} represents the interparticle forces, and \xi(t) is the stochastic rotational noise with properties \langle\xi(t)\rangle=0 and {\langle\xi(t)\xi(t^{\prime})\rangle=(2/\tau_{R})\delta(t-t^{\prime})}. For simplicity, we assume translational Brownian motion and hydrodynamic interactions are negligible. The interparticle forces F_{c} are implemented using a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson (WCA) potential, characterized by a potential strength \varepsilon and Lennard-Jones diameter \sigma [78]. We choose the potential strength to be sufficiently large (i.e., \varepsilon/(F_{a}\sigma)=100) to effectively mimic hard-particle behavior endowing particles with an effective hard diameter of \sigma_{p}=2^{1/6}\sigma. For the initial configuration, particles are randomly placed in the channel without overlaps, and the initial angles for the orientation vectors are uniformly distributed. Simulations were performed using HOOMD-blue [79] with N = 1000 particles for a minimum of 1.5\text{\times}{10}^{10} timesteps, and a timestep size \delta t=10^{-5} time units. Figure 2: Brownian dynamics simulation results (points) for the reduced (a) kinetic temperature, (b) pressure, and (c) constant Pe compressibility for different active Péclet numbers. The dashed colored lines in (a)-(c) correspond to the analytical expressions for these various quantities [Eqs. (6)-(8)]. While, the solid line in panels (b) and (c) corresponds to the analytical expression for the reduced pressure and isothermal compressibility for the 1D passive hard particle system (Tonks gas), respectively. The state of the SF-ABP system is characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the packing fraction \phi=\rho\sigma_{p}, where \rho=N/L is the particle line density, and the active Péclet number \text{Pe}=\ell_{0}/\sigma, where \ell_{0}=U_{a}\tau_{R} is the intrinsic run length of a particle. The active Péclet number quantifies the persistence of a particle’s motion relative to its diameter. In the limit \text{Pe}\rightarrow 0, particles undergo nearly Brownian dynamics and we recover the mechanical, structural, and transport properties of the single-file hard particle system often referred to as the Tonks gas [80]. As Pe increases, large dynamic clusters begin to form [74, 81, 82]. A detailed analysis of clustering behavior in the SF-ABP system is provided in Ref. [83, 74, 84, 77]. Interestingly, despite significant clustering, the SF-ABP system does not exhibit a motility-induced phase transition at finite Péclet numbers [85, 74, 81, 86]. Here, we briefly summarize the concepts of kinetic temperature, pressure, and compressibility for the SF-ABP system, which are essential quantities for characterizing the MSD of a tagged particle [77]. The reduced kinetic temperature \mathcal{T}_{k}=2\langle v^{2}\rangle/U_{a}^{2}, which represents the ratio of the mean square velocity in the interacting system to that of an ideal SF-ABP system, is expressed as: \mathcal{T}_{k}=1-\frac{2\langle F_{c}^{2}\rangle}{(\gamma U_{a})^{2}}\,, (5) where \mathcal{T}_{k} quantifies the reduction in the mean square velocity due to interparticle collisions. In Fig. 2(a), we show simulation results (points) for the reduced kinetic temperature of the SF-ABP system. As \phi\rightarrow 0, \mathcal{T}_{k}\rightarrow 1, and as \phi\rightarrow 1, \mathcal{T}_{k}\rightarrow 0. Using scaling arguments based on collision timescales, we previously derived the following accurate expression for the reduced kinetic temperature [dashed lines in Fig. 2(a)]: \mathcal{T}_{k}=\frac{1}{9b^{2}}\left[2\cos\left(\frac{1}{3}\arccos\left(\frac% {27}{2}b^{2}-1\right)\right)-1\right]^{2}\ , (6) where b=\alpha\text{Pe}\phi/(1-\phi) and \alpha=c/(1+\text{Pe})^{d} with c=1.1 and d=0.05. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the reduced kinetic temperature is equivalent to the reduced swim pressure, \mathcal{T}_{k}=P_{s}/P_{0}, and derived an analytical expression for the reduced total pressure of the SF-ABP system: \mathcal{P}=\frac{P}{P_{0}}=\mathcal{T}_{k}\left[\frac{1}{1-\phi}\,\right]\ , (7) where P_{0}=\rho\gamma U_{a}^{2}/2 is the ideal gas pressure. In the limit of small Pe, \mathcal{T}_{k}\rightarrow 1 and Eq. (7) reduces to the well-known equilibrium result for the Tonks gas \mathcal{P}=1/(1-\phi) [80]. Fig. 2(b) shows a comparison between the reduced pressure for the SF-ABP system and Eq. (7). The reduced constant Péclet compressibility, \mathcal{X}, [plotted in Fig. 2(c)] serves as a thermodynamic-like response function, analogous to the reduced isothermal compressibility in passive systems [87, 77]. This response function measures clustering and local density fluctuations, and as we show, is an important quantity in characterizing the MSD of a tagged particle. It can be calculated directly from Eq. (7), yielding \mathcal{X}=\frac{\chi_{a}}{\chi_{0}}=\left[\frac{\mathcal{T}_{k}}{(1-\phi)^{2% }}+\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{T}_{k}}{\partial\phi}\right% )\right]^{-1}, (8) where \chi_{a}=(\partial\ln\rho/\partial P)_{\text{Pe}} and \chi_{0}=1/P_{0} are the compressibilities of the interacting and ideal systems, respectively. As \text{Pe}\rightarrow 0, the SF-ABP system recovers the passive result, \mathcal{X}=(1-\phi)^{2}, and as \phi\rightarrow 0, \mathcal{X}\rightarrow 1. Figure 3: (a) Mean square displacement (MSD) of a tagged particle in the SF-ABP system. (b) The state diagram for the SF-ABP system, with data points corresponding to the MSD curves in (a). The black line represents the condition \ell_{0}/\lambda_{ABP}=1, separating two different dynamical regimes as discussed in the text. (c) Simulation results for the 1D-mobility across different values of Pe and \phi. The solid black line represents the analytical result for the 1D-mobility of passive hard particles [Eq. (2)]. (d) Normalized velocity autocorrelation function for the representative values of Pe and \phi. The solid black line represents the analytical result for ideal ABPs. The inset shows the power-law decay of the normalized velocity autocorrelation function, demonstrating the characteristic -t^{-3/2} behavior. Before presenting the results of this study, we briefly review the mean square displacement (MSD) of an ideal suspension of SF-ABPs. A useful form of the MSD is \langle(\Delta x)^{2}\rangle=2\langle v^{2}\rangle t\left[\int_{0}^{t}\left(1-% \frac{\tau}{t}\right)\mathcal{V}(\tau)d\tau\right]\,, (9) where \mathcal{V}(\tau)=\langle v(0)v(\tau)\rangle/\langle v^{2}\rangle is the normalized velocity autocorrelation function and \langle v^{2}\rangle is the mean square velocity of the particle [88]. In the ideal SF-ABP system, where there are no interparticle forces (F_{c}=0), it is straightforward to show that \langle v^{2}\rangle=\frac{1}{2}U_{a}^{2} and \mathcal{V}(\tau)=e^{-\tau/\tau_{R}}. Substituting these two expressions into Eq. (9), we obtain the well-known result for ideal ABPs [89]: \langle(\Delta x)^{2}\rangle=2D_{0}\left[t+\tau_{R}\left(e^{-t/\tau_{R}}-1% \right)\right], (10) where D_{0}=\frac{1}{2}U_{a}^{2}\tau_{R} is the free diffusion coefficient of an ABP. The MSD of an ideal ABP exhibits two distinct scaling regimes. At short times, the motion is ballistic, scaling as \langle(\Delta x)^{2}\rangle\sim\frac{1}{2}U_{a}^{2}t^{2}. At long times, the motion becomes diffusive, scaling as \langle(\Delta x)^{2}\rangle\sim 2D_{0}t. The crossover between the ballistic and diffusive regimes occurs around t\approx\tau_{R}, corresponding to the timescale over which the particle’s orientation undergoes significant reorientation due to rotational diffusion."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08948v1,Thermal Pseudo-Entropy,"In this work, we develop a generalisation of the thermal entropy to complex inverse temperatures, which we call the thermal pseudo-entropy. We show that this quantity represents the pseudo-entropy of the transition matrix between Thermofield Double states at different times. We have studied its properties in various quantum mechanical setups, Schwarzian theory, Random Matrix Theories, and 2D CFTs, including symmetric orbifolds. Our findings indicate a close relationship between the averaged thermal pseudo-entropy and the spectral form factor, which is instrumental in distinguishing chaotic and integrable models. Moreover, we have observed a logarithmic scaling of this quantity in models with a continuous spectrum, with a universal coefficient that is sensitive to the scaling of the density of states near the edge of the spectrum. Lastly, we found the connection between the real and imaginary parts of the thermal pseudo-entropy through the Kramers-Kronig relations.","Recently an interesting generalisation of entanglement entropy Bombelli:1986rw ; Srednicki:1993im ; Holzhey:1994we ; Calabrese:2004eu ; Calabrese:2009qy has been introduced by considering post-selection processes in quantum many-body systems, which is called pseudo-entropy Nakata:2021ubr . This quantity is defined from the transition matrix, which depends on two different states (i.e. the initial state and final state), while the density matrix depends only on a single state. Since the transition matrix is non-Hermitian, the pseudo-entropy becomes complex-valued in general. This quantity enjoys a number of useful properties. First of all, it has a simple and clear gravity dual in AdS/CFT correspondence Maldacena:1997re , such that it can be directly computed from the area of the minimal area in a Euclidean time-dependent AdS background Nakata:2021ubr . This provides a simple extension of holographic entanglement entropy Ryu:2006bv ; Ryu:2006ef ; Hubeny:2007xt in AdS/CFT. It is also useful when we consider a time-like extension of entanglement entropy, the so called time-like entanglement entropy, in Lorentzian AdS spacetimes Doi:2022iyj ; Liu:2022ugc ; Doi:2023zaf ; Guo:2024lrr ; Anegawa:2024kdj ; Heller:2024whi ; Afrasiar:2024lsi . Moreover, pseudo-entropy turns out to be a very useful probe for understanding the dS/CFT duality Strominger:2001pn ; Maldacena:2002vr ; Hikida:2021ese as it computes the length of time-like geodesics Hikida:2022ltr ; Narayan:2022afv ; Doi:2023zaf ; Narayan:2023ebn ; Kawamoto:2023nki ; Goswami:2024vfl . For further progress of pseudo-entropy in the context of holography, field theories, and quantum information, refer to Miyaji:2021lcq ; Akal:2021dqt ; Mukherjee:2022jac ; Guo:2022sfl ; Ishiyama:2022odv ; Miyaji:2022dna ; Bhattacharya:2022wlp ; Guo:2022jzs ; Parzygnat:2022pax ; He:2023eap ; Kanda:2023zse ; Xian:2023zgu ; Parzygnat:2023avh ; Guo:2023aio ; Balasubramanian:2023xyd ; Kanda:2023jyi ; Kawamoto:2023ade ; Wei:2024zez ; Doi:2024nty ; Parzygnat:2024tdf ; Soni:2024aop ; Hao:2024nhd ; Guo:2024pve . In addition, we can apply pseudo-entropy to study quantum phase transitions in various quantum many-body systems. In particular, an intriguing quantity in this context is the difference between the real part of pseudo-entropy for two different states and the averaged entanglement entropy for each state. This quantity becomes non-positive when two states are in the same quantum phase. However, this difference can be positive when they are in the different phases as confirmed explicitly in Mollabashi:2020yie ; Mollabashi:2021xsd . It is also expected to be related to multi-partite entanglement Shinmyo:2023eci . Finally, pseudo-entropy in topological phases provides a new class of interesting topological measures Nishioka:2021cxe ; Caputa:2024qkk which can play roles of new order parameters. Refer also Murciano:2021dga ; Carignano:2023xbz ; Carignano:2023xbz ; Carignano:2024jxb ; Bou-Comas:2024pxf for other condensed matter aspects of pseudo-entropy and related quantities. One of the problems on pseudo-entropy, which we do not understand well at present, is the meaning of its imaginary part. In previous applications to quantum phase transitions, we have some qualitative understanding of the real part as mentioned above. However, so far, we have not been able to relate the imaginary part to any physical quantities such as e.g. order parameters. A quantum information theoretic meaning in terms of entanglement distillation in the presence of post-selection is only available for the real part of pseudo-entropy in a special class of quantum states Nakata:2021ubr . Interestingly, in the context of dS/CFT, the imaginary part of the pseudo-entropy is expected to shed light on the emergence of time coordinate from a purely Euclidean CFT Hikida:2022ltr ; Doi:2022iyj ; Doi:2023zaf . In this paper, motivated by the above, we analyse the properties of the full complex-valued pseudo-entropy. To make the problem tractable, we focus on a simpler version of pseudo-entropy, which we call thermal pseudo-entropy (TPE). This is analogous to the relation between entanglement entropy and the standard thermal entropy, given by the statement that the entanglement entropy of a single copy in the Thermofield Double (TFD) state is simply equal to the thermal entropy. In other words, if we write the thermal entropy S(\beta) as a function of the inverse temperature \beta, we define the thermal pseudo-entropy by the complex extension S(\beta+it). We will see below that this precisely coincides with the pseudo-entropy for the TFD state and its time-evolution. This definition, by extending the standard thermal entropy, might be analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) Cotler:2016fpe . Even though they are different in that the former is a holomorphic quantity, while the latter not, we will show that there is a useful relationship between them when we take time averages. For earlier works on this connection, refer also to Goto:2021kln ; He:2024jog that focused more on sub-regions and two-point correlators. Moreover, as we will see later, the imaginary part of TPE is completely determined by the real part via the Kramers-Kronig relations (and vice versa). This provides the first example with a sharp understanding of the imaginary part. We will work out several interesting properties of TPE by computing it in various examples below. This will also reveal how its time evolution depends on the energy spectra, taking into account the finite size effects. This paper is organised as follows. In section 2, we provide the definition and basic properties of TPE. In section 3, we explore some of its general properties, and in section 4 we analyse explicit examples such as harmonic oscillator, Calogero-Sutherland and Schwarzian models as well as Random Matrix Theories. In section 5, we present calculation of TPE in various two-dimensional CFTs. In section 6, we study the SFF and TPE in orbifold CFTs. In section 7 we summarise and conclude. In appendix A, we show plots of SFF and TPE for compact scalar symmetric orbifold CFTs."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07706v1,Quantum master equation from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis,"We use the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to derive a quantum master equation for a system weakly coupled to a chaotic finite-sized bath prepared in a pure state. We show that the emergence of Markovianity is controlled by the spectral function of the ETH and that local detailed balance emerges in the Markovian regime for a broad class of pure bath states. We numerically verify this result by comparing the master equation to dynamics computed using exact diagonalization of a chaotic Hamiltonian. We also compare the master equation to exact dynamics for an integrable bath and find that at finite size they strongly disagree. Our work puts forward eigenstate thermalization as a foundation for open quantum systems theory, thus extending it beyond ensemble bath preparations to chaotic many-body environments in generic pure states.","Master equations are important for studying thermalization and irreversibility in open quantum systems (OQS). In OQS theory, these phenomena are explained by the interaction between a system and some inaccessible environment. The Redfield and Lindblad master equations describe the dynamics of systems which are weakly coupled to an environment and are frequently discussed in textbooks on OQS theory [1, 2, 3]. The derivation of these equations require a variety of assumptions to be made about the Hamiltonian and state of the bath. In this work, we focus on the widely used assumption that the bath is prepared in a Gibbs ensemble. This assumption is not always justified because a bath prepared in an arbitrary nonequilibrium state will not thermalize in general. This is particularly clear for pure bath states, which never evolve to a Gibbs ensemble under unitary dynamics. Additionally, local thermalization will not be guaranteed for many of the frequently used models considered in OQS theory, such as free fermions, free bosons and simple spin models. Instead these non-chaotic models are expected to locally evolve towards a generalized Gibbs ensemble [4]. Even if such non-chaotic systems are somehow prepared in a standard Gibbs state, the ensuing dynamics may not satisfy the requirements for a weak-coupling master equation to be valid [5, 6, 7]. Therefore, what justifies the use of a Gibbs ensemble for the bath has remained an unanswered question within OQS theory. This issue becomes relevant when considering isolated quantum systems, such as ultracold atomic gases, that can be described by a pure state. It is now possible to embed impurity probes in these gases [8, 9, 10, 11], as well as control their interaction with the gas [12, 13]. It has also been possible to study impurities coupled to strongly interacting environments [14, 15]. These impurities are most naturally described using OQS theory with a pure bath preparation. This motivates a master equation derivation that does not assume a thermal ensemble for the environment, complementing other recent efforts to extend OQS theory beyond standard assumptions, e.g. to finite sized [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], non-Markovian [21] and non-thermal [22, 23] baths. To tackle this problem, we use methods developed to explain thermalization in isolated quantum systems: specifically, quantum chaos theory. Chaotic many-body Hamiltonians are known to obey the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which states that energy eigenstates yield thermal expectation values for local operators (see Sec. II). It has been proven that the ETH is a sufficient condition for thermalization in isolated quantum systems prepared in high energy, pure states with subextensive energy fluctuations [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. Numerical experiments have verified the ETH in chaotic many-body Hamiltonians [29, 28, 30, 31, 32] and in Floquet dynamics [33, 31, 34, 35, 36]. The ETH and random matrix theory have been used to understand nonequilibrium phenomena such as transport properties [37, 38, 39, 40, 41] and have been used to derive fluctuation-dissipation theorems [42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]. The ETH is expected to hold for local operators or sums of local operators [48, 49] and so it should be applicable to models with local, short-ranged interactions, making it a potentially useful resource in understanding quantum impurity problems. Properties of many-body systems, such as information scrambling and the Lieb-Robinson bound, have been used to assist in deriving master equations [50]. The ETH in particular has been used to derive classical master equations [28, 51] and equations describing the dynamics of local operators in chaotic models [44, 51]. Additionally, the ETH has been applied to OQS theory, but generally only ensemble initial bath preparations are considered [52, 7, 53, 54, 55]. Despite these works, a full derivation of the quantum master equation for pure bath states has not been performed. In Sec. III, we fill this gap by deriving a weak-coupling quantum master equation for a system interacting with a chaotic bath that obeys the ETH and is prepared in a pure state. This extends the applicability of OQS theory to a much larger number of initial states and models. We show that the ETH implies a local detailed balance condition, which allows us to establish a consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamics and contributes to a line of research aiming to understand the implications of chaos and the ETH far from equilibrium [42, 56, 43, 57, 58, 36, 59, 44, 24, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64]. Our master equation gives a quantitative description of thermalization timescales in the weak-coupling regime. Additionally, generic Hamiltonians are expected to obey the ETH [28], so we expect the master equation to hold for most bath dynamics and even for multiple baths. We numerically verify this master equation in Sec. IV by comparing it to dynamics computed using exact diagonalization. This is done for a variety of pure bath states such as single eigenstates, random states and product states. We also consider an integrable model which shows disagreement with the master equation for finite sized baths. These results indicate that in finite sized systems, chaos ensures a consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamics for a much broader class of initial bath states than is commonly used in OQS theory. Units with \hbar=1=k_{B} are used throughout this paper."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08850v1,Typical Positivity of Nonequilibrium Entropy Production for Pure States,"We establish that the nonequilibrium dynamics of most pure states gives rise to the same entropy production as that of the corresponding ensemble, provided the effective dimension of the ensemble is large enough. This establishes the positivity of entropy production under a wide variety of nonequilibrium situations. Our results follow from dynamical typicality and suitable continuity properties alone, without relying on non-integrability, and they complement other recent efforts to establish “pure state second laws”. An explicit comparison with the distinctively different two-point measurement scheme is also provided.","References Esposito et al. (2009) M. Esposito, U. Harbola, and S.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08709v1,On the foundations of statistical mechanics,"Although not as wide, and popular, as that of quantum mechanics, the investigation of fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics constitutes an important research field in the building of modern physics. Besides the interest for itself, both for physicists and philosophers, and the obvious pedagogical motivations, there is a further, compelling reason for a thorough understanding of the subject. The fast development of models and methods at the edge of the established domain of the field requires indeed a deep reflection on the essential aspects of the theory, which are at the basis of its success. These elements should never be disregarded when trying to expand the domain of statistical mechanics to systems with novel, little known features.It is thus important to (re)consider in a careful way the main ingredients involved in the foundations of statistical mechanics. Among those, a primary role is covered by the dynamical aspects (e.g. presence of chaos), the emergence of collective features for large systems, and the use of probability in the building of a consistent statistical description of physical systems.With this goal in mind, in the present review we aim at providing a consistent picture of the state of the art of the subject, both in the classical and in the quantum realm. In particular, we will highlight the similarities of the key technical and conceptual steps with emphasis on the relevance of the many degrees of freedom, to justify the use of statistical ensembles in the two domains.","Statistical mechanics (SM) finds its motivation in the study of the behaviour and properties of macroscopic bodies, i.e. of systems composed of a very large number of particles (atoms or molecules). These elementary constituents are supposed to follow mechanical laws, either classical or quantum depending on the case [1]. The description of the whole system’s evolution at this level of detail is often referred to as microscopic dynamics. Its investigation is not only extremely challenging, but also unnecessary for most purposes: in everyday life, as well as in practical applications, one is rather interested in the macroscopic dynamics, i.e. the evolution of a reduced number of observables that are accessible at the macroscopic scale (e.g., temperature, pressure and so on). These quantities follow much simpler, deterministic laws, which define the thermodynamics of the system. From an historical point of view, most of them were discovered empirically, without an insightful theoretical basis: as Gibbs once said [2, 3], Thermodynamics is only a blind guide. The primary purpose of SM is therefore to give theoretical grounds to thermodynamics, exploiting the principles of probability theory and the knowledge of the microscopic dynamical laws. It is worth stressing that the simplicity of thermodynamical laws, in spite of the expected complexity of the total microscopic evolution, is due to the fact that measuring a macroscopic observable is equivalent to averaging over many degrees of freedom. The lower level of complexity at the macroscopic scale does not descend in a mechanicistic way from the combinations of microscopic interactions: it is a qualitatively different phenomenon. In this sense SM is not, as one may think, an archetypal example of rigid reductionism: it is rather a set of methods and techniques, founded mainly on probability theory, to explore and analyze the macroscopic behaviour of a mechanical system, in the limit of a large number of degrees of freedom. The aim of the present review is to provide a (non-exhaustive) picture of the main conceptual aspects at the basis of SM for classical and quantum systems. To this end, we collected those contributions, both from classical works and from recent literature, that tried to answer the question: “Why does SM work?”. Given that the problem of SM foundations is one and a half century old, one may wonder why to discuss it today. In our opinion there are several good reasons for that: 1. The subject is of interest by itself, both for scientists and philosophers, because it exemplifies how a radically new phenomenon can emerge from the typical behaviour of a lower-level one. In particular, the relation between microscopic and macroscopic laws allows to understand why, in many branches of science, the reductionist approach to complex phenomena is prone to failure [4, 5, 6]. 2. The subject is pedagogically relevant: far from being a pure intellectual exercise, it allows instead for a concrete discussion of the main conceptual issues concerning the link between different levels of description of a given reality. Statistical mechanics has proved to be, so far, the only methodological and conceptual framework in theoretical physics which is valid at all scales, from the cosmic ones dominated by classical gravitational interactions to the microscopic ones where quantum mechanics is at play, provided that the number of involved degrees of freedom is large. In order to stress the similarities of SM foundation problems in the classical and quantum domain a whole section of this review work will be dedicated to the SM of quantum many-body systems. 3. Although classical and quantum SM share many similarities in their basic structure, there are also important differences related to quantum phenomena having no classical analog, such as quantum entanglement and the interpretative difficulties associated with macroscopic superpositions. Therefore, the study of the foundations of statistical mechanics may be relevant to the foundations of quantum mechanics and vice versa. 4. The subject is important in the development of current technology: for instance, challenging frontiers for the applications of statistical physics are provided by systems with a small number of degrees of freedom, far from the thermodynamic limit, such as those of interest in bio- and nano-technologies. Therefore the foundations and applicability of the theory have to be scrutinised [1], in the light of a presumably even higher relevance of probabilities than in the original framework of SM. Before introducing the content of the single sections of this review, it is useful to retrace quickly the main steps that brought to the formulation of the theory of SM as it is known nowadays. A comprehensive historical digression exceeds instead the scope of this review paper: the interested reader can refer to [7, 8, 9, 10, 7]. As far as we know, the first primitive form of SM is due to Daniel Bernoulli. His derivation of Boyle’s law relies on the intuition that the pressure on the walls of a container comes from the average effect of the impacts of many molecules. Bernoulli’s theory (1738) was then almost forgotten for more than a century, until Rudolf Clausius built his own kinetic theory of gases (1857), where the fundamental concept of mean free path (i.e., the free space crossed by a molecule in the time interval between two collisions with other molecules) was introduced for the first time. After Clausius, Maxwell came to the idea of a probability distribution of the velocities of molecules in a gas, which is the first important systematic application of probabilistic concepts to physics [9]. The progress of SM was strictly related to the development of the theory of atomism. The kinetic theory of gases provided empirical and theoretical support to the atomistic point of view, predicting experimental laws as, e.g., the celebrated result (due to Maxwell) that the viscosity of gases is independent of the density. The most important contributions in this sense are due to Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann. His celebrated H-theorem allowed to reconcile the familiar notion of macroscopic irreversibility with the deterministic nature of the micorscopic motion [11]. This success of kinetic theory greatly contributed to the building of SM. The third founding father of SM was Gibbs, who, with his celebrated booklet [2], contributed to build a systematic theory. In the modern textbooks we still use Gibbs’s terminology for the ensembles (i.e. microcanonical, canonical and grand canonical). Sometimes Boltzmann and Gibbs are viewed as the champions of different points of view about SM. According to this vulgata, Gibbs would be the founder of the ensemble approach, in contrast with Boltzmann’s view based on dynamical theory and ergodicity. As a matter of fact both ergodicity and ensembles (originally called monodes) are inventions of Boltzmann, although he is not always credited of them [10]. In Boltzmann’s works it is also shown that, in the thermodynamic limit, the ergode and the holode (respectively the microcanonical and canonical ensemble) are equivalent. This is also the reason for the name of the ergodic hypothesis, where all states belonging to the same ergode are supposed to be equiprobable, and of the consequent ergodic theory. It is worth recalling that kinetic theory was alternative to the traditional understanding of thermodynamics employed until the beginning of 19th century to explain heat flow, which involved the use of an imponderable material called “caloric”. Still in the late 19th century, in spite of the important results of kinetic theory, the influential “energetistic” school was rejecting atomism, based on the success of phenomenological thermodynamics [7, 11]. This skepticism, which may now seem surprising, at that time was supported by important scientists and philosophers such as, e.g., P. Duhem, E. Mach, and W. Ostwald. In their positivistic point of view, the champions of the energetistic school believed that macroscopic phenomena (such as chemical reactions) should be treated solely in terms of phenomenological descriptions. Their approach was based on the conservation of energy and the spontaneous increase of entropy, and atoms were only regarded as a useful mathematical tool, with no realistic physical grounds. Since atoms and molecules were not visible, a decisive evidence of the atomic structure was considered to be impossible, and the atomic theory a physically unverifiable hypothesis. The followers of Energeticism also considered the phenomenological thermodynamics better than atomism in explaining the second law of thermodynamics. One of the reasons for such an opinion is the fact that Newtonian mechanics, owing to its time reversal property, cannot be exploited to distinguish between past and future [11, 10]. At the beginning of 20th century, a new stimulus to SM came from the study of Brownian motion by Langevin, Einstein and Smoluchovsky. The stochastic dynamics of a colloidal particle suspended in a fluid required new mathematical tools based on probability theory, and set the ground to the development of stochastic processes. It is interesting that Einstein did not care about the Brownian motion in itself: his real purpose was to show that microscopic bodies suspended in a liquid possess an observable fluctuating movement, which can only be justified in the light of the molecular theory of heat. In other words, he aimed at finding an experimental evidence of the existence of atoms, in line with Boltzmann’s point of view. Using Einstein’s formula on Brownian Motion, Perrin was even able to “count” the number of atoms in a volume of fluid, by measuring the diffusion of a suspended colloidal particle. After Perrin’s experimental validation, even the last followers of Energetisms capitulated to the increasingly compelling evidence in favour of atomism. Even after this striking success, a consistent fraction of the scientific community did not appreciate SM: beyond the philosophical perplexities of the energetistic school, some fundamental facts were still hard to explain, e.g., the temperature dependence of the specific heat in polyatomic molecules and in the diamond. After the introduction of Quantum Mechanics (QM), a suitable generalization of SM taking into account the quantum effects was able to solve most of these problems. While the understanding of specific phenomena was improved, the impact of QM on SM had mainly a technical nature, leaving untouched the basic aspects of the theory. The last century has seen a wealth of contributions in every branch of SM. In the 1930’s, the studies by Birkhoff and von Neumann on the ergodic theory, and the seminal work of Krylov on mixing gave important contributions to the foundations of SM. In the 1940’s, Onsager’s exact solution for the 2D Ising model proved that the formalism of SM can describe phase transitions and critical phenomena. The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingiou (FPUT) numerical experiment on nonlinear Hamiltonian systems (1955) started a fruitful research line on the problem of ergodicity in dynamical systems [12], which culminated with the KAM theorem for the regular behavior of almost integrable Hamiltonians, proposed by Kolmogorov and subsequently completed by Arnold and Moser [13] (1954-1963). Between 1960 and 1980 the research in SM was dominated by the study of universality for critical phenomena [14], renormalization group [15] and the relation with limit theorems of probability [16, 17, 18], with reciprocal influence between SM and quantum field theoretic ideas and methods. At the same time, the mathematical physics community was able to prove rigorous mathematical results for the Boltzmann equation [19]. In more recent times, the study of ergodicity-breaking transitions without symmetry breaking [20], and the ensemble formalism for ergodicity-breaking transition in disordered systems by Parisi [21, 22] are among the main achievements. The above timeline should clarify that the foundation of SM was the result of the collective effort of several generations of scientists, spanned over more than 150 years. The present paper is a (necessarily partial) review of the works that mostly contributed to that fascinating conceptual quest. In Section I we discuss the two great intuition of Boltzmann that mainly contributed to the birth of Statistical Mechanics, namely the existence of a “bridge law” connecting microscopic and macroscopic description, and the ergodic hypothesis. Section II is devoted to the subsequent effort to define ergodicity in a proper physical sense, relating the concept to the time-scales of the dynamics. In Section III we analyze the role of chaos in the foundation of SM; in particular we discuss Khinchin’s point of view, which does not require the presence of chaos to observe ergodic behaviour of physically meaningful onservables. The problem of irreversibility is reviewed in Section IV, where we report the main contributions stemming from Boltzmann’s celebrated H-theorem. In Section V we show that Boltzmann’s approach can be safely extended to the domain of quantum mechanics, introducing the concept of (quantum) thermal equilibrium dominance. Section VI is devoted to the review of the notion of typicality in this context: here we also discuss important differences with the classical case, due to the intrinsically quantum phenomenon of entanglement. Section VII focuses on thermalization, reviewing contributions on the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis and quantum chaos. In Section VIII we explicitly discuss some misconceptions and possible pitfalls on the conceptual aspects of SM. Finally in Section IX we outline some conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08480v1,Single impurity in the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process,"We examine the behavior of a single impurity particle embedded within a Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP). By analyzing the impurity’s dynamics, characterized by two arbitrary hopping parameters \alpha and \beta, we investigate both its macroscopic impact on the system and its individual trajectory, providing new insights into the interaction between the impurity and the TASEP environment. We classify the induced hydrodynamic limit shapes based on the initial densities to the left and right of the impurity, along with the values of the parameters \alpha,\beta. We develop a new method that enables the analysis of the impurity’s behavior within an arbitrary density field, thereby generalizing the traditional coupling technique used for second-class particles. With this tool, we extend to the impurity case under certain parameter conditions, Ferrari and Kipnis’s results on the distribution of the asymptotic speed of a second-class particle within a rarefaction fan.","The study of non-equilibrium stochastic processes is pivotal in understanding various natural phenomena, encompassing a wide range of fields including physics, chemistry [1], biology [2, 3], and interdisciplinary areas [4]. Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics exhibits a surprisingly rich array of physical phenomena, including phase transitions [5], even in one–dimensional systems. Models in one spatial dimension often possess the advantageous feature of being analytically tractable. A paradigmatic example of exactly solvable model is the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP), which is widely recognized as a fundamental model for non–equilibrium transport processes [6]. ASEP has found applications in diverse contexts such as traffic and pedestrian flow [7] , mRNA translation by ribosomes [8], and motor protein transport along single filaments [7], among others. At a macroscopic level, ASEP’s hydrodynamic behavior is well–established [9, 10]. However, introducing even a single microscopic impurity can substantially impact the system’s overall behavior and properties, creating complex effects that remain much less understood. One example of an impurity that has received considerable interest in the literature is a slow bond at a single site [11, 12]. In this article, we explore a different type of impurity: an impurity particle (hereafter referred to as the ”impurity”), which follows distinct dynamics compared to regular particles (hereafter referred to simply as ”particles”). To be more specific, we consider the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) in presence of an impurity. In this model each site of a one–dimensional lattice can be either empty or occupied by either a particle or an impurity. A particle hops forward on an empty site with rate 1, while an impurity hops on an empty site with rate \alpha. In addition to this, a particle can overtake an impurity with rate \beta. Denoting a particle by \bullet, an empty site by \circ and an impurity by \ast, the dynamics of the model can be schematically represented by the following exchanges with the corresponding rates \bullet\,\circ\xrightarrow{1}\circ\bullet\qquad\ast\,\circ\xrightarrow{\alpha}% \circ\ast\qquad\bullet\,\ast\xrightarrow{\beta}\ast\bullet. This model has been first considered in [13, 14], where the stationary measure on a finite periodic lattice was written in a matrix product ansatz form [15, 16]. Generalizations with an arbitrary number of impurities have considered in [17, 18]. When \alpha=\beta=1, the impurity reduces to what is commonly known as a ”second-class particle”, a concept which was introduced as early as the exclusion process itself [19]. From a hydrodynamic perspective, the evolution of the particle density in this setting is governed by the inviscid Burgers equation. Here, a second-class particle acts as a tracer, moving along the characteristics of the inviscid Burgers equation that originate from its position [20, 21]. In the scenarios involving a shock, a second-class particle accurately tracks the shock’s position [22, 15]. Interestingly, if such a particle is added to a point where multiple characteristics emerge (i.e., a decreasing discontinuity), it will randomly select one of the available characteristics. The distribution of the asymptotic average speed of the second–class particle is highly sensitive to its precise initial position. Ferrari and Knipsis [23] have considered the case where in the initial configuration the first–class particles are distributed following product Bernoulli measure with densities \rho_{L}>\rho_{R} to the left and right of the second–class particle respectively. They have shown that the asymptotic speed of the second–class particle is uniformly distributed distributed in the interval [1-2\rho_{L},1-2\rho_{R}] (see also [24]). This result has been extended to the ASEP case, as proven in [25]; see also the recent work in [26]. More general initial conditions in the TASEP case have been considered by Cator and Pimentel [27]. Using the well–known last–passage percolation (LPP) formulation of the TASEP, and then the connection between second class particles and competition interfaces in the LPP [28, 29], they have shown that the limiting speed of the second–class particle can be expressed in terms of the supremum of certain random walks. While a second-class particle does not alter the macroscopic evolution of the first-class particle density, this may no longer hold for an impurity with arbitrary values of the parameters \alpha and \beta. The first objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of a single impurity on the density profile, considering the impurity rates \alpha and \beta. Using heuristic hydrodynamics, we analyze the evolution of an initially smooth profile and then focus on cases where the impurity is positioned at a density discontinuity, identifying conditions under which the impurity modifies the density profile and detailing the nature of these changes. More specifically, we examine an initial profile consisting of a region with constant density \rho_{L} to the left of the impurity and a region with constant density \rho_{R} to the right. When \rho_{L}>\rho_{R}, the absence of the impurity would lead to the development of a rarefaction fan. This fan structure generally persists, except in the parameter region defined by \alpha+\beta<1, \beta<\rho_{R}, and \alpha<1-\rho_{L}. Under these conditions, the impurity induces an anti–shock, a discontinuity where the density increases from left to right, with a left density of 1-\alpha and a right density of \beta. On top of the anti–shock we may observe a shock to the left and or to the right of the impurity. These results are summarized in Figure 3. For numerical simulations illustrating this behavior, see 4(a)–4(d). When \rho_{L}<\rho_{R}, the absence of the impurity would result in a shock propagating with speed v_{s}=1-\rho_{L}-\rho_{R}. This shock structure generally remains intact, except in the parameter region defined by \beta<\rho_{R}, and \alpha<1-\rho_{L}. Under these conditions, the shock splits into two shocks, separated by an anti-shock located at the impurity position. For numerical simulations illustrating this behavior, see Figures 6(a)–6(d). A second objective of this paper is to analyze the trajectory of the impurity itself. When the initial density profile is smooth, the impurity propagates at a constant average speed over long times, determined entirely by the initial conditions. However, if the impurity is positioned at a decreasing density discontinuity with \alpha+\beta>1, the situation changes: while the impurity still reaches a constant asymptotic speed, this speed becomes a random variable, no longer uniquely determined by the initial conditions. The main challenge in extending the analysis of a second-class particle’s trajectory to that of an impurity with arbitrary jumping rates \alpha and \beta arises from the breakdown of the standard approach, which characterizes the second-class particle as a discrepancy between two coupled TASEP systems [19, 23]. To address this difficulty, we use a hole–particle pair representation of the impurity, as introduced by Ferrari and Pimentel in the case of a second–class particle [28]. To adapt this approach to the impurity case, we apply Weber’s interchangeability theorem from queueing theory [30]. This allows us to represent the trajectory of the impurity alone (rather than the entire system) through the dynamics of a particle–hole pair in a TASEP system, where a tagged particle and a tagged hole move with respective jumping rates \alpha and \beta. We are thus able to generalize the result by Ferrari and Kipnis for the case where \alpha,\beta\leq 1 and \alpha+\beta\geq 1 and the impurity is initially positioned at the interface between a fully occupied region on the left and an empty region on the right. We prove that, under these conditions, the asymptotic speed of the impurity is uniformly distributed over the interval [1-2\beta,2\alpha-1]. If \alpha>1, the impurity may ”escape” to the right of the rarefaction fan; similarly, if \beta>1 the impurity may escape to the left. We conjecture that, conditioned to the impurity to remain within the fan, its asymptotic speed is uniformly distributed in the interval [\max(1-2\beta,-1),\min(2\alpha-1,1)]. Numerical simulations suggest that, for more general left/right density configurations, the asymptotic speed of the impurity is no longer uniformly distributed within the allowed interval. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1, we utilize hydrodynamics to investigate the behavior of the density profile as a function of the impurity rates \alpha and \beta. Section 2 begins with a review of the hole–particle pair representation of the impurity. In Section 2.2, we establish one of the paper’s main results, Theorem 2.3, which states that the trajectory of the impurity shares the same distribution as that of a hole–particle pair in a TASEP with a tagged particle having a jumping rate \alpha and a tagged hole with jumping rate \beta. In Section 2.3, we apply Theorem 2.3, to first recover, using purely probabilistic arguments, the known result [14, 31] regarding the asymptotic speed of an impurity in an initially uniform density profile. We then apply the same theorem to determine the distribution of the speed of an impurity with jumping rates \alpha,\beta<1 and \alpha+\beta>1, initially locate at the interface of a 1–0 density profile. Finally, we conclude with a computation of the escape probabilities for the impurity from the rarefaction fan, starting from an initial 1–0 density profile."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08154v1,Fast Sampling of Protein Conformational Dynamics,"Protein function does not solely depend on structure but often relies on dynamical transitions between distinct conformations. Despite this fact, our ability to characterize or predict protein dynamics is substantially less developed compared to state-of-the-art protein structure prediction. Molecular simulations provide unique opportunities to study protein dynamics, but the timescales associated with conformational changes generate substantial challenges. Enhanced sampling algorithms with collective variables can greatly reduce the computational cost of sampling slow processes. However, defining collective variables suitable to enhance sampling of protein conformational transitions is non-trivial. Low-frequency vibrations have long been considered as promising candidates for collective variable but their identification so far relied on assumptions inherently invalid at low frequencies. We recently introduced an analysis of molecular vibrations that does not rely on such approximations and remains accurate at low frequencies. Here, we modified this approach to efficiently isolate low-frequency vibrations in proteins and applied it to a set of five proteins of varying complexity. We demonstrate that our approach is not only highly reproducible but results in collective variables that consistently enhance sampling of protein conformational transitions and associated free energy surfaces on timescales compatible with high throughput applications. This enables the efficient generation of protein conformational ensembles, which will be key for future prediction algorithms aiming beyond static protein structures.","Recent advances in protein structure prediction driven by machine learning (e.g., Alphafold [1, 2, 3, 4], ESMfold [5], RoseTTAFold [6, 7]) have dramatically improved capabilities for structure-based designs of enzymes and other proteins (e.g., RFdiffusion [8]). However, protein function is often not the result of a single stable conformation but involves reversible conformational transitions between two or more distinct states, i.e., protein dynamics [9, 10, 11]. The characterization or prediction of protein dynamics requires more intricate information on the associated free energy surfaces than current machine-learning models can provide. Stability differences between distinct conformational states that reversibly inter-convert are small (by definition) and thus challenging to predict reliably. Nevertheless, machine learning (ML) approaches are likely going to play a critical role for the inclusion of protein dynamics in computational enzyme design strategies. A remaining challenge is the lack of reliable and diverse training data for protein dynamics. Compared to hundreds of thousands of experimentally determined protein structures in the PDB [12], the dynamics of proteins are characterized in detail for only a limited set of systems. With few exceptions (e.g., time-resolved x-ray crystallography [13, 14]), many experiments characterize protein conformational dynamics only in terms of distance fluctuations between individually labeled sites [15]. Even sophisticated multi-color single-molecule FRET experiments [16, 17, 18, 19] that track multiple distances simultaneously, do not provide fine-grained structural information that is easily used to train ML models of protein dynamics. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a critical role in expanding the available data on protein conformational transitions at an atomic-level. Enhanced sampling simulations along suitable CVs can drastically accelerate sampling of slow conformational dynamics [20, 21]. However, without prior knowledge of suitable collective variables (CVs) to drive conformational transitions in biased simulations, MD simulations of proteins are typically under-sampled (with notable exceptions [22, 23, 24, 25, 11]) and remain too costly to run on timescales associated with relevant biomolecular functions (often milliseconds to seconds). Determining a suitable set of low-dimensional CVs to explore the dynamics of a given protein has remained a pervasive challenge. Selecting CVs typically requires prior knowledge of the conformational changes to be observed and, ideally, CVs align with the most likely transition pathways. Identifying suitable CVs without prior knowledge is an active field of research [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. We recently developed a theoretical framework that allows for the analysis of anharmonic low-frequency vibrations in molecules including proteins: frequency-selective anharmonic (FRESEAN) mode analysis [32]. In contrast to low-frequency harmonic or quasi-harmonic normal modes, which have historically been envisioned as potential CVs to explore protein conformational space [33, 34, 35, 36], FRESEAN mode analysis does not rely on approximations that are invalid at the lowest frequencies. Instead, we demonstrated that FRESEAN mode analysis can isolate collective degrees of freedom that describe structural distortions associated with minimal restraining forces [32]. We speculated that such motions may be associated with conformational dynamics [32] and performed enhanced sampling MD simulations for a test system, alanine dipeptide, that utilized vibrational modes obtained from FRESEAN mode analysis as CVs to speed up sampling of the peptide conformational space [37]. Here, we expand this work to a set of proteins with known conformational dynamics that provide a suitable test set. We combine our approach with coarse-grained representations of all-atom protein simulations designed to retain information on the lowest-frequency vibrations. In the following, we show that FRESEAN mode analysis of short MD simulations yields highly reproducible vibrational modes at low frequencies. Further, enhanced sampling simulations using these modes as CVs reliably sample known conformational transitions in each test protein. Our approach does not require prior knowledge of expected conformational transitions and can be performed in a single day using standard high performance computing hardware. Such throughput enables, for example, generating large data sets for protein conformational ensembles to train the next generation of ML models, which are capable to predict combined relationships between protein sequence, structure, and dynamics."

In the Affleck-Haldane picture, an ‘extension field’ parametrises the correlated fluctuations of the couplings and extends the target space from S^{2} to S^{3}; recently, however, Zirnbauer has advanced a competing picture where the extension field is frozen out and the infrared theory is more naturally thought of as a compact free boson dual to \mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_{1}. We show that the J_{1}–J_{2} spin chain evinces a phase transition between these pictures – corresponding to whether the dimer field that parametrises local singlet order is part of a joint O(4) Néel-singlet order parameter or appears as a separate gapped mode. For the O(3) NLSM itself, this analysis supports the Zirnbauer picture.","References Auerbach [2012] A.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08692v1,"Inferring Parameter Distributions in Heterogeneous Motile Particle Ensembles: 
A Likelihood Approach for Second Order Langevin Models","The inherent complexity of biological agents often leads to motility behavior that appears to have random components. Robust stochastic inference methods are therefore required to understand and predict the motion patterns from time discrete trajectory data provided by experiments. In many cases second order Langevin models are needed to adequately capture the motility. Additionally, population heterogeneity needs to be taken into account when analyzing data from several individual organisms. In this work, we describe a maximum likelihood approach to infer dynamical, stochastic models and, simultaneously, estimate the heterogeneity in a population of motile active particles from discretely sampled, stochastic trajectories. To this end we propose a new method to approximate the likelihood for non-linear second order Langevin models. We show that this maximum likelihood ansatz outperforms alternative approaches especially for short trajectories. Additionally, we demonstrate how a measure of uncertainty for the heterogeneity estimate can be derived. We thereby pave the way for the systematic, data-driven inference of dynamical models for actively driven entities based on trajectory data, deciphering temporal fluctuations and inter-particle variability.","One of the drivers of active matter research has been the goal to understand and describe the motility behavior of biological agents which span orders of magnitude from microorganisms and cancer cells to flocks of sheep and birds [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The inherent complexity of even single-cellular organisms and the plethora of unobserved internal degrees of freedom leads to motility patterns which appear to have random components. For this reason, stochastic models and, more specifically, stochastic differential equations (SDEs) or Langevin equations, have emerged as an important model class to describe the motility of macroscopic [6, 7, 8, 9] as well as microscopic biological agents [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Motility data from active particles takes the form of discretely sampled trajectories. Experimental setups often have a limited field of view and do not allow to follow a single individual for an extended time. Instead of a few long trajectories, only short trajectories from many different individuals are available in these situations. This poses a challenge especially if the observed population is not homogeneous, i. e. there is inter-individual variability. While individuality of macroscopic animals might be intuitive, even populations of genetically identical microscopic organisms display heterogeneity [15, 16, 17, 18]. This population heterogeneity can manifest itself in the motility behavior of the organisms [19, 20]. Even if the motility of all particles is captured by the same type of motility model, the parameters of this model will differ from individual to individual in heterogeneous populations. Population heterogeneity can lead to unusual behavior of statistical quantities like non-Gaussian displacement distributions [21, 22]. Ignorance about the heterogeneity can therefore result in wrong conclusions about the model. So far, heterogeneity inference for populations of motile microorganisms has mostly been limited to splitting the whole population into several subpopulations according to properties of the individual trajectories [11, 23]. Other approaches to infer population heterogeneity in biological systems include parameter fitting for each individual particle [22] and using forward simulations of the system to optimize a superposition of ansatz functions [24, 25]. Recently, it has also been suggested to use forward simulations to determine the parameter spread within a population from trajectory data [26]. A general approach that allows inference of arbitrarily parametrized continuous distributions and that utilizes the available trajectory information in an optimal way through likelihood based methods is still missing. Similar challenges have emerged in biomedical research in general and in the subfield of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in particular [27]. The metabolism of medical drugs can be described by SDEs, but the parameters of these SDEs may vary significantly between individual patients. In this community such SDEs with heterogeneity of the parameters are known as stochastic differential mixed effects models (SDMEMs). A number of methods and algorithms have been proposed to solve this inference problem. They range from analytical approximations [28] over stochastic approximations [29] to Bayesian inference using sophisticated particle methods [30, 31]. We point to Ref. [32] for an extensive list of references. There are also a number of contributions about theoretical properties of estimators in such systems [33]. However, there are some peculiarities about motility data that call for specialized methods. The positional dynamics of active particles will often require a second order description. In macroscopic inertial systems like flocks of birds, second order dynamics arise naturally through the Newtonian equations of motion [6]. But also for microorganisms whose motion is usually governed by low Reynolds numbers and is therefore overdamped, a first order description might not be sufficient—if the complex propulsion mechanism generates a force with fluctuations that are best described by a first order Langevin equation, the positional dynamics become second order [12, 34]. This makes the observed positional process non-Markovian and does not allow for inference through transition density estimation. Recently, new inference methods for homogeneous second order motility models have been introduced [35, 36]. However, these studies focus on the calculation of single point estimates for the motility parameters of each individual. In order to estimate the population heterogeneity from the available data in an optimal way, the full likelihood of the motility parameters is required. This is especially important if the measured trajectories have a short duration limiting the available information per trajectory. In the context of discrete time processes instead of continuous SDEs, motility inference based on likelihoods was discussed in Ref. [37]—the parameters inferred by this method will, however, depend on the sampling interval. While individual trajectories may be very short, many experimental settings allow, however, for high sampling rates. This means that the relevant limit in this case is short measurement intervals \tau while the total duration of the trajectories T remains constant. An inference method for motility data needs to be able to deal with potentially many data points per trajectory while converging to the true likelihood in the small \tau limit. In this work, we address the challenges summarized above by presenting a maximum likelihood based framework to infer distributions of motility parameters in heterogeneous ensembles of active particles. Maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) are known to have favorable theoretical properties like consistency, equivariance and efficiency. To this end, we introduce a new way to approximate the likelihood of the parameters of the motility model with respect to single trajectories in second order settings. This method yields an analytical approximation to the likelihood with a concise functional form. The derivation has some parallels with the approach taken in Ref. [36]. In contrast to this previous work which considers a drift comprised of a linear velocity-dependent term and a non-linear position-dependent term, here, we focus on models independent of position but with non-linear drift terms. We then plug this approximation into an expectation maximization (EM) scheme to obtain an MLE for the heterogeneity. Furthermore, we show how to obtain robust error estimates for the estimator. A methodologically different approximation of the likelihood in second order settings can be obtained using extended Kalman Filters [29, 38]. This provides a general approximation for partially observed systems by sequentially integrating out the unobserved parts of the system. This sequential algorithm, however, does not provide a closed-form expression for the likelihood and cannot provide intuitions about its parameter dependence. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section II we introduce the model and details of the maximum likelihood approach. In Section III we demonstrate how naive approaches can fail for second order Langevin models and derive an approximate likelihood expression of the motility parameters. In Section IV we show how this approximation can be used to calculate a heterogeneity estimator together with its uncertainty. Finally, Section V presents the results of numerical experiments, before we end with some final remarks in Section VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08512v1,"From noisy cell size control to population growth: 
when variability can be beneficial","Single-cell experiments revealed substantial variability in generation times, growth rates but also in birth and division sizes between genetically identical cells. Understanding how these fluctuations determine the fitness of the population, i.e. its growth rate, is necessary in any quantitative theory of evolution. Here, we develop a biologically-relevant model which accounts for the stochasticity in single-cell growth rates, birth sizes and division sizes. We derive expressions for the population growth rate and for the mean birth size in the population in terms of the single-cell fluctuations. Allowing division sizes to fluctuate reveals how the mechanism of cell size control (timer, sizer, adder) influences population growth. Surprisingly, we find that fluctuations in single-cell growth rates can be beneficial for population growth when slow-growing cells tend to divide at smaller sizes than fast-growing cells. Our framework is not limited to exponentially-growing cells like Escherichia coli, and we derive similar expressions for cells with linear and bi-linear growth laws, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, respectively.","In good conditions with an adequate supply of resources, the number N of cells in a population grows exponentially in the long time limit, N\sim e^{\lambda t}, where the population growth rate \lambda, or Malthus parameter, is a proxy for population fitness. It is well understood that this fitness depends on the environmental conditions, such as temperature and nutrients for instance [1, 2, 3]. However, recent single-cell experiments revealed a high degree of phenotypic variability between individual cells of isogenic populations, for example in generation times (time from cell birth to division) and single-cell growth rates, even in steady environments [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The dependence of the population growth rate on this inter-cellular variability is starting to be investigated [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] but is yet to be fully understood. In a seminal article, Powell showed that variability in generation times increases the population growth rate for age-regulated populations [16], a control mechanism today called timer [17]. However, the timer mechanism does not account for the observed mother-daughter correlations in generation times [12], and also does not lead to a steady size distribution for exponentially-growing cells [18, 19]. Steady-state size distributions are reached when cell size is controlled instead of cell age. Mechanisms of cell size control include the sizer strategy, where cells divide when reaching a critical size, and the adder strategy where cells divide after growing by a critical added size since birth [17]. Moreover, these mechanisms produce the expected negative mother-daughter correlations in generation times, since, intuitively, a cell with a large generation time tends to divide big and thus to give birth to a big daughter cell, which in turn takes a short time to reach its target division size [7, 12]. Experiments showed that many organisms indeed follow these phenomenological size control strategies [17], with an ubiquity of near-adder mechanisms in bacteria such as Escherichia coli [6, 7, 8], Caulobacter crescentus [6], Bacillus subtilis [7]; budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [20]; Mycobacterium smegmatis [21]; archaeal cell Halobacterium salinarum [22] and in a variety of mammalian cells [23], while a near-sizer strategy characterizes the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe [24]. Recent re-examination of the impact of single-cell variability on population growth, for size-regulated populations of exponentially-growing cells, showed that population fitness is primarily set by the statistics of single-cell growth rates rather than generation times [10, 12]. Indeed, in the absence of fluctuations in single-cell growth rates, the population grows at the same rate as its individual cells independently of the presence of other sources of noise. This is a consequence of cell size control and can be understood intuitively as follows. Cell size grows as s(t)=s_{b}e^{\alpha t} with s_{b} the size at birth and \alpha the single-cell growth rate, therefore the total population volume V(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{N(t)}s_{i}(t) grows as V(t)=V_{0}e^{\alpha t} when \dot{s}_{i}=\alpha s_{i} with the same \alpha for all cells i. Since cell size is regulated, the average cell size in a population snapshot, V/N\sim e^{(\alpha-\lambda)t}, must converge, which implies \lambda=\alpha. On the other hand, population fitness is lowered by uncorrelated fluctuations in single-cell growth rates, because slow-growing cells have larger than average generation times and are thus more likely to appear in population snapshots, thus biasing the instantaneous growth rate of the total population volume towards low values [10, 12]. In these works, only the fluctuations in the single-cell growth rates have been investigated, and the mechanism of cell size control was considered infinitely precise such that all cells are born with size s_{b}=1 and divide with size s_{d}=2. Single-cell data nonetheless indicate that cell size control is a noisy process, where cells born with the same size can divide at different sizes, and where the two cells born from a division can be born with different birth sizes [5, 6, 7, 8, 22, 21]. The roles of cell size control and of noises in cell size for population growth thus remain to be studied. In this article, we propose an approach to investigate how population growth depends on fluctuations at the single-cell level, namely in growth rates, in cell size control and in size partitioning upon division. We start by computing the corrections to the population growth rate coming from noise in cell size control and in size partitioning for exponentially-growing cells, thus generalizing the result from [10, 12]. Those corrections are of second order, as they are conditioned on the presence of noise in single-cell growth rates, and depend explicitly on the mechanism of cell size control. Our approach is not limited to exponentially-growing cells, and we derive similar expressions for other biologically-relevant growth laws such as linear growth, recently observed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis [25] and the bi-linear growth pattern of fission yeast S. Pombe [26]. In these cases, corrections due to noise in cell size control and in size partitioning are of first order and independent of the presence of noise in single-cell growth rates. Finally, our analysis of data from [7] for E. coli in different conditions indicates that the mechanism of cell size control itself depends on the single-cell growth rate for exponentially-growing cells. In this case, we show that, unlike what was observed in [10, 12], uncorrelated fluctuations in single-cell growth rates can be beneficial for population growth."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08214v1,The role of correlations in a sequence of quantum observations on empirical measures,"The outcome of continuously measuring a quantum system is a string of data whose intricate correlation properties reflect the underlying quantum dynamics. In this paper we study the role of these correlation in reconstructing the probabilities of finite sequences of outcomes, the so-called empirical distributions. Our approach is cast in terms of generic quantum instruments, and therefore encompass all types of sequential and continuous quantum measurements. We also show how this specializes to important cases, such as quantum jumps. To quantify the precise role of correlations, we introduce a relative-entropy based measure that quantifies the range of correlations in the string, and the influence that these correlations have in reconstructing finite sequences.","When measuring a quantum system, the standard technique is the so-called “prepare and measure” approach, wherein the state of a system is reset after each measurement. However, this can be somewhat restrictive, and a broader approach would consist of sequentially measuring the same system over and over; i.e., the experiment is not reset between observations. This brings about additional complexities because of the interplay between information gain and measurement backaction which now has to be explicitly taken into account. The correlations between these measurement outcomes reveal crucial properties about the underlying quantum system, with famous examples including Glauber’s coherence functions Plenio and Knight (1998) or the shot noise in mesoscopic physics Büttiker (1992). A common class of sequentially measured systems are quantum jumps Plenio and Knight (1998); Wiseman and Milburn (2009); Landi et al. (2024). Although quantum mechanics often involves “smooth” unitary evolution, the introduction of quantum jumps can provide a powerful tool for describing sudden, irreversible processes that one may find in nature Piilo et al. (2008, 2009); Landi (2023); Hatridge et al. (2013); Blok et al. (2014); such as spontaneous transitions, measurements, and interactions with the environment. Correlations between quantum jumps can be highly non-trivial and play a significant role in the underlying stochastic dynamics Aharonov et al. (2006); Zou et al. (2024); Bagewadi and Chatterjee (2024); Schmid (1987); Dittrich and Graham (1990); Giovannetti et al. (2006); Yang (2019); Altherr and Yang (2021). Much focus has been placed on finding ways to minimize these correlations, such as through quantum non-demolition measurements Caves et al. (1980), to simplify the dynamics of the system. However, correlations do not inherently improve or worsen the results of the measurements Radaelli et al. (2023); Zou et al. (2024). Thus, further understanding the role correlations play, when not suppressed, can lead to improved developments in quantum technology. In this paper we consider the task of reconstructing finite sequences from a string of measurements of a quantum systems. The basic problem is illustrated in Fig. 1. A continuously measured quantum system yields a very long string of data, which is generally highly correlated. From these data one wishes to reconstruct the probabilities of finite sequences. These are the so-called empirical distributions (EDs) and represent a form of data compression. The simplest one, which we denote ED1, simply consists of counting how many times we obtain each outcome, in this case 0 or 1 (left histogram in Fig. 1). Because the data can be correlated, it is also of interest to compute higher order statistics: ED2, for instance, counts how many times each of the four possible sequences, \{00,01,10,11\}, appear in the string (middle histogram in Fig. 1). ED3 would count triplets, like 001 and 010 (right histogram in Fig. 1), and so on and so forth for higher order empirical distributions. Summary statistics such as the multi-point correlation function Tilloy (2018); Guilmin et al. (2023, 2024) and the empirical distribution explored here are capable of compressing large data sets while retaining some useful information around complex patterns. Motivated by this, we provide two main results. First, we provide general methods to calculate the covariance matrix between entries of the empirical distribution of arbitrary order. This contains information on how correlations in the outcomes affect our ability to reconstruct finite empirical distributions. These formulas are useful within the context of full counting statistics, since they are the basic building blocks used in assessing current fluctuations Landi et al. (2024), a topic that has recently been the subject of intense interest in the context of thermo-kinetic uncertainty relations Vo et al. (2022); Hasegawa (2023); Hasegawa and Vu (2019); Guarnieri et al. (2019); Hasegawa (2020, 2021); Timpanaro et al. (2019); Prech et al. (2023). As our second result, we introduce an information-theoretic measure, based on the relative entropy, which gauges how correlations in the empirical distributions affect our ability to reconstruct the process under simple (Markovian) assumptions. This yields insight into the role of complex correlations between strings of data. Our formalism is based on general quantum instruments, which therefore encompass the most general type of sequential quantum measurement Wiseman and Milburn (2009); Milz and Modi (2021). In addition to being more general, we also show that this greatly simplifies the mathematical framework. Connections with specific measurement schemes, particularly quantum jumps, are also discussed in detail. The work here complements previous work Radaelli et al. (2023, 2024) that focused on the role of correlations in metrology and parameter estimation. Here our focus is on the correlations themselves. Moreover, previous work focused almost exclusively on ED1, while here our focus is a general EDL. The paper is organized as follows: Sec. II summarizes important concepts for the paper, Sec. III presents a key measure of correlations for the empirical distribution of a quantum process (using calculations in Appendix A), an information theoretic measure of the role correlations play is given in Sec. IV, and illustrative examples are given in Sec. V. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Sec. VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08065v1,h-CMD: An efficient hybrid fast centroid and quasi-centroid molecular dynamics method for the simulation of vibrational spectra,"Developing efficient path integral (PI) methods for atomistic simulations of vibrational spectra in heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces has long been a challenging task. Here, we present the h-CMD method, short for hybrid centroid molecular dynamics, that combines the recently introduced fast quasi-CMD (f-QCMD) method with fast CMD (f-CMD). In this scheme, molecules that are believed to suffer more seriously from the curvature problem of CMD, e.g., water, are treated with f-QCMD, while the rest, e.g., solid surfaces, are treated with f-CMD. To test the accuracy of the newly introduced scheme, the infrared spectra of the interfacial D2O confined in the archetypal ZIF-90 framework are simulated using h-CMD compared to a variety of other PI methods, including thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (T-RPMD) and partially adiabatic CMD as well as f-CMD and experiment as reference. Comparisons are also made to classical MD, where nuclear quantum effects are neglected entirely. Our detailed comparisons at different temperatures of 250-600 K show that h-CMD produces O–D stretches that are in close agreement with the experiment, correcting the known curvature problem and red-shifting of the stretch peaks of CMD. h-CMD also corrects the known issues associated with too artificially dampened and broadened spectra of T-RPMD, which leads to missing the characteristic doublet feature of the interfacial confined water, rendering it unsuitable for these systems. The new h-CMD method broadens the applicability of f-QCMD to heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces, where defining curvilinear coordinates for the entire system is not feasible.","Liquid-air, liquid-liquid, and liquid-solid interfaces play critical roles in various chemical, biological, materials, and environmental processes. Vibrational infrared (IR) spectroscopy provides a wealth of information about interactions of molecules in condensed phases and at different interfaces, especially in aqueous environments.Sharma et al. (2008); Le Caër et al. (2011); Catafesta et al. (2014); Perakis et al. (2016) Specifically, IR spectra can reveal key fundamental insights into the complex hydrogen bond (HB) network of water and how it is influenced by temperature, pH, reducing or oxidizing potentials, and the presence of different ions, among others. Reliable atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of vibrational spectra requires an efficient way of incorporating nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). However, while the role of NQEs in chemical and material sciences is a widely acknowledged fact, the development of efficient computational methods and software platforms capable of incorporating them into MD simulations of complex systems has been a challenging task.Markland and Ceriotti (2018) Path-integral approaches, including path-integral MD (PIMD)Parrinello and Rahman (1984), centroid MD (CMD),Cao and Voth (1994a, b, c, d) and ring polymer MD (RPMD),Craig and Manolopoulos (2004, 2005a, 2005b) as well as a myriad of more sophisticated methods branched from them,Habershon et al. (2013) have emerged as the leading platform for the incorporation of NQEs in large-scale condensed-phase simulations. In these methods, NQEs are captured using Feynman’s imaginary-time path-integral formalism Feynman and Hibbs (1965); Feynman (1972) by taking advantage of the so-called isomorphism between the quantum-mechanical partition function and the partition function of a classical ring polymer (RP). Every nuclear degree of freedom (DOF) is represented by an RP comprised of n copies of the system, known as “beads”, connected by harmonic springs. The extended phase space of this RP captures NQEs, such as zero-point energy and nuclear tunneling. Hence, accurate yet computationally efficient path integral (PI) techniques provide powerful alternatives to prohibitively expensive full quantum-mechanical dynamical simulations. However, when it comes to calculating the IR spectra of complex heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces, the quantum dynamic community has struggled to propose a computationally efficient PI method that can accurately capture NQEs, which are more pronounced in spectra than other structural and dynamical properties. One of the most well-known formalisms to approximate the real-time dynamics while incorporating NQEs in the PI framework is CMD. In CMD, the dynamics of the particles are performed under the effective mean-field potential of the imaginary-time path-integral whose centroid is constrained to be at the position of the particle. For low dimensional systems, this effective potential can be calculated on a grid prior to dynamical simulations, while for large systems, it must be calculated “on-the-fly,” which is referred to as adiabatic CMD (ACMD).Cao and Voth (1994c) This is achieved by introducing an adiabatic separation between the centroid and internal modes by using the physical mass of the particle as the centroid mass, scaling down the mass of the internal modes of the RP, and attaching them to a thermostat so that they sample the equilibrium distribution while being constrained to the position of the slower moving centroid.Cao and Voth (1994c) Full adiabatic separation in CMD requires a very small mass for the internal modes and, thus, a very small simulation time step for the dynamics to be accurate. The computational cost associated with such choices led to the development of the partially adiabatic CMD (PA-CMD) method, where the mass scaling is not as extreme, allowing for a larger time step while still providing accurate dynamics.Hone, Rossky, and Voth (2006) Further work in reducing the computational cost of CMD comes in the form of fast CMD (f-CMD), where the effective potential is learned beforehand from PIMD simulations using force matching to create a new classical analytical force field Hone, Izvekov, and Voth (2005) or neural network potential (NNP) Loose, Sahrmann, and Voth (2022). It has been documented that vibrational spectra calculated using CMD methods exhibit red-shifting of peaks, primarily of stretch bands, which is worsened with the lowering of temperatures and/or for lighter particles.Ivanov et al. (2010) This phenomenon, dubbed the “curvature problem”, is a result of the RP spreading out along the angular coordinates of a system when approaching the inside of the stretching coordinates. This stretching reduces the force along the stretching coordinate, lowering the oscillation frequency of that coordinate and red-shifting the spectra. One approach to overcome the curvature problem is the quasi-centroid MD (QCMD) method introduced by Althorpe and coworkers. Trenins, Willatt, and Althorpe (2019a); Haggard et al. (2021); Trenins, Haggard, and Althorpe (2022a) QCMD works by defining a quasi-centroid (QC) for the molecule using curvilinear coordinates and determining the effective mean-field potential using an imaginary time RP that has its QC constrained to the particle position as opposed to its Cartesian centroid. Trenins, Willatt, and Althorpe (2019a) The resulting potential does not exhibit the same flattening on the inside of stretching curves as in CMD and thus does not have the red-shifting of vibrational spectra. The original adiabatic implementation of QCMD does not lend itself to scaling to complex chemical systems due to computational complexity and cost. Trenins, Willatt, and Althorpe (2019a); Trenins, Haggard, and Althorpe (2022a) Inspired by the f-CMD approach, Manolopoulos and coworkers developed the f-QCMD method. Fletcher et al. (2021); Lawrence et al. (2023a) In f-QCMD, a corrective potential to the classical force field is learned to create QCMD-like dynamics in classical simulations, but the corrections are found using iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) Soper (1996); Reith, Pütz, and Müller-Plathe (2003) on a set of distribution functions instead of force matching. While f-QCMD has shown reduced computational cost compared to QCMD, Fletcher et al. (2021); Lawrence et al. (2023a) determining the distribution functions for large molecules/frameworks poses a challenge. In a similar vein, Kapil and coworkers developed the temperature elevation PI coarse-graining simulations (Te PIGS) method. Musil et al. (2022) Like with some f-CMD implementations, a classical NNP is learned through force matching a PIMD simulation to incorporate NQEs. However, the PIMD simulations are performed at a high temperature where the RP distribution is more compact. Musil et al. (2022) The resulting NNP is then used for calculating vibrational spectra at lower temperatures without the curvature problem of CMD. Musil et al. (2022) While offering a simpler implementation for complex systems compared to f-QCMD, performing the high-temperature simulations to obtain the NNP could pose challenges for delicate systems or when using an NNP for the PIMD simulation where bond breaking/forming is possible at high temperatures. Here, to circumvent the curvature problem and create an accurate yet efficient scheme for calculating vibrational spectra of complex condensed phases and interfaces, we have devised a new method coined hybrid CMD (h-CMD) that combines f-QCMD and f-CMD methods. This method allows us to simulate interfacial systems involving complex frameworks with high accuracy for the most important degrees of freedom and reduced complexity for the others. To bring f-QCMD and f-CMD methods on equal computational footing, the latter f-CMD method is implemented with the regularized IBI method used in f-QCMD. We showcase the accuracy of our new hybrid h-CMD method on simulating IR spectra of D2O confined in zeolitic-imidazolate framework-90 (ZIF-90) compared to the experiment as reference. By comparing the spectra using our hybrid h-CMD method to PA-CMD and T-RPMD, as well as f-CMD and classical MD at different temperatures, we provide detailed insights into the applicability of this new scheme to complex interfaces. This work is structured as follows: In Section II, we outline our h-CMD method, followed by the methods used for calculating vibrational spectra. Simulation details are provided in Section III. In section IV, we provide our detailed analyses of the IR spectra of interfacial D2O confined in ZIF-90 at different temperatures, followed by conclusions and future works."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08058v1,"Enzymatic Mpemba Effect:
Slowing of biochemical reactions by increasing enzyme concentration","Increasing the enzyme concentration generally speeds up enzymatic reactions. However, in this Letter, we show that increasing the enzyme concentration can also slow down the enzymatic reaction. We consider a simple allosteric protein with multiple modification sites, catalyzed by two enzymes with the same catalytic activity, but slightly different affinities. We show that increasing the concentration of one enzyme can slow the relaxation to the equilibrium state. The mechanism for this slowing is similar the Markovian Mpemba effect, and we name this phenomenon as the Enzymatic Mpemba effect.","Appendix A Derivation of the binding probability of an enzyme We consider the probability of binding of only a single enzyme. Proteins with the different number of relaxed monomers have different binding energies, and a binding energy of the enzyme j to a substrate in the \sigma=i state is given by E^{\mathrm{b}j}_{i}. Therefore, the grand partition function and the average number of binding enzymes \langle N_{{\mathrm{E}nz}j}\rangle in equilibrium are represented in a similar manner as Langmuir’s adsorption isotherm and are given by \displaystyle\Xi \displaystyle= \displaystyle\prod_{i=0}^{M}\left\{1+\exp\left[\beta\left(E^{\mathrm{b}j}_{i}+% \mu\right)\right]\right\}^{N_{i}}, (6) \displaystyle\langle N_{\mathrm{Enz}j}\rangle \displaystyle= \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{M}N_{i}\frac{\exp(\beta\mu)}{\exp\left(-\beta E^{% \mathrm{b}j}_{i}\right)+\exp(\beta\mu)}, (7) where N_{i} is the number of substrate in the \sigma=i state. For both in vivo and in vitro reactions, N and N_{\mathrm{Enz}j} are almost constant and are the control parameters of the system. Here, we assume that \langle N_{\mathrm{Enz}j}\rangle is the same as N_{\mathrm{Enz}j}, and that the chemical potential \mu is a function of N_{\mathrm{Enz}j} and \{N_{i}\}. This assumption is justified when N and N_{\mathrm{Enz}j} are sufficiently large, i.e., at the thermodynamic limit. Then, the chemical potential \mu can be calculated from Eq. 7. Note that, in the limit N_{\mathrm{Enz}j}\rightarrow N, \mu approaches -\infty, and all molecules bind to the enzyme. The arguments so far can be summarized to give the binding probability p^{\mathrm{b}j}_{i}=\frac{\langle N_{\mathrm{Enz}j,i}\rangle}{N_{i}}=\frac{% \exp(\beta\mu)}{\exp\left(-\beta E^{\mathrm{b}j}_{i}\right)+\exp(\beta\mu)}, (8) where N_{\mathrm{Enz}j,i} is the number of enzyme j that bind to the a substrate in the \sigma=i state."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07923v1,Microscopic fluctuations in the spreading fronts of circular wetting liquid droplets,"We study numerically the kinetic roughening properties of the precursor fronts of nonvolatile liquid droplets spreading on solid substrates, for the case of circular droplets, more frequently addressed in experiments. To this end, we perform kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations of a lattice gas model whose kinetic roughening behavior has been recently assessed in a band geometry [J. M. Marcos et al., Phys. Rev. E 105, 054801 (2022)]. We compare the scaling behaviors of the spreading fronts obtained for the two geometries, in view of the occurrence of, for example, different universality subclasses for different growth geometries for the related important Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. For circular droplets we obtain that the average front position increases (sub-)diffusively as R\sim t^{\delta}, where \delta\lesssim 1/2 shows a stronger dependence on the conditions considered for temperature and substrate wettability than in band geometry. In spite of this, front fluctuations for circular droplets behave qualitatively similar to those seen for band geometries, with kinetic roughening exponent values which similarly depend on temperature T but become T-independent for sufficiently high T. Circular droplets also display intrinsic anomalous scaling with different values of the roughness exponent at short and large length scales, and fluctuations statistics which are close to the Tracy-Widom probability distribution function that applies in the corresponding KPZ universality subclass, now the one expected for interfaces with an overall circular symmetry.","Under complete wetting conditions, non-volatile fluids spreading on top of solid substrates Starov (2007); Reiter (2018) are known to develop so-called precursor fronts at the edge of ultrathin (molecular-depth) fluid layers Popescu et al. (2012), that preempt the spreading of the macroscopic droplets. Given such small length scales, the dynamics of these precursor fronts is strongly influenced by fluctuations. Their average position R(t) displays diffusive-like behavior with time t as R(t)\sim t^{\delta} with values of \delta definitely larger (i.e., faster spreading) than those characterizing the radius of the macroscopic droplet, namely, Tanner’s [e.g., \delta_{\rm Tanner}=1/10 in three dimensions (3D)] Tanner (1979) and related growth laws Bonn et al. (2009). Hence, the propagation of precursor fronts needs to be taken into account when probing fluid motion at nanoscales, as recently assessed e.g. in the imbibition of liquids in nanoporous photonic crystals Cencha et al. (2020) or in graphene nanochannels Chang et al. (2024). The fluctuations that become so relevant at the small scales characteristic of precursor films do indeed enhance their dynamics, as is also the case, for example, for the free surface of very thin viscous fluid layers Nesic et al. (2015); Zhao et al. (2022); but they also impact their correlations in space, inducing the scale-invariant behavior characteristic of kinetically rough surfaces and interfaces Barabási and Stanley (1995); Krug (1997); Abraham et al. (2002); Zhang et al. (2021). Thus, these fronts evolve in absence of typical space-time scales analogous to, for instance, an equilibrium system at the critical temperature of a continuous transition Täuber (2014), with the difference that for many kinetically rough surfaces there is no need to tune system parameters to precise critical values Barabási and Stanley (1995); Krug (1997). In general, kinetic roughening implies power-law behavior of system observables in time and space, characterized by critical exponents with values that can be classified into universality classes, akin to those of equilibrium critical phenomena. Actually, surface kinetic roughening has unraveled scaling behavior which generalizes the latter. For instance, the dynamic scaling ansatz satisfied by the classic models A or B of critical dynamics Täuber (2014) (termed Family-Viseck (FV) in the kinetic roughening context Barabási and Stanley (1995); Krug (1997)) generalizes into so-called anomalous scaling Sarma et al. (1994); Plischke et al. (1993); Schroeder et al. (1993); López et al. (1997); Ramasco et al. (2000), found in many models and experiments of rough interfaces Cuerno and Vázquez (2004); Cuerno et al. (2007). Also, and related with recent developments largely connected with the paramount Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class Kriecherbauer and Krug (2010); Takeuchi (2018), additional traits are proving to bear significance on the unambiguous identification of the universality class. Specifically, the probability distribution function (PDF) of rescaled front fluctuations around the mean, which happens to take on a universal form. For 1D interfaces in the KPZ class, and sufficiently far in time both, from the initial conditions and from saturation to steady state, it is given by some member of the Tracy-Widom (TW) family of PDFs Fortin and Clusel (2015), the precise one depending on boundary conditions. Thus, for interfaces in a band geometry and periodic boundary conditions (PBC) it is the TW PDF associated with the largest eigenvalue of random matrices in the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (TW-GOE), which is replaced by that related with the Gaussian unitary ensemble (TW-GUE) for interfaces with an overall circular geometry Kriecherbauer and Krug (2010); Takeuchi (2018). The latter has been recently found to account for the fluctuations of an astounding variety of rough interfaces in terms of physical nature and typical scales Makey et al. (2020). Back to fronts of spreading droplets, it is actually the circular geometry which is most frequently observed in experiments and atomistic [e.g., molecular dynamics (MD)] models Bonn et al. (2009); Popescu et al. (2012). However, the fluctuation (kinetic roughening) properties of spreading fronts have been addressed only in the band geometry thus far. Specifically, by resorting to kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations —with improved access over MD models to the large space-time scales required to unambiguously identify scaling behavior—, a lattice model has been studied in Ref. Marcos et al. (2022) with Hamiltonian Abraham et al. (2002); Marcos et al. (2022) \mathcal{H}=-J\sum_{\langle\mathitbf{r},\mathitbf{s}\rangle}n(\mathitbf{r},t)n% (\mathitbf{s},t)-A\sum_{\mathitbf{r}}\frac{n(\mathitbf{r},t)}{Z^{3}}, (1) where n(\mathitbf{r},t) is the occupation number of lattice sites by fluid, the first term describes the interactions between the liquid particles and their nearest neighbors, the second one accounts for the interaction with the substrate, characterized by a Hamaker constant A>0, and \mathitbf{r}=(x,y,Z) denotes position in a three-dimensional (3D) cubic lattice. This model was first introduced to describe spreading of liquid droplets by Lukkarinen et al. Lukkarinen et al. (1995), and the fluctuation properties of the fronts of the precursor and supernatant films that ensue (at Z=1 and 2, respectively) have since been studied in the band geometry Abraham et al. (2002); Harel and Taitelbaum (2018, 2021); Marcos et al. (2022), where PBC are applied along one of the two substrate directions and the macroscopic droplet is a reservoir of particles placed on a segment along the perpendicular direction. The main conclusions are Marcos et al. (2022) that: (i) kinetic roughening properties of both, supernatant and precursor films are the same, with \delta\approx 0.5 basically for all (A,T) parameter choices; (ii) the fronts display intrinsics anomalous scaling with critical exponent values which depend more strongly on T than on A, becoming T-independent for sufficiently high temperatures; and (iii) the fluctuation PDF is the TW-GOE, as for the 1D KPZ equation on a band geometry with PBC. This last result and the approximate global exponent values agreed with similar results for a continuum model put forward for high T conditions Abraham et al. (2002); Marcos et al. (2022) which, notably, displays a KPZ nonlinearity. However, the coupling of such a term is proportional to the front speed V(t)\sim t^{\delta-1}, hence it does not control the values of the critical exponents at long times while (quite remarkably) simultaneously inducing TW fluctuation statistics. In this paper we study numerically the kinetic roughening properties of the fronts of fluid circular droplets spreading on solid substrates, as described by the lattice gas with Hamiltonian given by Eq. (1). At this, our goal is to provide data which replicate more closely typical experimental setups in this context Bonn et al. (2009); Popescu et al. (2012) and potentially present analogous complexities and challenges to ours in terms of data analysis. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, there are very few, if any, reports in the literature on intrinsic anomalous scaling for interfaces with a circular geometry. Additionally, through comparison with the results of Ref. Marcos et al. (2022), here we address the dependence of scaling behavior with system geometry that has been naturally introduced recently in kinetic roughening by the KPZ universality class Kriecherbauer and Krug (2010); Takeuchi (2018), which happens to be directly relevant to our system in band geometry. This paper is organized as follows. After this introduction, Sec. II contains a description of our numerical simulation method for the lattice gas model defined by Eq. (1), including the definition of the various observables measured. Our numerical results are then reported, together with a discussion, in Sec. III. A summary of our results, together with our conclusions, appears in Sec. IV. Finally, further additional simulation details, tables, and results are provided in Appendix A."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07904v1,Temperature-driven flows in nanochannels: Theory and Simulations,"The motion of a fluid induced by thermal gradients in the absence of driving forces is known as thermo-osmosis. The physical explanation of this phenomenon stems from the emergence of gradients in the tangential pressure due to the presence of a confining surface. The microscopic origin of the effect was recently elucidated in the framework of linear response theory. Here, by use of conservation laws, we provide an explicit solution of the equations governing the fluid flow at stationarity in slab geometry, expressing the thermo-osmotic coefficient as the integrated mass current-heat current correlation function (which vanishes in the bulk). A very simple expression for the pressure gradient in terms of equilibrium properties is also derived. To test the theoretical predictions in a controlled setting, we performed extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in two dimensions. Few simple models of wall-particle interactions are examined and the resulting pressure drop and velocity profile are compared with the theoretical predictions both in the liquid and in the gas regime.","Macroscopic fluid motion is always driven by pressure gradients or by external forces and is accurately described by continuum approaches, like the Navier-Stokes equation [1]. However, in sub-micron systems interfacial effects become relevant: Additional transport mechanisms are possible [2] and the validity of the Navier-Stokes equations becomes questionable [3]. A remarkable example is provided by thermo-osmosis, a surface-induced phenomenon, where the external “field” driving the fluid flow is a temperature gradient. The confinement of the fluid is essential for the onset of the flow. Indeed, the steady state of a bulk fluid in a thermal gradient is characterized by the onset of local equilibrium: All the macroscopic variables can be locally defined and the usual thermodynamic relations maintain their validity at each point. The temperature gradient thus leads to a spatial dependence of the chemical potential and of the particle density, keeping the bulk pressure uniform and preserving mechanical equilibrium. Thus, the fluid remains at rest while a stationary heat flux appears [1, 4]. Only when a confining surface not orthogonal to the thermal gradient, say a wall, is present, the fluid starts moving, giving rise to thermo-osmosis. Thermo-osmotic flows are expected to be minute on a macroscopic scale because the bulk fluid is set into motion due to an interfacial effect. Thus, the investigation of thermo-osmosis may appear to be justified mainly because it represents one of the simplest nonequilibrium systems we can envisage, serving as a test bed for any out-of-equilibrium theory of transport processes. However, the mass transport arising from any surface phenomenon becomes relevant every time one of the system’s dimensions becomes comparable to the correlation length or to the mean free path of the fluid [5]. This situation occurs in several systems of technological and biological interest. Moreover, industrial miniaturization has made available a large variety of nanochannels, paving the way for the development of nanofluidics [6] and many natural systems, such as membranes and gels, are characterized by porous networks with submicrometer diameters, where thermo-osmosis may play an important role [7, 8]. In particular, in the field of low carbon energy conversion, researchers are investigating nanoporous membranes to transform waste heat into mechanical energy [9, 10], and it is expected that the phenomenon will play an important role in the behaviour of clay-rich materials [11, 12, 13, 14]. Furthermore, interest in thermo-osmosis is increasing with the possibility of applications as a mechanism for governing the motion of particles at the nanoscale [15, 16, 17, 18]. Thermo-osmosis in liquids was discovered more than a century ago [19, 20, 21] and has been interpreted by Derjaguin on the basis of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, identifying the driving force as the local enthalpy excess induced by the confining surface [22], while, in rarefied gases, kinetic theories have been used since the pioneering works by Maxwell and Reynolds [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. However, the microscopic origin of the effect is still under debate, and the interpretation of nonequilibrium numerical simulations is carried out in the framework of phenomenological approaches, where additional free parameters must be introduced to provide a faithful description of the data [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. Recently, interest in thermo-osmosis has been revived by molecular dynamics simulations aimed at a microscopic understanding of this effect [39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. Following these investigations, a first principle treatment of thermal forces by use of linear response theory was developed [44, 45]. Explicit equations for the thermo-osmotic mass current were obtained in slab geometry, where the fluid is confined by two identical parallel walls, and a thermal gradient is imposed parallel to the surfaces. In the models studied in this work the walls are passive, that is they just act as an external force on the fluid molecules, orthogonal to the surface, thereby conserving the particle momentum parallel to the surface in a scattering process. In this paper, using the continuity equations, we provide a general analytical solution of the equations developed in Refs. [44, 45], expressing the mass flow and the pressure drop induced by a thermal gradient in terms of the mass current-heat current correlation function without phenomenological fitting parameters. Our approach is valid at all density regimes, from gases to liquids. Taking advantage of this solution, we confirm the interpretation of thermo-osmosis as an effect of the variation of the local enthalpy density induced by the presence of the wall, making contact with previous phenomenological approaches [2], while providing the unique expression of the excess enthalpy, which, as stressed in Refs. [39, 46], is not a well-defined quantity. In order to test the theoretical predictions in a controlled environment, we present the results of extensive molecular dynamics simulations for a simple model of a fluid with one component and a few wall-particle interactions in two dimensions. Finally, we briefly consider the case of confining surfaces which violate the momentum conservation during the wall-molecule scattering, where the same microscopic theory allows to derive an analytical form of the velocity profile at low density. Numerical and analytical results are compared, validating the theoretical interpretation in different regimes: From rarefied gases to dense liquids. The paper is organized as follows. The microscopic equations governing the fluid dynamics [44, 45] are summarized in Section II, where the explicit solution of the equations is also derived. In Section III the general solution previously found is specialized to different wall-particle interactions, while in Section IV we discuss the details of the equilibrium (MD) and nonequilibrium (NEMD) molecular dynamics simulations. The results are presented in Section V, where particular attention has been devoted to the comparison between the outcomes of the theory and of the molecular dynamic simulations at several densities and temperatures, and for different wall-fluid potentials. Section VI contains some final remark."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07824v1,Entropy production along a deterministic motion,We propose a stochastic dynamics to be associated to a deterministic motion defined by a set of first order differential equation. The transitions that defined the stochastic dynamics are unidirectional and the rates are equal to the absolute value of the velocity vector field associate to the deterministic motion. From the stochastic dynamics we determine the entropy production and the entropy flux. This last quantity is found to be the negative of the divergence of the velocity vector field. In the case of a Hamiltonian dynamics it vanishes identically.,"The calculation of the entropy S of a system by the Gibbs formula S=-\int P(x)\ln P(x)dx, (1) where P(x) is the probability density distribution of the states x of the system, requires a description of the system by a probabilistic approach. A probabilistic approach can be accomplished, for instance, by considering that the dynamic variables that characterize the state of the system are stochastic variables that obey a stochastic equation of motion. Examples of this type of equation are the master equation and the Fokker-Planck equation for continuous space of states kampen1981 ; tome2015L ; tome2015 . Let us consider a deterministic motion defined on a vector space x by the equation of motion \frac{dx_{i}}{dt}=f_{i}(x), (2) where f_{i} are the components of a vector field f(x) that depends on x, which we call the velocity vector field. If a system is described by the deterministic dynamics given by (2) and not by a stochastic dynamics, the question arises as to how to determine entropy by the Gibbs formula. An answer to the question just raised is to assign a probability distribution P_{0}(x) at time t=0 and determine P(x,t) for t>0 through (2). If x=h(t;x^{\prime}) is the solution of (2) with the initial condition x equal to x^{\prime} at t=0, then P(x,t)dx=P_{0}(x^{\prime})dx^{\prime}. From this equality, it is straightforward to derive the equation \frac{\partial P}{\partial t}=-\sum_{i}\frac{\partial f_{i}P}{\partial x_{i}} (3) by determining the Jacobian of the transformation defined by x^{\prime}\to x=h(t;x^{\prime}) where t is understood as a parameter. Equation (3) was derived by Gerlich gerlich1973 who called it the generalized Liouville equation. Solving this equation for P, we determine the entropy by the Gibbs formula. Its time derivative follows from equation (3) and is \frac{dS}{dt}=\sum_{i}\langle\frac{\partial f_{i}(x)}{\partial x_{i}}\rangle, (4) and expression derived by Dobbertin dobbertin1976 and by Andrey andrey1985 . The right-hand side of (4) is the average of the divergence of the velocity vector field f. We may also determine from the equation (3) the time evolution of the average s_{i}=\langle x_{i}\rangle which is given by \frac{ds_{i}}{dt}=\langle f_{i}(x)\rangle. (5) Let us suppose that the initial probability distribution is very sharp at a certain point of the state space, that is, the initial state is a delta function. From equation (3) it follows that it remains forever sharp around the average s=\langle x\rangle, and \langle f_{i}(x)\rangle becomes f_{i}(s), and the equation (5) reduces to \frac{ds_{i}}{dt}=f_{i}(s), (6) which is no other than equation (2), if we replace s by x. The sharpness of P turns the equation (4) into the equation \frac{dS}{dt}=\sum_{i}\frac{\partial f_{i}(s)}{\partial s_{i}} (7) We wish to show here that it is possible to set up another stochastic dynamics that also fulfills the condition (6), and can thus be associated to the set of deterministic equations (2). The basic assumption that we adopt is to interpret |f_{i}(x)|=w_{i} as the rate of the transition x_{i}\to x_{i}+\varepsilon, where \varepsilon is a small parameter that we set to zero after we have calculated the quantities of interest. The equation that we derive is \frac{\partial P}{\partial t}=-\sum_{i}\frac{\partial f_{i}P}{\partial x_{i}}+% \frac{\varepsilon}{2}\sum_{i}\frac{\partial^{2}w_{i}P}{\partial x_{i}^{2}}, (8) which differs from equation (3) by the additional term proportional to \varepsilon. For small enough \varepsilon, we reach (6), as desired, but dS/dt is no longer given by (7) and is given by \frac{dS}{dt}=\sum_{i}\frac{\partial f_{i}(s)}{\partial s_{i}}+\frac{1}{2}\sum% _{i}(\chi^{-1})_{ii}w_{i}, (9) where \chi is the solution of \frac{d\chi_{ij}}{dt}=\sum_{k}(f_{ik}\chi_{kj}+f_{jk}\chi_{ki})+\delta_{ij}w_{% i}. (10) The negative of the first term in the right-hand side of (9) is a measure of the contraction of the volume of the state space, and was suggested to be the rate of entropy production gallavotti1995 ; ruelle1996 ; ruelle1997 . Here, however we interpret it as the entropy flux, \Psi=-\sum_{i}\frac{\partial f_{i}(s)}{\partial s_{i}}, (11) that is, the flux of entropy from the system to the outside. The second term in the right-hand side of (9) is nonnegative and we interpret it as the rate of entropy production, \Pi=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}(\chi^{-1})_{ii}w_{i}, (12) which allows to write \frac{dS}{dt}=\Pi-\Psi. (13) that is, the time variation of the entropy is equal to the rate of entropy production minus the flux of entropy to the outside. The stochastic dynamics that we consider here consists of transitions that are unidirectional, also called absolute irreversible transitions, and its entropy production has been the subject of investigation in recent years ohkubo2009 ; murashita2014 ; zeraati2012 ; benavraham2011 ; busiello2020 ; rahav2014 ; saha2016 ; pal2017 ; pal2021 ; pal2021a ; manzano2024 . The entropy production associated to unidirectional transitions cannot be calculated by the formula introduced by Schnakenberg schnakenberg1976 because this formula requires the reverse transition. The expression that we employ here for the entropy production, which leads us to the formula (12), is a continuous version of a formula that we have proposed for unidirectional transitions in discrete space of states tome2024 ."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07438v1,A direct derivation of law of entropy non-decrease from Kelvin principle,"We derive the law of entropy non-decrease directly from Kelvin principle for simple and compound systems without using Clausius inequality. A key of the derivation is a formulation of entropy utilizing a Carnot machine, which is equivalent to Clausius entropy based on heat and Gyftopoulos-Beretta entropy based on work.","How information of irreversibility is encoded into entropy as a state quantity? This would be one of the most difficult points for those who learn thermodynamics first to grasp. This is also true for physicists today and the famous paper by Lieb and Yngvason was aimed to clarify the nature of entropy in terms of adiabatic accessibility in their axiomic approach to thermodynamics [1, 2], where neither statistical mechanics nor heat engines are used [2] (see also Ref. [3]). Here, let us consider a more conventional approach to thermodynamics. Consider a thermally isolated system in an equilibrium state A_{1}. After an arbitrary adiabatic process that changes the system’s state to another equilibrium state A_{2}, the system’s entropy S never decreases before and after the change: \displaystyle S_{2}-S_{1}\geq 0, (1) which is the principle of entropy non-decrease, and the equality applies to reversible adiabatic processes. Here, the entropies of the system’s states A_{1} and A_{2} are measured by \displaystyle S_{1}=S_{0}+\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\delta Q}{T_{R}},\ \ S_{2}=S_{0}+% \int_{0}^{2}\frac{\delta Q}{T_{R}}, (2) where S_{0} is the entropy at a reference state A_{0}, \delta Q denotes heat supplied to the system and T_{R} denotes the temperature of a heat reservoir. During the process from A_{0} to A_{1}, the heat reservoir that contacts the system and its temperature T_{R} may continuously change. Usually, in standard textbooks on thermodynamics such as Ref. [4], after introducing Carnot cycle and Carnot efficiency as the maximum efficiency of heat engines, Eq. (1) is derived by using Clausius inequality for a cyclic process: \displaystyle\oint\frac{\delta Q}{T_{R}}\leq 0. (3) The existence of entropy as a state quantity (2) is shown by using the equality condition of Clausius inequality. Then, by applying Clausius inequality Eq. (3) to a cyclic process A_{1}\to A_{2}\xrightarrow[\rm rev]{}A_{1}, where “rev” implies that the process is reversible, we have \displaystyle S_{2}-S_{1}-\int_{1}^{2}\frac{\delta Q}{T_{R}}\geq 0. (4) If the process A_{1}\to A_{2} is an adiabatic process, we may put \delta Q=0 into the above equality and derive Eq. (1). The sketch of the above derivation of the law of entropy non-decrease is based on Clausius inequality Eq. (3). The Clausius inequality is derived from Kelvin principle, which manifests one expression of the second law of thermodynamics: We cannot extract a positive work from a single heat reservoir at a fixed temperature without leaving any other changes. For a cyclic process, it can be expressed as \displaystyle W_{\rm cyc}\leq 0, (5) where W_{\rm cyc} denotes the work extracted from the cycle starting from an equilibrium state, and the equality applies to a reversible cycle. However, deriving Clausius inequality from Kelvin principle is not so easy as the derivation relies on a complicated thermodynamic process involving multiple heat reservoirs at different temperatures and multiple Carnot heat engines [4]. In this paper, we derive the law of entropy non-decrease Eq. (1) directly from Kelvin principle Eq. (5) without using Clausius inequality Eq. (3); we will assume only a single heat reservoir in our derivation, which apparently makes it possible to apply the Kelvin principle."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07344v1,"Wetting, Algebraic Curves and Conformal Invariance","Recent studies of wetting in a two-component square-gradient model of interfaces in a fluid mixture, showing three-phase bulk coexistence, have revealed some highly surprising features. Numerical results show that the density profile paths, which form a tricuspid shape in the density plane, have curious geometric properties, while conjectures for the analytical form of the surface tensions imply that nonwetting may persist up to the critical end points, contrary to the usual expectation of critical point wetting. Here, we solve the model exactly and show that the profile paths are conformally invariant quartic algebraic curves that change genus at the wetting transition. Being harmonic, the profile paths can be represented by an analytic function in the complex plane which then conformally maps the paths onto straight lines. Using this, we derive the conjectured form of the surface tensions and explain the geometrical properties of the tricuspid and its relation to the Neumann triangle for the contact angles. The exact solution confirms that critical point wetting is absent in this square-gradient model.","References Sullivan and Telo da Gama (1986) D. E. Sullivan and M. M.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08012v1,Non-equilibrium phase transitions in hybrid Voronoi models of cell colonies,"Eukaryotic cells are characterized by a stiff nucleus whose effect in modeling the collective behavior of cell aggregates is usually underestimated. However, increasing experimental evidence links nuclear modifications with phenotypic transition, like the one between epithelial and mesenchymal states. In this work, we explore the effect of short-range repulsive forces in the non-equilibrium dynamics of the self-propelled Voronoi model. We show that the competition between steric repulsions (representing nuclear/cellular compressibility) and Vertex interactions (mimicking cell-cell adhesion/interaction and cytoskeleton organization) generate a variety of non-equilibrium phase transitions from Motility-Induced Phase Separation to mesenchymal-like phases up to disordered confluent configurations. Notably, we found that tuning the nucleus’s effective size/compressibility provides an additional way to cross the boundary between the different possible phases in line with experimental observations.","Biological tissues are collections of cells at high packing fractions. Each cell is a complex non-equilibrium machine; on top of that, cells are also deformable objects whose shape can fluctuate because of the interaction with the surrounding environment. Various models incorporate some of those minimal ingredients for capturing the collective behavior of cells in confluent monolayers alert2020physical ; trepat2018mesoscale ; camley2017physical ; barton2017active . Depending on the biological situation of interest, different coarse-graining descriptions of cells might be very effective. Those descriptions range from particle-based models Smeets16 ; henkes2020dense ; giavazzi2017giant ; Paoluzzi2022 ; paoluzzi2024flocking , phase field models PhysRevLett.105.108104 ; PhysRevE.104.054410 ; chiang2024intercellular ; PhysRevE.98.042402 ; PhysRevLett.129.148101 ; PhysRevLett.125.038003 ; PhysRevLett.122.048004 , Potts models PhysRevLett.69.2013 ; nandi21 ; PhysRevLett.132.248401 ; PhysRevE.47.2128 , and Voronoi/Vertex models nagai2001dynamic ; bi2015density ; Bi2016 ; giavazzi2018flocking ; merkel2018geometrically ; merkel2019minimal ; erdemci2021effect ; PhysRevResearch.2.043026 ; yang2017correlating ; farhadifar2007influence . This is important for understanding biological processes during morphogenesis Miotto2023 or cancer invasion sunyer2016collective ; Friedl17 ; Miotto2021 . In its complexity, a single cell is characterized by different structures that are hierarchically arranged: in the spirit of coarse-graining only the leading degrees of freedom are necessary for describing cell collectives, most of the attempts in modeling the single cell neglect such a complexity. For instance, within phase fields and Voronoi-like models, cell shape fluctuations can be included as a leading ingredient necessary for modeling the cell aggregate more realistically. Such fluctuations have been found to act as a driving force for jamming/unjamming transition Park15 ; Arora2024 . In particular, elongated cells characterized by a high shape factor, i.e., the ratio between the typical cell perimeter divided by the square root of the cell area, tend to aggregate into a liquid phase where cells continuously rearrange bi2015density . Highly symmetric cells, characterized by a smaller shape factor, undergo a rigidity transition similar to the jamming phase or, in some cases, a glass-like transition Bi2016 ; Sadhukhan2024 . Many experimental studies provide evidence for the importance of non-equilibrium glass-like or jamming-like transition in confluent monolayers Park15 ; Malinverno17 ; kang2021novel ; Arora2024 . Indeed, development, wound repair, and cancer metastasis are fundamental biological processes in which epithelial cells, typically non-migratory, can become highly mobile and rearrange over time and length scales much larger than the typical time and length scales of the single cell. From a biological point of view, the transition from a sedentary to a migratory state in epithelial layers was thought to rely on EMT or partial EMT (pEMT) in many contexts. During EMT/pEMT, cells lose their apicobasal polarity and epithelial markers, while acquiring front-to-back polarity and mesenchymal markers, allowing them to detach from neighboring cells and the surrounding matrix, adopting a migratory behavior. The unjamming transition has been identified as a distinct migratory mechanism where collective epithelial migration may take place without EMT Mitchel2020 . While cells can change their shape, allowing for adapting to growth in different conditions and moving across barriers Saito2024 , the presence of a stiff nucleus poses limits to their degree of deformability. In this framework, arises the question of what the effect of such stiff nucleus on cell collective behavior is (see for instance the reviews CaleroCuenca2018 ; Boutillon2024 ). Registering migration speed and cell/nucleus shapes, Wolf et al. Wolf2013 , identified deformability of the nucleus as one of the first-order rate-limiting physicochemical determinants of cell migration. Grosser et al. Grosser2021 compared spheroids of cancerous and noncancerous cell lines via bulk experiments and/or single live-cell tracking, finding that cancerous cells populations are fluidized by active cells moving through the tissue with the degree of tissue fluidity correlating with elongated cell and nucleus shapes. They speculate that individual cell and nucleus shape may serve as a marker for metastatic potential. Despite increasing evidence of the mechanical importance of the cell nucleus, models explicitly accounting for its effect are still rare Chojowski2024 . What is the effect of combining a stiff nucleus with a deformable shape in collective cell behaviors remains an open question. Here, we introduce a hybrid Voronoi model that takes into account short-range excluded volume forces mimicking the presence of the stiff cell nucleus. Our hybrid Voronoi model allows us to describe cells in both mesenchymal and epithelial phases. Indeed, by varying the relative strength between Vertex and excluded volume forces we interpolate from a pure particle-based model to a confluent model. Note that our approach counts a few control parameters for controlling different ingredients as typical shape elongation, cell motility, and nuclei stiffness. In contrast, other approaches require the fine-tuning of many parameters and is quite expensive from the numerical point of view alert2020physical . In the following, after introducing the model, we show that the system undergoes several non-equilibrium phase transitions from the so-called Motility-Induced Phase Separation (MIPS) Tailleur08 , to standard active liquid, to Voronoi (confluent) liquid, and disordered solid by tuning the strength of the Vertex interaction. Next, we change the packing fraction of the system showing that this brings a reach phase diagram where cells can arrange in Gas-like or Phase-separates without attractive forces at low packing fraction (as in the case of Mesenchymal cells). By increasing the strength of Voronoi the system becomes confluent. However, the structural property of the monolayer changes dramatically with the pacing fraction.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07829v1,NVU view on energy polydisperse Lennard-Jones systems,"Lennard-Jones (LJ) systems exhibit strikingly invariant structure and dynamics when energy polydispersity is introduced [Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 2837 (2023)]. For instance, at a given state point the radial distribution function and the mean-square displacement as a function of time are virtually unaffected by energy polydispersity, which is in contrast to what happens when size polydispersity is introduced. We here argue – and validate by simulations of up to 30% polydispersity – that this invariance reflects an approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy hypersurface. NVU dynamics is defined as geodesic motion at constant potential energy; because this dynamics is equivalent to Newtonian dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy hypersurface implies virtually the same structure and dynamics of energy polydisperse LJ systems as for the single-component version. In contrast, the constant-potential-energy hypersurface is shown to be significantly affected by the introduction of size polydispersity.","The term polydispersity is typically used for models characterized by a continuous distribution of parameters in the interaction potentials. This is relevant for describing the jamming of granular media, e.g., sand, which can be modeled by introducing a distribution of particle sizes Dickinson (1978); Salacuse and Stell (1982); Frenkel et al. (1986); Evans (1999); Weeks et al. (2000); Fasolo and Sollich (2003); Abraham et al. (2008); Ballesta et al. (2008); Nguyen et al. (2014); Ingebrigtsen and Tanaka (2015). Polydispersity is also relevant in the modeling of glass-forming liquids by allowing for fast equilibration via swap dynamics Ninarello et al. (2017). Size polydispersity is typically introduced via a distribution of the size parameter of the pair potential. If the “size” of particle i is \sigma_{i}, the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rule states that the interaction with particle j involves the length parameter (\sigma_{i}+\sigma_{j})/2 Allen and Tildesley (1987). While size polydispersity is most commonly studied Dickinson (1978); Salacuse and Stell (1982); Gualtieri et al. (1982); Kofke and Glandt (1986); Evans (1999); Auer and Frenkel (2001); Fasolo and Sollich (2003); Wilding and Sollich (2005); Abraham et al. (2008); Ballesta et al. (2008); Jacobs and Frenkel (2013); Sarkar et al. (2013); Nguyen et al. (2014), a few publications have investigated the effects of energy polydispersity Shagolsem and Rabin (2016a); Ingebrigtsen and Tanaka (2016); Shagolsem and Rabin (2016b); Ingebrigtsen and Dyre (2023). Using the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rule for energies Allen and Tildesley (1987), Refs. Shagolsem and Rabin, 2016a and Shagolsem and Rabin, 2016b studied energy-polydisperse Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids in 2d and found only very small differences at a given thermodynamic state point between the average properties of polydisperse systems and those of the single-component LJ fluid with the same average interaction energy. This was recently confirmed in a study of 3d energy-polydisperse LJ mixtures, demonstrating virtually invariant structure and dynamics when varying the degree of polydispersity Ingebrigtsen and Dyre (2023). Energy-polydispersity invariance is robust; thus Ref. Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, 2023 demonstrated that, except for the case of extreme energy polydispersity, the invariance property is maintained when varying the state point, the mixing rule, the energy probability distribution, or the pair potential. The question we address in this paper is: Why does the introduction of energy polydispersity not affect the structure and dynamics to any significant degree? Before proceeding we note that the above-mentioned findings are consistent with the prediction of the so-called conformal solution theory Gubbins (2013) based on the idea that a mixture may be represented by a single-component liquid Mansoori (1993); Shell et al. (2006). This does not work well for size polydispersity, however Pond et al. (2011). According to the van der Waals mixing rule of conformal solution theory, the energy parameter of the one-component fluid representing the mixture is the average of the ij particle interaction energies \langle\varepsilon_{ij}\rangle. For the box distribution of particle energies \varepsilon_{i} studied in Ref. Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, 2023 this results in an average close to that obtained from the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rule (and identical if one uses a linear energy-mixing rule, which also leads to invariant physics Ingebrigtsen and Dyre (2023)). In order to throw light on the energy-polydispersity invariance of structure and dynamics this paper adopts an NVU point of view. NVU dynamics replaces Newton’s second law by Newton’s first law – the law of inertia – by considering geodesic motion on the constant-potential-energy hypersurface in 3N dimensions where N is the number of particles Ingebrigtsen et al. (2011a, b). In the thermodynamic limit (N\to\infty) this gives rise to a time evolution that result in the same structure and dynamics as standard Newtonian dynamics Ingebrigtsen et al. (2011a, b). In fact, when NVU dynamics is discretized for numerical implementation, this leads to the leap-frog algorithm with a varying time step the relative fluctuations of which go to zero for N\to\infty Ingebrigtsen et al. (2011b). The conjecture investigated in this paper is that energy-polydisperse LJ mixtures have approximately the same constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces as those of the single-component LJ system. If validated, this would explain the observed invariance of structure and dynamics upon the introduction of energy polydispersity. Figure 1: Average structure and dynamics of LJ systems of different energy polydispersity at the state point \left(\rho,T\right)=(0.85,0.70), which is close to the triple point of the single-component LJ system. (a) shows the average radial distribution function (RDF), g(r), for polydispersities up to 40%. (b) shows the average incoherent intermediate scattering function, F_{s}(q,t), where the solid lines represent data for the wave vector of the first peak of the static structure factor of the monodisperse system (q=7.2) while the dashed lines represent data for the wave vector corresponding to the box length (q=0.19). For both structure and dynamics we find results that are virtually independent of the degree of polydispersity. These findings confirm those of Ref. Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, 2023."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07771v1,Efficiency of energy-consuming random walkers: Variability in energy helps,"Energy considerations can significantly affect the behavior of a population of energy-consuming agents with limited energy budgets, for instance, in the movement process of people in a city. We consider a population of interacting agents with an initial energy budget walking on a graph according to an exploration and return (to home) strategy that is based on the current energy of the person. Each move reduces the available energy depending on the flow of movements and the strength of interactions, and the movement ends when an agent returns home with a negative energy. We observe that a uniform distribution of initial energy budgets results in a larger number of visited sites per consumed energy (efficiency) compared to case that all agents have the same initial energy if return to home is relevant from the beginning of the process. The uniform energy distribution also reduces the amount of uncertainties in the total travel times (entropy production) which is more pronounced when the strength of interactions and exploration play the relevant role in the movement process. That is variability in the energies can help to increase the efficiency and reduce the entropy production specially in presence of strong interactions.","Human everyday activities (e.g., commuting between home and workplace, or shopping) are specific kinds of recurrent diffusion process in which agents travel from one place to another and then return to their starting point after following a trajectory with a number of steps of various lengths Gonzalez ; Scafetta2011 ; Barbosa . An exploration and return (ER) strategy is usually used to model such movements in social and ecological systems song-2010 ; Majumdar2010 ; Benichou2011 ; Pappalardo ; wang2022 . This basic principle has been generalized in many studies to better describe for instance the social, economical, and geometrical aspects of these systems gonzalez-2015 ; vazifeh2021 . In the past few years, the emergence of location tracking devices (e.g., GPS navigator and smart phones), and location-based services (e.g., Foursquare, Yelp checkin and Google places) provides good opportunities to study human mobility patterns at very different spatial and temporal scales gallotti-2012 ; barthelemy-2019 ; bettencourt-2021 ; batty-2021 ; gonzalez-2022 : from mobility of individuals inside a city to mobility and transportation in an entire country Chowel ; Brockmann ; Vespignani ; gonzalez-2023 .

Efficiency of structure and dynamical processes is essential to maintain a sustainable system like a city horner-2002 ; newman-2006 ; dong-2016 ; latora-2018 ; indaco-2019 ; barthelemy-2022 . However, the majority of research on this subject have focused on simulating the statistical characteristics of human mobility, such as displacement and gyration radius. We know that energy, used by human body or vehicle, plays a key role in transportation and other forms of social activities Kolbl ; boyer-2009 ; Wang22 . It has been observed that the average travel times for different transportation modes (e.g. walking, cycling, bus, or car travel) are inversely proportional to the (physiological) energy consumption rates measured for the respective physical activities Kolbl . Interestingly, when daily travel-time distributions of different transport modes are appropriately scaled, they turn out to have a universal functional relationship Kolbl ; kolbl-2021 . In this work we are going to investigate the effects of energy consumption and limited energy budgets on a measure of efficiency and entropy production in a movement process which is based on the ER strategy. We see how constraints on energy budgets can influence the movements of these interacting and energy consuming agents, for instance resulting in a subdiffusion regime. In particular, we are interested in the efficiency of such a movement process and its relation to a measure of entropy or uncertainty production in such a process indaco-2020 ; indaco-2021 . We study the number of distinct locations visited by a person per the consumed energy. A greater number of demands are expected to be fulfilled during an urban exploration when a larger number of distinct sites are visited. A reasonable definition of efficiency should also take into account the energy consumed by the agent in this process. Additionally, we are interested in the uncertainty in the travel times which is generated by interactions between the agents. Smaller uncertainties in the travel times are expected to result in a better planning and therefore smaller dissipation. The paper is organized as follows. We start in Sec. II.1 with a definition of the model and the main parameters. In Sec. II.2 we study an effective one-dimensional model and write a master equation in the continuum limit which can easily be generalized to higher dimensions. A naive mean-field approximation to the equation is presented and the results are compared with the exact solutions of the master equation in one dimension. Section II.3 is devoted to the numerical simulations of the model in two dimensions. Concluding remarks are given in Sec. III."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07701v1,Generating and analyzing small-size datasets to explore physical observables in quantum Ising systems,"We propose a detailed analysis of datasets generated from simulations of two-dimensional quantum spin systems using the quantum Ising model at absolute zero temperature. Our focus is on examining how fundamental physical properties, energy, magnetization, and entanglement entropy, evolve under varying external transverse magnetic fields and system sizes. From the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP), we simulate systems with 4, 8, and 16 spins arranged in square lattices, generating extensive datasets with 5000 samples per magnetic field value. The Hamiltonian operator incorporates quantum mechanical effects such as superposition and tunneling, challenging classical interpretations of spin states. We compute extended Pauli operators and construct the Hamiltonian to include spin-spin interactions and transverse field terms. Our analysis reveals that as the system size increases, fluctuations in energy and entanglement entropy become more evident, indicating lifted sensitivity to external perturbations and suggesting the onset of quantum phase transitions. Spin-spin correlation functions demonstrate that interactions are predominantly local, but larger systems exhibit more complex and fluctuating correlations. These findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of quantum spin systems and lay the groundwork for future machine learning applications aimed at predicting physical quantities and identifying phase transitions from a quantum perspective.","Predicting phase transitions involves understanding complex systems in which small changes in external conditions can lead to abrupt transformations in the properties of the system. Challenges include dealing with non-linear dynamics, critical fluctuations, and the need for accurate datasets to detect these transitions [1]. The Ising model is an important tool in physics for studying phase transitions, particularly in ferromagnetism. It helps in being aware of how local interactions can lead to collective behavior, acting as an analogy for neurons in machine learning models where local rules determine the overall behavior [2]. The study of phase transitions faces a significant evolution as it moves into the quantum mechanics framework [3, 4]; particularly through the famous two-dimensional (2D) quantum Ising model [5]. This expansion into quantum mechanics introduces novel paradigms for understanding phase behavior, transitions, and critical phenomena, especially where traditional local order parameters are absent [6]. Furthermore, several other models are used to investigate phase transitions in both classical and quantum viewpoints. For example, the Potts model [7] is a generalization of the Ising model and can be used to study phase transitions in systems with more than two possible states per site. It is useful in areas such as magnetism and biology, where interactions can assume multiple discrete states. In the Heisenberg model [8], spins can be oriented in any direction in a three-dimensional space, unlike in the Ising model, where spins are restricted to two directions. This model is fundamental for understanding magnetism in materials where spin-spin interactions are more complex and not restricted to parallel or antiparallel alignments. The Hubbard model [9] studies electronic systems in networks of atoms or ions, where the competition between the kinetic energy of electrons and their interactions can lead to several physical phenomena such as interaction-induced insulation and superconductivity. The XY model [10] considers spins aligned in a plane, capable of freely rotating within it. Such model investigates the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition [11], which occurs through the decoupling of vortices and antivortices, a topological phase transition without a change in the symmetry of the order parameter. Finally, the percolation model [12] scrutinizes the formation of random clusters and their ability to form a large network that covers the entire system. It is applied to both material science problems and in studies of complex networks and epidemiology, focusing on the dynamics of connectivity. However, the center of attention of our work is on analyzing datasets generated by simulating quantum spin systems with different numbers of spins at zero temperature, examining their energy, magnetization, and entanglement entropy under varying external magnetic fields. This is justified since we aim to prepare the most suitable datasets for our future machine learning works by making predictions of physical quantities and identifying phase transitions from the viewpoint of quantum systems, analogously to what we previously done in the classical perspective [2]. To achieve this, the Hamiltonian operator is fundamental in quantum mechanics to illustrate how the states and interactions of a system’s particles dictate its energy [13]. Thus, the quantum Ising model is our first choice for analyzing phase transitions in the quantum realm. Its theoretical expansion within statistical physics summarizes ferromagnetic behaviors in magnetic particle systems under quantum effects [5]. Recognized for its multidimensional applicability, this model goes beyond classical constraints, making it indispensable for phase transition studies [14, 15, 16]. Represented by the Hamiltonian operator \hat{H}=-J\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle\in L}\hat{\sigma}_{i}^{z}\hat{\sigma}_{j}^{% z}-h\sum_{i\in L}\hat{\sigma}_{i}^{x}, (1) where J is the uniform coupling constant between spins, h is the uniform external transverse magnetic field, \hat{\sigma}_{i}^{x} and \hat{\sigma}_{i}^{z} are the Pauli matrices acting on site i, and the sum \langle i,j\rangle runs over nearest-neighbor pairs in the lattice L. As mentioned earlier, this system introduces quantum superpositions and tunneling effects, challenging classical parallel and antiparallel states through quantum mechanical rules. The inclusion of the Pauli matrix X, \hat{\sigma}_{i}^{x}, represents quantum state flips, further complicating the system’s dynamics at lower temperatures, where quantum phenomena are more evident [17, 18, 19]. Here, we employ quantum mechanical simulations using the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP) [20, 21] to generate our datasets. Our primary goal is to analyze the energy, magnetization, and entanglement entropy of these systems and to understand how these properties evolve and stabilize as the system size increases. These datasets provide perceptions into the stability and behavior of the quantum Ising model with different spin configurations. We fix the coupling coefficient J as 1.0 (in arbitrary energy units), and work with a range of external magnetic field strengths h from 1.0 to 5.0 (in the same energy units), at absolute zero temperature, i.e., considering exclusively quantum effects without thermal fluctuations. Each simulation runs for 5000 samples per value of the external magnetic field, ensuring a good exploration of the state space. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. I, we introduce the background and motivation for studying quantum phase transitions using the two-dimensional quantum Ising model. In Sec. II, we describe the data generation process, including the simulation of quantum spin systems with different numbers of spins and the methods used to compute energy, magnetization, and entanglement entropy. In Sec. III, we analyze the results, discussing how these physical quantities evolve with varying external magnetic fields and system sizes. Finally, Sec. IV concludes the manuscript, outlining our findings and offering potential directions for future research, particularly the application of machine learning algorithms to predict physical quantities and identify phase transitions from a quantum perspective."

We consider entanglement between a single interval and the union of remaining disjoint intervals, and compute 2-Rényi CCNR negativity for 2d massless compact boson. The expression for 2-Rényi CCNR negativity is given in terms of cross-ratios and Riemann period matrices of Riemann surfaces involved in the calculation. In general, the Riemann surfaces involved in the calculation of n-Rényi CCNR negativity do not possess a Z_{n} symmetry. We also evaluate the Reflected Rényi entropy related to the 2-Rényi CCNR negativity. This Reflected Rényi entropy is a universal quantity. We extend these calculations to the 2d massless Dirac fermions as well. Finally, the analytical results are checked against the numerical evaluations in the tight-binding model and are found to be in good agreement.","Entanglement has been a driving force behind some of the recent developments in many frontiers of physics. Specifically entanglement has provided key insights in Gravity Ryu:2006bv ; Nishioka:2009un ; Solodukhin:2011gn , Quantum computation Nielsen_Chuang_2010 , and Quantum many-body systems Amico:2007ag ; Osterloh:2002sym ; Vidal:2002rm ; Calabrese:2004eu . To study bipartite entanglement of a quantum system in pure states one often considers entanglement entropies, however, these measures fail to quantify entanglement in mixed states as they fail to distinguish between the classical and quantum correlations. Mutual Information fails to reliably detect entanglement as well since it suffers from similar issues. It is in general a hard problem to study entanglement for mixed states. One viable option is to consider separability criterion, in this regard PPT (Partial transpose) Peres:1996dw ; Horodecki:1996nc criterion has been often considered in quantum many-body systems. The computable cross norm (CCNR) Rudolph:2002qos ; Chen:2003slc is another such criterion considered recently in quantum many-body systems. In general, it is not known whether one criterion has an advantage over the other in detecting entanglement Rudolph:2005tpa . Entanglement has proven to be an indispensable tool in the study of critical systems Amico:2007ag , owing to its ability to detect the scaling of quantum correlations near the quantum phase transitions Holzhey:1994we ; Calabrese:2004eu ; Osterloh:2002sym ; Vidal:2002rm . This has led to extensive research investigating entanglement in 2d Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). Entanglement studies in CFTs have been made in the context of critical systems Calabrese:2004eu ; Calabrese:2009qy ; Fradkin:2006mb ; Cardy:2016fqc ; Alcaraz:2011tn ; Hsu:2008af ; Calabrese:2014yza ; Shapourian:2016cqu , non-equilibrium dynamics Calabrese:2005in ; Calabrese:2007mtj ; Cardy:2016fqc ; Wen:2015qwa ; Coser:2014gsa ; Hoogeveen:2014bqa , integrable models Cardy:2007mb ; Doyon:2008vu ; Castro-Alvaredo:2009yqb ; Bianchini:2015uea ; Blondeau-Fournier:2015yoa ; Castro-Alvaredo:2018dja ; Castro-Alvaredo:2008fni , and systems with boundaries or defects zhou2006entanglement ; Cornfeld:2017tkz ; Estienne:2023ekf ; Capizzi:2022xdt ; Capizzi:2022uni ; Gutperle:2017enx ; Ohmori:2014eia ; Rogerson:2022yim ; Capizzi:2022igy with great success. Recently there has been a lot of interest in studying symmetry resolved entanglement in CFTs Castro-Alvaredo:2024azg ; Goldstein:2017bua ; Cornfeld:2018wbg ; Xavier:2018kqb ; Murciano:2021djk ; Jones:2022tgp ; Murciano:2020vgh ; Foligno:2022ltu ; Capizzi:2021kys ; Horvath:2021fks ; Parez:2020vsp ; DiGiulio:2022jjd ; Kusuki:2023bsp ; Calabrese:2021wvi as well. Entanglement studies in CFTs involving disjoint interval settings have been particularly interesting. In this regard, mutual information was first considered in Furukawa:2008uk to study entanglement between two disjoint intervals. Since then many studies have been made in similar settings. Entanglement of the disjoints intervals with its complement has been investigated by studying the Rényi entropies in Calabrese:2009ez ; Calabrese:2010he ; Coser:2013qda ; Headrick:2012fk ; Coser:2015dvp ; Alba:2011fu ; Rajabpour:2011pt ; Ruggiero:2018hyl ; Ares:2022gjb ; Gaur:2023yru . To study entanglement between the disjoint intervals Rényi PPT negativities has been considered in Calabrese:2012ew ; Calabrese:2012nk ; Coser:2015eba ; DeNobili:2015dla ; Chen:2021nma ; Gaur:2022sjf . One interesting aspect of entanglement in such studies is that the entanglement spectrum is not just sensitive to the central charge of the CFT but becomes sensitive to the local operator content of the CFT as well. However, these studies in general suffer a problem that it is not known how to analytically continue these results in the Rényi index from integer values to real values to obtain entanglement entropy and negativity. This is because the calculation of Rényi entropies requires evaluating partition functions on Riemann surfaces, and the genus of these surfaces varies with the Rényi index. It is worth mentioning here that these Riemann surfaces carry a Z_{n} symmetry, where n is the Rényi index. It was recently shown in Yin:2022toc , that when Rényi CCNR negativity for two disjoint intervals is considered, the Riemann surface involved in the calculations is always a torus of genus one. Hence these results can be analytically continued in Rényi index to find CCNR-negativity. The symmetry resolution of CCNR negativity has also been studied in quantum-many body systems Berthiere:2023gkx ; Bruno:2023tez . The Rényi CCNR negativities have also been shown to be related to the Reflected entropies, first introduced in the context of holography Dutta:2019gen . This work aims to extend the study of Rényi CCNR negativities to multiple disjoint intervals. When multiple-disjoint intervals are considered, the genus of the Riemann surfaces involved in the calculations of Rényi CCNR negativities again becomes sensitive to the Rényi index, however, a new feature is that these Riemann surfaces in general do not have Z_{n} symmetry. It is therefore interesting to study the features of CCNR-negativities in these settings. In the present work, we consider entanglement between a single interval, denoted A, and the rest of the disjoint intervals denoted B_{i}, see Figure 1 and compute the 2-Rényi negativity. We hope to generalise this result to arbitrary integer values of the Rényi index in future work. We will focus our attention on the compact boson CFT for our study. The organisation of this work is as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the Rényi CCNR negativity and Reflected entropies. In Section 3, we review the replica trick and Twist fields used in the evaluation of the Rényi CCNR negativities. In section 4, we evaluate the 2-Rényi CCNR negativity, and the related Reflected entropy for compact boson and also extend these results to massless Dirac fermion. We also numerically check our results against the tight-binding model. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude the present work. We also have three appendices, containing necessary calculations, background material and details of the numerical model used in the present study. Figure 1: Multiple Disjoint Intervals. The interval A is (u_{1},v_{1}) and the intervals B_{i} are (u_{i-1},v_{i-1})"
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07388v1,"Firing Rate Models as Associative Memory: 
Excitatory-Inhibitory Balance for Robust Retrieval","Firing rate models are dynamical systems widely used in applied and theoretical neuroscience to describe local cortical dynamics in neuronal populations. By providing a macroscopic perspective of neuronal activity, these models are essential for investigating oscillatory phenomena, chaotic behavior, and associative memory processes. Despite their widespread use, the application of firing rate models to associative memory networks has received limited mathematical exploration, and most existing studies are focused on specific models. Conversely, well-established associative memory designs, such as Hopfield networks, lack key biologically-relevant features intrinsic to firing rate models, including positivity and interpretable synaptic matrices that reflect excitatory and inhibitory interactions. To address this gap, we propose a general framework that ensures the emergence of re-scaled memory patterns as stable equilibria in the firing rate dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the conditions under which the memories are locally and globally asymptotically stable, providing insights into constructing biologically-plausible and robust systems for associative memory retrieval.","The modelling of associative memory processes began in the early 1970’s and 1980’s with the mathematical formalization of Amari (Amari, 1972, 1977) and of Grossberg (Grossberg, 1983) and the elegant and explicit construction of Hopfield (Hopfield, 1982, 1984). The authors drew inspiration from the early successes of statistical physics in the description of glassy phenomena (Sherrington & Kirkpatrick, 1975; Mezard, Parisi & Virasoro, 1987), leveraging the average properties of simple interconnected units. The key idea was to define a network of neuron-like computational units, similar to those studied by McCulloch and Pitts (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943), and investigate memory retrieval as emergent processes. Within this context, the authors conceptualized associative memory networks as dynamical systems defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) having as stable equilibrium points the memory patterns to retrieve. The first key contribution was the definition of a Lyapunov function for the associative memory system that ensured global asymptotic convergence to the equilibria of the system. Thus, any initial condition for the system would lie in the basin of attraction of one of these equilibria, and the system trajectory will inevitably evolve towards it. The second key contribution was the explicit definition of the set of memory vectors as binary patterns taking values in \{-1,+1\}, analogously to ferromagnets in spin glasses. The binary representation of the memory vectors allowed for the explicit design of a synaptic matrix, that ensured the system’s equilibria precisely matched the intended memories. The effective combination of the two key contributions has catalyzed a wealth of subsequent research, both analytical and numerical, focusing on the fundamental properties of associative memory systems. Notably, many authors have studied the storage capacity (Amit, Gutfreund & Sompolinsky, 1987a, b; McEliece et al., 1987; Petritis, 1995) of associative memory systems, that is the maximum number of memories that can be stored in the synaptic matrix without compromising their stability. Subsequent works (Tsodyks & Feigel’man, 1988; Treves, 1990; Amit & Tsodyks, 1991) have extended beyond the binary spin structure proposed by Hopfield, enabling binary positive activations \{0,1\} and low levels of neural activity. These works retain the dynamic framework initially proposed by Grossberg and Hopfield, hereafter referred to as voltage equations, but apply non-negative activation functions to yield neuron firing rates. While positive activations allow interpreting synaptic matrix components as excitatory or inhibitory, the relationship between voltages and firing rates remains arbitrary and highly dependent on network parameters. This limitation has led associative memory researchers to explore models that directly connect empirically measurable quantities, like firing rates, with one another. Parallel to the advancements in the modeling of associative memory networks, detailed biophysical models of cortical circuits have received an increasing amount of attention due to their capability of generating synthetic data of EEG recordings, thus providing insight to experimentalists on the roots of the measured quantities. Beginning with the groundbreaking description of the neuron biochemical response by Hodgkin and Huxley (Hodgkin & Huxley, 1952), the characterization of neuronal properties by means of dynamical systems has become ever more pervasive. In the beginning, the mathematical characterization of neurons and neural processes focused on the extensive treatment of the microscopic properties, such as gating and diffusion of ions, and branched into the well known FitzHugh-Nagumo (FitzHugh, 1961) and Morris-Lecar (Morris & Lecar, 1981) models. However, the mathematical complexity of these models, combined with the computational limitations, constrained researchers to small-scale studies involving only a handful of neurons. To address these challenges, substantial efforts were devoted to the derivation of simplified mathematical models amenable to analytical treatment and large scale simulation. This effort led to the establishment of the class of models widely known as Integrate-and-Fire (Bresslof & Coombes, 2000; Brunel, 2000; Burkitt, 2006a, b). Despite their utility, using Integrate-and-Fire models for memory retrieval remains challenging due to the hybrid nature of their dynamics, switching between continuous dynamics and a hard reset to a given initial condition. The key idea for the formulation of biologically plausible associative memory systems was to consider an Integrate-and-Fire model and to average neural spikes over fixed time windows to derive a rate of firing (Ermentrout & Terman, 2010; Gerstner, 2014) for the neuron. The core of the newly proposed biologically plausible model, referred to as the firing rate model, lies in its use of a non-negative activation function that directly processes firing rates rather than membrane voltages. This approach effectively links two empirical observables across clusters of neurons. Despite its potential importance for neuroscience, designing firing rate systems—such as synaptic matrices and activation functions—so that specific memories appear as locally stable equilibria remains an underexplored area (Dayan & Abbott, 2005, Section 7.4). The primary contributions of this paper are (i) the design of a synaptic matrix that encodes memories as equilibrium points within the firing rate system, applicable to arbitrary activation functions, and (ii) an analysis of both local and global stability, building upon and expanding the foundational work presented in (Dayan & Abbott, 2005, Section 7.4). Specifically, we present a method to design a synaptic matrix of the firing rate model that guarantees the retrieval of a rescaled version of the prototypical memories. These prototypical memories are assumed to be equally sparse and equally correlated binary vectors, meaning that they share a common number of ones and of overlapping entries. In particular, our first theorem states the necessary and sufficient conditions that ensure the existence of the rescaled prototypical memories as equilibrium points for the firing rate dynamics. The proposed construction admits a biological interpretation of the synaptic components in terms of excitation, inhibition, and homeostatic regulation. Moreover, we frame the canonical prescription of Dayan & Abbott (Dayan & Abbott, 2005, Section 7.4) as a special case of our synaptic matrix construction. Additionally, we show that the emergence of “anti-memories” is possible only for pathological cases reducible to the use of Hopfield-type synaptic matrix, and explore the existence of spurious equilibria, particularly homogeneous ones. The second theorem goes on to establish sufficient conditions for the local asymptotic stability of the rescaled prototypical memories and, leveraging results from Grossberg (Grossberg, 1983) and Hopfield (Hopfield, 1984), we proceed by defining an energy function to analyze the global behavior of trajectories. Finally, we investigate numerically the tightness of these stability conditions and visualize the energy landscapes for two relevant examples. Notably, simulations reveal how the choice of a negative homeostatic strength results in wider stability regions over the space of parameters, compatibly with the canonical sign choice for the homeostatic term found in the literature. To enhance readability, the proofs of the technical results are deferred to the Appendix. Notation: We let n×m denote the set of n\times m matrices with real entries. The symbol \mathbbold{1}_{n} indicates an n-dimensional vectors of ones and I_{n} the n\times n identity matrix. Given a matrix A\in{}^{n\times m}, A^{\top} is the transpose of A. For a symmetric matrix A=A^{\top}, we write A\succ 0 (A\succeq 0) if A is positive definite (positive semidefinite, respectively). Moreover for two symmetric matrices A,B, we write A\succ B (A\succeq B) if A-B\succ 0 (A-B\succeq 0). Given a vector x\in{}^{n}, \mathrm{diag}(x) is the diagonal matrix with the entries of x as diagonal entries. If f(x) is a real-valued function, f^{\prime}(x) denotes the derivative of f. A function is weakly increasing if f(x_{1})\leq f(x_{2}) for all x_{1},x_{2}\in\real with x_{1}<x_{2} and strictly increasing if f(x_{1})<f(x_{2}) for all x_{1},x_{2}\in\real with x_{1}<x_{2}."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07373v1,Subtle Nuances between Quantum and Classical regimes,"This study explores the semiclassical limit of an integrable-chaotic bosonic many-body quantum system, providing nuanced insights into its behavior. We examine classical-quantum correspondences across different interaction regimes of bosons in a triple-well potential, ranging from the integrable to the self-trapping regime, and including the chaotic one. The close resemblance between the phase-space mean projections of classical trajectories and those of Husimi distributions evokes the Principle of Uniform Semiclassical Condensation (PUSC) of Wigner functions of eigenstates. Notably, the resulting figures also exhibit patterns reminiscent of Jason Gallas’s ""shrimp"" shapes.","I INTRODUCTION Natant decapod crustaceans, commonly known as shrimps (and prawns), are ubiquitous species inhabiting oceans and shallow seas worldwide, including the frigid waters of the Antarctic. These crustaceans play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, serving as predators, scavengers, and prey. Their diverse feeding habits and ecological roles contribute significantly to nutrient cycling and energy flow within marine environments. In the field of dynamical systems, the term ""shrimps"" was introduced by J.A.C. Gallas Gallas (1993, 1994); Hunt et al. (1999); Bonatto, Garreau, and Gallas (2005); Bonatto and Gallas (2008). This terminology arises from the visual similarity between certain bifurcation diagrams and the shape of these marine animals. Bifurcation diagrams, which map the points at which a system’s behavior changes, often display complex, branching structures that resemble the segmented bodies and antennae of shrimps. Interestingly, these dynamical systems’ ""shrimps"" are ubiquitous structures, appearing across a wide range of nonlinear systems. Their presence highlights the intricate and often unexpected patterns that can emerge in the study of dynamical systems, underscoring the universality of such phenomena. In tribute to J.A.C. Gallas, here we unveil patterns that evoke his iconic ""shrimp"" shapes in quantum maps for a Bose-Hubbard model, with a clear correspondence to classical behavior. Our approach focuses on a generalized three-site Bose-Hubbard model with open boundary conditions and long-range interactions Lahaye, Pfau, and Santos (2010), \displaystyle{\mathcal{H}} \displaystyle=\frac{U_{0}}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{3}N_{i}(N_{i}-1)+\sum_{i=1}^{3}\sum_{% j=1;j\neq i}^{3}\frac{U_{ij}}{2}N_{i}N_{j} \displaystyle\qquad-J_{1}(a_{1}^{\dagger}a_{2}+a_{2}^{\dagger}a_{1})-J_{3}(a_{% 2}^{\dagger}a_{3}+a_{3}^{\dagger}a_{2}). (1) where a_{i}^{\dagger}, a_{i}, i=1,2,3, are the canonical creation and annihilation operators, representing the three bosonic degrees of freedom in the model, N_{i}=a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{i} the number operators of the well i. The coupling J_{i},\,i=1,3 denotes the tunneling between neighboring wells, and U_{0} and U_{ij}=U_{ji}, i\neq j, set the on-site and long-range dipole–dipole interactions, respectively. The Hamiltonian has two independent conserved quantities: the energy and the total number of particles N, with N=N_{1}+N_{2}+N_{3}. An experimental feasibility of this system was detailed in Ref. Lahaye, Pfau, and Santos (2010) (see also Ref. Wilsmann et al. (2018)). For a given set of parameters, the model exhibits a third conserved quantity Ymai et al. (2017), equating to the number of degrees of freedom. In this configuration the model is integrable, presenting a bipartite structure Tonel, Links, and Foerster (2005); Links et al. (2006). Systems with a two-mode algebra exhibit three distinct regimes of interaction Lahaye, Pfau, and Santos (2010): Rabi: U\ll JN^{-1}; Josephson: JN^{-1}\ll U\ll JN; and Fock: JN\ll U. In the Rabi and Josephson regimes, the behavior is semiclassical, while the Fock regime corresponds to a pendulum in a strongly quantum regime Lahaye, Pfau, and Santos (2010). The semiclassical integrability properties of the 3-well model have been extensively studied in the Josephson regime Wilsmann et al. (2018); Tonel et al. (2020); W. et al. (2023), as well as in a 4-well model Grün et al. (2022, 2022), both of which belong to a family of integrable multimode systemsYmai et al. (2017). Conversely, integrable quantum models become even more intriguing when they can be controllably driven to chaos Mi et al. (2021). Studies have shown that this integrable system can be driven to the chaotic limit for a finite number of particles N, although its eigenstates do not achieve maximum ergodicity, earning it the label ""Preface to many-body quantum chaos"" Castro et al. (2021); Wittmann W. et al. (2022); Castro et al. (2024). The chaotic behavior is achieved by breaking the symmetry of the system through a tilt between potential wells. Additionally, the system must be in the transition between the Rabi and Josephson interaction regimes. Chaos has also been explored in other three-well models Nemoto et al. (2000); Franzosi and Penna (2001); Mossmann and Jung (2006); Graefe, Korsch, and Witthaut (2006); Hiller, Kottos, and Geisel (2006); Liu et al. (2007); Hiller, Kottos, and Geisel (2009); Kollath et al. (2010); Viscondi and Furuya (2011); Garcia-March et al. (2018); Bera et al. (2019); Rautenberg and Gärttner (2020); Ray, Cohen, and Vardi (2020); Nakerst and Haque (2021, 2023); Bhattacharyya, Ghosh, and Nandi (2023); Zhou and Chen (2024). In this study, we explore the correspondence between the classical and quantum behaviors of a 3-well bosonic system as it transitions from integrability to chaos and then to a fully localized regime. A main finding is that the phase-space mean projections of classical trajectories and those of Husimi distributions evoke the Principle of Uniform Semiclassical Condensation (PUSC) of Wigner functions of eigenstatesRobnik (2019, 2020). The PUSC states that Wigner or Husimi quasiprobabilty distributions of eigenstates condense uniformly on a classical invariant component in the classical phase space, when the Heisenberg time is larger than all relevant classical transport time scales Robnik (2019, 2020). We employ measurements designed to visually capture these correspondences. Interestingly, the results bring to mind the distinct “shrimp” shapes highlighted by J.A.C. Gallas. The article is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we introduce the integrable model along with its symmetry-breaking term, and we also present its classical counterpart. In Section III.1, we compare quantum eigenvector projections (condensations) with classical trajectories of the system as integrability is broken. Sec. III.2 extends this quantum-classical analysis to subspaces of the system in the chaotic regime. n Sec. III.3, we present some trajectories exhibiting quantum-classical correspondence that drew our attention due to their resemblance to Gallas’s ""shrimps."" Finally, Sec. IV provides a discussion of the results, addresses key questions, and outlines new perspectives for future research."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07298v1,Two-stage relaxation of operators through domain wall and magnon dynamics,"The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is a popular probe for quantum information spreading and thermalization. In systems with local interactions, the OTOC defines a characteristic butterfly lightcone that separates a regime unperturbed by chaos from one where time-evolved operators and the OTOC approach equilibrium. This relaxation has been shown to proceed in two stages. The first stage exhibits an extensive timescale and a decay rate known as the “phantom eigenvalue”, which is slower than the gap of the transfer matrix. In this work, we investigate the two-stage relaxation of the OTOC towards its equilibrium value in various local quantum circuits. We apply a systematic framework based on an emergent statistical model, where the dynamics of two single-particle modes – a domain wall and a magnon – govern the decay rates. We show that a configuration with coexisting domain wall and magnon modes generates the phantom rate in the first stage, while competition between these two modes determines the second stage. We also examine this relaxation within the operator cluster picture. The magnon modes translate into a bound state of clusters and the domain wall into a random operator, giving consistent rates. Finally, we extend our findings from random-in-time circuits to a broad class of Floquet models.","Classical chaos is characterized by its extreme sensitivity to the initial conditions, as illustrated by the “butterfly effect”, where small perturbations can lead to dramatically different phase space trajectories. In contrast, the linearity of quantum evolution precludes exponentially diverging trajectories in the full Hilbert space. However, in recent years, one successful probe of quantum chaos has been found in the form of an out-of-time-ordered correlation function (OTOC)larkin_quasiclassical_1969 ; roberts_diagnosing_2015 ; kitaev2015 ; roberts_localized_2015 ; shenker_stringy_2014 , from which a quantum analog of the butterfly effect can be extracted. It has gained traction in studying systems in both high energy and condensed matter physics. In certain holographic systems with black holes, the time scales of OTOCs are used to determine the bulk causal structure roberts_localized_2015 ; shenker_stringy_2014 ; qi_butterfly_2017 ; shenker_black_2014 . The rate at which the commutator increases is shown to be upper-bounded by the inverse temperature of the system maldacena_bound_2016 ; parker_universal_2019 ; murthy_bounds_2019 ; liao_nonlinear_2018 , which is saturated in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, a strongly interacting fermionic system in 0+1 dimension sachdev_gapless_1993 ; sachdev_bekenstein-hawking_2015 ; kitaev2015 . The time scales set by OTOCs and their saturation values are also used to diagnose phases of many-body physics PhysRevB.107.L020202 ; PhysRevB.95.165136 ; PhysRevB.99.224305 ; huang_out–time-ordered_2016 ; fan_out–time-order_2016 ; chen_out–time-order_2016 . More recently, operator spreading has been examined in various random circuit and Hamiltonian models with or without conservation laws hosur_chaos_2016 ; xu_accessing_2018 ; zhou_levy_flight_2020 ; xu_locality_2019 ; Khemani_operator_hydro_2018 ; 2018PRX_Rakovszky ; vonKeyserlingk2018operator ; chen_operator_2018 ; gu_energy_2017 ; nahum2018operator ; lucas_quantum_2019 ; aleiner_microscopic_2016 ; bertini_scrambling_2020-1 , revealing how the relaxation of conserved quantities introduces additional timescales for the spread of quantum chaos. The fundamental mechanism underlying the growth (or decay) of the OTOC is scrambling - the process by which quantum information spreads through interactions. This is often studied in the operator language, by tracking how an initially localized operator grows in time. To understand this precisely, we consider a spin chain and define the OTOC of two initially local operators V and W as the following infinite temperature average \displaystyle\text{OTOC}(x,t)=\langle V(0,t)W(x,0)V(0,t)W(x,0)\rangle (1) where \langle\cdots\rangle=\frac{1}{q^{L}}\rm Tr(...). The operators W at position x and V at position 0 appear in a non-time ordered sequence, hence ’out-of-time-ordered’ correlator. This allows us to compare two quantum states: one first perturbed by W(x,0) then by V(0,t), and another first perturbed by V(0,t) then by W(x,0). At t=0, the local operators W(x,0) and V(0,0) are spatially separated and commute, resulting in identical states. Consequently, \text{OTOC}(x,0) is a time-independent \mathcal{O}(1) constant. However, as the operator V(0,t) evolves and spreads, it ceases to commute with W(x,0), causing the overlap between these differently evolved states to decay. This decrease in overlap quantifies how much the W(x,0) perturbation affects the system when applied before or after V(0,t). The operator V(0,t) typically grows outward at a characteristic “butterfly velocity” v_{B}, making the OTOC a probe of quantum analog of the butterfly effectshenker_black_2014 ; kitaev2015 . The time at which V(0,t) has scrambled sufficiently to cause an \mathcal{O}(1) decrease in the OTOC is known as the scrambling timeshenker_black_2014 ; hosur_chaos_2016 ; susskind_switchbacks_2014 . Figure 1: (a) The OTOC is initially small and experiences a drastic growth at a time \sim x/v_{B}, and then saturates to an equilibrium value. We focus on how it converges to the saturation value after the time scale of \sim x/v_{B}. (b) The OTOC can show two-stage decay with rates r_{1} and r_{2} (r_{1} possibly ¡ r_{2}), where L is the system size. Our work focuses on how the OTOC converges to the steady-state value at long times beyond the initial operator spreading and how the OTOC relaxes to its saturation value. We consider models of local quantum circuits with a well-defined v_{B}. When t\geq\mathcal{O}(x/v_{B}), the operator V(0,t) becomes close to completely random at the location of W(x,0), which gives the saturation value of the OTOC. Interestingly, in a finite system, the relaxation process takes place in two stages, each characterized by different decay rates znidaric_phantom_2023 . In both random and non-random circuits, the relaxation in the first stage does not necessarily follow the gap of the transfer matrix of the OTOC evolution. Instead, the OTOC decays at the rate of “phantom” eigenvalueznidaric_phantom_2023 that lies within the actual gap of the transfer matrix spectrum. The duration of this first stage is characterized by a time scale of L/v_{B}, which indicates a failure to exchange the thermodynamic limits of L\rightarrow\infty and t\rightarrow\infty. The emergence of the phantom eigenvalue and the two-stage decay have also been observed in the relaxation of other quantities, the half-state purity being one of the earliest examples bensa_fastest_2021 ; bensa_purity_2022 ; bensa_two-step_2022 ; jonay_physical_2024 ; znidaric_phantom_2023 ; znidaric_solvable_2022 . To briefly recap, the half-system purity decays exponentially during a quantum quench with local interactions. This is consistent with the linear growth of entanglement entropy before the saturation time \mathcal{O}(L/v_{E}), where v_{E} is the entanglement growth rate. However, after \mathcal{O}(L/v_{E}), the purity can decay at a different rate, which can be slower or faster. In the case when the second stage decay is faster, the first stage decay is precsiely the phantom eigenvalue. Our previous work jonay_physical_2024 also identified a similar transition for the one-point correlation functions (to be discussed in Sec. VI in the cluster picture), as well as the relaxation of entanglement spectra toward its equilibrium distribution. There are generally two approaches for understanding the emergence of the phantom eigenvalue. The first involves the analysis of the pseudo-spectrum of a non-hermitian transfer matrix znidaric_solvable_2022 ; znidaric_phantom_2023 . The left and right eigenstates of a non-hermitian transfer matrix are mutually bi-orthogonal, but they are not necessarily simultaneously normalized. The norm of the left and right eigenvectors can be exponentially large in L but constant in t . The norm remains large when t\ll L, which shadows the true decay before t\sim L/v_{B} and gives rise to a phantom decay. This is an empirical picture explaing the phantom eigenvalue of the purity through the norm of the left and right eigenvector. We adopted a different perspective jonay_physical_2024 and interpret the relaxation rates as the free energies of two emergent modes in the effective purity dynamics - a magnon and a domain wall nahum_quantum_2017 ; zhou_entanglement_2020 ; zhou_nahum_emergent_stat_mech2018 ; vonKeyserlingk2018operator ; jonay2018coarsegrained , (Sec. III.2).This physical fremework precisely predicts the asymptotic rates of both stages and reveals a mechanism of geometric and dynamical nature leading to the rich phenomenology of two-stage thermalization. In this work, we extend our physical theory of two-stage decay to describe the relaxation of the OTOC. We find that the two modes – the domain wall and magnon – are sufficient to capture the trajectories of the system towards its saturation value. Our main result shows that the boundary conditions imposed by the OTOC in the effective model create a scenario where the first stage hosts a coexisting domain wall and magnon mode whose decay rate is a fraction of the magnon rate. The spreading of operators was initially described using the cluster picture, where Pauli strings are represented as expanding clusters under time evolutionnahum2018operator ; vonKeyserlingk2018operator ; nahum_real-time_2022-1 ; chen_operator_2018 ; qi_quantum_2018 ; roberts_operator_2018 . We apply the same framework to understand the relaxation of the OTOC. In this language, what we refer to as a magnon in the spin picture becomes a bound state of clusters whose decay rate can be directly read off from the two-body transfer matrix. Thus, this basis is particularly effective for predicting scenarios where magnon rates dominate. The domain wall corresponds to a random operator that is a superposition of occupied and unoccupied clusters. This viewpoint helps interpret the reverse transition observed in one-point functions. However, since the domain wall represents a superposition of states in the cluster picture, the classical configurations in OTOC relaxation are less intuitive. We conclude that the cluster picture is not a suitable basis when the domain wall dominates.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07297v1,Chaos in Time: Incommensurable Frequencies and Dissipative Continuous Quasi Time Crystals,"While a generic open quantum system decays to its steady state, continuous time crystals (CTCs) develop spontaneous oscillation and never converge to a stationary state. Just as crystals develop correlations in space, CTCs do so in time. Here, we introduce a Continuous Quasi Time Crystals (CQTC). Despite being characterized by the presence of non-decaying oscillations, this phase does not retain its long-range order, making it the time analogous of quasi-crystal structures. We investigate the emergence of this phase in a system made of two coupled collective spin sub-systems, each developing a CTC phase upon the action of a strong enough drive. The addition of a coupling enables the emergence of different synchronized phases, where both sub-systems oscillate at the same frequency. In the transition between different CTC orders, the system develops chaotic dynamics with aperiodic oscillations. These chaotic features differ from those of closed quantum systems, as the dynamics is not characterized by a unitary evolution. At the same time, the presence of non-decaying oscillations makes this phenomenon distinct from other form of chaos in open quantum system, where the system decays instead. We investigate the connection between chaos and this quasi-crystalline phase using mean-field techniques, and we confirm these results including quantum fluctuations at the lowest order.","Introduction Classical nonlinear systems produce a variety of phenomena, including instabilities, period multiplication, and synchronization [1]. Similar phenomena also occur in quantum mechanical systems in the presence of dissipation—the non-unitary dynamics ensuing from the interaction between a quantum system and its environment [2]. A primary example of dissipation-induced phenomena are continuous time crystals (CTCs) [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], states that like “standard” crystals develop long-range order, but realizes it in time rather than in space. Normally, an open quantum system evolves toward its unique steady state and, upon reaching it, the dynamics become stationary. CTCs breaks this time-translational invariance, maintaining an oscillatory behavior even at infinite times. This space-to-time analogy extends to several interacting CTCs, as oscillating phases combine or melt, losing all-time periodicity or synchronizing with novel ones [16, 25, 23, 26]. CTCs have been associated with enhanced sensing [27, 28], quantum-to-classical transition [29] and non-equilibrium thermodynamic [30, 31, 32], prompting their experimental investigations [33, 34, 35]. Figure 1: Sketch of the model and emergent phases. (a) Two systems, each described by the Dicke model in Eq. (1), are coupled and result in Eq. (2). According to the choice of parameters and the relative strength of the coupling, the collective phase of the system changes between (b) Melted: Irreversible decay towards the steady state. When analyzing the structure of the Liouvillian superoperator [c.f. (8)], all eigenvalues are characterized by Re(\lambda_{j})<0, except the one associated with the steady state Re(\lambda_{j})=0. (c) Time Crystal: Undamped, regular oscillations. This results in Re(\lambda_{j})=0 and equally spaced Im(\lambda_{j})\neq 0 for a portion of eigenvalues. (d) Quasicrystal: Persistent but aperiodic oscillations. Here, Re(\lambda_{j})=0 and non-commensurate Im(\lambda_{j}). Chaos–a prerogative of nonlinear systems–is an amplification of the incertitude on the system’s initial state, making it so that “the present determines the future but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future” [36]. Despite having a linear dynamics, quantum systems can display a certain degree of randomness, leading to parallels between classical and quantum chaos. The features and characteristics of these quantum chaotic systems have been characterized via random matrix theory [37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. These definitions have been extended to open quantum systems [42, 43, 44, 45], with recent investigation focusing on the stochastic nature of the system-environment interaction [46, 47, 48]. A distinctive feature of chaos is the presence of strange attractors in phase space, points around which a system describes aperiodic orbits [1]. A key question is whether this chaotic feature can emerge in dissipative configurations, with a system not relaxing to its steady state but maintaining aperiodic oscillations. Given the correspondence between space and time crystals, this phase would represent an ordered but non-periodic structure in time, thereby creating a dissipative continuous quasi-time crystal (CQTC). We present evidence for the existence of CQTCs and characterize them. We analyze this phase using mean-field techniques, and we verify that beyond-mean-field techniques reproduce the mean-field results in the thermodynamic limit. We thus show that the resulting phase is robust with respect to finite-size effects and analyze how the emission spectrum could detect the appearance of this chaotic behavior. As this phase leads to chaotic oscillatory behavior within a CTC, this problem can be seen as chaos in a 1D portion of an otherwise 2D spectrum, making its features distinct from both the prediction of Hamiltonian or Liouvillian chaos."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07189v1,Deterministic criticality & cluster dynamics hidden in the Game of Life,"Conway’s Game of Life (GOL) is a cellular automaton showing how complex dynamical behavior emerges from simple local interactions. Although it has often been shown that the dynamics of GOL lies close to some sort of critical behavior, this system has never been studied in the context of a deterministic phase transition. Here, we study the critical dynamics of equal-state clusters that emerge in the logistic GOL: an extension of Conway’s GOL with a parameter that alters the dynamics by expanding the binary state space into a Cantor set, while maintaining the deterministic nature of the system. Upon tuning the parameter, we find that the logistic GOL comprises at least three types of asymptotic behavior, i.e. phases, that are separated by two critical points. One critical point defines the boundary between a sparse-static and a sparse-dynamic asymptotic phase, whereas the other point marks a deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic and a third, dense-dynamic asymptotic phase. Moreover, we identify distinct power-law distributions of cluster sizes near the critical points, and discuss the underlying mechanisms that give rise to such critical behavior. Overall, our work highlights the idea that scale invariance can emerge even in systems where clusters are generated by a purely deterministic process.","Criticality has always been associated with universal scaling behavior and universality classes in non-equilibrium systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. In particular, deterministic criticality has been a focal point for structures that emerge from fixed rules, particularly in the context of percolation, a theme which has itself united various branches of mathematics [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and physics [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. Deterministic criticality plays a crucial role in understanding how systems governed by fixed rules can exhibit complex behaviors, including phase transitions and scaling laws, without relying on randomness. It has been examined through deterministic processes governing invasion percolation [32], electrical [33] and elastic [34] responses in deterministic fractal networks, as well as deterministic ansatz for fractal-like critical snapshots [35]. Moreover, it has also been demonstrated in deterministic walks, sandpile models [36, 37], bootstrap percolation on trees with hierarchical dynamics [38, 39]. In this work, we report the surprising emergence of deterministic criticality in a closed Game of Life (GOL) system, a cellular automaton governed by exceedingly simple deterministic evolution rules. First introduced in 1970 [40, 41], this discrete dynamical system initially gained attention as (i) an exquisite illustration of the idea that complex behavior can emerge from simple interactions, and as (ii) a universal Turing machine [42, 43]. Moreover, Conway’s GOL has been often considered an elegant starting point for studying emergent phenomena such as artificial life [44, 45, 46, 47], neural networks [48], ecology [49, 50] self-organization [51, 52, 53, 54], quantum systems [55, 56, 57, 58], criticality [59, 60, 61] and phase transitions [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68]. Conway’s GOL has been widely investigated in the context of a phase transition because it is an inherently complex system. Indeed, the long transient dynamics and localized structures – that emerge from parallel local interactions (i.e. automaton rules) among binary states in a square lattice of sites – support the notion that this system resides between ‘order and chaos’ [69]. However, statistical investigations [64, 70, 71] have revealed that GOL is subcritical in terms of its late time behavior, with an asymptotic density significantly lower than the mean-field prediction [68]. In this respect, it has been tempting to introduce extensions of GOL with control parameters that, by incrementally modifying the automaton rules away from the original system, can identify how far the GOL dynamics is from a critical phase transition. Examples of such extensions include asynchronous [62] or mass-conserving [63] update schemes, probabilistic rules of time evolution [64, 65, 66], varying ranges of interactions [67], etc., and find that the rules of GOL are close to both continuous and discontinuous critical phase transitions. However, while most of these extensions are variations that employ probabilistic/random components, this deterministic automaton has never been investigated in the context of a deterministic phase transition [72, 73]. In this paper, we analyze the phase transitions that occur in the logistic GOL [53]: an extension inspired by the logistic map [74], where a control parameter changes the rate of update of sites by expanding the initially binary state space into a Cantor set. As the parameter ‘drifts’ the system away from Conway’s GOL, its asymptotic dynamics transitions from a sparse-inactive (I) phase (like Conway’s GOL) to a sparse-active (II), and then a dense-active (III) phase. We identify the points that separate these three distinct dynamical regimes numerically and study their critical properties by in-depth analyses of cluster dynamics. We find that the critical point separating phases I and II defines the bound of a peculiar form of self-organized criticality in the sparse-active phase, where quiescent clusters surrounded by activity follow a power-law distribution. Moreover, detailed cluster analyses at the critical point separating phases II and III, indicate a deterministic, continuous percolation transition. Interestingly, the identified percolation exhibits a Fisher exponent below two, differing from random percolation models and aligning with no enclave percolation [75]. Beyond showcasing critical behavior in deterministic dynamical systems, the logistic GOL introduces a broad range of deterministic tunability. This tunability allows for precise control of the cluster shapes and the ‘fatness’ of cluster size distributions, studied here for the first time in a variation of GOL. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we discuss how we extend Conway’s GOL to the logistic GOL. In Sec. III, we report results from simulations of the logistic GOL and identify the different asymptotic dynamical regimes separated by critical points. In Sec. IV, we perform extensive cluster analyses and to study the percolation transition between phases II and III, whereas in Sec. V we investigate both critical points in terms of their power-law cluster size distributions. Lastly, in Sec. VI we provide a summary and discussion on the deterministic critical behavior identified in the logistic GOL."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07005v1,"Detecting time-irreversibility in multiscale systems: 
correlation and response functions in the Lorenz96 model","Due to their relevance to geophysical systems, the investigation of multiscale systems through the lens of statistical mechanics has gained popularity in recent years. The aim of our work is the characterization of the nonequilibrium properties of the well-known two-scales Lorenz96 model, a dynamical system much used for testing ideas in geophysics, by studying either higher-order correlation functions or response to external perturbations of the energy. These tools in both equilibrium (inviscid) or non-equilibrium (viscous) systems provide clear evidence of their suitability for detecting time-reversal symmetry breaking and for characterizing transport properties also in this class of models. In particular, we characterize how localized energy perturbations are transported between the different scales, highlighting that perturbations of synoptic variables greatly impact advective variables but perturbations of the latter have a practically negligible effect on synoptic scales. Finally, we show that responses of global observables to finite size perturbations strongly depend on the perturbation protocol. This prevents the physical understanding of the system from observations of the relaxation process alone, a fact often overlooked.","The study of geophysical phenomena is notoriously challenging for both mathematicians and physicists. The inherent complexity can be attributed to the nontrivial interactions existing between the system components possessing different length and time scales, but also to the mere difficulty (even computational) of properly taking into account the enormous amount of variables needed to describe any relevant observable. These difficulties could be overcome with a clever modelization of the phenomenon, having the twofold aim of simplifying the interactions appearing in the original equations and reduce the number of degrees of freedom. Naturally the procedure of discarding variables and interactions is rather delicate: the resulting equations still need to be a valid approximation of the original ones, and have to reproduce as faithfully as possible the features (either dynamical or statistical) of our system. E. N. Lorenz clearly understood the advantages of simplified models Lorenz (2005) to gain some insight on complex phenomena, especially when dealing with geophysical flows. The “Lorenz63 model"" Lorenz (1963), a hyper-simplified modelization of thermal convection, had an enormous impact on chaos theory and fluid mechanics, and arguably represents the prototypical chaotic model for most computational studies. Less popular, yet with quite a considerable influence, is another model that became known as “Lorenz96"" Lorenz (1995). The original aim was the study of atmospheric predictability, and the possibility to gain information about the spreading of initial small uncertainties by exploiting dynamical models attempting to reproduce atmospheric circulation. Lorenz presented two versions of the model. He first introduced a single-scale model where the dynamical variables, placed along a latitude circle, have asymmetric nonlinear couplings and are subject to constant forcing and linear damping. The combination of these three actions can roughly account for most geophysical phenomena taking place in the atmosphere. In the same work, Lorenz also proposed a two-scales version of the model, where the interacting variables have either slow or fast dynamics. Resolving the faster scales as well should make the model more adherent to real physics. The wide influence of the Lorenz96 model is proved by the plethora of works which adopted it as the core of their studies or as a case study for applying new concepts. It was employed likewise in physics Boffetta et al. (2000); Lacorata and Vulpiani (2007); Karimi and Paul (2010); Gallavotti and Lucarini (2014); van Kekem and Sterk (2018), mathematics Orrell and Smith (2003); Stappers and Barkmeijer (2012); de Leeuw et al. (2018); Kerin and Engler (2020) and geosciences Basnarkov and Kocarev (2012); Sterk et al. (2012); Carlu et al. (2019), just to mention a few. In this work we are interested in the characterization, in the two-scales Lorenz96 model, of temporal nonequilibrium properties as revealed by two effective indicators of the absence of statistical equilibrium: high-order time correlation functions Pomeau (1982) and response functions Kubo (1966); Marconi et al. (2008). There are several reasons for choosing the Lorenz96 model for our purposes: the presence of nonlinear interactions between variables hinders the use of the solid theoretical framework built for linear systems, thereby making necessary the use of computer simulations. Since we have access to the explicit evolution equations, we can choose to study the ‘standard’ model, namely a driven dissipative system, which is far from statistical equilibrium, or else the ‘reversible’ model, where damping and external forcing are put to zero and the total energy is a global conserved quantity, so that the system is in statistical equilibrium in the microcanonical sense. In the following we will refer to the original model as “viscous"" or “irreversible"" Lorenz96, and to the model without forcing and damping as “inviscid"" or “reversible"" Lorenz96. In this respect, it becomes especially interesting to analyze the differences between the two above-mentioned indicators when they refer to the former or the latter version of the model. Non-symmetric third-order time correlation functions provide results that fit well with recent studies Lucente et al. (2023a); Cocciaglia, Cencini, and Vulpiani (2024), for what concerns their ability to discriminate between statistical equilibrium and nonequilibrium: correlation functions in the reversible model show very small deviations from zero, while the same functions in the irreversible model are characterized by a large short-time peak followed by relaxation to zero, thus the time dependence is more nontrivial. The second indicators, namely the response functions Marconi et al. (2008) of the ‘local’ (related to a single d.o.f.) energies, reveal interesting dynamical properties. Specifically, the spreading of an initially-localized energy perturbation highlights the presence of statistical fluxes that behave as travelling waves. This happens only in the irreversible model, while in the reversible case the response functions display an asymptotic approach to equipartition, as expected from equilibrium statistical mechanics considerations. The paper is structured as follows: in Sec. II we introduce the model and delineate the main differences between the reversible and irreversible versions. In Sec III, the statistical properties of the system are characterized through the lens of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. In particular, Sec. III.1 deals with higher-order correlation functions while Sec. III.2 examines the responses of the system to external perturbations. Finally, in Sec. IV we draw the main conclusions and present possible perspectives."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06894v1,Correlation functions and properties of local distributions of frustrated phases in the ground state of a dilute Ising chain in a magnetic field,"The features of the response of frustrated states to the external field are considered on the example of a diluted Ising chain. In the ferromagnetic case, partial ordering occurs, which leads to a decrease in entropy. In the antiferromagnetic case, the switching on of the field leads to the appearance of a long-range order in the system, although the state remains frustrated. A mapping of a one-dimensional spin model to a Markov chain is proposed, which makes it possible to study in detail the properties of correlation functions and local distributions of the states in the spin chain.","The Ising model is important as a theoretical tool in the understanding of phase states and phase transitions in ferroelectric materials [1] and due to the concept of magnetism-driven ferroelectricity [2]. Unusual effects may be associated with frustrated phases, including in ferroelectrics [3]. First of all, frustrated states are characterized by a nontrivial response to the external field. The source of frustration, in addition to the geometry of the lattice, can be impurities. A dilute Ising chain is the simplest model of a system where the ground state is frustrated due to the presence of impurities. In a zero magnetic field, this model has an exact solution [4], which is presented and analyzed in the most general form in [5], and the properties of local distributions of states over the chain sites were investigated in the work [6]. The entropy and phase diagram of the ground state of the system in a magnetic field at a fixed impurity concentration were obtained in [7]. It has been shown that in a zero magnetic field, frustrated phases with a ferro- and antiferromagnetic sign of the exchange interaction constant have the same entropy at a given impurity concentration, however, with a non-zero magnetic field, the residual entropy of the frustrated ferromagnetic phase is greater than of the antiferromagnetic one. In order to investigate the cause of this seeming contradiction, the properties of correlation functions and local distributions for frustrated phases of the ground state in a magnetic field are studied in detail in this paper. For calculations and analysis of the results, the mapping of a one-dimensional spin model to a Markov chain is used. The article is organized as follows. The section II briefly describes the ground state phase diagram of the model. In the section III, the principle of mapping a one-dimensional spin model to a Markov chain is formulated and a general formula for the transition matrix is obtained. The main results of the work and their discussion are contained in the section IV. Brief conclusions are formulated in the section V."

Our study encompasses the thermodynamic properties, evaluating energy, magnetization, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, magnetic entropy, and the Binder cumulant. Additionally, we examine the impact of external fields on these thermodynamic quantities at different externally applied field values. We accurately determine the critical temperature for various model scenarios by analyzing the Binder cumulant. Our investigations also include an analysis of the hysteresis loop for the model for different an-isotropic cases. In particular, our study presents the magnetocaloric effect, which is the change in temperature of magnetic material when exposed to a changing magnetic field, in the different anisotropic cases of the Ising model.","I introduction The main aim of condensed matter physics is the study of the collective properties of matter composed of many constituents and the interactions between them [1]. Distinguishing different phases of a system and locating the critical points in the parameter space is key in condensed matter and statistical physics. The study of magnetic materials is a significant topic of interest in both fields. This magnetism arises from the spins of electrons within the material, and ferromagnetic materials particularly are important to study. Ferromagnetic materials have domains in which spins are aligned in a specific direction. When an external magnetic field is applied to these materials, the domains align with the applied field, magnetizing the material. As the temperature increases, the total magnetization decreases. At a specific temperature, known as the Curie temperature or transition temperature, the magnetizations become disordered, and the spins point in random directions, causing the material to lose its magnetic properties–the transition from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic state. This study focuses on explaining the thermal and magnetic behavior of magnetic materials. In 1925, a German physicist, Ernst Ising, with the advice of his PhD advisor Wilhelm Lenz, discussed a model known as the Ising model in his PhD thesis [2]. The Ising model was later solved exactly by Onsager for two dimensions [3]. This model is considered the paradigmatic model for the study of equilibrium phase transitions in statistical and condensed matter physics, as well as in various other fields such as chemistry, biology, statistics, and finance [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The Ising model is one of the simplest and fundamental models for studying magnetic materials. The model has been extensively studied due to its phase transition properties, and numerous resources are available, such as [16]. An overview of the model is as follows. Our study considers a square lattice of size L, having N(=\mathrm{L\times L}) lattice sites. The symbol s_{i} (or \sigma_{i}) is used to represent the magnetic moment (or spin) of the electron/atom/molecule at the lattice site i. The spin is considered fixed at the site and is assumed to take only binary values \{1,-1\} corresponding to the two possible spin states, up and down, along a fixed axis. See Fig.1. The choice of spins with values of \pm 1 is foundational to the model and is motivated by several reasons. This binary nature simplifies the mathematical formulation and analysis of the model, making it more tractable for theoretical studies and computational simulations. The model was originally developed to describe ferromagnetic materials, where atomic magnetic moments (spins) tend to align either parallel or anti-parallel. The Ising model with \pm 1 spins has been instrumental in understanding critical phenomena and phase transitions, particularly second-order phase transitions. These sites (i and j) interact through their fields with interaction strengths \mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{x}} or \mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{y}} along x-axis and y-axis respectively. Furthermore, the interactions are taken between nearest neighboring sites, denoted as \langle i,j\rangle under the summation. The Hamiltonian for the Ising model is represented as: \mathrm{H}(\mathrm{s})=-\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{x}}\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_{x}}s_% {i}s_{j}-\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{y}}\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_{y}}s_{i}s_{j}-h_{j}% \sum_{j}s_{j} (1) Here, h_{j} is the external magnetic field applied. Spins oriented along the magnetic (external) field will have lower energy, and those oriented opposite to the field will have higher energy. For \mathrm{J}_{x},\mathrm{J}_{y}>0, neighboring spins tend to align in a single direction and material shows ferromagnetic behavior. Conversely, for \mathrm{J}_{x},\mathrm{J}_{y}<0, the material becomes antiferromagnetic. When \mathrm{J}=0, the spins do not interact with each other. In these simulations, J is set as the unit of energy and temperature. The changes in the value of J is explained ahead for different anisotropic scenarios. . Figure 1: Schematic diagram of 2D Ising model with J_{x} and J_{y} as nearest neighbor interactions along x-axis and y-axis respectively. By the term anisotropic Ising model, we mean that \frac{J_{y}}{J_{x}}\neq 1.0. This is the model we are interested in our simulations. In the isotropic Ising model, the values of \frac{J_{y}}{J_{x}}=1.0. In our study of the anisotropic Ising model, the value of \frac{J_{y}}{J_{x}} has been changed. One of the methods for studying the phase transition of the model is the Monte Carlo (MC) technique. Metropolis algorithm has been implemented successfully on a large variety of condensed matter systems like cuprates [17, 18, 19]. On the one hand, following the tradition of using the Monte Carlo method, we employed the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (discussed in section II.1 ahead) to study phases and phase transitions of the 2D Ising model. However, this approach leads to the well-known problem of critical slowing down near the critical point. This problem has been extensively discussed in the literature [20]. While we will not delve deeply into the details of this issue, we aim to give the reader a sense of its complexity in the next few paragraphs. On the other hand, we used the Wolff algorithm [21] for the same study of phases and phase transitions. The Wolff algorithm helps us bypass critical slowing down by employing a method called cluster updating, which involves growing a cluster randomly and flipping the cluster, giving the speed-up over the Metropolis-Hastings’ algorithm which flips a single spin randomly. The working of the Wolf algorithm has been discussed in section II.2 ahead. 2D materials in general and the ones with magnetic properties especially, after the discovery of graphene [22, 23], have begun a new field of research because of their distinctive physical properties, hence, their different and interesting applications in industrial sectors like optoelectronics, magnetic recording, energy, thermo-electrics, etc. [24, 25, 26, 27] that in turn gives rise to the new technologies. This magnetism is coming due to the spins. For the fundamental understanding the Ising model, a historical model, is studied in physics that provides a simplified framework to investigate complex spin interactions in 2D and 3D materials offering valuable insights of the phenomena. Here we are focusing on 2D systems because of their special properties. The range of interactions has a role of great importance, for example, new long-range interactions have been recently studied in [28] and the references mentioned therein. The variation of the strength of interaction alters the detailed balance condition of the system, affecting the system’s overall thermodynamic behavior. This is one of our interests in this study. Let’s have some account of an engrossing phenomenon–the detailed balance condition, crucial in Metropolis-Hastings’ algorithm, which states that at equilibrium, all elementary processes should be equilibrated by their reverse processes. In simple terms, the probability of the system transitioning from state A to state B is the same as the probability of transitioning from state B to state A. In the context of the Ising model, which describes the magnetic spins on a lattice, the detailed balance condition is of great importance for sampling the configuration space according to the Boltzmann distribution. A random move is accepted or rejected based on the change in energy, following the Metropolis algorithm. The Metropolis criteria are essential to ensure that the detailed balance condition is satisfied [29]. The detailed balance condition states that for any two states \sigma and \sigma^{\prime} of the system, the transition rates \mathrm{W}\left(\sigma\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime}\right) and W\left(\sigma^{\prime}\rightarrow\sigma\right) must satisfy: \frac{\mathrm{P}\left(\sigma^{\prime}\right)\mathrm{W}\left(\sigma^{\prime}% \rightarrow\sigma\right)}{\mathrm{P}(\sigma)\mathrm{W}\left(\sigma\rightarrow% \sigma^{\prime}\right)}=1 (2) where P(\sigma) denotes the equilibrium probability distribution of state \sigma. For a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T, the probability (\sigma) is given by the Boltzmann distribution: P(\sigma)=\frac{e^{-\beta H(\sigma)}}{\mathrm{Z}} (3) where \beta=\frac{1}{k_{B}T} (k_{B} is Boltzmann constant), H(\sigma) is the energy of state \sigma, and Z is the partition function: \mathrm{Z}=\sum_{\sigma}\mathrm{e}^{-\beta\mathrm{H}(\sigma)} (4) To ensure detailed balance, the transition rates should be chosen such that: \frac{\mathrm{e}^{-\beta\mathrm{H}\left(\sigma^{\prime}\right)}\mathrm{W}\left% (\sigma^{\prime}\rightarrow\sigma\right)}{\mathrm{e}^{-\beta\mathrm{H}(\sigma)% }\mathrm{W}\left(\sigma\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime}\right)}=1 (5) which simplifies to: \frac{\mathrm{W}\left(\sigma^{\prime}\rightarrow\sigma\right)}{\mathrm{W}\left% (\sigma\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime}\right)}=\mathrm{e}^{\beta\left[\mathrm{H}% \left(\sigma^{\prime}\right)-\mathrm{H}(\sigma)\right]} (6) One common choice for the transition rates that satisfies the detailed balance condition is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, where the transition rate from state \sigma to \sigma^{\prime} is given by: \mathrm{W}\left(\sigma\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime}\right)=\min\left(1,e^{\beta% \left[\mathrm{H}\left(\sigma^{\prime}\right)-\mathrm{H}(\sigma)\right]}\right) (7) Critical slowing down [29] shows auto-correlation time blows up. Since the Metropolis algorithm flips a single random spin at a time to dismantle clusters spread throughout the lattice, this process is a huge time-consuming process in simulations. The correlation length is the characteristic length scale over which the spins of the system are correlated. Near the transition temperature, the correlation length diverges, indicating that correlations extend over long distances. Additionally, the correlation time, which is the characteristic time scale over which spins in the system are correlated, also increases. At the critical point, where there is a phase transition between the ordered (ferromagnetic) phase and the disordered (paramagnetic) phase, correlations become stronger and extend over long distances. Due to this, the single-flip method offered by the Metropolis algorithm leads to a highly time-consuming process known as critical slowing down [21, 29]. The cluster flipping method offered by the Wolff algorithm [21] assists in de-correlating the system in significantly less time. This can be realized from the Eq.(8) that gives the relation between the correlation time (\tau) and the correlation length (\xi). \tau\approx\xi^{z} (8) Here, z represents the dynamic exponent. The value of this dynamic exponent is approximately \approx 2.17 for the Metropolis algorithm and nearly zero for the Wolff algorithm [21, 30]. The systems we are studying have limited size, unlike the realistic models that ideally extend to infinite size (L\rightarrow\infty). Therefore, boundary conditions need to be taken into consideration, and for that, we are employing the usual approach of using periodic boundary conditions. This implies that the topmost and rightmost layers are considered neighbors, as are the bottom-most and leftmost layers. Figure 2: Snapshot of the Monte-Carlo simulation of isotropic Ising model using Wolff algorithm (first row) and the MA (second row) at three (2.0, 2.26, and 3.0) temperatures (Black and white dots here represent the +1 and -1 states of the model, video file: [31]). Fig.2 presents snapshots of the simulation at three different temperatures of the isotropic Ising model: 2.0 (below the transition temperature), 2.26 (near the transition temperature), and 3.0 (above the transition temperature). Black and white dots here represent the +1 and -1 states of the model. The first row displays the results for the Wolff algorithm, while the second row shows the lattice of the Metropolis algorithm. These snapshots were captured after 10^{3} Monte Carlo steps for 100\times 100 lattice. For temperatures near the critical temperature, the Wolff algorithm reaches equilibrium near 10^{3} steps, whereas the Metropolis algorithm lags. A video demonstrating these flips has been created and an online video can be seen by clicking the link in [31] From the video, it can be observed that even at a temperature of 2.0 (below the transition temperature) and especially at T = 2.26 (near to the transition temperature), the Metropolis algorithm takes larger number of Monte-Carlo steps for equilibration, while the Wolff algorithm shows the transition of the system in lesser number of Monte-Carlo steps. At T=3.0 (above transition temperature) the system is not transitioning from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic state. The phase transition is not possible above the transition temperature because the thermal fluctuations dominate the system. Our main results include magnetization, energy, specific heat, magnetic entropy, and Binder cumulant versus temperature at various magnetic field values. Additionally, we present the study of the Magnetocaloric effect for both the isotropic Ising model anisotropic Ising model and different anisotropic Ising model cases. Transition temperatures for the Isotropic Ising model and four different variants of the anisotropic Ising model were determined through Monte Carlo simulations using both the Metropolis and Wolff algorithms. The four different variants of the anisotropic Ising model involve five distinct values of \frac{J_{y}}{J_{x}}, namely 0.5,0.75,1.0,1.25, and 1.5. Transition temperatures of these models were identified using Binder cumulant graph plotting for five different values of N, the lattice size. The values of N considered in this study are 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. The magneto-caloric effect (MCE) is an interesting topic for the discovery and development of new materials with enhanced magnetocaloric properties. Contrary to traditional methods of gas compression and expansion cycles for refrigeration, for example, which often use environmentally harmful refrigerants, magnetocaloric refrigeration has the potential to be a more efficient source of energy and friendly to the environment. Magnetocaloric refrigeration can provide targeted cooling with high precision which has high industrial uses. Magnetocaloric technologies can be integrated with renewable energy sources. The MCE comes with some scientific and technological challenges that drive research and innovation. Though MCE promises many things, understanding the fundamental physics behind the effect, optimizing material properties, and designing efficient magnetocaloric devices are table-top topics in research. These challenges stimulate advancements in materials science, thermodynamics, and engineering. The investigation of magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effect has been an interesting topic for a long time. Even nowadays researchers are exploring these properties in different systems using Monte Carlo and other methods. The magnetocaloric effect using Monte Carlo simulations has been discussed for 1D, 2D, and 3D ferrimagnetic systems has been discussed in [32]. Magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effect of an Ising-type polyhedral chain have been discussed in [33], on 2D core-shell Ising system in [34], Ising model with RKKY interaction in [35], 3D Ising model with new long-range interaction in [28] Further discussion about MCE is in the magneto-caloric effect section later. After the introduction in the above section I, the rest of the paper is framed as follows. First, we are presenting an overview of the Metropolis and Wolff algorithm in section II. Afterward, a discussion on symmetry, order parameters, and phase transitions is given in section III. In the next section, we are moving to results and analysis of the below-mentioned thermodynamic quantities (Eq.(11)) to (14)) for anisotropic Ising model and anisotropic Ising model using Metropolis algorithm and Wolff algorithm, followed by the study of transition temperatures using Binder cumulant using Wolff algorithm, in section IV. Subsequently, we are presenting the study of the thermodynamic and magnetic quantities ((Eq.(11)) to (15)) at varying magnetic fields in section V. Thereafter, we are presenting the hysteresis loop survey for the Ising model for different Isotropic cases in section VI. Finally, we go to the magnetocaloric effect in section VII. And the conclusion of the paper in the last section VIII."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06818v1,Mechanism of the Nonequilibrium Phase Transition in Self-Propelled Particles with Alignment,"Self-propelled particles with alignment, displaying ordered collective motions such as swarming, can be investigated by the well-known Vicsek model. However, challenges still remain regarding the nature of the associated phase transition. Here, we use the landscape-flux approach combined with the coarse-grained mapping method to reveal the underlying mechanism of the continuous or discontinuous order-disorder nonequilibrium phase transition in Vicsek model systems featuring diverse noise characteristics. It is found that the nonequilibrium flux inside the landscape in the density-alignment degree phase space always rotates counterclockwise, and tends to delocalize or destabilize the point attractor states, providing the dynamical driving force for altering the landscape shape and the system state. Furthermore, the variations in the averaged flux and entropy production rate exhibit pronounced differences across various noise types. This not only helps to reveal the dynamical and thermodynamical mechanisms of the order-disorder transition but also offers a useful tool to recognize the continuity of the transition. Our findings present a novel perspective for exploring nonequilibrium phase transition behaviors and other collective motions in various complex systems.","References Bechinger et al. [2016] C.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06273v1,Structural Properties of Hyperuniform Networks,"Disordered hyperuniform many-particle systems are recently discovered exotic states of matter, characterized by a complete suppression of normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations, as in perfect crystals, and lack of conventional long-range order, as in liquids and glasses. In this work, we begin a program to quantify the structural properties of nonhyperuniform and hyperuniform networks. In particular, large two-dimensional (2D) Voronoi networks (graphs) containing approximately 10,000 nodes are created from a variety of different point configurations, including the antihyperuniform hyperplane intersection process (HIP), nonhyperuniform Poisson process, nonhyperuniform random sequential addition (RSA) saturated packing, and both non-stealthy and stealthy hyperuniform point processes. We carry out an extensive study of the Voronoi-cell area distribution of each of the networks through determining multiple metrics that characterize the distribution, including their higher-cumulants (i.e., skewness \gamma_{1} and excess kurtosis \gamma_{2}). We show that the HIP distribution is far from Gaussian, as evidenced by a high skewness (\gamma_{1}=3.16) and large positive excess kurtosis (\gamma_{2}=16.2). The Poisson (with \gamma_{1}=1.07 and \gamma_{2}=1.79) and non-stealthy hyperuniform (with \gamma_{1}=0.257 and \gamma_{2}=0.0217) distributions are Gaussian-like distributions, since they exhibit a small but positive skewness and excess kurtosis. The RSA (with \gamma_{1}=0.450 and \gamma_{2}=-0.0384) and the highest stealthy hyperuniform distributions (with \gamma_{1}=0.0272 and \gamma_{2}=-0.0626) are also non-Gaussian because of their low skewness and negative excess kurtosis, which is diametrically opposite non-Gaussian behavior of the HIP. The fact that the cell-area distributions of large, finite-sized RSA and stealthy hyperuniform networks (e.g., with N\approx 10,000 nodes) are narrower, have larger peaks, and smaller tails than a Gaussian distribution implies that in the thermodynamic limit the distributions should exhibit compact support, consistent with previous theoretical considerations. Moreover, we compute the Voronoi-area correlation functions C_{00}(r) for the networks, which describe the correlations between the area of two Voronoi cells separated by a given distance r [M. A. Klatt and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. E 90, 052120 (2014)]. We show that the correlation functions C_{00}(r) qualitatively distinguish the antihyperuniform, nonhyperuniform and hyperuniform Voronoi networks considered here. Specifically, the antihyperuniform HIP networks possess a slowly decaying C_{00}(r) with large positive values, indicating large fluctuations of Voronoi cell areas across scales. While the nonhyperuniform Poisson and RSA network possess positive and fast decaying C_{00}(r), we find strong anticorrelations in C_{00}(r) (i.e., negative values) for the hyperuniform networks. The latter indicates that the large-scale area fluctuations are suppressed by accompanying large Voronoi cells with small cells (and vice versa) in the systems in order to achieve hyperuniformity. In summary, we have shown that cell-area distributions and pair correlations functions of Voronoi networks enable one to distinguish quantitatively antihyperuniform, standard nonhyperuniform and hyperuniform networks from one another.","Disordered hyperuniform many-particle systems in d-dimensional Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{d} are exotic amorphous states in which the normalized density fluctuations are completely suppressed at infinite wavelengths Torquato and Stillinger (2003); Torquato (2018). In the last two decades, such disordered systems have been shown to arise in a variety of contexts in the physical, mathematical and biological contexts Torquato and Stillinger (2003); Torquato (2018); Donev et al. (2005); Zachary and Torquato (2009a); Jiao et al. (2014); Torquato (2016); Leseur et al. (2016); Hexner and Levine (2017); Hexner et al. (2017); Weijs and Bartolo (2017); Torquato et al. (2019); Chen et al. (2023a); Zheng et al. (2020); Salvalaglio et al. (2020); Chen et al. (2021); Sakai et al. (2022); Puig et al. (2022); Ge (2023); Philcox and Torquato (2023); Zhang et al. (2023); Wilken et al. (2021); Liu et al. (2024); Sánchez et al. (2023). Disordered hyperuniform materials are attracting great attention because they possess many unique optical, mechanical and transport properties Florescu et al. (2009); Man et al. (2013); Florescu et al. (2013); Weijs et al. (2015); Xu et al. (2017); Wu et al. (2017); Rumi et al. (2019); Lei and Ni (2019); Zhang et al. (2019); Chéron et al. (2022); Tavakoli et al. (2022); Granchi et al. (2022); Tang et al. (2022); Chen et al. (2022, 2023b); Zhuang et al. (2024). A hyperuniform system, disordered or not, can be defined in two equivalent ways. A hyperuniform many-particle systems is one in which the number variance of particles within a spherical observation window of radius R grows slower than the observation window volume R^{d} for large R Torquato and Stillinger (2003); Torquato (2018), i.e., \lim_{R\rightarrow\infty}\sigma_{N}^{2}(R)/v_{1}(R)=0 (1) where \sigma_{N}^{2}(R)\equiv\langle N(R)^{2}\rangle-\langle N(R)\rangle^{2} is the variance in number of points (brackets indicate the ensemble average) and v_{1}(R)\sim R^{d} is the volume of a d-dimensional sphere or radius R. Equivalently, a many-particle system is hyperuniform if its structure factor S(\mathbf{k}) tends to zero as the wavenumber k\equiv|\mathbf{k}| tends to zero, i.e., \lim_{|\mathbf{k}|\rightarrow 0}S(\mathbf{k})=0. (2) The small-k scaling behavior of S(k)\sim k^{\alpha} determines the large-R asymptotic behavior of \sigma_{N}^{2}(R), based on which all hyperuniform systems, disordered or not, can be categorized into three classes: \sigma_{N}^{2}(R)\sim R^{d-1} for \alpha>1 (class I); \sigma_{N}^{2}(R)\sim R^{d-1}\ln(R) for \alpha=1 (class II); and \sigma_{N}^{2}(R)\sim R^{d-\alpha} for 0<\alpha<1 (class III) Torquato (2018). Consequently, hyperuniform systems encompass all crystals and quasicrystals Torquato and Stillinger (2003); Torquato (2018). A special subset of class-I hyperuniform systems possess a zero structure factor for a range of wavenumbers around the origin, i.e., S(k)=0 for k<K^{*} (excluding the forward scattering), which are referred as stealthy hyperuniform systems. Stealthy hyperuniform systems include all crystals and certain special disordered systems, which are characterized by a parameter \chi\in(0,0.5) reflecting the fraction of the constrained degrees of freedom in the system Torquato et al. (2015); Zhang et al. (2015a, b, 2017a), see Sec. II for more details. Increasing \chi also leads to an increasing of local order in the system. Although this exotic state of matter continues to be identified in more fields and their unique properties are being further illuminated, the preponderance of previous work has focused on hyperuniform particle configurations, two-phase media and random fields Torquato and Stillinger (2003); Zachary and Torquato (2009b); Torquato (2016, 2018). On the other hand, only a few studies on hyperuniform networks Klatt and Torquato (2014); Salvalaglio et al. (2024) have been carried out. Here, we focus on the “spatial networks” derived from point configurations, i.e., graphs whose nodes are embedded in a space with a metric (e.g., a Euclidean space) Barthélemy (2011); Daqing et al. (2011). In particular, we construct networks using the Voronoi tessellations of point patterns Aurenhammer (1991); Torquato (2002a); Lazar et al. (2022). A Voronoi tessellation in 2D is a partition of the plane by convex polygonal cells which are referred to as Voronoi cells Torquato (2002a). The Voronoi cell associated with a point is defined to be the region of space nearer to this point at than to any other point in the point pattern (see Sec. II.B for details). We convert the tessellation into a network by specifying the vertices of the Voronoi polygons as nodes and the edges of the polygons as edges of the network. We note there are multiple ways of converting a point pattern into a spatial network Yook et al. (2002); Bullmore and Sporns (2009); Farahani et al. (2013); Papadopoulos et al. (2018); Duchemin and De Castro (2023); Penrose (2003), and each was found to have both pros and cons. We choose Voronoi networks because such networks are widely applied in numerous different fields, including biology, meteorology, metallurgy, crystallography, forestry, ecology, archaeology, geology, geography, astrophysics, physics, computer science, and engineering Torquato (2002a). Moreover, previous theoretical studies have established analytical results for such systems that can be used as benchmarks for our current study Zhang et al. (2015a); Zhang and Torquato (2013). We comprehensively analyze the networks constructed from the Voronoi tessellation of the point patterns. First, we perform an analysis of the area distribution of Voronoi cells to recapitulate previously found results regarding the size of holes in the point pattern Zhang et al. (2016, 2017a); Ghosh and Lebowitz (2018); Torquato et al. (2021); Wang and Torquato (2023a). In particular, we calculate the higher-cumulants, including skewness \gamma_{1} and excess kurtosis \gamma_{2} associated with the Voronoi tessellations of large, finite-sized two-dimensional systems containing N\approx 10,000 points built from hyperplane intersection process (HIP) Chiu et al. (2013), Poisson, random sequential addition (RSA) Torquato et al. (2006); Zhang and Torquato (2013), and both non-stealthy Wang and Torquato (2023b, 2024) and stealthy Uche et al. (2004); Batten et al. (2008); Torquato et al. (2015) point processes. The higher order cumulants of each distribution reveal the shape of the cell-area distribution and compare the probability density function to a Gaussian distribution (i.e., \gamma_{1}=0, \gamma_{2}=0). Our analysis reveals that the Poisson and non-stealthy hyperuniform cell-area distributions are Gaussian-like because they possess small, positive skewness and excess kurtosis values (i.e., \gamma_{1}=1.07,~{}0.257 and \gamma_{2}=1.79,~{}0.0217 for the Poisson and non-stealthy hyperuniform distributions respectively). In contrast, the antihyperuniform HIP system has a large positive skewness (\gamma_{1}=3.16) and excess kurtosis (\gamma_{2}=16.2), indicating it is far from Gaussian. The RSA and high-\chi stealthy hyperuniform systems are also non-Gaussian because they have low skewness and negative excess kurtosis (i.e., \gamma_{1}=0.450,~{}0.0492,~{}0.0272 and \gamma_{2}=-0.0383,~{}-0.119,~{}-0.0626 for the RSA, stealthy \chi=0.40, and stealthy \chi=0.49 respectively), yet they possess diametrically opposite non-Gaussian behavior of the HIP systems. Moreover, the low-\chi stealthy hyperuniform systems are not Gaussian-like because they are also very peaked and their right tail decreases faster than a Gaussian curve. However, this is not directly readable from their skewness and excess kurtosis values due to a left tail in their distributions. We note that the Voronoi networks analyzed here are necessarily finite in size, even if relatively large with N\approx 10,000 nodes. It is clear that distributions associated with finite systems will always appear to possess finite support, even if the support becomes infinite (such as a Poisson distribution) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e., N\rightarrow\infty) Zhang et al. (2015a). This is because the probability of observing arbitrarily large holes of the order of the system size is vanishing small. Therefore, in order to correctly ascertain the behaviors of infinite networks, the tail behavior of the simulated finite-sized distributions are analyzed. Systems possessing infinite support in the thermodynamic limit (e.g., Poisson) can be inferred from an exponential or power-law decaying tail in the distributions associated with sufficiently large, yet finite-sized systems. Similarly, one can infer compact support for RSA and all stealthy cases from our finite-sized simulations in the same way consistent with the known theoretical results for these models Zhang and Torquato (2013); Zhang et al. (2015a). To further characterize the Voronoi networks, we compute the Voronoi-area correlation functions C_{00}(r) for the networks Klatt and Torquato (2014). In particular, C_{00}(r) is defined as the correlation between the volume of two Voronoi cells given that the corresponding centers separated by distance r (see Sec. II.B for details). We observe strong anticorrelations in C_{00}(r) (i.e., negative values) for the hyperuniform networks, consistent with previous analysis of the hyperuniform MRJ sphere packings in 3D Klatt and Torquato (2014). On the other hand, the antihyperuniform HIP networks possess a slowly decaying C_{00}(r) with large positive values, indicating large fluctuations of Voronoi cell areas across scales, while the nonhyperuniform Poisson and RSA network possess positive and much faster decaying C_{00}(r). These results indicate that the large-scale area fluctuations in the hyperuniform networks are effectively suppressed by accompanying large Voronoi cells with small cells (and vice versa), in contrast to the nonhyperuniform networks in which the Voronoi cells with different areas do not possess any notable correlations. To summarize, we find the correlation functions C_{00}(r) qualitatively distinguish the antihyperuniform, nonhyperuniform and hyperuniform Voronoi networks considered here. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we provide definitions of hyperuniform as well as the Voronoi-area correlation functions. In Sec. III, we present our results, including the comprehensive Voronoi distribution analysis as well as the correlation function analysis of all seven network systems. In Sec. IV, we provide concluding remarks and discuss future directions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06044v1,Thermal lifetime of breathers,"In this article, we explore the lifetime of localized excitations in nonlinear lattices, called breathers, when a thermalized lattice is perturbed with localized energy delivered to a single site. We develop a method to measure the time it takes for the system to approach equilibrium based on a single scalar quantity, the participation number, and deduce the value corresponding to thermal equilibrium. We observe the time to achieve thermalization as a function of the energy of the excited site. We explore a variety of different physical system models. The result is that the lifetime of breathers increases exponentially with the breather energy for all the systems. These results may provide a method to detect the existence of breathers in real systems.","Discrete breathers (DB) are exact localized vibrations in nonlinear lattices [1, 2, 3, 4]. They are also called Intrinsic Localized Modes (ILM) [5], to distinguish them from the localized Anderson modes due to disorder, an external impurity, a defect, or an interface in a lattice [6, 7]. Usually, discrete breather solutions cannot be obtained in closed analytical form. However, they can be constructed numerically with arbitrary machine precision, and, in that case, they are called exact breathers [8, 9, 10, 11]. Numerical simulations of the evolution of exact solutions can continue forever at zero temperature. This is because exact DB solutions are usually exponentially localized on an infinitely large lattice, such that the energy of these solutions is finite, and their average energy density is exactly zero. However, introducing the concept of temperature or simply finite energy density usually implies a finite lifetime for any coherent excitations, which is an important feature to measure or estimate when studying breathers in physical systems. The existence and lifetime of breathers can be of importance in environments where they will be created in large quantities, as fusion tokamak reactors [12], where the impact of neutrons and alpha particles will produce many of them. Their slow relaxation may prevent the evacuation of heat at the desired rate with undesirable consequences. The effect could be even more remarkable if breathers can bind to an electric charge in the materials used [13]. An early attempt to quantify the lifetimes of DBs on a nonzero thermal background was reported in [14], where simulations were performed to detect long-lasting local fluctuations and their lifetimes as a function of the energy density of the background. The fluctuation lifetime grew with the energy density, seemingly in an exponentially fast way. This approach was clearly not capable of measuring the lifetimes of strongly excited breathers due to computational limitations. Also, the energies of the longest-lasting local fluctuations depended on the computational time - the longer the time, the more probable a larger fluctuation becomes. A more recent study by Iubini et al [15] planted local breather excitations into a discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation (DNLS). They were motivated by the fact that the microcanonical DNLS dynamics features thermal states with Gibbs statistics but also non-Gibbs ones with nonergodic features [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] due to the presence of an additional (to the already existing energy) integral of motion related to the total norm or a classical analog of the total number of particles of quantum many-body systems. The study monitored the local norm at the original site of the breather excitation, introduced an ad hoc threshold to its value at which the breather was assumed to be destroyed, and measured the time to reach that threshold. The study found approximate exponential dependence of the breather’s lifetime on its norm. Finally, around the same time, Danieli et al [21] introduced a method to define and measure the lifetime of the fluctuation of any observable using the ergodic hypothesis. They applied this method successfully to measure the lifetime of long wavelength mode excitations in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) systems to address the FPUT paradox of lifetimes of anomalous initial states and quenches, but also to address the statistics of lifetime fluctuations at thermal equilibrium. We are going to use this method below. In this article, we address the issue of breather lifetimes by studying systems that are more general than the DNLS one, which in general lack nontrivial second integrals of motion, and which are supposed to show proper Gibbs statistics and ergodicity for any choice of the relevant energy density. Instead of an ad hoc threshold value for local energy, we use the participation number P as an observable and measure the inhomogeneity of energy density distribution in the system. At thermal equilibrium, the participation number P on any ergodic trajectory is forced to fluctuate around its temporal and thus phase space average endlessly. We compute the thermal average of P and measure the time interval it takes for a breather excitation on top of a thermal background to decrease the participation number down to its thermal average for the first time. We find strong exponential dependence of the thermalization time as a function of the breather excitation energy by studying four different, fairly generic systems, consisting of units described by a coordinate u_{n}, which can be a spacial coordinate or a different magnitude, and its momentum p_{n}. For simplicity, we will often refer to each unit as an oscillator or particle. Moreover, we find that the exponential dependence is strongly influenced by the temperature, i.e. energy density, of the system background. The first three systems represent a lattice of particles that experience an on-site potential V(u_{n}), where u_{n} is the coordinate of the n^{th} particle, and the particles are coupled with their nearest neighbors through an interaction potential U(u_{n+1}-u_{n}). The on-site potential represents an external field, or, if the described system is a subsystem of a larger system, the interaction with the rest of the system. The first two systems have a quartic on-site potential and harmonic coupling, that is: H=\sum_{n}\frac{1}{2}p_{n}^{2}+V(u_{n})+U(u_{n+1}-u_{n})=\sum_{n}\frac{% \displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle 2}p_{n}^{2}+\omega_{0}^{2}\left(\frac{u_{n}^{2}% }{2}+s\frac{u_{n}^{4}}{4}\right)+\kappa\frac{\displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle 2}% (u_{n+1}-u_{n})^{2}\,, (1) where the nonlinearity parameter s can be +1 or -1. If s is positive, an isolated particle will have a frequency that increases with the oscillation amplitude, or, as it is commonly called, a hard potential. This system, labeled QH, will be the first system studied, followed by the opposite case, that is, the quartic soft potential (QS) with s=-1, which becomes the second system. The third, more realistic system, has a Frenkel-Kontorova on-site potential [22, 23], that is, a sinusoidal function, which models the periodicity of the lattice. The coupling potential is the Lennard-Jones potential, which represents a realistic interaction between atoms, that repel very strongly when they get close and gradually vanishes when they move apart [24, 25, 26]. We will denote it as FKLJ. The fourth system will have no on-site potential, but a sinusoidal type coupling, and represents a Josephson junction network [27, 28]. As the coordinate describing an oscillator is an angle, it is also called a rotor, and the system can also represent a chain of coupled pendula [27] that can rotate. We will often refer to this analog as it is easier to understand. We will denote this system as JJN. In this study, the first step is to obtain information about the discrete breather energies and characteristics. In the appendices, we describe the method to obtain exact breathers from the anticontinuous limit and their properties in the four different systems. The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2, we introduce the participation number P, deduce its value at thermal equilibrium, and demonstrate that numerical simulations are coherent with this interpretation. Sec. 3 describes the creation of localized breather energy over a thermalized system and the system’s time evolution towards thermal equilibrium. The following Section 4 is dedicated to the computation of breathers’ lifetime and analysis of differences in numerical results in the systems under study. The different systems are analyzed in four subsections: the quartic hard and soft potentials in Sec. 4.1 and Sec. 4.2, respectively, the Frenkel-Kontorova Lennard-Jones system in Sec. 4.3 and the model for Josephson junction arrays in Sec. 4.4. The paper concludes with the conclusions, acknowledgments, funding, and a short reference to the computational means that have been used. The appendices include analytical and computational details about discrete breathers in the four different systems. Figure 1: (Left:) System QH with \omega_{0}=1 and \kappa=0.05: Evolution of the participation number P for the mean thermal energy h=0.02 with the hard quartic potential and with number of particles N=64. We can see that the time-averaged participation number \langle P\rangle is slightly above N/2. (Right:) System QS: Identical representation for the soft potential with the same parameters. In both cases, generally speaking, \langle P\rangle is 1-2 particles above N/2, but for some realizations, it can also be below depending on the length of the observation time window."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07174v1,"Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings","We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry \mathcal{T}. Different from the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.","In the past few decades, tremendous progress has been made in the study of zero-temperature topological phases[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], which are ground states of local Hamiltonians in closed quantum systems. The huge success of classifying and characterizing pure quantum states and phase transitions between them has motivated recent investigations into the topological properties of mixed states in open quantum systems[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], which has become a flourishing research area in the past few years. In zero-temperature topological phases, the interplay of symmetry and topology in the space of gapped local Hamiltonians gives rise to a rich structure of symmetry protected topological phases[27, 28, 29, 7] and symmetry enriched topological orders[30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. In the case of open quantum systems, it turns out that symmetries in mixed states have a more complicated structure than in pure states, as they can be grouped into weak and strong symmetries[13, 14, 22, 20]. While strong symmetries in mixed states analogous to symmetries in pure states, implying the conservation of symmetry quantum numbers in the whole ensemble of the mixed state, weak symmetries in mixed states has no counterparts in pure states. It has been demonstrated that the presence of both strong and weak symmetries can lead to new mixed state phenomena, which are believed to not exist in pure states[14, 16, 22, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25]. Many recent efforts have been devoted to the theoretical classification of mixed states with symmetries and associated phase transitions[13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Since a large amount of knowledge has been accumulated in the past few decades on many-body pure state phenomena, on how to realize them and to detect them in condensed matters, one natural question is, is it possible to realize various mixed state phenomena with strong and weak symmetries in a pure state of condensed matters? In this work, we provide a positive answer to this question, by introducing a bilayer construction as a specific purification of a mixed state. The bilayer construction makes use of a one-to-one correspondence between a mixed state (in its diagonal basis) \displaystyle\rho=\sum_{j,k}\rho_{j,k}|e_{j}\rangle\langle e_{k}|,~{}~{}~{}% \rho=\rho^{\dagger}\geq 0,~{}\text{Tr}~{}\rho=1. (1) where \{|e_{k}\rangle\} is a complete orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space \mathcal{H}, and a “non-negative”[16] pure state in a bilayer construction consisting of “system layer” A and “environment layer” B with a doubled Hilbert space \mathcal{H}_{A}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{B}: \displaystyle|\psi\rangle=\sum_{j,k}\big{(}\sqrt{\rho}\big{)}_{j,k}|e_{j},A% \rangle\otimes|e_{k},B\rangle (2) constrained by an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry \mathcal{T}: \displaystyle\mathcal{T}|e_{k},A\rangle=|e_{k},B\rangle,~{}~{}\mathcal{T}|e_{k% },B\rangle=|e_{k},A\rangle,~{}~{}\forall~{}k. (3) Note that the wavefunction \psi_{j,k} in the orthonormal basis |e_{j},A\rangle\otimes|e_{k},B\rangle must be non-negative (\psi=\sqrt{\rho}\geq 0 ) in order for the one-to-one correspondence between pure state |\psi\rangle and mixed state \rho. As a specific \mathcal{T}-preserving purification scheme for mixed state \rho, the above bilayer state |\psi\rangle is different from the Choi state \displaystyle|\psi_{\text{Choi}}\rangle=\sum_{j,k}\rho_{j,k}|e_{j},A\rangle% \otimes|e_{k},B\rangle from Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism between operator \rho and state |\psi_{\text{Choi}}\rangle. Although the bilayer state |\psi\rangle and Choi state |\psi_{\text{Choi}}\rangle are similar in terms of symmetry (including strong, weak and \mathcal{T} symmetries as we will clarify in section III.1) and non-negativity, the bilayer purification |\psi\rangle have two unique advantages over the Choi state: (1) Since mixed state \rho is nothing but the reduced density matrix of layer A in bilayer pure state |\psi\rangle \displaystyle\rho_{A}=\text{Tr}~{}_{B}\big{(}|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\big{)}] (4) any physical property of mixed state \rho can be realized and experimentally detected as a property of layer A in the bilayer pure state |\psi\rangle. (2) The anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry \mathcal{T}, crucial for the one-to-one correspondence between mixed state \rho and bilayer pure state |\psi\rangle (as we will clarify in section II), can be realized as the combination of time-reversal and layer-exchange mirror reflection operations. Experimentally, such a symmetry can be generally implemented in two-dimensional (2D) bilayer materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry, even in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. This provides a route to realize and to observe 2D mixed state phenomena as pure state phenomena in 2D quantum materials. In this work, we lay out the framework of bilayer construction for mixed states with strong and weak symmetries, and apply the framework to understand mixed state phenomena such as strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking[22, 20, 35] and decoherence of topological orders by local errors[36, 17, 18, 19, 37, 38, 39]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After introducing the bilayer construction for mixed state in section II, we discuss how to describe strong and weak symmetries in the bilayer construction in section III.1, and derive the criteria (see Table 1) for spontaneous and explicit symmetry breakings in mixed states using the correspondence to symmetry breakings in bilayer pure state in section III.2. Our criteria summarized in Table 1 is equivalent to those proposed by Ref.[22] in terms of fidelity correlator[40, 41]. We also use the bilayer framework to discuss the failure of Renyi-2 correlator[22, 20] in describing strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in section III.3. Next, we investigate two examples of SWSSB in mixed states, which are realized as usual spontaneous symmetry breakings (SSBs) in the bilayer construction: section IV.1 studies SWSSB for discrete Z_{2} symmetry in a two-leg Ising ladder, whose critical scalings of vairous correlators are studied in section IV.1.2; section IV.2 studies SWSSB for continuous U(1) symmetry as the formation of interlayer superconductivity in the bilayer construction. In section V we further discuss various mixed state phenomena can be realized in the bilayer construction: in section V.1 we show the decoherence of topological orders by local quantum channels[36, 17, 18, 19, 37, 38, 39] can be realized as quantum quench dynamics[42] of the bialyer pure state, and in section V.2 we show how symmetry protected topological mixed states and mixed state topologial orders can be constructed from their pure state counterparts in the bilayer construction. Finally we conclude in section VI with a summary and outlook for future directions."

Using dynamical renormalisation group in spatial dimension d=1, we demonstrate that coupled stochastic complex Ginsburg-Landau equations exhibit an emergent stationary distribution, enforcing KPZ dynamical exponent z=3/2 and static roughness exponent \chi=1/2 for both components. By tuning intercomponent interactions, the system can access other regimes, including a fragmented condensate regime from a dynamical instability in the phase fluctuations, as well as a spacetime vortex regime driven by the non-linear terms in the coupled KPZ equations. In stable regimes, we show that in specific submanifolds relevant to polaritons, the RG fixed point offers a transformation to decoupled KPZ equations.

This model can be derived from Keldysh field theory in the semiclassical approximation assuming a Markovian coupling to the decay and pumping bath modes. All parameters are real and \mu_{d},\,u_{d},\,u_{c}>0 for a stable condensed solution, and \zeta_{i} is a Gaussian complex white noise with diagonal correlations \langle\zeta^{*}_{i}(x,t)\zeta_{j}(x^{\prime},t)\rangle=(\gamma_{p}+\gamma_{l}% )\delta_{ij}\delta(x-x^{\prime})\delta(t-t^{\prime}). The kinetic coefficient is k_{c}=1/2m_{LP} where m_{LP} is the effective polariton mass and k_{d} is a diffusion constant which acts to suppress higher momentum modes. The system is driven-dissipative requiring incoherent external pumping from a laser, and is in contact with an excitonic decay bath. This gives rise to an effective gain \mu_{d}=(\gamma_{p}-\gamma_{l})/2 from the incoherent pump minus the single particle losses which is positive in the U(1) spontaneously symmetry broken (SSB) condensate phase. The two particle losses u_{d},\,v_{d}>0 act as gain saturation terms. This model assumes local interactions which is valid provided we ignore the spatial extent of the excitons. For polaritons, the intercomponent, v_{c}, and intracomponent, u_{c}, interactions are attractive and repulsive respectively. Typically, experimental cross-spin scattering rates are 5-10\% of the intraparticle scattering rate implying v_{c}\approx-0.1u_{c} [52, 53]. Equilibrium two-component condensates support a miscible-immiscible transition when the real intercomponent interactions exceed the intracomponent interactions v_{c}^{2}>u_{c}^{2} [54, 55, 56, 57] where modulation instabilities cause condensate fragmentation. Non-equilibrium condensates support a similar phase separation [14, 43] but differ from their equilibrium counterparts in that the linearised SCGLE (1) no longer has four gapless sound modes in its Bogoliubov spectrum but instead has two gapped density modes and two gapless diffusive phase modes. There are two conditions of different physical origin which can drive a miscible transition shown in FIG. 1(i-ii): (a) the dissipative intercomponent interaction exceeds the intracomponent interactions v_{d}>u_{d}, resulting in the gapped modes becoming dynamically unstable, and (b) when the rescaled intercomponent interaction \tilde{v}_{c}=v_{c}/u_{c} does not satisfy -1-\mathcal{R}(k)\mathcal{R}(u)(1+\tilde{v}_{d})<\tilde{v}_{c}<1+\mathcal{R}(k% )\mathcal{R}(u)(1-\tilde{v}_{d}) (2) with \mathcal{R}(k)=k_{d}/k_{c}, resulting in the gapless modes becoming dynamically unstable. Within the \tilde{v}_{d}=v_{d}/u_{d}<1 region, there exist two sub-cases for the miscible transition depending on whether the intercomponent interaction v_{c} is attractive or repulsive. For repulsive intercomponent interactions v_{c}>0, tuning (\tilde{v}_{c},\tilde{v}_{d}) outside of the immiscible boundary Eq. (2), gives rise to spatially localised single component regions. For these parameters which map to Quadrants II and III in FIG. 1(i-iii), the low-energy sector is described by single component KPZ if density fluctuations are sufficiently irrelevant [51]. If the interaction is attractive \tilde{v}_{c}<0, as shown for the density plot for the simulation in Quadrant III in FIG. 1(ii), there is no obvious fragmentation. However, the density fluctuations are still large and cannot be adiabatically eliminated, making the KPZ mapping inappropriate. The theory is invariant under U(1)\times U(1) symmetry with independent \psi_{i}\mapsto e^{i\theta_{i}}\psi_{i}. When \mu_{d}>0, each U(1) undergoes SSB. The ground state topology dictates that the effective theory is parameterised using the density-phase representation where \theta_{i} parameterise the gapless fluctuations. In the adiabatic approximation around the mean field |\psi_{0,i}|^{2}=\rho_{i}={\mu_{d}}/{(u_{d}+v_{d})}=-{\mu_{c}}/{(u_{c}+v_{c})}, gapped fluctuations can be integrated out [58] giving multicomponent KPZ equations for \mathbb{R}^{2}-fields (\theta^{\alpha}(x,t))_{\alpha=1}^{2} \displaystyle\partial_{t}\theta^{\alpha}=D_{\alpha\beta}\partial_{x}^{2}\theta% ^{\beta}+\dfrac{1}{2}\Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma}(\partial_{x}\theta^{\beta})% (\partial_{x}\theta^{\gamma})+\zeta^{\alpha} (3) driven by a real Gaussian additive white noise (\zeta^{\alpha})_{\alpha=1}^{2} with symmetric covariance \langle\zeta^{\alpha}(x,t)\zeta^{\beta}(x^{\prime},t^{\prime})\rangle=2\Delta^% {\alpha\beta}\delta(x-x^{\prime})\delta(t-t^{\prime}). Strictly, the phase itself is a compact variable, supporting non-trivial topological excitations such as spacetime vortices (STV) which modify the scaling. For the single-component case in the low-noise regime, compactness does not affect KPZ scaling for significant time windows [59]. The parameters from the SCGLE mapping are D_{11}=k_{c}\mathcal{C}_{1}(u_{d}u_{c}-v_{c}v_{d})+k_{d},\,D_{12}=k_{c}% \mathcal{C}_{1}(v_{c}u_{d}-u_{c}v_{d}),\,\Gamma^{1}_{11}=-2k_{c}+2k_{d}% \mathcal{C}_{1}\left(u_{c}u_{d}-v_{c}v_{d}\right),\,\Gamma^{1}_{22}=2k_{d}% \mathcal{C}_{1}(v_{c}u_{d}-u_{c}v_{d}),\,\Gamma^{1}_{12}=0, where \mathcal{C}_{1}=(u_{d}^{2}-v_{d}^{2})^{-1}. The remaining parameters can be inferred from \mathbb{Z}_{2} symmetry. Coupling in the real density channel between the condensates v_{c} produces non-trivial couplings in the off-diagonals of the diffusion and noise matrices. The non-linearity vanishes at the equilibrium condition when k_{d}/k_{c}=v_{d}/v_{c}=u_{d}/u_{c} define collinear rays in the complex plane [60]. A point to stress is that off-diagonal interaction vertices \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma} are only generated if k_{d}\neq 0. The \Delta^{\alpha\beta} have non-trivial cross-components resulting in correlated white noise driving the two phase modes and are presented in the supplemental materials Ref. [61]. Imposing that the diffusion matrix D is positive definite is equivalent to the dynamical stability condition in Eq. (2). In the spirit of Landau, the effective theory in the multicomponent regimes should be described by Eq. (3) with \mathbb{Z}_{2} symmetry \theta^{1}\leftrightarrow\theta^{2} resulting in the degenerate structure of the \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma} tensors \Gamma^{1}=\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}\Gamma^{1}_{11}&\Gamma^{1}_{12}\\ \Gamma^{1}_{12}&\Gamma^{1}_{22}\end{array}\right),\hskip 5.69054pt\Gamma^{2}=% \left(\begin{array}[]{cc}\Gamma^{1}_{22}&\Gamma^{1}_{12}\\ \Gamma^{1}_{12}&\Gamma^{1}_{11}\end{array}\right) (4) and D=D^{T}=D^{\tau}, \Delta=\Delta^{T}=\Delta^{\tau} where \tau denotes the off-diagonal transpose. It is insightful to transform Eq. (3) to its normal modes where the rotated fields, denoted by tildes, transform as \tilde{\theta}^{1}={(\theta^{1}+\theta^{2})}/{\sqrt{2}}, \tilde{\theta}^{2}={(\theta^{1}-\theta^{2})}/{\sqrt{2}}. These coordinates capture the joint phase and phase difference between the condensates. The linear equations decouple with diffusion matrices \tilde{D}_{11}=D_{11}+D_{12} and \tilde{D}_{22}=D_{11}-D_{12}. The noise covariance inherits the diagonal structure \langle\tilde{\zeta}^{\alpha}(x,t)\tilde{\zeta}^{\beta}(x^{\prime},t^{\prime})% \rangle=\delta^{\alpha\beta}(\Delta_{11}\pm\Delta_{12})\delta(x-x^{\prime})% \delta(t-t^{\prime}) where +,\,- are for (1,1) and (2,2) components respectively. Interaction vertices are rank-(1,2) tensors, transforming non-trivially \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}=(\Gamma^{1}_{11}+2\Gamma^{1}_{12}+\Gamma^{1}_{22})/% \sqrt{2}, \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}=(\Gamma^{1}_{11}-2\Gamma^{1}_{12}+\Gamma^{1}_{22})/% \sqrt{2}, \tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12}=(\Gamma^{1}_{11}-\Gamma^{1}_{22})/\sqrt{2} while all other non-linear terms vanish. In these coordinates, the \mathbb{Z}_{2}-theory maps onto \displaystyle\partial_{t}\tilde{\theta}^{1} \displaystyle=\tilde{D}_{11}\partial_{x}^{2}\tilde{\theta}^{1}+\dfrac{1}{2}% \left(\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}(\partial_{x}\tilde{\theta}^{1})^{2}+\tilde{% \Gamma}^{1}_{22}(\partial_{x}\tilde{\theta}^{2})^{2}\right)+\tilde{\zeta}_{1} (5) \displaystyle\partial_{t}\tilde{\theta}^{2} \displaystyle=\tilde{D}_{22}\partial_{x}^{2}\tilde{\theta}^{2}+\tilde{\Gamma}^% {2}_{12}(\partial_{x}\tilde{\theta}^{1})(\partial_{x}\tilde{\theta}^{2})+% \tilde{\zeta_{2}} previously studied by Ertaş and Kardar in dynamic roughening of directed lines [16]. For decoupled \mathbb{Z}_{2} symmetric KPZ equations with v_{c}=v_{d}=0, the bare parameters transform to \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}=\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}=\tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12} which corresponds to the point (1,1) in FIG. 1(iii). Tuning the intercomponent interactions allows you to move away from the decoupled point into other quadrants, each representing distinct physical behaviours. At large times, the dynamics is dominated by the non-linearity and stability analysis shows that if \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22} and \tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12} do not have the same sign, there is an instability. This instability arises from the non-hyperbolicity of the linearised equations and non-linear dominated dynamics in Quadrants II and IV in FIG. 1. Tuning (\tilde{v}_{c},\tilde{v}_{d}), we can access this instability in Quadrant IV from the SCGLE by choosing bare parameters which satisfy Eq. (2) but violate conditions \displaystyle-1+\dfrac{\mathcal{R}(u)}{\mathcal{R}(k)}(1+\tilde{v}_{d}) \displaystyle<\tilde{v}_{c}<1-\dfrac{\mathcal{R}(u)}{\mathcal{R}(k)}(1-\tilde{% v}_{d}) (6a) \displaystyle 1-\dfrac{\mathcal{R}(u)}{\mathcal{R}(k)}(1-\tilde{v}_{d}) \displaystyle<\tilde{v}_{c}<-1+\dfrac{\mathcal{R}(u)}{\mathcal{R}(k)}(1+\tilde% {v}_{d}) (6b) for \mathcal{R}(u)<\mathcal{R}(k) and for \mathcal{R}(u)>\mathcal{R}(k) respectively. For clarity, we draw attention to the significance of this quadrant in the context of the original \mathbb{Z}_{2} parameters. In FIG. 1(iii), Quadrant IV is achieved when both X = \tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12}/\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}<0 and Y=(\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}\tilde{\Delta}_{22}\tilde{D}_{11})/(\tilde{\Gamma}^{% 1}_{11}\tilde{\Delta}_{11}\tilde{D}_{22})>0. In the specific case of the SCGLE mapping, \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}=\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11} and \tilde{\Delta}_{11},\tilde{\Delta}_{22}>0 are always satisfied, leading to the equivalence of conditions Y>0 and Eq. (2), both of which ensure the positive definiteness of the diffusion constants \tilde{D}_{11},\,\tilde{D}_{22}>0. Therefore, Quadrant IV emerges by tuning the effective KPZ interactions, \tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12}\sim(\Gamma^{1}_{11}-\Gamma^{1}_{22}) and \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}\sim(\Gamma^{1}_{11}+\Gamma^{1}_{22}), to have different signs. Consequently, in the \mathbb{Z}_{2} coordinates, this occurs when the KPZ intercomponent interaction between the phase modes is larger than the KPZ intracomponent interaction |\Gamma^{1}_{22}|>|\Gamma^{1}_{11}|. In this quadrant, the non-hyperbolicity gives rise to large phase differences between nearest-neighbour sites. At the physical level, this triggers the proliferation of STVs, non-trivial windings in the phase due to compactness. The vortex turbulent regime dramatically modifies the scaling, resulting in growth exponent \beta=1/2 and dynamical exponent z=1 as shown in FIG. 2. An STV phase has been observed in the single component case in the large noise regime [59], however this phase transition originates from tuning the intercomponent interaction \tilde{v}_{c}. More detail on the analysis of the STV phase can be found in the supplemental material Ref. [61]. Figure 2: SCGLE simulations with parameters v_{d}=0, k_{d}=u_{d}=\mu_{d}=1 and k_{c}=3,\;u_{c}=1.5 and tuning \tilde{v}_{c} from 0 to -1.2. (i-ii) The autocorrelation \Delta(t_{1}-t_{2}) of the unwound phase for \tilde{\theta}_{1} and \tilde{\theta}_{2} respectively showing a crossover to the STV regime when tuning \tilde{v}_{c} between 0 to -1.2 plotted from bottom to top. (iii) Probability of a vortex in the spacetime lattice for unrotated \theta_{1}, \theta_{2} as a function of attractive \tilde{v}_{c}. Inset shows the line traced out in the (X,Y) plane in FIG. 1(iii) from the decoupled point (1,1) in Quadrant I (KPZ) in blue to Quadrant IV (STV) in red. (iv) Vortex charge distribution with +1 (red) and -1 (blue) on a section of the spacetime lattice for \tilde{v}_{c}=-1.2 in the STV dominated Quadrant IV. The RG flows are best interpreted in the normal mode basis in adimensionalised coordinates from Eq. (5), closing under the \mathbb{R}^{4}-parameter space: T=\tilde{D}_{22}/\tilde{D}_{11}, X=\tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12}/\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}, Y=(\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}\tilde{\Delta}_{22}\tilde{D}_{11})/(\tilde{\Gamma}^{% 1}_{11}\tilde{\Delta}_{11}\tilde{D}_{22}), Z=(\tilde{\Delta}_{11}(\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22})^{2})/(4\Lambda\tilde{D}_{11}^{% 3}) where \Lambda is the UV cutoff regularising the effective theory. The cutoff has a natural origin in exciton-polariton systems since excitons typically have a Bohr radius up to 100\text{\AA} giving k_{max}=h/100\text{\AA}. The noise ratio W=\tilde{\Delta}_{22}/\tilde{\Delta}_{11} is required to be positive definite to retain its connection to probability. The RG flow equations are autonomous ODEs describing how the parameters change as we iteratively integrate out high momentum modes. The boundary condition for the flows is specified at \ell=0 where the parameters assume their initial bare values. The projected flows of X and Y are shown in FIG. 1(iii). The parameters X,\,Y do not change sign under RG, implying that the flows do not cross between quadrants. To understand the phase dynamics, we can concentrate on Quadrants I and IV since the other quadrants present a physical instability from Eq. (2). The RG suggests that the scaling should be Edwards-Wilkinson z=2 for the \tilde{\theta}_{2} mode and KPZ z=3/2 for \tilde{\theta}_{1} in Quadrant IV, however we must discount it based on the instability from conditions (6a) and (6b). Physically, this quadrant as previously discussed corresponds to a disordered STV phase with z=1 for both modes. At this point, we focus on the analysis of the coupled SCGLE in Quadrant I."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06973v1,"The orientational structure of a model patchy particle fluid: simulations, integral equations, density functional theory and machine learning","We investigate the orientational properties of a homogeneous and inhomogeneous tetrahedral 4-patch fluid (Kern–Frenkel model). Using integral equations, either (i) HNC or (ii) a modified HNC scheme with simulation input, the full orientational dependence of pair and direct correlation functions is determined. Density functionals for the inhomogeneous problem are constructed via two different methods. The first, molecular density functional theory, utilizes the full direct correlation function and an isotropic hard-sphere bridge functional. The second method, a machine learning approach, uses a decomposition of the functional into an isotropic reference part and a mean-field orientational part, where both parts are improved by machine learning techniques. Comparison to simulation data at hard walls and around hard tracers show a similar performance of the two functionals. Machine learning strategies are discussed to eliminate residual differences, with the goal of obtaining machine-learning enhanced functionals for the general anisotropic fluid.","Classical fluids made of particles with strong directional bonding (associating fluids) are an important class of systems relevant for the understanding of polymerization, self-assembly in molecular and colloidal systems and phase behavior of proteins. A simple model system for associating fluids are spherical patchy particles made of hard spheres with N_{\mathrm{p}} localized spots (patches) on their surface, which lead to strong attraction when they overlap. Specifically, patchy particles with N_{\mathrm{p}}=4 patches are interesting model systems for tetrahedrally coordinating particles and thus the system has also some relevance to molecular fluids such as water [1]. Patchy particles are becoming increasingly popular as colloidal models to explain certain features of protein solutions. An example is the phase and adsorption behavior of bovine serum albumine (BSA) in solutions with trivalent cations [2, 3, 4]. In these systems, the proteins bind at specific sites with the cations acting as a bridge, and can be described as ion-activated patchy particles. Regarding bulk thermodynamic behaviour we note that the equation of state and consequently the phase diagram of these patchy particles can be understood very well using a statistical theory of bonding developed by Wertheim, namely first order thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT1), which only needs the pair correlations in a reference hard sphere system [5]. Gas–liquid binodals from TPT1 and simulations agree on a semiquantitative level [6, 7, 8]. The dynamic properties of the fluid phase (relaxation) are strongly different from the ones in simple fluids, due to the formation of transient networks and have been mainly studied by simulations addressing the time-dependent bonding statistics [9]. Although patchy particles (if besides the attractive spots no other isotropic attractions are assumed) are in some sense “maximally anisotropic” in their attractions, the intrinsic orientational order in the equilibrium fluid has not been investigated very much in the past. As described, Wertheim’s TPT1 does not need it and simulations focus on the bonding statistics which is easier to access but is of course a consequence of the orientational order. Explicit account for orientational structure appears to be necessary when discussing solvation. Solvated objects such as solute particles or surfaces [10] may impose very strong directional constraints. Theoretical methods for the description of the orientational structure in anisotropic fluids can be roughly classified into integral equations (IE) and classical density functional theory (DFT) approaches. The theoretical background for IE’s has been worked out in the 1970’s [11, 12], mostly with the aim of describing molecular fluids. Applications to realistic associated fluids such as water dates from the late 1990s [13, 14]. Such applications to patchy fluids have not been undertaken to the best of our knowledge. For patchy particles, an alternative IE approach is the “multidensity” formalism which considers orientationally averaged correlations but resolves them with regard to the binding state (i.e. number of bonds) of the particle, see Ref. [15] and references therein. Classical DFT methods for patchy particles specifically have focused on functionals of the orientationally averaged density, taking into account the orientational association behavior in an averaged manner, based on Wertheim’s association theory [16, 10]. Recent work [17] has shown that at hard walls, a 4-patch Kern–Frenkel fluid shows strong orientational correlations close to hard walls, which cannot be captured by orientationally averaged DFT, for a similar finding see also Ref. [18]. Therefore, resolving the orientational dependence in the density profile appears to be necessary to correctly account for solvation properties of patchy particles. RPA-like functionals (which are second-order in the density) do not work well for patchy particles [17]. An alternative is to use Taylor-expanded functionals around a reference bulk fluid, which in their second-order term need the full orientation-resolved direct (pair) correlation function as input (which must be provided by an IE approach). Higher-order terms (“bridge functional”) may be approximated by the corresponding bridge functional of an isotropic system. In the past years, this approach has been developed and applied successfully for aqueous systems (“molecular DFT” [19, 20, 21, 22]) but the methodology can also be transferred to patchy particles. In this work, the orientational correlations of a model 4-patch fluid are investigated for the bulk and close to a hard wall. For the bulk pair correlations and the density profile at a hard wall, Monte Carlo simulation data are obtained as a reference. Direct correlation functions (DCFs) cannot be simulated directly but are obtained via an IE scheme developed in Ref. [23]. These DCFs are input for the molecular DFT approach which is then applied to the solvation problem of hard walls and hard solutes. Results are compared to an improved approach along the lines of Ref. [17], where the functional is split into an orientationally averaged and a mean-field part taking into account the orientational correlations. In Ref. [17], the kernel of the mean field part was determined using machine learning (ML) methods and the reference part was the fundamental measure theory (FMT)–based “Stopper–Wu” functional of Ref. [10]. Here, the FMT weight functions in the reference functional are improved by ML methods. Overall, we find rather good agreement of both DFT’s with the hard wall simulation data, with “molecular DFT” performing better (and in excellent agreement with simulations) for the orientational correlations, and ML-improved “Stopper–Wu” DFT performing slightly better for the orientationally averaged density profile. The comparison between the two DFT’s offers also some insight into the orientational expansion of the direct correlation function. The paper is structured as follows: Sec. II defines the model (a symmetric 4-patch Kern–Frenkel model), introduces orientational expansions for density profile and pair correlation functions tailored to the symmetries of the model and briefly describes the simulations. In Sec. III, the IE methods are introduced and results for pair correlation and bridge functions in the supercritical region are discussed. Sec. IV discusses two approaches for the construction of an orientation–resolved density functional for the general inhomogeneous problem. The first (molecular DFT), is based on a functional Taylor expansion and requires as input the fully orientation-resolved direct correlation function. The second approach employs a machine-learned reference functional depending on the angular–averaged density and an orientation-dependent remainder parameterized in mean–field form. The density functionals are applied to hard wall inhomogeneities. Finally, Sec. V summarizes and concludes the work."

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06794v1,Emergence of steady quantum transport in a superconducting processor,"Non-equilibrium quantum transport is crucial to technological advances ranging from nanoelectronics to thermal management. In essence, it deals with the coherent transfer of energy and (quasi-)particles through quantum channels between thermodynamic baths. A complete understanding of quantum transport thus requires the ability to simulate and probe macroscopic and microscopic physics on equal footing. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate the emergence of non-equilibrium steady quantum transport by emulating the baths with qubit ladders and realising steady particle currents between the baths. We experimentally show that the currents are independent of the microscopic details of bath initialisation, and their temporal fluctuations decrease rapidly with the size of the baths, emulating those predicted by thermodynamic baths. The above characteristics are experimental evidence of pure-state statistical mechanics and prethermalisation in non-equilibrium many-body quantum systems. Furthermore, by utilising precise controls and measurements with single-site resolution, we demonstrate the capability to tune steady currents by manipulating the macroscopic properties of the baths, including filling and spectral properties. Our investigation paves the way for a new generation of experimental exploration of non-equilibrium quantum transport in strongly correlated quantum matter.","I Main Recent advances in quantum thermodynamics and nano-scale devices have shown the increasing importance of quantum transport. However, despite its widespread interest and technological significance, a complete knowledge of the microscopic mechanisms that lead to the emergence of steady quantum transport remains elusive. The main obstacle resides in the presence of diverse scales: the microscopic motion of the individual particles being transported, and the statistical behaviour of particles in the thermodynamic baths. Although new insights into the quantum origin of thermodynamic equilibrium have been given by the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis [1, 2, 3] and typicality [4, 5], these approaches are challenged in the investigation of steady quantum transport due to the presence of transport channels. This motivates the development of new theoretical, numerical, and experimental frameworks that can capture multiscale non-equilibrium physics. Figure 1: Schematics of setup and measurement of site-resolved dynamics. a, Schematic of the device where qubits are depicted as circles with connecting lines representing nearest-neighbour tunable couplings. 31 functional qubits used in the experiment are coloured in cyan. b, Mapping to the particle-transport model which comprises two non-integrable baths connected by a weak link between sites 18 and 20. c, Measured dynamics of the site-resolved particle occupations. Shown are the simultaneously measured excited-state probabilities of individual qubits in both baths (see colorbars on the far right) at a few selected time spots during the dynamics. A promising direction is to use quantum simulators such as ultracold atoms [6, 7, 8], trapped ions [9], and superconducting qubits [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Quantum simulators have the potential to surpass classical computers in investigating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can naturally handle the exponential complexity inherent in these systems [15, 16, 17, 18]. However, the study of non-equilibrium transport requires additional efforts on these experimental platforms due to the presence of baths. Firstly, the description of the bath state often relies on fictitious statistical ensembles, instead of experimentally realistic pure states. These ensembles are represented with complex mixed states that are impossible to generate strictly through unitary evolution of a pure state [19]. Secondly, engineering a configurable and scalable bath to have desired macroscopic properties and spectral profiles is still challenging with either analogue or digital quantum simulators [20, 21, 19]. Resolving these issues would significantly enhance our capabilities in simulating and understanding complex non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. In this article, we demonstrate the emergence of steady quantum transport from a single pure initial state in a superconducting processor. By preparing a population difference between the baths, we observe a generation of inter-bath particle current, the main signature of non-equilibrium transport. Specifically, we show that the currents obtained are typical, as they do not depend on the microscopic dynamics of the baths, but only on their conserved quantities. Moreover, these currents are steady, manifested by a significant decrease in their temporal fluctuations as the system size increases. We emphasise that 31 qubits are sufficient to capture the above observations, implying a fast transition to the regime where statistical mechanics apply. This relies on the recent understanding of quantum chaos [22, 23], pure-state quantum statistical mechanics [4, 24, 25, 26, 27, 5, 28, 29], and prethermalisation dynamics [30, 31, 32, 33, 34] which leads to an extendable intermediate time scale to probe steady current properties [35, 36, 37]. Additionally, we show that our setup serves as a flexible platform to study quantum transport by demonstrating a high degree of current tunability."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06709v1,Experimentally probing entropy reduction via iterative quantum information transfer,"Thermodynamic principles governing energy and information are important tools for a deeper understanding and better control of quantum systems. In this work, we experimentally investigate the interplay of the thermodynamic costs and information flow in a quantum system undergoing iterative quantum measurement and feedback. Our study employs a state stabilization protocol involving repeated measurement and feedback on an electronic spin qubit associated with a Silicon-Vacancy center in diamond, which is strongly coupled to a diamond nanocavity. This setup allows us to verify the fundamental laws of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics, including the second law and the fluctuation theorem, both of which incorporate measures of quantum information flow induced by iterative measurement and feedback. We further assess the reducible entropy based on the feedback’s causal structure and quantitatively demonstrate the thermodynamic advantages of non-Markovian feedback over Markovian feedback. For that purpose, we extend the theoretical framework of quantum thermodynamics to include the causal structure of the applied feedback protocol. Our work lays the foundation for investigating the entropic and energetic costs of real-time quantum control in various quantum systems.","Recent advances in nonequilibrium thermodynamics [PRXinfothermoExp, esposito2009nonequilibrium, campisi2011colloquium, seifert2012stochastic, funo2018quantum, landi2021irreversible] have revealed the fundamental relationship between information and thermodynamics [leff2002maxwell, parrondo2015thermodynamics]. The reduction of entropy in a system through feedback control by “Maxwell’s demon” is fundamentally bounded by the information accessible to the demon, which is characterized by mutual information and information flow. This is reflected in generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics (SL) and the fluctuation theorem (FT) [sagawa2008second, sagawa2010generalized, horowitz2010nonequilibrium, sagawa2012nonequilibrium, ito2013information, hartich2014stochastic, HorowitzEspositoPRX2014, funo2013integral, ptaszynski2019thermodynamics, yada2022quantum], in which information and thermodynamic quantities are treated on an equal footing even in far from equilibrium dynamics. In the classical regime, the generalized thermodynamic principles have been experimentally verified, clarifying the role of the continuous flow of classical information [ribezzi2019large, debiossac2020thermodynamics, debiossac2022non], beyond single measurement-feedback protocols [toyabe2010experimental, berut2012experimental, roldan2014universal, koski2014experimental, vidrighin2016photonic, chida2017power, paneru2018lossless, paneru2020efficiency, yan2024experimental]. In the quantum regime [camati2016experimental, cottet2017observing, masuyama2018information, naghiloo2018information, hernandez2022autonomous], however, the thermodynamic role of quantum information flow induced by iterative quantum feedback has not been probed experimentally. Exploring the impact of quantum information flow on thermodynamics is critical to characterize the dynamical behavior of a system under multiple rounds of quantum measurement and feedback, which is practically relevant to various tasks in quantum experiments. Iterative or continuous feedback control can be used to create specific quantum resource states [sayrin2011real, magrini2021real] and to execute quantum error correction protocols [ofek2016extending, ryan2021realization, krinner2022realizing]. To perform these tasks effectively, it is crucial to find the optimal feedback protocol that fully exploits the available information [wiseman2009quantum, sivak2022model]. However, the thermodynamic description of the causal structure of quantum control remains to be investigated, unlike the well-explored classical case [horowitz2010nonequilibrium, sagawa2012nonequilibrium, ito2013information, hartich2014stochastic, HorowitzEspositoPRX2014, horowitz2014second, barato2014efficiency, hartich2016sensory, ito2016backward]. Figure 1: The Silicon-vacancy center under iterative measurement and feedback. (a) Schematic of a quantum system under repeated measurement and feedback. The operation in the n-th feedback process is determined by all past measurement outcomes (y_{1},y_{2},\dots,y_{n}). (b) Experimental setup: The SiV coupled to a nanophotonic optical cavity in diamond is placed in a cryostat at a 200\mathrm{mK} temperature. A readout laser at \sim 737\mathrm{nm} is sent to the SiV-cavity system through an optical fiber, and the reflected light intensity is monitored with a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector to determine the SiV electron spin state. The measurement results are stored and sent to an FPGA that plays the role of Maxwell’s demon and can apply quantum gates on the SiV electronic spin qubit through the MW application. The decoherence mechanism is established through SiV’s interaction with a heat bath consisting of spins in the diamond lattice. (c) A detailed experimental sequence of a step shown in (a): The SiV electronic spin qubit is measured, and the result y_{n} is sent to the Maxwell’s demon’s memory, which then applies the feedback unitary rotation \hat{R}_{x}(\theta_{n}) based on the past result(s). The spin then evolves for time \Delta t_{\mathrm{prec}} in a tilted basis set by the pre- and post-rotation gates \hat{R}_{x}(\varphi) and \hat{R}_{x}(-\varphi). (d) Details of the measurement and feedback with a specific Markovian feedback. The population change by the measurement and feedback is illustrated separately for y_{n}=1 and y_{n}=0, where coherence between \ket{0} and \ket{1} is ignored in this figure for simplicity. (e) Bloch sphere representation of the unitary evolution and dephasing. In this work, we experimentally explore the role of quantum information flow in thermodynamics using successive quantum feedback on a solid-state spin qubit. Specifically, our quantum system consists of a Silicon-Vacancy (SiV) defect center coupled to a diamond nanocavity [nguyen2019integrated, stas2022]. Using our platform, we first experimentally validate the fundamental thermodynamic laws, the SL and FT, which incorporate quantum information flow, as theoretically predicted in Ref. [yada2022quantum]. These results confirm that the quantum information flow bounds the fundamental capability of quantum feedback control, i.e., the amount of entropy reduction. Moreover, we experimentally explore the role of the causal structure of the feedback protocol, which is responsible for how efficiently the obtained information is used. By turning on and off the dependence of the feedback on the past measurement outcomes, we generate non-Markovian and Markovian control sequences as different feedback causal structures. To properly describe the effect of non-Markovian feedback protocols, we expand the theoretical framework [yada2022quantum] and derive the generalized SL and FT by quantifying the unavailable information due to the constraints on feedback design. Based on the theoretical framework developed in this study, we experimentally show the increased accessible information and reducible entropy of non-Markovian feedback over Markovian feedback, thus not only highlighting but also quantifying the benefit of non-Markovianity in thermodynamic terms. Our framework offers a new toolset for understanding the role of quantum information flow, optimizing feedback to control quantum systems, learning the energy cost of quantum information processing, and designing efficient quantum heat engines under feedback control in the real-time domain."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06648v1,Driven Critical Dynamics in Measurement-induced Phase Transitions,"Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT), characterizing abrupt changes in entanglement properties in quantum many-body systems subjected to unitary evolution with interspersed projective measurements, have garnered increasing interest. In this work, we generalize the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) driven critical dynamics that has achieved great success in traditional quantum and classical phase transitions to MIPT. By linearly changing the measurement probability p to cross the critical point p_{c} with driving velocity R, we identify the dynamic scaling relation of the entanglement entropy S versus R at p_{c}. For decreasing p from the area-law phase, S satisfies S\propto\ln R; while for increasing p from the volume-law phase, S satisfies S\propto R^{1/r} in which r=z+1/\nu with z and \nu being the dynamic and correlation length exponents, respectively. Moreover, we find that the driven dynamics from the volume-law phase violates the adiabatic-impulse scenario of the KZ mechanism. In spite of this, a unified finite-time scaling (FTS) form can be developed to describe these scaling behaviors. Besides, the dynamic scaling of the entanglement entropy of an auxiliary qubit S_{Q} is also investigated to further confirm the universality of the FTS form. By successfully establishing the driven dynamic scaling theory of this newfashioned entanglement transition, we bring a new fundamental perspective into MIPT that can be detected in fast-developing quantum computers.","References Calabrese and Cardy [2005] P.

of Nonnormal and Defective
Matrix-Valued Dynamical Systems","We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For an eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter, then the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our dynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue \lambda_{0}=0. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size at t=1 and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric multiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits relaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the defectivity of \lambda_{0} is recovering in time. We show that such processes are realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including \lambda_{0}. Here the pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not necessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely large values. The defective eigenvalue \lambda_{0} is sensitive to perturbation and the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the pseudospectrum including \lambda_{0}. By constructing generalized eigenspace for \lambda_{0}, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of matrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the systems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the present analysis.Keywords: Nonnormal matrices, Defective eigenvalue, Pseudospectrum dynamics, Generalized eigenspaces, Jordan decompositions of resolvents, Symbol curves2020 Mathematics Subject Classification: 15A18; 15A20; 15B05; 47A10; 60B20","Consider a matrix M\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}. We write its Hermitian conjugate as M^{\dagger} defined by the complex conjugate of the transpose; M^{\dagger}:=\overline{M^{\mathsf{T}}}. If it satisfies the equality M^{\dagger}M=MM^{\dagger}, then it is said to be normal and can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation. Hermitian matrices satisfying M^{\dagger}=M fall in this class. We introduce two notions of degeneracy of eigenvalues. The algebraic multiplicity is the number of times the eigenvalue appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial of M, while the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of the eigenvectors associated to the eigenvalue. When the geometric multiplicity is equal to the algebraic multiplicity for all eigenvalues, the matrix M has a complete set of eigenvectors. In this case, even if M is nonnormal, it can be reduced to a diagonal matrix \Lambda by a similarity transformation as \Lambda=V^{-1}MV. Here the j-th column of V is given by the j-th linearly independent eigenvector, j=1,2,\dots,n, and V^{-1} is well defined. But if the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue exceeds the geometric multiplicity, then that eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagoralizable. Consider the shift matrix with size n\geq 2, S=S_{n}:=\Big{(}\delta_{j\,k-1}\Big{)}_{1\leq j,k\leq n}=\left(\begin{array}[]% {cccccc}0&1&&&\smash{\lower 7.3194pt\hbox{\bg 0}}&\\ &0&1&&&\\ &\ldots&\ldots&&&\\ &&\ldots&\ldots&&\\ &&&0&1&\\ &&&&0&1\\ &\smash{\hbox{\bg 0}}&&&&0\end{array}\right), (1.1) where \delta_{jk} denotes the Kronecker delta. It is obvious that S^{k}=0 for k\geq n. Let b_{j}\in\mathbb{C}, j=1,2,\dots, and consider nilpotent Toeplitz matrices, S(m):=S^{m}+b_{1}S^{m+1}+\cdots+b_{n-m-1}S^{n-1}, (1.2) for m=1,2,\dots,n-1. Notice that S(m), m=1,2,\dots,n-1 are non-Hermitian and nonnormal. Since all the elements of the diagonal and lower triangular part of S(m) are zero, \lambda_{0}:=0 is the only eigenvalue. Hence, the algebraic multiplicity of \lambda_{0}, which is denoted by a_{0}(m), is n for any m=1,2,\dots,n-1. For each m=1,2,\dots,n-1, any vector \bm{v}_{0}(m) in the form \bm{v}_{0}(m)=(v_{01}(m),v_{02}(m),\cdots,v_{0m}(m),0,\cdots,0)^{\mathsf{T}} can be an eigenvector for \lambda_{0}. The dimension of the complex space spanned by these eigenvectors is m. Hence the geometric multiplicity g_{0}(m) of \lambda_{0} is m. We notice that g_{0}(1)=a_{0}(1)=1, but g_{0}(m)<a_{0}(m),\quad m=2,3,\dots,n-1. That is, the eigenvectors fail to span \mathbb{C}^{n}. In this case, the eigenvalue \lambda_{0} is defective and there is no similarity transformation which reduces S(m) to any diagonal form. Although S(m) is nondiagonalizable, a similarity transformation can reduce the matrix to the Jordan canonical form, \mathbb{J}(m)=V(m)^{-1}S(m)V(m). The diagonal elements of \mathbb{J}(m) are still all zero, but some of the upper 2nd-diagonal elements can be 1. More precisely, \mathbb{J}(m) is decomposed into g_{0}(m)-ple Jordan blocks which are given by shift matrices (1.1), \mathbb{J}(m)=\bigoplus_{\ell=1}^{g_{0}(m)}S_{d_{0}^{(\ell)}(m)}, (1.3) where the sizes of them are denoted by d_{0}^{(\ell)}(m), \ell=1,2,\dots,g_{0}(m). By convention, we assume the non-increasing order, d_{0}^{(1)}(m)\geq d_{0}^{(2)}(m)\geq\cdots\geq d_{0}^{(g_{0}(m))}(m). Each d_{0}^{(\ell)}(m) gives the dimension of the generalized sub-eigenspace which includes the \ell-th eigenvector \bm{v}_{0}^{(\ell)}(m) associated with the zero-eigenvalue \lambda_{0}, \ell=1,2,\dots,g_{0}(m). They satisfy the sum rule \sum_{\ell=1}^{g_{0}(m)}d_{0}^{(\ell)}(m)=a_{0}(m). By definition, if d_{0}^{(\ell)}\equiv 1, \ell=1,2,\dots,g_{0}, then g_{0}=a_{0} and the matrix is normal. Therefore, k_{0}(m):=\max\{d_{0}^{(\ell)}(m):\ell=1,2,\dots,g_{0}(m)\}=d_{0}^{(1)}(m) (1.4) will indicate the degree of defectivity of the zero-eigenvalue \lambda_{0} measuring how far from being normal. It is called the index of \lambda_{0}. Eigenvalue analysis is one of the most successful method of applied mathematics. Roughly speaking, eigenvalues give us the abstraction of a matrix by plotting the set of them (spectra) on a complex plane \mathbb{C}. For defective matrices, however, eigenvalue analysis fails. In the above case with S(m), the unique eigenvalue at zero with full algebraic multiplicity a_{0}(m)\equiv n misleads us to identify S(m) with the null (all-zero) matrix O. The Jordan-block structure with zero diagonal can not be represented only by spectra. (a) (b) (c) Figure 1: (a) One sampling result of numerically obtained eigenvalues of the system with Gaussian perturbation matrix Z; S^{(b)}(m,\delta Z)=S^{m}+bS^{m+1}+(1/\sqrt{2n})Z, where n=5000, m=3, and b=1. (b) Superpositions of 50 samples. (c) Symbol curve of \widehat{S}^{m}+b\widehat{S}^{m+1} with m=3 and b=1. The structure of S(m) hidden in eigenvalue analysis is revealed by its sensitivity to perturbation. Let Z be a matrix with independently and normally distributed complex entries; Z_{jk}=X_{jk}+iY_{jk} with X_{jk}\sim{\rm N}(0,1), Y_{jk}\sim{\rm N}(0,1), i:=\sqrt{-1}. Here we consider a simple case for (1.2) such that b_{1}=b\in\mathbb{C}, b_{j}=0 for j\geq 2. Figure 1 shows plots of the numerically obtained eigenvalues, when the complex Gaussian random matrix Z is added, S^{(b)}(m,\widetilde{\delta}Z):=S^{m}+bS^{m+1}+\widetilde{\delta}Z, (1.5) where n=5000, m=3, b=1, and the coefficient of Z is given by \widetilde{\delta}=\widetilde{\delta}(n)=1/\sqrt{2n}=1/100. The dots are not the eigenvalues of the original matrix, S^{(b)}(m,0)=S^{m}+bS^{m+1}, but they represent the structure of this defective matrix in the sense explained below. Hence they are called the pseudo-eigenvalues of S^{(b)}(m,0). (More precisely speaking, the domains on \mathbb{C} in which the eigenvalues of randomly perturbed matrix are distributed are called the pseudospectra of the original unperturbed matrix having defective eigenvalues [6, 22, 25].) Instead of the n\times n shift matrix (1.1), here we consider an infinite-size shift matrix, \widehat{S}:=S_{\infty}=(\delta_{j\,k-1})_{1\leq j,k<\infty}. (1.6) which will represent a nilpotent Toeplitz operator. We also consider an infinite-dimensional vector \widehat{\bm{v}} in the form \widehat{\bm{v}}=(1,z,z^{2},z^{3},\cdots)^{\mathsf{T}}, z\in\mathbb{C}. Then we see that (\widehat{S}^{m}+b\widehat{S}^{m+1})\widehat{\bm{v}}=f(z)\widehat{\bm{v}}\quad% \mbox{with}\quad f(z)=z^{m}+bz^{m+1}. (1.7) The 2-norm of \widehat{\bm{v}}, \|\widehat{\bm{v}}\|:=(\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|\widehat{v}_{j}|^{2})^{1/2}=(1-|z|^% {2})^{-1/2}, is finite if z is inside the unit circle \mathbb{T}:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|=1\}. The function f(z) is known as the symbol of the Toeplitz operator \widehat{S}^{m}+b\widehat{S}^{m+1}. The image of \mathbb{T} by the map f, f(\mathbb{T}), is called the symbol curve of \widehat{S}^{m}+b\widehat{S}^{m+1} and is drawn in Fig.1 for b=1 [6, 25]. In Fig.1, the plots of eigenvalues of the perturbed systems line up along the symbol curve f(\mathbb{T}). For all z\in\mathbb{C}, |z|<1, the vectors \widehat{\bm{v}} satisfying (1.7) give eigenvectors of eigenvalues f(z)=z^{m}+bz^{m+1}, m-1,2,\dots,n-1 in \ell^{2}-space. It is proved that the spectrum of the Toeplitz operator \widehat{S}^{m}+b\widehat{S}^{m+1} is equal to f(\mathbb{T}) with all the points enclosed by this curve (see, [22, Theorem 2.1], [25, Theorem 7.1]), and Section 5 (i) below). If numerically obtained eigenvalues of (1.5) were all superposed, they will fill the region bounded by the outmost curve of the symbol curve f(\mathbb{T}). Figure 1 shows superposition of the plots of 50 samples. Mathematical study of random perturbations of banded Toeplitz matrices, see [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 23] and references therein. Recently, the notion of pseudospectra has attracted much attention in stochastic analysis of time-dependent random matrix theory [13, 19]. The non-Hermitian matrix-valued Brownian motion (BM) is defined by M(t)=(M_{jk}(t))_{1\leq j,k\leq n}:=\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2n}}(B^{{\rm R}}_{jk}% (t)+iB^{{\rm I}}_{jk}(t))\right)_{1\leq j,k\leq n},\quad t\geq 0, where (B^{{\rm R}}_{jk}(t))_{t\geq 0}, (B^{{\rm I}}_{jk}(t))_{t\geq 0}, 1\leq j,k\leq n are 2n^{2} independent one-dimensional standard BMs [7, 8, 9, 12, 17]. This process is regarded as the dynamical extension of the complex Ginibre ensemble, since if it starts from the null matrix, M(0)=O, the distribution of eigenvalues at an arbitrary time t>0 is identified with the complex Ginibre ensemble of eigenvalues with variance t [16], which has been extensively studied in random matrix theory [10, 13]. Burda et al. [9] studied the process (M(t))_{t\geq 0} starting from M(0)=S. By numerical simulation they found that the eigenvalues seem to expand instantly from \lambda_{0} to a unit circle \mathbb{T}. For the time interval 0<t<1, the dots form a growing annulus. Then the inner radius of the annulus shrinks to zero at t=1 and dots fill up a full unit disk. This observation shall be compared with the eigenvalues of the matrix (1.5) with m=1 and b=0, where perturbation was given by a Gaussian complex random-matrix Z. When m=1 and b=0, the symbol is f(z)=z and hence the symbol curve is simply a unit circle, f(\mathbb{T})=\mathbb{T}. The transition from a unit circle to a unit disk in the time period t\in(0,1] reported by Burda et al. [9] will be regarded as a sampling process of eigenvalues for the perturbed nilpotent Toeplitz matrix. They seem to cluster along the symbol curve \mathbb{T} when the sampling number is small, while they tend to fill the unit disk as the sampling number becomes large. Motivated by the above consideration, we will study the following matrix-valued dynamical system [20], S^{(b)}(t,\delta J):=S^{t+1}+bS^{t+2}+\delta J, (1.8) with discrete time t=0,1,\dots,T, where the final time is defined by T=T(n):=n-2. Here b,\delta\in\mathbb{C} and J is the all-ones matrix; J=(J_{jk})_{1\leq j,k\leq n} with J_{jk}\equiv 1,\quad j,k=1,2,\dots n, which gives the additive rank 1 perturbation [14] to the nilpotent Toeplitz matrices, S^{(b)}(t,0)=S^{t+1}+bS^{t+2}. Figure 2: Time-evolution of the geometric multiplicity g_{0}, the algebraic multiplicity a_{0}, and the degree k_{0} of \lambda_{0} are shown by black, red, and blue dots, respectively, for t=1,2,\dots,T:=n-2 with n=100. Figure 3: Time evolution of Young diagram representing the dynamics of the Jordan canonical form associated with \lambda_{0}. The upper-left diagram is for the initial time t=1 with \lfloor n/2\rfloor boxes and the right diagram is for the final time t=T with n-2 boxes. Here we have drawn the case with n=17. The lower-left diagram shows the intermediate state at time t=5. In this case n=17 is indivisible by t+1=6; (t+1)\nmid n. Then k_{0}=\lfloor n/(t+1)\rfloor+1=3, n-(t+1)\lfloor n/(t+1)\rfloor-1=4. We will show the following. (i) The discrete time t is equal to the geometric multiplicity of \lambda_{0}, g_{0}(t)=t,\quad t=0,1,\dots,T. (1.9) (See Proposition 3.1 in Section 3.1.) In other words, we consider the matrix-valued dynamical system such that the dimension of the eigenspace in the narrow sense associated with \lambda_{0} is growing in time. (ii) All non-zero eigenvalues of S^{(b)}(t,\delta J) are given by simple roots of a polynomial equation with degree p_{1}(t)+1 with p_{1}(t):=\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{t+1}\right\rfloor, (1.10) where \lfloor x\rfloor denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x\in\mathbb{R} (the floor function of x) [20]. This determines the algebraic multiplicity of \lambda_{0} as a_{0}(t)=n-p_{1}(t)-1,\quad t=0,1,\dots,T. (1.11) (See Theorem 2.1 in Section 2.) Note that with a fixed n, a_{0}(t) is increasing stepwise in t [20]. Notice that a_{0}(0)=0; that is, the origin is not an eigenvalue at t=0. When the origin becomes an eigenvalue at t=1, its algebraic multiplicity has a large value \lfloor n/2\rfloor, that is, approximately half of the matrix size n, while the system has only one (g_{0}(1)=1) eigenvector. Non-zero eigenvalues are being absorbed one by one to the origin [20], and the algebraic multiplicity a_{0}(t) increases stepwise in time. The speed of increment of a_{0}(t) is slowing down as t increases, but it keeps excess to g_{0}(t) until t=n-3. At the final time t=T, \lambda_{0} has a_{0}(T)=n-2=T leaving only two non-zero eigenvalues on \mathbb{C}. There are g_{0}(T)=T linearly independent eigenvalues at that time. The coincidence a_{0}(T)=g_{0}(T) makes the matrix be diagonalizable. (iii) Although g_{0}(0)=a_{0}(0)=0 and g_{0}(T)=a_{0}(T)=T, the inequality holds as g_{0}(t)<a_{0}(t),\quad t=1,2,\dots,T-1. That is, the matrices S^{(b)}(t,\delta J) are nonnormal and \lambda_{0} is defective. We will construct the generalized eigenspaces associated with \lambda_{0} explicitly and prove that the index of \lambda_{0} is given by k_{0}(t)=\begin{cases}\displaystyle{\frac{n}{t+1}},&\quad\mbox{if $(t+1)\mid n% $},\cr\cr\displaystyle{\left\lfloor\frac{n}{t+1}\right\rfloor+1},&\quad\mbox{% if $(t+1)\nmid n$},\end{cases} (1.12) where (t+1)\mid n (resp. (t+1)\nmid n) means that n is divisible (resp. indivisible) by t+1. (See Proposition 3.2 in Section 3.1.) The degree of nonnormality is the highest value at the beginning; k_{0}(1)=n/2 if n is even and k_{0}(1)=(n+1)/2 if n is odd. The defectivity of \lambda_{0} is then decreasing stepwise in time. We put k_{0}(T)=1 by convention. See Fig.2 (iv) At each time t=1,2,\dots,T-1, by a similarity transformation, S^{(b)}(t,\delta J) is reduced to the following form, \mathbb{J}(t)\oplus{\rm diag}(\lambda_{1}(t),\lambda_{2}(t),\dots,\lambda_{p_{% 1}(t)+1}), (1.13) where the Jordan canonical form \mathbb{J}(t) is decomposed into t-ple Jordan blocks as \mathbb{J}(t)=\begin{cases}\underbrace{S_{k_{0}(t)}\oplus\cdots\oplus S_{k_{0}% (t)}}_{t},&\mbox{if $(t+1)\mid n$},\cr\underbrace{S_{k_{0}(t)}\oplus\cdots% \oplus S_{k_{0}(t)}}_{n-(t+1)\lfloor n/(t+1)\rfloor-1}\oplus\underbrace{S_{k_{% 0}(t)-1}\oplus\cdots\oplus S_{k_{0}(t)-1}}_{t-n+(t+1)\lfloor n/(t+1)\rfloor+1}% ,&\mbox{if $(t+1)\nmid n$}.\end{cases} (1.14) (See Section 3.1.) The Jordan canonical form is represented by a Young diagram [11, 15]. Figure 3 shows dynamics of Young diagram corresponding to (1.14). It starts from a single row diagram with \lfloor n/2\rfloor boxes at time t=1 and ends with a single column diagram with n-2 boxes at time t=T. (As mentioned at the end of (ii) above, at the final time t=T, S^{(b)}(T,\delta J)=S^{n-1}+\delta J can be diagonalized into the form, {\rm diag}(\underbrace{0,\cdots,0}_{T},\lambda_{1}(T),\lambda_{2}(T)), |\lambda_{1}(T)|>|\lambda_{2}(T)|>0 instead of (1.13).) The time t is identified with the number of rows and the total number of boxes is given by a_{0}(t) which increases stepwise in time. The relaxation process of the defectivity of \lambda_{0} is represented by the stepwise decreasing of the number of columns. In summary, the present dynamical systems (S^{(b)}(t,\delta J))_{1\leq t\leq T}, b,\delta\in\mathbb{C}, represent relaxation processes of matrices from being far-from-normal to being near-normal, in which the defective eigenvalue \lambda_{0} is recovering in time. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we derive the polynomial equation for the non-zero eigenvalues and discuss their time-evolution. Section 3 is devoted to the analytical study of the pseudospectra, in particular, the pseudospectrum including the defective eigenvalue \lambda_{0}=0. In Section 3.1 we explain how to construct the generalized eigenspace associated with \lambda_{0}, which is decomposed into t sub-spaces and gives the t-ple Jordan blocks for the similarity transformation of the matrix at each time t, We perform the Jordan decomposition of resolvent of the matrix, introduce the notion of generalized condition number, and then evaluate the 2-norm of the resolvent (Proposition 3.6) in Section 3.2. In Section 3.3, we give the first definition of \varepsilon-pseudospectrum (Definition 3). Then an estimation of the \varepsilon-pseudospectra is given by Theorem 3.8. This theorem clarifies the (t,n)-dependence of the pseudospectrum including \lambda_{0}. In order to show the validity of our analytical study, we perform numerical calculation for the processes perturbed by Gaussian complex random matrices in Section 4. In Section 4.1, we show the second definition of \varepsilon-pseudospectrum (Definition 4.1) which is equivalent with the first one. By this definition, the pseudospectrum is characterized by the sensitivity of \lambda_{0} with respect to perturbations. Actually, we show in Section 4.2, that (t,n)-dependence of the domain, in which the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are accumulated, is consistent with Theorem 3.8 for the pseudospectrum including \lambda_{0}. Finally in Section 5 future problems are listed out."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06446v1,Entropic magnetic interlayer coupling,"Nanomagnetism concerns the engineering of magnetic interactions in heterostructures that consist of layers of magnetic and non-magnetic materials. Mostly, these interactions are dominated by the minimization of energy. Here, we propose an effective magnetic interlayer coupling that is dominated by the maximization of entropy. As an example, we consider the system that mediates the effective interactions to be square spin ice, in which case we find purely entropic interactions that are long-ranged. We argue that in the thermodynamic limit the entropic interlayer coupling gives rise to entropic torques on the magnetization direction. For small systems, the physical properties are well characterized by the mutual information between the two magnets that are coupled. Because entropic interactions become stronger for higher temperatures, our findings may benefit the development of nanomagnetic devices that require thermal stability.","References Shinjo [2009] T.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05849v1,Input-Driven Dynamics for Robust Memory Retrieval in Hopfield Networks,"The Hopfield model provides a mathematically idealized yet insightful framework for understanding the mechanisms of memory storage and retrieval in the human brain. This model has inspired four decades of extensive research on learning and retrieval dynamics, capacity estimates, and sequential transitions among memories. Notably, the role and impact of external inputs has been largely underexplored, from their effects on neural dynamics to how they facilitate effective memory retrieval. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel dynamical system framework in which the external input directly influences the neural synapses and shapes the energy landscape of the Hopfield model. This plasticity-based mechanism provides a clear energetic interpretation of the memory retrieval process and proves effective at correctly classifying highly mixed inputs. Furthermore, we integrate this model within the framework of modern Hopfield architectures, using this connection to elucidate how current and past information are combined during the retrieval process. Finally, we embed both the classic and the new model in an environment disrupted by noise and compare their robustness during memory retrieval.","Since the beginning of the 80s, the words “Associative Memory Network"" have closely echoed with “Hopfield Network"" (Hopfield, 1982, 1984), and a plethora of subsequent works have endeavored to provide a detailed picture of the properties of such networks (Amit et al., 1987a; Crisanti et al., 1986; Treves and Amit, 1988). Drawing from the toolbox of statistical mechanics, Hopfield networks provided a convincing explanation for the multi-stability of memories as function of the neurons couplings, and therefore a plausible, dynamic retrieval mechanism over an energy landscape. Recently, in a machine-learning driven Renaissance for associative memory networks, the original framework has been generalized to higher order interactions (Krotov and Hopfield, 2016) and to multi-layered architectures (Krotov and Hopfield, 2020; Chaudhry et al., 2023), thus endowing the model with both a significantly improved capacity (Demircigil et al., 2017) and a direct bridge to state-of-the-art transformer models and their attention mechanism (Hubert et al., 2021). Moreover, the new framework has paved the way for new hypotheses on how neurons and astrocytes could interact (Kozachkov et al., 2023), at the functional level, to support cognitive processes. The effort to bridge formal approaches and neuroscience is of paramount importance for the advancement of both fields. As proposed in (Treves and Rolls, 1992), attractor dynamics may be a key component of hippocampal functioning, where the signal relayed by cortical areas is sparsified and orthogonalized in the CA3-CA1 regions (Yassa and Stark, 2011; Rolls, 2013). In addition, simple attractor models provide a viable tool to study global cortical dynamics in the brain (Russo and Treves, 2012; Naim et al., 2018), by partitioning the surface in interacting patches of cortex each idealized by Hopfield like networks. In classic treatments on computational neuroscience (Amit, 1989; Dayan and Abbott, 2005; Gerstner et al., 2014), memory retrieval in the Hopfield model is implicitly described as a two-step process. First, a noisy or incomplete input is presented as a cue and adopted as an initial condition. Then, driven by an energy landscape, the network state flows towards the closest energy minimum representing the prototypical memory. The literature however lacks an explanation for how an external input becomes an initial condition in the neural dynamics; it is worth noting that external inputs and initial conditions play distinct roles in the behavior of a dynamical system. Most importantly, while this classic two-step process is natural within an algorithmic paradigm, it fails to explain how neuronal circuits continuously react and adapt in real time to external inputs. In light of these limitations, we advocate for a paradigm shift from a two-step mechanism, akin to a standard algorithmic approach, to a input-driven dynamic mechanism, aligned with the principles of online algorithms and continual learning (Zenke et al., 2017; Hadsell et al., 2020; Lesort et al., 2020). To this extent, we propose a novel version of the Hopfield model that is driven by external inputs. A key feature of this model is that the input shapes the energy landscape and affects the resulting gradient descent flow (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, our model admits a simple representation as a modern Hopfield network (Krotov and Hopfield, 2020; Hubert et al., 2021); this representation provides a conceptual bridge with the recent literature on transformer models and machine learning. Finally, the addition of noise reveals the advantageous integration of past and present information by our model, thereby reducing misclassification errors induced by inconsistent or ‘glitchy’ inputs. Figure 1: Comparison between classic Hopfield and IDP Hopfield models. (a) A slowly morphing sequence of noisy images is presented as a input to the observer, who updates its belief state to retrieve the memory closest to the current image u. This adaptation process occurs continuously. (b) In the classic model, the network state is set to an initial condition x(0) equal to the current image u and then the Hopfield dynamics performs the memory retrieval task. (c) In the proposed input-driven plasticity model, the network initial condition is arbitrary, the image u modifies the synaptic weights W(u), and the Hopfield dynamics with modified synaptic weights performs the memory retrieval task. This dynamics is well posed and naturally tracks the morphing images also when the image is time-varying u=u(t). (d) In the classic model, the Hopfield dynamics is a gradient descent for the energy \mathrm{E}(x;W): the blue ball, representing the neural state, rolls from an initial condition towards a stable minimum point (cat memory). Therefore, the retrieval process is successful when the noisy image x(0)=u (dotted cat) lies in the region of attraction of the correct memory (cat memory). (e) In the proposed model, the noisy image u directly modifies the synaptic matrix W(u) and in turn the energy landscape \mathrm{E}(x;W(u)), thereby extending the region of attraction of the correct memory. The retrieval process is successful from generic initial conditions when the correct memory is the unique minimum of the landscape. Specifically, in the panel, the noisy image (dotted cat) renders the correct memory a minimum (cat memory) and the incorrect memory (dog memory) no longer an equilibrium of \mathrm{E}(x;W(u))."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05766v1,A nonstabilizerness monotone from stabilizerness asymmetry,"We introduce a nonstabilizerness monotone which we name basis-minimised stabilizerness asymmetry (BMSA). It is based on the notion of G-asymmetry, a measure of how much a certain state deviates from being symmetric with respect to a symmetry group G. For pure states, we show that the BMSA is a strong monotone for magic-state resource theory, while it can be extended to mixed states via the convex roof construction. We discuss its relation with other magic monotones, first showing that the BMSA coincides with the recently introduced basis-minimized measurement entropy, thereby establishing the strong monotonicity of the latter. Next, we provide inequalities between the BMSA and other nonstabilizerness measures known in the literature. Finally, we present numerical methods to compute the BMSA, highlighting its advantages and drawbacks compared to other nonstabilizerness measures in the context of pure many-body quantum states. We also discuss the importance of additivity and strong monotonicity for measures of nonstabilizerness in many-body physics, motivating the search for additional computable nonstabilizerness monotones.","The theory of nonstabilizerness [1, 2], also known as magic, is a well-established branch of quantum information theory. It is based on the notion of stabilizer states [3], which are those generated by the class of Clifford unitary operators and which play a crucial role in quantum computation [4]. Stabilizer states have very special properties, which lie at the basis of most quantum-error correcting codes available today [5, 6]. Roughly speaking, nonstabilizerness is the degree to which a certain state or computation cannot be approximated by a stabilizer state or a Clifford unitary operator, respectively. As Clifford gates can be simulated efficiently by a classical computer [7, 8, 9], a non-zero amount of nonstabilizerness is necessary for universal quantum computation [5, 6]. This observation motivates the problem of quantifying nonstabilizerness of quantum states and operators, which is formalized within the framework of the resource theory of nonstabilizerness [2, 10]. The notion of nonstabilizerness was introduced almost twenty years ago [1], but the past few years have witnessed an increasing interest in its study in the context of many-body quantum physics [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Arguably, a strong motivation comes from the recent progress in fault-tolerant quantum computing [18, 19]. An important point is that Clifford operations can be efficiently implemented fault tolerantly [6, 20, 21], often making them less demanding than other operations [22, 23, 23]. Therefore, quantifying nonstabilizerness of a physical state becomes relevant for estimating experimental resources needed to prepare quantum states on fault-tolerant quantum computers [24], as well as a benchmark for the performance of the quantum computer [25, 26, 27, 18]. From a more theoretical perspective, nonstabilizerness has been argued to provide further understanding on the structure of many-body states [28, 29, 30, 31, 15, 32], quantum phases of matter [11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 33, 34, 35] and pseudorandomness [36, 37, 38]. Further, nonstabilizerness characterises chaotic quantum dynamics [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45], the structure of entanglement [46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51] and quantum chaos [52, 53, 40, 54, 55, 56]. Within the standard resource theory [10], a proper measure of nonstabilizerness should satisfy a minimal set of conditions which define monotones with respect to Clifford operations. In addition, from the point of view of many-body physics, it is also very natural to require additional properties such as additivity (at least asymptotically in the system size) and strong monotonicity [10], which guarantees that nonstabilizerness does not increase, on average, under local measurements. Unfortunately, most of the measures of nonstabilizerness known from the standard resource theory are hard to compute in the many-body setting. Recently, a breakthrough came with the introduction of the so-called stabilizer Rényi entropies [39], which were shown to be monotones for Rényi index \alpha\geq 2 [29, 57]. Differently from several known monotones, they do not require minimization procedures, making their computation feasible in a variety of physically interesting situations [17, 33, 30, 27, 31, 58, 59]. Yet, while being additive, the SRE is not a strong monotone [29]. At the same time, the closely related linear stabilizer entropy is a strong monotone [57], but it is not additive. Therefore, it is still important to search for novel nonstabilizerness monotones which are both additive and computable, at least in restricted classes of states. Motivated by this picture, we introduce a measure of nonstabilizerness which we name basis-minimised stabilizerness asymmetry (BMSA). It is based on the notion of G-asymmetry [60, 61], a measure of how much a certain state deviates from being symmetric with respect to a symmetry group G. For pure states, we show that the BMSA is a strong monotone for magic-state resource theory, which can be extended to mixed states via a standard convex roof construction. Next, we discuss in detail its relation with other known magic monotones. In particular, we first show that the BMSA coincides with a recently introduced basis-minimized measurement entropy [62], thereby establishing the strong monotonicity of the latter. We then provide inequalities between the BMSA and other known nonstabilizerness measures, highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of the BMSA. Finally, we discuss computational methods to evaluate the BMSA and present numerical results in explicit cases. The rest of this work is organized as follows. We begin in Sec. II, where we recall the resource theory of nonstabilizerness and survey known measures. Here, we also discuss the importance of additivity and strong monotonicity in the many-body setting. Next, in Sec. III we introduce the BSMA and study its properties, proving in particular its strong monotonicity. Its relation with other monotones is discussed in Sec. IV, while our numerical results are reported in Sec. V. Finally, Sec. VI contains our conclusions, while the most technical aspects of our work are consigned to several appendices."
