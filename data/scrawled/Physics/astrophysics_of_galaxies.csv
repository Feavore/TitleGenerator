https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10391v1,shaping of a mature galactic bar in action-angle space,"We study vertical resonant trapping and resonant heating of orbits. These two processes both lead to the growth of a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge in a typical N-body model. For the first time, we study this by means of the action variables and resonant angles of the actual orbits that compose the model itself. We used the resonant angle instead of the frequency ratio, which allowed us to clearly distinguish between these two processes in numerical simulations. We show that trapping and heating occur simultaneously, at least at the stage of a mature bar, that is, some orbits quickly pass through vertical resonance while at the same time, a substantial number of orbits remains trapped into this stage for a long time. Half of all bar orbits spend more than 2.5 Gyr in vertical resonance over an interval of 4 Gyr. Half of the orbits trapped into the bar over the last 3 Gyr of simulation remain captured in vertical resonance for more than 2 Gyr. We conclude that in the later stages of the bar evolution, the process of vertical trapping dominates in the ongoing process that causes the boxy/peanut shape of a bar in a typical N-body model. This contradicts the results of several recent works.","When they are viewed edge-on, the central regions of many disk galaxies exhibit a prominent structure that bulges out from the midplane of the disk and resembles either a box or, in some cases, a peanut (e.g., NGC 128, NGC 4013). These structures, usually called boxy/peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulges, are directly observed in 30% – 40% of the edge-on disk galaxies in the local Universe (Lütticke et al., 2000; Erwin & Debattista, 2013; Yoshino & Yamauchi, 2015; Erwin & Debattista, 2017; Kruk et al., 2019; Marchuk et al., 2022), and some candidates have been identified up to redshift z\sim 1 (Kruk et al., 2019). Early numerical (Combes & Sanders, 1981; Combes et al., 1990; Pfenniger & Friedli, 1991; Raha et al., 1991) and kinematic (Kuijken & Merrifield, 1995; Bureau & Freeman, 1999; Merrifield & Kuijken, 1999; Veilleux et al., 1999; Chung & Bureau, 2004) studies showed that B/PS bulges originate from the bars and are vertically extended parts of the bars. Combes & Sanders (1981) were the first to show that a flat bar, shortly after its appearance, begins to grow in the vertical direction and acquires the B/P shape. Extensive orbital studies of numerical models carried out later (Skokos et al., 2002; Patsis & Katsanikas, 2014; Portail et al., 2015; Abbott et al., 2017; Parul et al., 2020) proved that B/PS bulges are built by the same orbits that populate the bars, that is, B/PS bulges share their building blocks with bars111Although not all bar orbits become B/PS bulge orbits.. Although the connection between bars and B/PS bulges is well known, the debate is ongoing as to why initially flat orbits rise above the disk plane and what causes this (Sellwood & Gerhard, 2020; Li et al., 2023). There are two different approaches. The first approach is based on the commensurability of three orbital frequencies (azimuthal \Omega, radial \kappa, and vertical \omega_{z}), which leads to resonant interaction. As a result, the orbits experience an average nonzero lifting force (Combes et al., 1990; Quillen, 2002; Quillen et al., 2014). The second concept considers the emergence of instability due to the collective response of the orbits to a vertical disturbance (Raha et al., 1991). This instability is often called buckling instability in the case of a growing bar and is similar to the firehorse instability. In the case of resonant interactions, the important resonance is the vertical inner Lindblad resonance (vILR). In this region of the disk, \omega_{z}\approx 2(\Omega-\Omega_{\mathrm{p}}), and \Omega_{\mathrm{p}} is the bar pattern speed. Combes et al. (1990) noted that the location of this particular resonance almost coincides with the location of another resonance, namely the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR, \kappa\approx 2(\Omega-\Omega_{\mathrm{p}})), which is known to play an important role in the formation and growth of the bar. Because the locations of resonances coincide, the elongated orbits of a bar, which are initially almost completely confined to the disk plane, sooner or later rise above the disk plane, and the orbits themselves become part of the B/PS bulge. A simple Hamiltonian model describing orbital trapping by vILR was first presented by Quillen (2002) and was based on an analogous model developed for in-plane resonance by Contopoulos (1975). The ideas of Quillen (2002) were later expanded based on the fact that the secular evolution of a bar, driven by interaction with the disk and halo particles at the corotation resonance (CR; \Omega=\Omega_{\mathrm{p}}) leads to an increase in the bar size (Athanassoula, 2003). This suggests that the resonance moves outward and elevates particles from the midplane along the path (Quillen et al., 2014). As the resonance moves farther from the centre, increasingly more orbits are lifted from the disk plane and eventually form an impressive B/PS bulge. This process can briefly be described as resonant heating or a resonant passage, when we consider the orbits in the bar reference frame. Quillen et al. (2014) showed how resonant heating works using limited model examples. Sellwood & Gerhard (2020) studied several self-consistent N-body models and one model with an artificially imposed vertical symmetry. The authors followed the secular evolution of the orbital frequencies of a random sample of bar particles in each model and concluded that although peanut shapes formed in all models, each model individually exhibited the effect of buckling, resonant heating, and resonant trapping. Although three distinct mechanisms have clearly been demonstrated that each contribute to the growth of the B/PS bulge, several points regarding them are still unclear. It is unclear whether each of these mechanisms operates only when certain conditions are met, and if not, whether they can operate simultaneously or if each is associated with a specific stage in the bar life. It also remains to be determined which of the two is more important for the B/PS bulge growth. It is critical to answer these questions if we wish to understand how B/PS bulges grow in real galaxies. In this work, we demonstrate that at least the long-term resonant trapping and resonant passage (heating) that were studied in particular by Sellwood & Gerhard (2020) occur simultaneously in a typical N-body model. In addition, resonant trapping can lock the orbits for very long periods of time, up to several billion years, while the bar itself continues to evolve slowly. To demonstrate this, we analyzed the evolution of a sample of orbits that were trapped into the bar in such a model in terms of both actions and resonant angles. We used the techniques developed in our previous work (Zozulia et al., 2024). Although the resonant angles arise naturally in theoretical studies, it is an entirely new approach to employ them to describe the evolution of orbits in N-body simulations. This allows us to directly identify orbits that are captured or escape the resonance. As we show below, the commensurability of the frequencies at some point in time is clearly insufficient to state that the orbit is in resonance, and it is therefore important to study the corresponding angles. We would also like to note that by their theoretical definition, the actions (Lichtenberg & Lieberman, 1992) should be constants of motion. However, when a system is perturbed by a strong bar, the actions defined for an axisymmetric potential are no longer conserved and are not really proper actions in the original sense. This arises because in this study and in some recent studies that considered the influence of the bar (Binney, 2018, 2020; Trick et al., 2021; Trick, 2022), the actions were calculated using the polar coordinates of particular orbits. These actions are sometimes called unperturbed actions (Binney, 2018, 2020) because they correspond to actions of the angularly averaged system (i.e., an axisymmetric system). To investigate the behavior of unperturbed actions on different timescales, we time-averaged these actions over different time intervals (Sec. 2.2). Our model contains an early buckling episode. We excluded this episode and its role in the uplift of orbits in the central regions in the early stages of bar evolution here and focused on the later stages, when buckling no longer affects the orbits that join the bar."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10373v1,The Effect of Galaxy Interactions on Starbursts in Milky Way-Mass Galaxies in FIRE Simulations,"Simulations and observations suggest that galaxy interactions may enhance the star formation rate (SFR) in merging galaxies. One proposed mechanism is the torque exerted on the gas and stars in the larger galaxy by the smaller galaxy. We analyze the interaction torques and star formation activity on six galaxies from the FIRE-2 simulation suite with masses comparable to the Milky Way galaxy at redshift z=0. We trace the halos from z=3.6 to z=0, calculating the torque exerted by the nearby galaxies on the gas in the central galaxy. We calculate the correlation between the torque and the SFR across the simulations for various mass ratios. For near-equal-stellar-mass-ratio interactions in the galaxy sample, occurring between z=1.2-3.6, there is a positive and statistically significant correlation between the torque from nearby galaxies on the gas of the central galaxies and the SFR. For all other samples, no statistically significant correlation is found between the torque and the SFR. Our analysis shows that some, but not all, major interactions cause starbursts in the simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies, and that most starbursts are not caused by galaxy interactions. The transition from ‘bursty’ at high redshift (z\gtrsim 1) to ‘steady’ star-formation state at later times is independent of the interaction history of the galaxies, and most of the interactions do not leave significant imprints on the overall trend of the star formation history of the galaxies.","Simulations of galaxies that resolve the interstellar medium (ISM) at giant molecular cloud-scales show that massive galaxies transition from a “bursty” star formation state with large temporal fluctuations in star formation rate (SFR) at high redshift to a “steady” star formation state at low redshift (Hopkins et al., 2014; Muratov et al., 2015; Sparre et al., 2017; Hopkins et al., 2018; Faucher-Giguère, 2018). It is worth noting that this connects broadly with the transition from a thick to thin disk geometry (Yu et al., 2021, 2023; McCluskey et al., 2024). The physical cause of this transition, however, remains uncertain (Stern et al., 2021; Gurvich et al., 2023; Hopkins et al., 2023). A proposed mechanism is the change in merger and flyby frequency with redshift (Barnes & Hernquist, 1996). In this paper, we investigate this mechanism by looking at the effects of galaxy interactions on the star formation activity of central galaxies and their likelihood to trigger starburst events. Mergers and flybys (Moreno, 2012; Moreno et al., 2013) are common in the growth history of galaxies in the \LambdaCDM cosmological model, and it is commonly believed that galaxy interactions can induce star formation in central galaxies. Previous simulations have shown that the torque from a companion galaxy exerted on the central galaxy can lead to the inflow of gas, and thus to the enhancement of the SFR in the central galaxy (Toomre & Toomre, 1972; Keel et al., 1985; Sanders et al., 1988; Barnes & Hernquist, 1996; Mihos & Hernquist, 1996; Tissera et al., 2002; Cox et al., 2006; Montuori et al., 2010; Rupke et al., 2010; Torrey et al., 2012). Consistent with the insight from the simulations, there have also been observations (Larson & Tinsley, 1978; Barton et al., 2000; Alonso et al., 2004; Nikolic et al., 2004; Woods et al., 2006; Woods & Geller, 2007; Barton et al., 2007; Ellison et al., 2008; Heiderman et al., 2009; Knapen & James, 2009; Robaina et al., 2009; Ellison et al., 2010; Woods et al., 2010; Patton et al., 2011) showing that, near redshift zero, the presence of nearby galaxies coincides with higher SFR, and that the separation of companions is inversely correlated with the SFR. Compared to galaxies in the star-forming main sequence, a larger fraction of starburst galaxies display merger features (Luo et al., 2014; Knapen & Cisternas, 2015; Blumenthal et al., 2020). In observations of the local universe, the majority of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs; L_{IR}\geq 10^{12}L_{\odot}, i.e., extreme starbursts), display features of strongly interacting systems such as bridges, tidal tails, and disturbed morphologies (e.g., Veilleux et al., 2002; Colina et al., 2005; Gao & Solomon, 2004; García-Burillo et al., 2012; Hung et al., 2013). At higher redshift, mergers are more common, and if the impact of mergers on the SFR activity is similar to the local universe, it is reasonable to assume that a larger fraction of the stellar mass created in that epoch is directly attributable to mergers. However, whether the effect of galaxy interactions on SFR enhancement at high redshift is different from the local universe is unclear. Some observational studies (Rodighiero et al., 2011; Schreiber et al., 2015; Lofthouse et al., 2017; Silva et al., 2018; Pearson et al., 2019) show a measurable but marginally statistically significant enhancement of the SFR in merging galaxies compared to the non-merging sample. There are simulations of idealized galaxies (Perret et al., 2014; Scudder et al., 2015; Fensch et al., 2017) with gas fractions typical of high-redshift galaxies, which found that the merger-induced star formation enhancement is weaker compared to galaxies with lower gas fractions. As the tidal features of galaxy interactions with lower mass ratios are more difficult to observe (especially at high redshift) due to lower surface brightness, minor interactions (stellar mass ratios \mu \leq 0.25; Jackson et al., 2022) and mini interactions (\mu \leq 0.1; Bottrell et al., 2024) have been difficult to observe, but new facilities may improve this situation. Galaxy simulations that can predict the observable properties can be useful in studying the effect of galaxy interactions of various mass ratios on the star formation history. The FIRE111http://fire.northwestern.edu suite of simulations (Hopkins et al., 2014, 2018) provide a useful laboratory to investigate how interactions affect the internal star formation properties of a galaxy. These simulations explicitly model the radiation pressure, stellar winds, and ionization of young stellar populations to account for the effects of feedback from star formation on their natal environment. This provides a physically realistic model of star formation that has shown success in reproducing a diverse range of observational results, from the relationship between stellar mass and halo mass of galaxies (Hopkins et al., 2014; Feldmann et al., 2017; Hopkins et al., 2018) to the mass-metallicity relationship of stars and gas within galaxies (Ma et al., 2016; Wetzel et al., 2016; Bassini et al., 2024; Marszewski et al., 2024). A defining feature of star formation in FIRE is its burstiness, which has been noted as key to how these simulations may be able to reproduce a variety of observational properties (Muratov et al., 2015; Sparre & Springel, 2016; Ma et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2021; Stern et al., 2021; Gurvich et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023). In this paper, we study the effect of tidal interactions on the star formation activity of the central galaxy using six zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass star-forming galaxies from the FIRE-2 simulation suite (Hopkins et al., 2018). In particular, we analyse the effects of major interactions (stellar mass ratios \mu \geq 0.25), minor interactions (0.1 \leq \mu < 0.25), and mini interactions (0.01 \leq \mu < 0.1) on the star formation histories of the central galaxies. The major interactions in our sample occur at high redshifts, between z=1.2 and z=3.6. The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we describe the simulations used in the analysis, the halo tracing methods, the SFR calculation and detrending, the classification of galaxy interactions, and the torque calculation; in Section 3 we show the results of this study; in Section 4 we discuss the results; in Section 5 we summarize the main findings from this study. We adopt a standard flat \LambdaCDM cosmology with cosmological parameters H_{0}=70.2\rm kms^{-1}Mpc^{-1}, \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.728, \Omega_{m}=1-\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.272, \Omega_{b}=0.0455, \sigma_{8}=0.807, and n=0.961."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10045v1,Discovery of a Rare Group of Dwarf Galaxies in the Local Universe,"We report the discovery of a rare isolated group of five dwarf galaxies located at z = 0.0086 (D = 36 Mpc). All member galaxies are star-forming, blue, and gas-rich with g-r indices ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 mag, and two of them show signs of ongoing mutual interaction. The most massive member of the group has a stellar mass that is half of the Small Magellanic Cloud stellar mass, and the median stellar mass of the group members is 7.87 \times 107 M☉. The derived total dynamical mass of the group is M_{\rm dyn} = 6.02\times1010 M☉, whereas its total baryonic mass (stellar + HI) is 2.6\times109 M☉, which gives us the dynamical to baryonic mass ratio of 23. Interestingly, all galaxies found in the group are aligned along a straight line in the plane of the sky. The observed spatial extent of the member galaxies is 154 kpc, and their relative line-of-sight velocity span is within 75 km s-1. Using the spatially resolved optical spectra provided by DESI EDR, we find that three group members share a common rotational direction. With these unique properties of the group and its member galaxies, we discuss the possible importance of such a system in the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxy groups and in testing the theory of large-scale structure formation.","The Lambda Cold Dark Matter (\LambdaCDM) model is successful in explaining the large-scale structure of the Universe, but it encounters difficulties with explaining many aspects of dwarf galaxies (White & Rees, 1978; Frenk & White, 2012; Bullock & Boylan-Kolchin, 2017). According to the \LambdaCDM theory, even low-mass halos possess detectable substructures, which implies that dwarf galaxies ought to have sub-halos and form individual groups (Diemand et al., 2008; Wheeler et al., 2015). Consequently, simulations predict mergers involving only dwarf galaxies (Deason et al., 2014). However, statistical analysis of both observational and simulation data estimated that fewer than 5% of dwarf galaxies have close companions, and there is less than a 0.004% chance that a dwarf galaxy would be part of a quad group (with the number of members equal to 4) of dwarf galaxies (Stierwalt et al., 2017; Besla et al., 2018). Moreover, very few of these close companion dwarf galaxies could undergo a merger. The interaction between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is a unique example that has been extensively studied in both observations and theoretical models (Putman et al., 1998; Besla et al., 2010; Glatt et al., 2010; Besla et al., 2012; Kallivayalil et al., 2013; D’Onghia & Fox, 2016; Kallivayalil et al., 2018). In addition, recent deep observation has revealed several new satellites around the LMC-SMC system (Koposov et al., 2015; Drlica-Wagner et al., 2015; Koposov et al., 2018). The discovery of the LMC group has revitalized the importance of LMC-SMC on the evolution of the Milky-Way (MW) satellite system and the MW itself; particularly, it is hypothesized that a fraction of the MW satellites is accreted as part of the LMC-SMC group, and that helps to explain the observed overdensity of globular clusters and satellite dwarfs in the direction of the LMC (Yoon & Lee, 2002; Sales et al., 2017; Erkal & Belokurov, 2020). Understanding the origin of the LMC-SMC group in the vicinity of the MW has been an active area of research (Cautun et al., 2019; Evans et al., 2020; Vasiliev, 2023). In this Letter, we report the discovery of a system of interacting dwarf galaxies within a group of at least five confirmed members. The most massive galaxy in this group has a stellar mass of M_{*} = 2.7\times108 M☉, which is half of the SMC stellar mass. This Letter is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the system and provide the details of data analysis. In Section 3, we discuss our findings, and we summarize them in Section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10007v1,Constraints on the history of Galactic spiral arms revealed by {Gaia} {GSP-Spec} \alpha-elements,"Context. The distribution of chemical elements in the Galactic disc can reveal fundamental clues on the physical processes that led to the current configuration of our Galaxy.Aims. We map chemical azimuthal variations in the disc using individual stellar chemical abundances like calcium and magnesium, and discuss their possible connection with the spiral arms and other perturbing mechanisms.Methods. Using Gaia Data Release 3, we examine [Ca/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] fluctuations in a \sim4 kpc region around the Sun, focusing on bright giant stars. We implemented a kernel density estimator technique to enhance the chemical inhomogeneities.Results. We observe radial gradients and azimuthal fluctuations in [\alpha/Fe] for young (\lessapprox 150 Myr) and old (\gtrapprox 2 Gyr) stars, with amplitudes varying according to the studied element. In young stars, those within spiral arms (e.g., Sagittarius-Carina and Local arms) are generally more metal and calcium-rich (\sim0–0.19 dex) but show lower [Ca/Fe] (\sim0.06 dex) and [Mg/Fe] (\sim0.05 dex) compared to inter-arm regions, suggesting enhanced iron production in spiral arms. These [alpha/Fe] depletions are analysed in light of theoretical scenarios and compared to a 2D chemical evolution model with multiple spiral patterns. For the old sample, [Ca/Fe] maps reveal deficiencies along a segment of the Local arm identified by young stars. We caution that, for this old sample, the quality of the obtained maps might be limited along a specific line-of-sight, due to the Gaia scanning law.Conclusions. This study transitions our understanding of disc chemical evolution from a 1D radial view to a more detailed 2D framework incorporating radial, azimuthal, and small-scale variations. Individual chemical abundances prove essential for tracing spiral arms in disc galaxies. We recommend models and simulations incorporate alpha-abundance trends to better address spiral arm lifetimes.","The ability to map the structural, kinematic and chemical properties of stars in our Galaxy has revealed that the classical components of the Milky Way (MW), namely the disc(s) (composed of the thin and thick discs Gilmore & Reid, 1983), the bulge and the halo, are interlinked and constitute a system interacting with its environment (e.g. Helmi et al., 2018; Antoja et al., 2023). The accretion of satellite galaxies can leave important signatures in the Galactic disc (Purcell et al., 2011; Laporte et al., 2018; Garavito-Camargo et al., 2021). Moreover, the large-scale spiral structure of the Galaxy (e.g. Georgelin & Georgelin, 1976; Taylor & Cordes, 1993; Reid et al., 2019; Minniti et al., 2021) and the central bar (e.g. Okuda et al., 1977; Palicio et al., 2018; Khoperskov et al., 2020; Gaia Collaboration et al., 2023a) are expected to be crucial drivers of the dynamical evolution of disc stars (e.g. Schönrich & Binney, 2009; Minchev et al., 2012; Hunt et al., 2019; Santos-Peral et al., 2021; Palicio et al., 2023, and others). As a consequence of the dynamical mechanisms at work in the Galactic disc, the star kinematic history can be completely erased. On the other hand, the chemical composition will be preserved through the stellar life. In a galaxy with a radial metallicity gradient (Anders et al., 2017; Katz et al., 2021), any process of radial migration would give rise to chemical azimuthal variations. To disentangle the dynamical history of Galactic stellar populations, mapping the spatial distribution of metals in the disc has a crucial importance. In external disc galaxies, both radial and azimuthal chemical gradients have been mapped (Pilyugin et al., 2014; Vogt et al., 2017; Zurita et al., 2021). In the MW, chemical azimuthal variations have been found using HII regions (Balser et al., 2011; Wenger et al., 2019), Cepheids (Genovali et al., 2014; Kovtyukh et al., 2022) and the interstellar medium (De Cia et al., 2021), amongst others. With the advent of Gaia Data Release (DR) 3 (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2023c), azimuthal variations were mapped in the metallicity of both young and old stars (Poggio et al., 2022; Gaia Collaboration et al., 2023b; Hawkins, 2023). More precisely, using young giants (\lessapprox 150 Myr), Poggio et al. (2022) mapped local metallicity enhancements at the level of \sim 0.1 dex, which appeared to be statistically correlated with the position of the nearest spiral arms in the Galaxy. Using giant stars in Gaia DR3, Hawkins (2023) detected azimuthal variations which appeared to be co-located with the spiral arms; however, using OBAF-type stars in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), they found that the correlation was not evident. Based on numerical simulations, spiral arms are expected to drive azimuthal variations in the disc metallicity (Grand et al., 2016; Khoperskov et al., 2018, 2023; Debattista et al., 2024). Moreover, azimuthal metallicity substructures can be caused by the radial migration induced by satellite galaxies (Carr et al., 2022) and/or the Galactic bar (Di Matteo et al., 2013; Filion et al., 2023). This complexity reveals the need of further constraints on the structural and chemo-dynamical characteristics of the Galactic disc in both the radial and the azimuthal dimensions. Up to now, analytic chemical evolution models of the Galactic disc ignore azimuthal surface density variations, with the recent exception of the 2D Spitoni et al. (2019, 2023) or Mollá et al. (2019) models. One of the main results of Spitoni et al. (2023) is that elements synthesised on short time scales, like \alpha-elements, exhibit larger abundance fluctuations along the spiral arms than heavier elements like iron (Fe) and barium (Ba) produced with a larger time delay. The aim of this study is a detailed analysis of the chemical inhomogeneities in the MW disc, with the goal of detecting the spiral arm signatures in calcium and magnesium, and more generally to explore radial and azimuthal chemical variations in the disc. In Section 2 the details of our data selections and methodology are explained. Section 3 describes our results and Section 4 summarizes our discussions and conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09903v1,"The H  Mass Function of the Local Universe: Combining Measurements from HIPASS, ALFALFA and FASHI","We present the first H i mass function (HIMF) measurement for the recent FAST All Sky H i (FASHI) survey and the most complete measurements of HIMF in the local universe so far by combining the H i catalogues from H i Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS), Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) and FASHI surveys at redshift 0<z<0.05, covering 76% of the entire sky. We adopt the same methods to estimate distances, calculate sample completeness, and determine the HIMF for all three surveys. The best-fitting Schechter function for the total HIMF has a low-mass slope parameter \alpha=-1.30\pm 0.01 and a ‘knee’ mass \log(M_{s}/h_{70}^{-2}M_{\sun})=9.86\pm 0.01 and a normalisaztion \phi_{s}=(6.58\pm 0.23)\times 10^{-3}h_{70}^{3}\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}dex^{-1}}. This gives the cosmic H i abundance \Omega_{\textrm{H {i}}}=(4.54\pm 0.20)\times 10^{-4}h_{70}^{-1}. We find that a double Schechter function with the same slope \alpha better describes our HIMF, and the two different ‘knee’ masses are \log(M_{s_{1}}/h_{70}^{-2}M_{\sun})=9.96\pm 0.03 and \log(M_{s_{2}}/h_{70}^{-2}M_{\sun})=9.65\pm 0.07. We verify that the measured HIMF is marginally affected by the choice of distance estimates. The effect of cosmic variance is significantly suppressed by combining the three surveys and it provides a unique opportunity to obtain an unbiased estimate of the HIMF in the local universe.","Neutral hydrogen, in its atomic (H i) and molecular (H2) forms, plays an important role in the baryon cycle of galaxies (see e.g., Péroux & Howk 2020; Saintonge & Catinella 2022, for reviews). Although H2 is the direct fuel for star formation, H i serves as the reservoir to form H2. Understanding the distribution of H i and how it is correlated with the properties of galaxies is crucial for theoretical studies of galaxy formation and evolution. The two most important measurements for describing the H i content are the cosmic H i abundance (\Omega_{\textrm{H {i}}}) and the H i mass function (HIMF). \Omega_{\textrm{H {i}}} quantifies the total H i mass in the universe and its evolution with redshift, \Omega_{\textrm{H {i}}}(z), is closely related to the star formation history of galaxies (e.g., Rafieferantsoa et al. 2019; Kamphuis et al. 2022). As the counterpart of the galaxy stellar mass function in an optical survey, the HIMF describes the number densities of galaxies in different H i mass bins and provides the mass distribution of the H i gas in addition to the total abundance of \Omega_{\textrm{H {i}}}. In the local universe, \Omega_{\textrm{H {i}}} can be accurately determined by directly summing up the HIMF. At higher redshifts, \Omega_{\textrm{H {i}}} is usually estimated using the stacked H i signals and the damped Ly\alpha systems, although with large uncertainties (see Péroux & Howk 2020, and references therein). The HIMF is not only useful to derive \Omega_{\textrm{H {i}}}, but also encodes essential information about galaxy assembly histories. Since the H i gas distribution is very sensitive to accretion and feedback mechanisms (e.g. Fu et al. 2013; Popping et al. 2015; Xie et al. 2017; Guo et al. 2022), the HIMF serves as a valuable tool to distinguish between various galaxy formation models, where the galaxy stellar mass functions at low redshifts are typically well reproduced (e.g., Baugh et al. 2019; Davé et al. 2020). The HIMF also shows a strong dependence on the halo and large-scale environment (e.g., Zwaan et al. 2005; Jones et al. 2020; Ma et al. 2024). Precise measurements of the HIMF are also the key science goal of current and future H i surveys, including the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind Survey (WALLABY; Koribalski et al. 2020), the MeerKAT International GigaHertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE; Jarvis et al. 2016), and the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) All Sky H i survey (FASHI; Zhang et al. 2024). In the local universe (z<0.06), the HIMF has been directly measured by the H i Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS; Barnes et al. 2001; Meyer et al. 2004) and the Arecibo Fast Legacy ALFA Survey (ALFALFA; Giovanelli et al. 2005; Haynes et al. 2011). It has been found that the measured HIMF, \phi(M_{\textrm{H {i}}}), can be well described by a Schechter function (Schechter 1976), \phi(M_{\textrm{H {i}}})=\frac{dn}{d\log M_{\textrm{H {i}}}}=\ln(10)\phi_{s}% \left(\frac{M_{\textrm{H {i}}}}{M_{s}}\right)^{\alpha+1}\exp\left(-\frac{M_{% \textrm{H {i}}}}{M_{s}}\right), (1) where \phi_{s} is the normalization, \alpha+1 is the low-mass end slope, and M_{s} is the ‘knee’ mass. Zwaan et al. (2005) used HIPASS and made one of the first HIMF measurements at z\sim 0, finding a ‘knee’ mass of \log(M_{s}/h_{70}^{-2}M_{\sun})=9.80\pm 0.03 and a slope of \alpha=-1.37\pm 0.03. Using the 40% complete sample of ALFALFA that has much better sensitivity and resolution than HIPASS, Martin et al. (2010) found a higher ‘knee’ mass (\log(M_{s}/h_{70}^{-2}M_{\sun})=9.96\pm 0.02) and a slightly flatter slope (\alpha=-1.33\pm 0.03). The HIMF measurement was later updated by Jones et al. (2018) with the final ALFALFA sample, and they found a consistent ‘knee’ mass of \log(M_{s}/h_{70}^{-2}M_{\sun})=9.94, but a much shallower slope (\alpha=-1.25\pm 0.02). In optical surveys, galaxy stellar mass estimates may depend on various assumptions of initial mass functions, dust extinction laws, and stellar population synthesis models. The H i mass estimate of a target galaxy has the great advantage that it suffers from much less systematics and mainly depends on the uncertainties in the source distance (D_{L}) and the integrated H i line flux (S_{21}) (Meyer et al. 2017), as well as the unquantified self-absorption line. However, most blind H i surveys are not volume-limited in nature. The number of measured H i targets depends on both S_{21} and the width of the line profile (W_{50}). Galaxies with higher flux and narrower line profiles are much easier to detect (Giovanelli et al. 2005; Haynes et al. 2011). Therefore, it is crucial to quantify the sample completeness due to the selection effect. As shown in Guo et al. (2023), the differences between the HIMF measurements of Martin et al. (2010) and Jones et al. (2018) are caused by both cosmic variance and the adopted completeness cuts, where the 50% completeness cut is used in Jones et al. (2018), causing the shallower low-mass slope. As investigated in Jones et al. (2018), the systematic uncertainties in the HIMF caused by distance estimates are very minor, only changing \log M_{s} and \alpha at the level of 0.01. The remaining source of systematic uncertainties, and likely the most important one when comparing the HIMFs of different surveys, is the cosmic variance effect. That is, the intrinsic HIMFs in different survey volumes, no matter how accurately they are measured, could vary from each other. This effect is already shown in the HIMF measurements of the final sample of ALFALFA. The differences between the separate measurements of \alpha in the Spring and Fall sky regions of ALFALFA are 0.14, even when all other conditions are the same (see Fig. 3 of Jones et al. 2018). The apparent discrepancies between the HIMFs of HIPASS (southern sky) and ALFALFA (northern sky) could be caused by variations in galaxy populations and large-scale structures (Ma et al. 2024), as well as the different methods of estimating sample completeness and target distances. However, galaxies with low H i masses can only be probed in a very limited redshift range, since the H i flux for a given H i mass would decrease rapidly as the distance increases (S_{21}\propto D_{L}^{-2}). To minimise the cosmic variance effect, we can increase the volume by conducting deeper H i surveys or covering a larger sky area. Recently, the first catalogue of the FASHI survey has been released (Zhang et al. 2024). It features significantly enhanced sensitivity, resolution and depth compared to previous surveys. This catalogue covers approximately 7600 square degrees of the sky, which is also complementary to the existing HIPASS and ALFALFA sky coverage. It offers an unprecedented opportunity to measure the most accurate HIMF in the local volume by combining the three survey catalogues. In this paper, our aim is to measure the HIMF by combining the H i sources in the HIPASS, ALAFLFA and FASHI surveys, with a total sky coverage of around 31,528 \deg^{2} (i.e. nearly 76% of the entire sky). Most importantly, we will process all three catalogues using the same set of distance estimates, sample completeness corrections, and calculation method of HIMF. The resulting HIMF will provide an important reference for future H i surveys. The organisation of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the observational data used in the constraints. Section 3 describes the methods that we use in estimating HIMF. We show the results in Section 4. The discussion and conclusions are presented in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively. Throughout the paper, all masses are expressed in units of M_{\sun}. We adopt a flat \LambdaCDM cosmology of \Omega_{\rm m}=0.3 and the Hubble constant is assumed to be H_{0}=70\,h_{70}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09889v1,Kinematics of Young Stellar Objects Under Various Stellar Feedback,"Based on the Gaia Data Release 3 and APOGEE datasets, we investigate the kinematic differences between young stellar objects (YSOs) and their parent clouds in five nearby star-forming regions. Overall, the 1D velocity differences between Class II YSOs and their parent molecular cloud range from [0, 1.4] km s-1. In feedback environments dominated by outflows, massive stars, and supernova feedback, the corresponding velocity differences range from [0, 1.4] km s-1, [0.1, 0.4] km s-1, and [0.1, 1] km s-1, respectively. These results indicate that YSO kinematics are not significantly affected by these different types of feedback environment. Additionally, compared to the Class II YSOs, Class III YSOs have slightly larger velocities and dispersions.","1 introduction The vast majority of stars form in clusters within molecular clouds, subsequently evolving into star clusters, associations, or isolated stars, and eventually dissolving into the Galactic gravitational field (e.g., de Zeeuw et al., 1999; Lada & Lada, 2003; Buckner et al., 2019; Krause et al., 2020). Stars form in molecular clouds through gravitational collapse, and are influenced by turbulence (e.g., Hennebelle & Falgarone, 2012; Guerrero-Gamboa & Vázquez-Semadeni, 2020), stellar feedback (e.g., Lada & Lada, 2003; Rey-Raposo et al., 2017), and magnetic fields (e.g., Ostriker et al., 2001; McKee & Ostriker, 2007). Currently, our understanding of the kinematic processes of star formation remains quite limited. Young stellar objects (YSOs), which are very young and still associated with their parent molecular clouds, can potentially serve as tracers to reveal the kinematics of the star formation process. In recent studies, researchers have made significant progress in understanding the relationship between molecular clouds and star formation by combining observations of YSOs and molecular gas. For example, Gaia astrometry data of YSOs have been used to explore the structure of molecular clouds (e.g., Kounkel et al., 2022; Tu et al., 2022), the history of star formation (e.g., Großschedl et al., 2021; Krolikowski et al., 2021), and the expansion of young star clusters (Kuhn et al., 2019). In these studies, researchers generally assume that the parallaxes and proper motions of the YSOs can serve as proxies for the distances and proper motions of the molecular gas therein. However, due to stellar feedback, the kinematics of the YSOs may not be entirely consistent with that of their parent molecular clouds. During the star formation process, various feedback environments such as protostellar outflows (e.g., Arce et al., 2010; Dionatos & Güdel, 2017), stellar winds from massive stars and H ii regions (e.g., Pabst et al., 2019; Grudić et al., 2022), and supernova explosions (e.g., Wareing et al., 2017; Krumholz et al., 2019) inject momentum into star-forming regions. These processes are theoretically capable of displacing surrounding material and potentially influencing the kinematics of newly formed stars within the cloud. However, to date, there remains a lack of research comparing the kinematic characteristics of YSOs with their parent molecular clouds, which is the purpose of our research. By revealing the kinematic differences and their extent between YSOs and their parent molecular clouds, we aim to provide a foundation for studying star formation and kinematic evolution. Now, we have the opportunity to explore the kinematic characteristics of YSOs and compare them with the motions of their parent molecular clouds. First, molecular line surveys provide us with distribution and kinematic information of molecular clouds (Dame et al., 2001). Second, a large number of YSOs have been identified through previous surveys, such as Gutermuth et al. (2009); Megeath et al. (2012); Furlan et al. (2016). Thus, by crossmatching infrared-selected YSOs with Gaia’s high-precision astrometric data (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2023), we can obtain kinematic information for a significant number of YSOs. The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 describes the star-forming regions and the corresponding YSO samples. Section 3 presents the distribution and kinematics of the star-forming regions and YSOs. Section 4 provides a statistical analysis of the kinematic characteristics of YSOs in different feedback environments. Finally, Section 5 provides a summary."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09781v1,Changing Look AGN: An X-ray Look,"To date, a number of changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known. We studied, in detail what happens to the X-ray spectrum during the CL events using the example of the nearby CL Seyfert NGC 1566, which was observed by Swift, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku. We applied the Comptonization model to describe an evolution of NGC 1566 X-ray spectra during outbursts and compared these results with a typical behavior for other AGNs to identify some differences and common properties that can ultimately help us to better understand the physics of the CL phenomenon. We found that changes in the X-ray properties of NGC 1566 are characterized by a different combination of Sy1 (using 1H 0707–495 as a representative) and Sy2 properties (using NGC 7679 and Mrk 3 as their representatives). At high X-ray luminosities NGC 1566 exhibits the behavior typical for Sy1, and at low luminosities we see a transition of NGC 1566 from the Sy1 behavior to the Sy2 pattern. We revealed the saturation of the spectral indices, \alpha for these four AGNs during outbursts (\alpha_{1566}\sim 1.1, \alpha_{0707}\sim 2, \alpha_{7679}\sim 0.9 and \alpha_{mrk3}\sim 0.9) and determined the masses of the black holes (BHs) in the centers of these AGNs namely, M{}_{0707}\sim 6.8\times 10^{7} M⊙, M{}_{7679}\sim 8.4\times 10^{6} M⊙, M{}_{mrk3}\sim 2.2\times 10^{8} M⊙ and M{}_{1566}\sim 2\times 10^{5} M⊙, applying the scaling method. Our spectral analysis shows that the changing-look of NGC1566 from Sy1.2 to Sy1.9 in 2019 was accompanied by the transition of NGC 1566 to an accretion regime which is typical for the intermediate and highly soft spectral states of other BHs. We also find that when going from Sy2 to Sy1, the spectrum of NGC 1566 shows an increase in the soft excess accompanied by a decrease in the Comptonized fraction (0.1<f<0.5), which is consistent with the typical behavior of BH sources during X-ray outburst decay. Our results strongly suggest that the large diversity in its behavior observed among CL, Sy1, and Sy2 AGNs with different X-ray luminosities can be explained by changes in a single variable parameter, such as the ratio of the AGN’s X-ray luminosity to its Eddington luminosity, without any need for additional differences in Sy AGN parameters, such as its inclination, thereby blurring the distinction between the Sy1, Sy2 and CL-AGN subclasses.","Recent detections of numerous changing-look active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN) events have led to a surge of interest in the study of this phenomenon. The origin of the CL-AGN events is still unclear. NGC 1566 galaxy is a prominent representative of the CL-AGN subclass of AGNs. Its supermassive black hole (SMBH) is estimated to be (1.3\pm0.6)\times 10^{7} M⊙. As the closest galaxy (z=0.005, see also Table 1) among the CL-AGNs, NGC 1566 has been intensively studied over the past 70 years. It was first classified as a Seyfert 1 (Sy1) with the broad Hα and Hβ lines (de Vaucouleurs & de Vaucouleurs, 1961). The Hβ line was later found to be weak, leading to the source being classified as Seyfert 2 (Sy2) (Pastoriza & Gerola, 1970). This is consistent with the generally accepted classification of AGN as Sy1 or Sy2, depending on the presence or absence of broad optical emission lines. The existence of different classes of AGN can be explained using a unified model (Antonucci, 1993), based on the orientation of an optically thick torus relative to the line of our vision. However, NGC 1566 exhibits the appearance or disappearance of broad optical emission lines, transitioning from Sy 2 (or Sy 1.8–1.9) to Sy 1 (or Sy 1.2–1.5) and vice versa within a few months (da Silva et al., 2017), and does not fit into the generally accepted classification and constitutes a significant problem in our understanding of AGN. Since 2018, observations of NGC 1566 have been carried out in many wavelength ranges: from hard X-rays (see X-ray image of NGC 1566 in Fig. 2) to infrared rays (Ducci et al., 2018). It became clear that the NGC 1566 flux varies in all wavelengths. In particular, in July 2018, its flux increased strongly and reached its peak (Parker et al., 2019; Oknyansky et al., 2019, 2020). Long-term light curves of ASAS-SN and NEOWISE showed that the IR and optical flux began to increase as early as September 2017 (Cutri et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2018). The Swift/XRT flux increased by about 30 times (Fig. 1) when the source changed from Sy1.8–1.9 to Sy1.2 (Oknyansky et al., 2020, 2019). The source became Sy1 with an appearance of strong broad emission lines (Oknyansky et al., 2019; Ochmann et al., 2020). Having reached their peak, the source fluxes decreased in all wavebands. Several smaller flares were observed after the main outburst (Grupe et al., 2018, 2019). This 2018–2019 outburst of NGC 1566 with a CL-effect was observed using NuSTAR and XMM-Newton. Jana et al. (2021) investigated these observations applying the power-law, NTHCOMP, OPTXAGNF and RELXILL models with an addition of Gaussian lines and taking into account X-ray absorption effects. Each of these models shed light on the CL-peculiarities and the change in the object itself. In the power-law model, Jana et al. (2021) found the presence of a soft excess (< 2 keV), which they approximated by an additional bbody component. This model fits well the XMM-Newton data for about 2.5 years before the 2018 outburst with parameters N_{H}=(3.53\pm 0.06)\times 10^{21} cm-2 and a photon index \Gamma\sim 1.7 (\Gamma=\alpha-1). Moreover, an iron Kα emission line was detected at 6.4 keV with an equivalent width (EW) of 200 eV. The rise phase of the 2018 outburst was analyzed using simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of NGC 1566, and in this model the fit yielded \Gamma=1.8. The Fe Kα line was detected at 6.38 keV with an EW>110 eV, as well as the Fe XXVI emission feature at 6.87 keV with an EW< 37 eV. It is interesting to note that two ionized absorbers were required to fit the source spectra in the rise phase, one low-ionization absorber (\xi\sim 101.7\pm 0.1) with N_{H,1}=(8.1\pm 2.2)\times 10^{20} cm-2, and one high-ionization absorber (\xi\sim 104.7\pm 0.4) with N_{H,2}=(4.3\pm 0.4)\times 10^{21} cm-2. In the outburst decay phase the photon index was almost constant (\Gamma\sim 1.7), the blackbody temperature was constant kT_{bb}\sim 110 eV and the Fe Kα line was detected with EW > 100 eV. Although column density of the weakly ionizing absorber varied in the range of N_{H,1}\sim(1.2-1.3)\times 10^{21} cm-2, no highly ionizing absorber was required to fit the spectra during the outburst decay. In addition, a weak reflection hump was detected as an excess of emission at energies 15–40 keV. In the NTHCOMP model, Jana et al. (2021) fixed the seed photon temperature at kT_{s}=30 eV. They again needed to account for two absorption components during the outburst rise and initial decay phases. They found that as the corona size R_{cor} decreased, the plasma electron temperature kT_{e} increased from 60 to 100 keV with a nearly constant photon index (\Gamma=1.7-1.9). To model this NGC 1566 outburst with OPTXAGNF Jana et al. (2021) again accounted for two absorption components during the outburst rise and initial decay phases. The photon index \Gamma and optical depth \tau were held almost constant at \Gamma=1.7-1.8 and \tau\sim 4-5 throughout the 2018 outburst. Before this outburst, the Eddington ratio and the size of the X-ray corona were found to be small (L/L_{Edd}\sim 0.04 and R_{cor}=12R_{g}) compared to the rise phase outburst (L/L_{Edd}\sim 0.23 and R_{cor}=43R_{g}). In later observations, they decreased L/L_{Edd}\sim 0.06 and R_{cor}\sim 20R_{g}. This model fit all observations well and indicated an increase in the accretion rate and corona size at the outburst peak, as well as a high degree of the plasma Comptonization during the outburst. The RELXILL model again required taking into account two absorption components during the rising and initial decay phases of the outburst. In addition, the model included the reprocessed X-ray emission from the disk as a reflectivity parameter R_{refl}, which turned out to be relatively weak (R_{refl}\sim 0.1-0.2) throughout the outburst. The inner disk edge R_{in} varied from 4R_{g} to 7R_{g}. Tripathi & Dewangan (2022a), hereafter TD22a also analyzed NGC 1566 using XMM-Newton, Swift and NuSTAR data at different epochs during the decay phase of the 2018 outburst using a broadband continuum model OPTXAGNF (Done et al., 2012) taking into account the thermal Comptonization (THCOMP) and the reflection (RELXILL) model, as well as investigated the correlations between the accretion disk X-ray emission, soft X-ray excess and the power-law continuum. They argued that at low X-ray flux levels, the source soft X-ray excess was absent and only the disk emission provided seed photons for thermal Comptonization in the corona, while at high flux levels, both the soft X-ray excess and the disk emission were present, providing seed photons for the thermal Comptonization in the corona. TD22a found that the X-ray photon index remained constant (\Gamma\sim 1.66-1.72), although the electron temperature of the corona increased from 22 to 200 keV from June 2018 to August 2019. At the same time, the optical depth of the corona \tau decreased from 4 to 0.7, and the scattering fraction increased from 1% to 10%. TD22a interpreted this as an increase in the size of the corona and its heating with a decrease in the mass accretion rate during the decay phase. Different models are used to study AGN, including those specifically designed for AGN (assuming a specific structure of active galactic nuclei) and generalized models (with a minimum number of specific assumptions). The first of these, such as the AGNSED model (Kubota & Done, 2018) and models taking into account the double (warm and hot) corona (Petrucci et al., 2013), consider three zones of AGN X-ray formation: an outer standard disc, an inner warm Comptonizing region (to produce the soft X-ray excess) and a hot corona (see Fig. 10 in Petrucci et al. (2013)). Generalized models such as the BMC (Titarchuk et al., 1997; Titarchuk & Zannias, 1998; Laurent & Titarchuk, 1999; Borozdin et al., 1999; Shrader & Titarchuk, 1996), NTHComp (Zdziarski et al., 1996), Comptb (Farinelli & Titarchuk, 2011), Comptt (Titarchuk, 1994) are based on the first principles and also consider three X-ray formation regions: an outer standard disc, a hot Comptonizing region (a so called Transition layer) to reproduce the soft X-ray excess and a thermal Comptoniziation hump in the source spectrum, and a converging flow region (possibly analogous to a hot corona, to form a hard high-energy tail in the source X-ray spectrum). In this paper, we apply these generalized models to identify the features of CL-AGN compared to Sy1 and Sy2, without assuming a specific geometry of these sources. In addition, for better understanding the properties of NGC 1566 during CL events, it is interesting to compare the behavior of this CL-AGN with other AGNs, such as Sy1 and Sy2. To do this, we used the Sy1 galaxy (1H 0707–495) and the Sy2 galaxy (NGC 7679) to study their differences and similarities during X-ray outbursts in comparison to CL-AGN. The Narrow-Line Sy 1 galaxy 1H 0707–495 (z = 0.0411, hereafter 1H 0707, see also Table 1) is a bright Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy (Leighly, 1999). BH mass estimates in 1H 0707 vary over a wide range from 2\times 10^{6} to 107 M⊙ Zhou & Wang (2005); Kara et al. (2013); Done & Jin (2016). In particular, Zoghbi et al. (2011) assumed that most of the radiation is emitted at \sim 2r_{g} and estimated the inner radius and the emissivity index using their spectral fitting. They interpreting the 30 s lag as the light crossing time and estimated a BH mass of M_{BH}\sim 2\times 10^{6}M_{\odot}, which was consistent with the uncertain mass of this BH quoted in the literature (Zhou & Wang, 2005). NGC 7679 is a barred lenticular galaxy seen face on (Yankulova et al., 2007). It is located at a distance of about 200 million light years from Earth (see also Table 1). It was discovered by Heinrich d’Arrest on September 23, 1864. The nucleus of NGC 7679 turned out to be active and was classified as a Seyfert galaxy. The most common theory for the energy source of Seyfert galaxies is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. NGC 7679 is believed to host a supermassive black hole, with a mass estimated at 5.9\times 10^{6} M⊙ based on velocity dispersion (Alonso-Herrero et al., 2013). The X-ray spectrum of NGC 7679 using BeppoSAX shows no significant absorption above 2 keV, and the Kα line of iron was only slightly detected. However, the galaxy shows signs of obstruction to visual light as it lacks broad emission lines. Two possible reasons: the presence of dust or an X-ray emitting accretion disk that is not covered and the broad line region is covered (Risaliti, 2002a). To date, the classification of NGC 7679 as Sy1 or Sy2 remains controversial. On the one hand, this AGN has an optical spectrum without broad emission lines, which allows it to be classified as a Sy2 (Risaliti, 2002a). On the other hand, NGC 7679 has significant variable X-ray emission, typical of Sy1. The main feature of objects like NGC 7679 is not the strength of their starburst, but the apparent optical faintness of the Sy1 nucleus when compared to the X-ray luminosity. As a second representative of Sy2 galaxies we used Markarian 3 (hereafter Mrk 3), which is one of the brightest and best-studied members of the Sy2 class. The host galaxy is classified as an elliptical or S0 galaxy type. Awaki et al. (1990), Awaki et al. (1991) and Smith & Done (1996) revealed an anomalously flat power-law continuum emerging through a tall occultation column (N_{H}\sim 6\times 10^{23} cm-2) from GINGA observations of Mrk 3. A strong Fe line with high equivalent width (EW\sim 1.3 keV) was also detected. Mrk 3 has the hardest spectrum among all 16 Sy2 galaxies studied by Smith & Done (1996), significantly harder than the spectrum of Sy1 galaxies. In ASCA observations of Mrk 3, the object showed a spectrum with a photon index \Gamma\sim 1.8 and a two-component iron line (Iwasawa et al., 1994). Thus, the dominant component of the Kα iron line at 6.4 keV has EW=0.9 keV, while the second component at 7 keV has EW=0.2 keV. A reanalysis of the spectrum of Mrk 3 using non-simultaneous GiINGA, ROSAT and ASCA observations (Griffiths et al., 1998) covering a wide spectral band (0.1–30 keV) yielded a typical value for the power law, \Gamma\sim 1.7, when either an additional absorption edge at 8 keV (possibly arising from a warm absorber) or reflection was included in the spectral model. Recent observations with BeppoSAX (Cappi et al., 1999), which extend the spectral coverage to 150 keV, indeed confirm a presence of a steep (\Gamma\sim 1.8) internal power law. Turner et al. (1997) also reanalyzed the ASCA data and proposed an alternative model in which the internal continuum is resolved through very large absorption column (N_{H}>10^{24} cm-2), while the reflection component is not obscured. Georgantopoulos et al. (1999) analyzed the RXTE data for Mrk 3 and found an agreement with the earlier results of GINGA. They used a spectral model consisting of a very hard power-law continuum (\Gamma\sim 1.1) modified below \sim6 keV by a strongly absorbing column (N_{H}\sim 6\times 10^{23} cm-2) and an iron line with a high equivalent width at 6.4 keV. Their conclusions are consistent with the results by Turner et al. (1997) on the complex absorption of a molecular torus. It is interesting to note that Boorman et al. (2018) found an anti-correlation between the equivalence width of the narrow core of the neutral Fe K\alpha fluorescence line, ubiquitously observed in the reflection spectra of obscured AGNs, and the mid-infrared continuum luminosity at 12 \mum. This is consistent with numerous studies of the X-ray Baldwin effect for unobscured and slightly obscured AGNs and challenges the traditional view that the Fe K\alpha line originates from the same region as the underlying reflection continuum, which together make up the reflection spectrum. However, the found anti-correlation does not apply to Mrk 3, as Ricci et al. (2015) find a Compton-thin column density (90% confidence level) for this source. Risaliti (2002b) discuss another type of X-ray changing look for AGNs based on changes in column density (from 20% to 80%) during AGN X-ray variability on time scales of months to years. Namely, the AGN switched between thin Compton thin (N_{H}<1.5\times 10^{24} cm-2) and Compton thick (N_{H}>1.5\times 10^{24} cm-2) regimes (see also Matt et al. (2003)). To describe the BH states in AGN during outbursts, it is convenient to use the terminology used to identify the BH states in X-ray binaries (XRBs). Thus, the observed manifestations of BHs in galactic sources are traditionally described in terms of a classification of BH spectral states (see Klein-Wolt & van der Klis (2008); Remillard & McClintock (2006); Belloni et al. (2005), for various definitions of BH states). A general classification of BH states for four main BH states is accepted by the community: the quiescent, the low hard (LHS), the intermediate (IS, sometimes subdivided into Hard intermediate, HIMS, and Soft intermediate, SIMS) and the high soft (HSS) states. When a BH transient goes into an outburst, it leaves the quiescent state and enters the LHS, a low-luminosity state with an energy spectrum dominated by the thermal component of Comptonization combined with a weak thermal component. The photon spectrum in the LHS is thought to be the result of Comptonization (upward scattering) of soft photons, which originated in the relatively weak inner part of the accretion disk, from electrons in the hot surrounding plasma (see, e.g., Sunyaev & Titarchuk (1980)). The HSS photon spectrum is characterized by a pronounced thermal component, which is probably a sign of strong radiation emanating from the geometrically thin accretion disk. The IS is a transition state between the LHS and the HSS. At the same time, the subdivision the IS into SIMS and HIMS states reflects the specifics of a BH source at the entrance and exit from the outburst. As for supermassive BHs in AGNs, despite the different time scale, sizes and sources of accreted matter compared to XRBs, they show a similar pattern of the spectral changes during their outbursts. Therefore, we use the terminology given above, but note that there is, of course, no direct analogy. In addition, the excess soft radiation of AGNs is another component of the Comptonization effect, since the disk temperature of AGNs is much lower. X-ray spectroscopy is a very powerful tool for shedding light on the CL-AGN relationship, mainly because X-rays are emitted closer to the primary emission source than optical emission lines, which are reprocessed emission from interstellar gas (e.g., Terashimai et al. (2009)). In this paper we present the comparative analysis for NGC 1566, 1H 0707–495 and NGC 7679 using the Suzaku, ASCA, Swift and BeppoSAX observations. In §2 we present the list of observations used in our data analysis while in §3 we provide the details of X-ray spectral analysis. We analyze an evolution of X-ray spectral and timing properties during the state transition in §4. In §5 we present a description of the spectral models used for fitting these data. In §6 we discuss the main results of the paper. In §7 we present our final conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09755v1,The  line emission as an ISM probe in the  galaxies,"Context. The [C II] fine-structure line at 157.74 \mum is one of the brightest far-infrared emission lines in galaxies and an important probe of galaxy properties such as the star formation rate (SFR) and the molecular gas mass (M_{\mathrm{mol}}).Aims. Using high-resolution numerical simulations, we test the reliability of the [C II] line as a tracer of M_{\mathrm{mol}} in high-redshift galaxies and investigate secondary dependences of the [{C\textsc{II}}]-M_{\mathrm{mol}} relation on the SFR and metallicity. We also investigate the time evolution of the [C II] luminosity function (LF) and the relative spatial extent of [C II] emission and star formation.Methods. We post-process galaxies from the Marigold cosmological simulations at redshifts 3\leq z\leq 7 to obtain their [C II] emission. These simulations were performed with the sub-grid chemistry model, Hyacinth, to track the non-equilibrium abundances of \mathrm{H_{2}}, \mathrm{CO}, \rm C and \mathrm{C^{+}} on the fly. Based on a statistical sample of galaxies at these redshifts, we investigate correlations between the [C II] line luminosity (L_{[{C\textsc{II}}]}) and the SFR, the M_{\mathrm{mol}}, the total gas mass and the metal mass in gas phase (M_{\mathrm{metal}}).Results. We find that accounting for secondary dependencies in the L_{[{C\textsc{II}}]}-M_{\mathrm{mol}} relation improves the M_{\mathrm{mol}} prediction by a factor of 2.3 at all redshifts. Our simulations predict a mild evolution in the slope of the L_{[{C\textsc{II}}]}-\mathrm{SFR} relation (\lesssim 0.15 dex) and an increase in the intercept by 0.5 dex in the above redshift range. Among the various galaxy properties we explore, the [C II] emission in our simulated galaxies shows the tightest correlation with M_{\mathrm{metal}}, indicating the potential of this line to constrain the metallicity of high-redshift galaxies. About 20% (10%) of our simulated galaxies at z=5 (z=4) have [C II] emission extending \geq 2 times farther than the star formation activity. The [C II] LF evolves rapidly and is always well approximated by a double power law that does not show an exponential cutoff at the bright end. We record a 600-fold increase in the number density of L_{[{C\textsc{II}}]}\sim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{L_{\odot}} emitters in 1.4 Gyr.","The fine-structure line of singly-ionised carbon (\mathrm{C^{+}}) at a wavelength of 157.74\,\mu\rm m (hereafter [{C\textsc{II}}]), is an important coolant in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies near and far. Being one of the brightest lines in the infrared, accounting for \sim 0.1-1\% of the total infrared luminosity in star-forming galaxies (Díaz-Santos et al., 2013), it is particularly useful for observing high-redshift (z\gtrsim 4) galaxies, where it is conveniently redshifted to the transparent atmospheric window at millimetre wavelengths and is accessible from the ground with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA), among others. The strength of this line has been shown to correlate well with both the galaxy-integrated star formation rate (SFR; Stacey et al., 2010; De Looze et al., 2011, 2014; Carniani et al., 2018; Matthee et al., 2019; Schaerer et al., 2020) and the spatially-resolved SFR (the \Sigma_{[{C\textsc{II}}]}-\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}} relation; Pineda et al., 2014; De Looze et al., 2014; Herrera-Camus et al., 2015). Additionally, in recent years, the line strength has been used as a tracer of other galaxy-integrated quantities such as the molecular gas mass (Hughes et al., 2017; Madden et al., 2020; Zanella et al., 2018), particularly of CO-dark molecular gas (Madden et al., 2020; Accurso et al., 2017), the \rm H\,\textsc{i} mass (Heintz et al., 2021, 2022), the total gas mass (D’Eugenio et al., 2023), as well as the metal content (Heintz et al., 2023). However, it is known from observations of [C II] emission from galactic centres and luminous infrared galaxies, with infrared (IR) luminosities L_{\rm IR}\gtrsim 10^{11}\,\rm L_{\odot}, that the L_{[{C\textsc{II}}]}/L_{\rm IR} ratio decreases with increasing L_{\rm IR} (e.g., Malhotra et al., 2001; Graciá-Carpio et al., 2011; Díaz-Santos et al., 2013), thereby hinting at a possible breakdown of the [C II]-SFR relation at high SFRs or high SFR surface densities (see e.g., Graciá-Carpio et al., 2011). From the theoretical point of view, the observed correlations between [{C\textsc{II}}] line strength and the galaxy properties arise naturally as [{C\textsc{II}}] is a metal cooling line and is linked to both the metal content and the heating via star formation in regions where cooling is dominated by this line such as photon-dominated regions (PDRs) and the cold neutral medium. Moreover, the various galaxy properties are themselves correlated; for example, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation connects the gas surface density and the SFR surface density (Kennicutt, 1998; Leroy et al., 2008; Bigiel et al., 2008), while the mass-metallicity relation (Tremonti et al., 2004) connects the stellar mass and gas metallicity. This implies that any correlation of the [{C\textsc{II}}] line with another galaxy property will have secondary dependencies, often manifested as a scatter, that must be quantified to provide robust calibrations. In this regard, the [{C\textsc{II}}]-SFR correlation has garnered a lot of attention on the theoretical front. Several studies have meticulously tested this correlation and its redshift evolution using chemical and radiative transfer modelling in individual galaxies (Vallini et al., 2015; Katz et al., 2019, 2022) or for entire simulation suite at targeted redshifts (Olsen et al., 2016, 2017; Pallottini et al., 2017; Lagache et al., 2018; Lupi et al., 2018; Popping et al., 2019; Leung et al., 2020). However, unlike the [{C\textsc{II}}]-SFR relation, the [{C\textsc{II}}]-M_{\mathrm{mol}} relation has received limited attention in simulations so far (see e.g., Vizgan et al., 2022), partly because current state-of-the-art cosmological simulations do not self-consistently follow the evolution of the molecular gas component in galaxies, and they often rely on analytical relations to be used in post-processing (e.g., Lagos et al., 2015, 2016), which might not hold at high redshifts. For instance, Vizgan et al. (2022) found a shallower L_{[{C\textsc{II}}]}-M_{\mathrm{mol}} relation at z\sim 6 compared to the one obtained by Zanella et al. (2018) using a compilation of M_{*}\gtrsim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}} galaxies at z=0-5.5, highlighting the need for robust testing of this calibration. Therefore, while observations of the [C II] line have opened up an interesting avenue for probing the high-z ISM, several open questions still remain: does the [C II]-SFR relation evolve with redshift? Does the [C II]-M_{\mathrm{mol}} relation show secondary dependencies on other galaxy properties? What is faint-end slope of the [C II] luminosity function and how does it evolve with redshift? To provide a theoretical insight on these, we have performed a suite of cosmological simulations, called the Marigold suite, wherein we follow the non-equilibrium abundance of \mathrm{H_{2}}, CO, C, and \mathrm{C^{+}} on the fly using the sub-grid model Hyacinth (Khatri et al., 2024). The [\rm{C\textsc{II}}] emission from the simulated galaxies is calculated by solving the radiative-transfer problem in post-processing. In this paper, we use this simulation suite to investigate the usefulness of this line as a probe of the interstellar medium (ISM) in high-redshift (3\leq z\leq 7) galaxies. In particular, we provide a calibration for inferring the molecular gas mass of a galaxy from its [C II] luminosity, accounting for secondary dependencies in this relation across redshift. In the past few years, observations of high-redshift galaxies have detected [{C\textsc{II}}] emission extending farther than the UV continuum emission from these galaxies (Fujimoto et al., 2019, 2020; Ginolfi et al., 2020; Fudamoto et al., 2022; Lambert et al., 2023; Posses et al., 2024), hinting at an extended gas reservoir rich in ionized carbon. This extended [{C\textsc{II}}] emission is often referred to as a [{C\textsc{II}}] halo, despite the misleading term. Satellites galaxies, galactic outflows, and gas stripped due to galaxy interactions are all plausible sources of an extended [C II] halo. Reproducing extended [C II] in numerical simulations has proven challenging so far (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Muñoz-Elgueta et al., 2024), making it difficult to pinpoint its exact origin(s). This is further complicated by the faint nature of the extended emission and the limited spatial resolution of high-z observations. In this study, we further explore the existence of extended [C II] emission using our simulations. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: In Sect. 2, we describe the simulation suite and detail the modelling of the [{C\textsc{II}}] emission in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we investigate the redshift evolution of the [{C\textsc{II}}] luminosity function from the simulations. We investigate the [{C\textsc{II}}]-star formation rate correlation in our simulated galaxies on global and spatially resolved scales in Sect. 5. In Sect. 6, we examine the reliability of the [{C\textsc{II}}] line as a molecular gas tracer and quantify secondary dependencies of the L_{[{C\textsc{II}}]}-M_{\mathrm{mol}} relation on the star formation rate and the gas metallicity. Then, we explore the extended [{C\textsc{II}}] emission in Sect. 7. We compare our [C II]-SFR relation and [C II] luminosity function with those from previous numerical studies in Sect. 8 and conclude with a summary of our main results in Sect. 9.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09733v1,Fuzzy Gasoline: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxy formation with Fuzzy Dark Matter,"We present the first set of high-resolution, hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of galaxy formation in a Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) framework. These simulations were performed with a new version of the gasoline2 code, known as fuzzy-gasoline, which can simulate quantum FDM effects alongside a comprehensive baryonic model that includes metal cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and black hole physics, previously used in the NIHAO simulation suite. Using thirty zoom-in simulations of galaxies with halo masses in the range 10^{9}\lesssim M_{\text{halo}}/M_{\odot}\lesssim 10^{11}, we explore how the interplay between FDM’s quantum potential and baryonic processes influences dark matter distributions and observable galaxy properties. Our findings indicate that both baryons and low-mass FDM contribute to core formation within dark matter profiles, though through distinct mechanisms: FDM-induced cores emerge in all haloes, particularly within low-mass systems at high redshift, while baryon-driven cores form within a specific mass range and at low redshift. Despite these significant differences in dark matter structure, key stellar observables such as star formation histories and velocity dispersion profiles remain remarkably similar to predictions from the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model, making it challenging to distinguish between CDM and FDM solely through stellar observations.","The Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model, characterized by its cold, dark, and collisionless nature, has been considered the leading framework for explaining the dark matter component in cosmic structure formation over the past few decades (see e.g. Mo et al., 2010, for a comprehensive review on the subject). Nonetheless, unresolved tensions at small scales, combined with the ongoing failure to detect Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) — the leading particle candidate of the CDM model — have continued to raise doubts about the model’s viability. Motivated by the elusiveness of WIMPs in predominant direct and indirect detection methods, several alternative dark matter models have come to the forefront, investigating the lower mass regimes for dark matter particles (Jungman et al., 1996). Moving away from the GeV/c2 mass range associated with WIMPs, these efforts explored and proposed several lighter dark matter particle candidates, one being the axion particle, which is theorized to arise from the CP-symmetry breaking in quantum chromo-dynamics (QCD) theories (Peccei & Quinn, 1977). In a cosmological context, a pseudo-scalar bosonic particle can be generalized from the QCD axion model, motivating a comprehensive class of axion-like particles (ALPs) acting as dark matter candidates. These ALPs span a broad range of masses, encompassing over 24 orders of magnitude from 10^{-24} to 1 eV/c2 (see e.g. Hui et al., 2017; Ferreira, 2021, for reviews on FDM models). Dark matter models related to ALP particle masses in the mass range (10^{-24} to 10^{-19} eV/c2) are known as Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) models, whose identifying boson mass m_{\chi} is typically represented in terms of m_{22}=m_{\chi}/(10^{-22}\text{ eV}/c^{2}). The mass range of FDM corresponds to de Broglie wavelengths on scales of \mathcal{O}(1\text{ kpc}), exhibiting wave-like behavior at sub-galactic scales (Hu et al., 2000). The quantum wave-like nature of FDM results in a net repulsive force that, on one hand, modifies the matter power spectrum of cold dark matter (CDM) during matter-radiation equality and smooths out density perturbations at small scales, ultimately leading to fewer collapsed structures (Hu et al., 2000; Marsh & Silk, 2014). On the other hand, it induces a resistance to gravitational collapse resulting in decreased dark matter (DM) distribution in the central region of FDM haloes. This effectively translates to FDM haloes featuring cored inner DM density profiles (\rho(r)\sim constant) contrasted with CDM’s cuspy inner DM density profiles (\rho(r)\sim r^{-1}) for dwarf galaxy systems (Hu et al., 2000). While the CDM model has been successful in modeling large-scale cosmological structures (Springel et al., 2005; Tegmark et al., 2006; Alam et al., 2017), several challenges have arisen on smaller, non-linear scales. These include well-known issues such as the cusp-core problem (Flores & Primack, 1994; Moore, 1994) and the missing satellites problem (Klypin et al., 1999; Moore et al., 1999) [see Bullock & Boylan-Kolchin (2017) for a detailed review]. Verifying the model’s validity at these non-linear scales has proven to be particularly challenging. In response, numerous studies have defended the CDM model, pointing out that earlier works overstated the severity of these problems due to theoretical and observational limitations. These studies emphasize the growing importance of baryonic physics in structure formation on smaller scales (Brooks & Zolotov, 2014; Macciò et al., 2020; Waterval et al., 2022), as well as the inefficiency of star formation in dwarf galaxies, which complicates their observational detection (Yang et al., 2003; Fitts et al., 2017; Frings et al., 2017). Previous studies investigating the role of baryonic feedback processes in dwarf galaxies have found that baryons are able to produce significant cores (\sim 1 kpc) in their dark matter distribution (Governato et al., 2010; Macciò et al., 2011; Benítez-Llambay et al., 2019). The most-widely accepted mechanism explaining this phenomenon is the sub-dynamical time-scale changes in the central (\sim\bigO(\text{kpc})) potential of the halo. These rapid changes in the central potential, caused by stellar and black hole feedback, are tied to strong gas outflows that irreversibly alter the central potential by transferring energy to collisionless DM particles (Pontzen & Governato, 2012). However, these baryonic effects help alleviate these small scale tensions only up to a certain mass scale (M_{halo} \sim 10{}^{10}M_{\odot}). Since these mechanisms are out of play in lowest mass, gas-deficient dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxies, the central DM distribution of the halo reverts back to the cuspy profiles (e.g. Tollet et al., 2016). The addition of FDM interaction to baryonic effects might help alleviate these tensions at lower halo masses while maintaining CDM large scale features. Numerical simulations of structure formation within FDM models have been initially performed by means of highly numerically intensive Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) algorithms able to solve the Schrödinger-Poisson equations over a grid (see e.g. Schive et al., 2010, 2018; Mocz et al., 2017), leading to impressive and very detailed results on the properties of individual FDM collapsed objects (see e.g. Woo & Chiueh, 2009; Schive et al., 2014; Veltmaat et al., 2018). However, the computational cost of such approach hindered the possibility to extend the investigation of late time structure formation to large cosmological volumes. To address this issue, N-Body codes were employed, initially only including the (linear) suppression in the initial conditions but neglecting the integrated effect of the FDM interaction during the subsequent dynamical evolution (see e.g. Schive et al., 2016; Iršič et al., 2017; Armengaud et al., 2017) – i.e. basically treating FDM as standard dark matter with a suppressed primordial power spectrum. The inclusion of the typical FDM interaction in N-body codes was achieved with ax-gadget Nori & Baldi (2018), a modified version of the cosmological hydrodynamical code p-gadget3 that implemented the general scheme suggested by Mocz & Succi (2015) and Marsh (2015). The code ax-gadget allowed the investigation of FDM in larger cosmological volumes with a vast number of systems (Nori et al., 2019) as well as a variety of complex galactic systems with many evolving substructures (Nori & Baldi, 2020; Nori et al., 2023; Elgamal et al., 2024) hardly obtainable with other simulation strategies. Nonetheless, previous studies on FDM cosmologies with ax-gadget have all relied on dark-matter-only (DMO) simulations. To further investigate FDM models in a proper physical context and examine their impact on galaxy formation, this work expands on what has been done with ax-gadget since Nori & Baldi (2018) by incorporating baryonic effects in a cosmological hydrodynamical N-body code, which are essential for a correct description of structure formation. While effective in modeling FDM behavior, ax-gadget is limited in simulating baryonic processes like gas cooling, star formation, and black hole feedback. Conversely, gasoline2– another cosmological hydrodynamical code with a compatible N-body structure – has been constantly developed and integrated with new routines related to baryonic process, and has been shown to be very effective in these areas in the past years (e.g. Stinson et al., 2006; Brooks et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015). By integrating the FDM routines from ax-gadget into gasoline2 (Wadsley et al., 2017), we have developed a new version of the gasoline2 code, fuzzy-gasoline, capable of running hydrodynamic FDM simulations with baryons through to the present day (z=0) of large and complex systems at a reasonable computational cost. To the authors knowledge, this is the first code of its kind capable to do so. In this work, we leverage the fuzzy-gasoline code to create novel hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxy systems with halo masses in the range of 10^{9}\lesssim M_{\text{halo}}/M_{\odot}\lesssim 10^{11}. We detail their properties, including dark matter, gas and star density and velocity profiles, as well as star formation histories, and compare them with those of their cold dark matter (CDM) NIHAO counterparts. Our goal is to explore two key aspects: first, what is the combined effect of baryons and FDM on galactic properties, and second, whether it is possible to disentangle the degeneracy of the two individual contributions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2 we provide an overview of the theoretical background of FDM models; in Sec. 3 we detail the numerical methodology implemented in this work, specifically related to FDM dynamics and simulations; in Sec. 4 we present the main results, focusing on DM density profiles, differentiating between its two driving factors: FDM’s quantum pressure and baryonic feedback processes, and their impact on the observable properties of the explored systems; finally, we summarize our findings in Sec. 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09905v1,Eccentricities of Close Stellar Binaries,"Orbits of stellar binaries are in general eccentric. This encodes information about the formation process. Here, we use thousands of main-sequence binaries from the GAIA DR3 catalog to reveal that, binaries inwards of a few AU exhibit a simple Rayleigh distribution with a mode \sigma_{e}\simeq 0.30. We find the same distribution for binaries from M to A spectral types, and from tens of days to 10^{3}days (possibly extending to tens of AU).This observed distribution is most likely primordial. Its Rayleigh form suggests an origin in weak scattering, while its invariant mode demands a universal process. We experiment with exciting binary eccentricities by ejecting brown dwarfs, and find that the eccentricities reach an equi-partition value of \sigma_{e}\simeq\sqrt{M_{\rm bd}/M_{*}}. So to explain the observed mode, these brown dwarfs will have to be of order one tenth the stellar masses, and be at least as abundant in the Galaxy as the close binaries. The veracity of such a proposal remains to be tested.","Binary stars are common in the Galaxy (Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Fischer & Marcy, 1992). Their orbits are invariably eccentric. The distribution of these eccentricities encodes accessible information about their formation, and is a useful property invoked in a wide range of studies. Surprisingly, for binaries closer than tens of AU (’close binaries’), such a fundamental property is not well known. Multiple lines of evidences suggest two main modes of binary formation (see Duchêne & Kraus, 2013; Offner et al., 2023, for reviews). Wide binaries (>50 AU,111Interestingly, 50AU, or P\sim 10^{5}days, is roughly the peak of the binary distribution for Sun-like stars (Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Raghavan et al., 2010). see, e.g., Parker et al., 2009) likely form following direct collapse of individual components. These are either weakly bound at birth or are captured after birth. Their occurrence is insensitive to or rises with stellar metallicity (El-Badry & Rix, 2019; Hwang et al., 2021), and the two components appear to be randomly paired in mass (Moe & Di Stefano, 2017). Close binaries, on the other hand, are now thought to have formed through gravitational fragmentation in massive circum-stellar disks (see review by Kratter & Lodato, 2016). Their occurrence anti-correlates with stellar metallicity (Moe et al., 2019), and the two masses are correlated (Raghavan et al., 2010; Duchêne & Kraus, 2013; Moe & Di Stefano, 2017) with an excess at equal-mass (’twin-binaries’, Moe & Di Stefano, 2017; El-Badry et al., 2019). These different formation pathways also manifest in binary eccentricities – a property that is observationally accessible and dynamically informative. Wide binaries are observationally determined to have a thermal distribution (dN/de\propto e), as inferred from spectroscopic binaries (Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Raghavan et al., 2010) and visual binaries(Tokovinin, 2020; Hwang et al., 2022).222Very wide binaries (>10^{3} AU) also appear to be super-thermal (Tokovinin, 2020; Hwang et al., 2022), suggesting another mechanism at play. This reflects a dynamic past in the birth clusters (Parker et al., 2009), where plentiful scatterings with other stars have relaxed the binaries towards a ’thermal’ equilibrium (Jeans, 1919; Heggie, 1975). This concordance between theory and observation does not, however, extend to close binaries. There are no theoretical predictions for their e-distribution, owing to the uncertain fragmentation process. On the observational side, their e-distribution remains murky, though it clearly differs from that of the wide binaries. The current wisdom is that they are consistent with being uniform,333Binaries with massive primaries (O/B stars) appear ’thermal’, down to periods as short as tens of days, possibly related to their higher triple fraction (Moe & Di Stefano, 2017). dN/de\propto e^{0} (Raghavan et al., 2010; Duchêne & Kraus, 2013; Moe & Di Stefano, 2017; Tokovinin, 2000; Geller et al., 2021; Hwang et al., 2022), but this is only a best-guess estimate that is based on small samples444Some studies have suggested a more ’bell-shaped’ e-distribution (Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991; Geller & Mathieu, 2012), but Moe & Di Stefano (2017) concluded that the data are too sparse to tell. and has no ready theoretical explanation. For instance, selecting from the volume-complete (to 25pc) Solar-type sample (Raghavan et al., 2010; Moe & Di Stefano, 2017), for binaries with periods 10^{2}-10^{3}d, so as to exclude binaries that may have experienced tidal circularization or may have been disturbed by passing-by stars, we are left with only 18 binaries. It is clear a much larger sample is sorely needed. The Gaia mission (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2016, 2023a), especially with its most recent non-single-star catalogue published in DR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2023b), provides just this sample. The GAIA binaries, as we show here, sharpen our vision dramatically. The e-distribution for those inward of a few AU follows, distinctly, a Rayleigh distribution."

high-angular-resolution imaging of the AGB star W Hya in
vibrationally excited  lines and visible polarized light
with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL","Aims. We present contemporaneous high-angular-resolution millimeter imaging and visible polarimetric imaging of the nearby asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star W Hya to better understand the dynamics and dust formation within a few stellar radii.Methods. The star W Hya was observed in two vibrationally excited H2O lines at 268 and 251 GHz with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at a spatial resolution of 16\times20 mas and at 748 and 820 nm at a resolution of 26\times27 mas with the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE)-Zurich Imaging Polarimeter (ZIMPOL).Results. ALMA’s high spatial resolution allowed us to image strong emission of the vibrationally excited H2O line at 268 GHz (\varv_{2} = 2, J_{K_{a},K_{c}} = 6_{5,2}–7_{4,3}) over the stellar surface instead of absorption against the continuum, which is expected for thermal excitation. Strong, spotty emission was also detected along and just outside the stellar disk limb at an angular distance of \sim40 mas (\sim1.9 R_{\star}), extending to \sim60 mas (\sim2.9 R_{\star}). Another H2O line (\varv_{2} = 2, J_{K_{a},K_{c}} = 9_{2,8}–8_{3,5}) at 251 GHz with a similar upper-level energy was tentatively identified, which shows absorption over the stellar surface. This suggests that the emission over the surface seen in the 268 GHz H2O line is suprathermal or even maser emission. The estimated gas temperature and H2O density are consistent with the radiatively pumped masers. The 268 GHz H2O line reveals global infall at up to \sim15 km s-1 within 2–3 R_{\star}, but outflows at up to \sim8 km s-1 are also present. The polarized intensity maps obtained in the visible reveal clumpy dust clouds forming within \sim40 mas (\sim1.9 R_{\star}) with a particularly prominent cloud in the SW quadrant and a weaker cloud in the east. The 268 GHz H2O emission overlaps very well with the visible polarized intensity maps, which suggests that both the nonthermal and likely maser H2O emission and the dust originate from dense, cool pockets in the inhomogeneous atmosphere within \sim2–3 R_{\star}.","Mass loss on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) plays an important role not only in stellar evolution but also in the chemical evolution of galaxies. The initial–final mass relation of low- and intermediate-mass stars shows that stars can lose up to \sim80% of their initial mass before they evolve to white dwarfs (Cummings et al. cummings18 (2018)). Despite such importance, the mass-loss mechanism in AGB stars is not yet fully understood. According to the pulsation-enhanced dust-driven outflow scenario, large-amplitude stellar pulsation levitates the material, which leads to density enhancement at the cool, upper atmosphere, where dust can form, and the radiation pressure on the dust grains can drive the mass loss (Höfner & Olofsson hoefner18 (2018)). The recent 3D models of AGB stars show that convection can also levitate the material, which leads to clumpy stellar winds (Freytag & Höfner freytag23 (2023)). To clarify the long-standing problem of the AGB mass loss, it is indispensable to probe the region within \sim10 R_{\star}, where dust forms and the wind accelerates. The oxygen-rich AGB star W Hya has been studied with various observational techniques from the visible to the infrared to the radio (e.g., Zhao-Geisler et al. zhao-geisler11 (2011); Khouri et al. khouri15 (2015) and references therein) because of its proximity (98^{+30}_{-18} pc, Vlemmings et al. vlemmings03 (2003)). The light curve shows clear periodicity (Woodruff et al. woodruff08 (2008)) with a period of 389 days (Uttenthaler et al. uttenthaler11 (2011)). Woodruff et al. (woodruff09 (2009)) show that the minimum near-infrared uniform-disk (UD) diameter of W Hya at phase 0.58 (near minimum light) is \sim36 mas at 1.2–1.3 \mum. This is considered to correspond to the star’s angular diameter as seen in the deepest photospheric layers. We converted the UD diameter to the fully darkened disk diameter by multiplying it by the factor 1.15 derived by Zhao-Geisler et al. (zhao-geisler11 (2011)). This resulted in a stellar angular diameter of 41.4 mas (i.e., 20.7 mas as the star’s angular radius R_{\star}). Taking advantage of visible polarimetric imaging with the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE)-Zurich Imaging Polarimeter (ZIMPOL) instrument (Beuzit et al. beuzit08 (2008); Schmid et al. schmid18 (2018)) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), Ohnaka et al. (ohnaka16 (2016)) spatially resolved the clumpy dust clouds forming around W Hya at an angular distance of \sim50 mas (\sim2.4 R_{\star}), which is similar to the angular distance derived by Norris et al. (norris12 (2012)) based on polarimetric aperture-masking experiments. The modeling of Norris et al. (norris12 (2012)) and Ohnaka et al. (ohnaka16 (2016)) suggests a predominance of large (0.3–0.5 \mum), transparent grains of Al2O3, Mg2SiO4, or MgSiO3 in the clumpy clouds, lending support to the scenario of scattering-driven mass loss (Höfner hoefner08 (2008)). Furthermore, the second-epoch ZIMPOL observations by Ohnaka et al. (ohnaka17 (2017)) revealed the morphological change in the dust clouds as well as a change in the grain size from 0.4–0.5 \mum to \sim0.1 \mum. Similar clumpy dust cloud formation has been imaged in other nearby AGB stars, R Dor, IK Tau, and o Cet (Khouri et al. khouri16 (2016), khouri18 (2018); Adam & Ohnaka adam19 (2019)). Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Takigawa et al. (takigawa17 (2017)) imaged W Hya in the gas-phase AlO line at 344 GHz at an epoch between two ZIMPOL observations of Ohnaka et al. (ohnaka16 (2016), ohnaka17 (2017)). Takigawa et al. (takigawa17 (2017)) found that the distribution of AlO is in excellent agreement with the clumpy dust clouds seen in the polarized intensity maps. In this Letter, we present contemporaneous high-angular-resolution imaging of W Hya in two vibrationally excited H2O lines with ALMA and visible polarimetric imaging with VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL. Figure 1: Continuum-subtracted channel maps of W Hya obtained in the vibrationally excited H2O maser line (\varv_{2} = 2, J_{K_{a},K_{c}} = 6_{5,2}–7_{4,3}, E_{u} = 6039.0 K) at 268.149117 GHz. The gray circles represent the ellipse fitted to the millimeter continuum image. In the lower right corner of each panel, the LSR velocity and the relative velocity (\mbox{$V_{\rm rel}$}\ =\mbox{$V_{\rm LSR}$}-\mbox{$V_{\rm sys}$}, \mbox{$V_{\rm sys}$}=40.4 km s-1) are shown. The restoring beam size is shown in the lower left corner of each panel. North is up, and east to the left.

The channel maps at the velocities more redshifted than V_{\rm rel} = 3.0 km s-1 are not shown, because the signals are affected by the adjacent Si17O line (\varv=0, J = 6 – 5) at 250.744695 GHz."

Joint mass measurements for eROSITA galaxy clusters","The mass of galaxy clusters is a critical quantity for probing cluster cosmology and testing theories of gravity, but its measurement could be biased given assumptions are inevitable in order to make use of any approach. In this paper, we employ and compare two mass proxies for galaxy clusters: thermodynamics of the intracluster medium and kinematics of member galaxies. We select 22 galaxy clusters from the cluster catalog in the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) that have sufficient optical and near-infrared observations. We generate multi-band images in the energy range of (0.3, 7) keV for each cluster, and derive their temperature profiles, gas mass profiles and hydrostatic mass profiles using a parametric approach that does not assume dark matter halo models. With spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies collected from multiple surveys, we numerically solve the spherical Jeans equation for their dynamical mass profiles. Our results quantify the correlation between dynamical mass and line-of-sight velocity dispersion, \log M_{\rm dyn}=(1.296\pm 0.001)\log(\sigma_{\rm los}^{2}r_{\rm proj}/G)-(3.8% 7\pm 0.23), with an rms scatter of 0.14 dex. We find the two mass proxies lead to roughly the same total mass, with no observed systematic bias. As such, the \sigma_{8} tension is not specific to hydrostatic mass or weak lensing shears, but also appears with galaxy kinematics. Interestingly, the hydrostatic-to-dynamical mass ratios decrease slightly toward large radii, which could possibly be evidence for accreting galaxies in the outskirts. We also compare our hydrostatic masses with the latest weak lensing masses inferred with scaling relations. The comparison shows the weak lensing mass is significantly higher than our hydrostatic mass by \sim110%. This might explain the significantly larger value of \sigma_{8} from the latest measurement using eRASS1 clusters than almost all previous estimates in the literature. Finally, we test the radial acceleration relation (RAR) established in disk galaxies. We confirm the missing baryon problem in the inner region of galaxy clusters using three independent mass proxies for the first time. As ongoing and planned surveys are providing deeper X-ray observations and more galaxy spectra for cluster members, we expect to extend the study to cluster outskirts in the near future.","Studying the dynamics of galaxy clusters provides a useful way to constrain the nature of dark matter, as the cold dark matter model predicts that dark matter halos are in a universal profile (Navarro et al., 1996). It also helps test the universality of scaling relations that are mostly established in galaxies, such as the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (McGaugh et al., 2000) and the radial acceleration relation (RAR, McGaugh et al., 2016; Lelli et al., 2017a; Li et al., 2018). Both scientific objectives require robust measurements of cluster mass profiles, which is non-trivial, as it often suffers from both technical and observational difficulties.

(2024). The weighted spectroscopic redshift z_{\rm spec}, the coordinates of BCGs ({\rm RA_{BCG}}, {\rm Dec_{BCG}}), and best-fit X-ray centers ({\rm RA_{X-ray}}, {\rm Dec_{X-ray}}) are from Kluge et al. (2024) and Bulbul et al. (2024), respectively. Nspec is the number of available spectroscopic member galaxies, while N_{\rm eff} is the corresponding effective number of galaxy spectra, taking into account membership probabilities. The cluster radius R_{\rm 500,wl} and total mass M_{\rm 500,wl} are derived from scaling relations, as presented in Ghirardini et al. (2024). M_{\rm 500,hydro} is the hydrostatic mass derived in this paper. The commonly employed dynamical tracer to measure cluster mass profiles is the hot cluster gas via the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. Hot cluster gas emits X-ray photons, so they can be measured with X-ray observations. The first all-sky X-ray telescope ROSAT led to the construction of the Northern (NORAS) catalog of 495 clusters (Böhringer et al., 2000) and the Southern (REFLEX) catalog of 447 clusters (Böhringer et al., 2004). There are smaller sky-coverage but deeper observations with the XMM-Newton telescope, such as the XMM-Newton Cluster Survey (XCS, Mehrtens et al., 2012) for 503 galaxy clusters and the XMM-Newton Cluster Archive Super Survey (X-CLASS Koulouridis et al., 2021) for 1646 galaxy clusters. Deep follow-up programme are limited to tens to hundreds of galaxy clusters, such as the X-COP project (Eckert et al., 2017) and the CHEX-MATE project (CHEX-MATE Collaboration et al., 2021). A big milestone is made by the latest all-sky survey telescope, eROSITA (Predehl et al., 2021), which has observed more than 1.2 million X-ray sources (Merloni et al., 2024), and identified more than 26 thousand extended sources (Bulbul et al., 2024) in the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1). More than 12 thousand extended sources have been identified by optical observations (Kluge et al., 2024), leading to the largest catalog of galaxy clusters with X-ray data available. The significant increase in the number of X-ray selected clusters suggests that studying cluster dynamics in a statistical way is becoming more and more promising. Cluster galaxies have also been used as dynamical tracers assuming they are in dynamical equilibrium. The total cluster mass can be estimated by building a scaling relation between the total velocity dispersion of cluster galaxies and the virial mass via simulations (Biviano et al., 2006; Munari et al., 2013; Saro et al., 2013). To derive dynamical mass profiles, one needs to solves the Jeans equation (e.g. Binney & Tremaine, 2008). However, this approach suffers two technical difficulties. First, dynamical mass is related to radial velocity dispersion and 3-D galaxy distribution through spherical Jeans equation (Binney & Tremaine, 2008), but observationally only projected spatial distributions and line-of-sight velocity dispersion of member galaxies are measurable. Second, there is a serious degeneracy between dynamical mass and velocity anisotropy. Degeneracy is a general problem in astronomy, which can lead to unrealistic estimations of parameters and even result in absurd conclusion (e.g. see Li et al., 2021). Mamon et al. (2013); Biviano et al. (2013) proposed to tackle these problems by parameterizing mass profiles, tracer distribution functions, and velocity anisotropy profiles using 3D functions. These functions are determined by matching their projected forms to observed phase-space information. Li et al. (2023a) also used parameterized profiles but with more flexible functions, and addressed the mass-velocity anisotropy degeneracy by introducing additional constraints that involve two virial shape parameters, namely the fourth order of velocity dispersion (Merrifield & Kent, 1990). As a result, the dynamical mass profiles can be well derived (see Appendix B in Li et al., 2023a). Both approaches assume galaxy clusters are relaxed, which cannot be independently, robustly verified. An interesting fact is that the two approaches assume different relaxations, one on hot intracluster gas via thermodynamics, and the other on member galaxies through kinematic motions. It is therefore interesting to compare these two mass estimators in a statistical sense. This is particularly interesting because of the \sigma_{8} tension (Planck Collaboration et al., 2014), since the cluster mass measurements using hot gas are thought to be biased lower due to non-thermal flows (e.g. Lau et al., 2009; Vazza et al., 2009; Battaglia et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2015; Biffi et al., 2016) and thereby lead to lower matter fluctuation compared with that from cosmic microwave background fluctuations (Planck Collaboration et al., 2016b). In this paper, we select a subsample of galaxy clusters from the cluster catalog in the first all-sky survey of eROSITA (Bulbul et al., 2024) based on their optical properties (Kluge et al., 2024). We measure their cluster mass profiles using both hot intracluster gas and cluster galaxies as dynamical tracers and make a systematic comparison between these two mass proxies. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our sample selection criteria; Section 3 & 4 present the results of X-ray analysis and kinematics analysis, respectively; Section 5 compares the mass profiles measured with different estimators; Section 6 shows a test for the universality of the RAR; Section 7 discusses the results and concludes the paper."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09729v1,The SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM): Data Analysis Pipeline,"We introduce the Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP) for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) project, referred to as the LVM-DAP. We outline our methods for recovering both stellar and emission line components from the optical integral field spectroscopy, highlighting the developments and changes implemented to address specific challenges of the data set. The observations from the LVM project are unique because they cover a wide range of physical resolutions, from approximately 0.05 pc to 100 pc, depending on the distance to the targets. This, along with the varying number of stars sampled in each aperture (ranging from zero, just one of a few, to thousands), presents challenges in using previous spectral synthesis methods and interpreting the spectral fits. We provide a detailed explanation of how we model the stellar content and separate it from the ionized gas emission lines. To assess the accuracy of our results, we compare them with both idealized and more realistic simulations, highlighting the limitations of our methods. We find that the DAP robustly correct for stellar continuum features and recover emission line parameters (e.g. flux, equivalent width, systemtic velocity and velocity dispersion) with a precision and accuracy that fulfill the requirements of the primary goal of the analysis. In addition, the recovered stellar parameters are reliable for single stars, the recovery of integrated populations is less precise. We conclude with a description of the data products we provide, instructions for downloading and using our software, and a showcase illustrating the quality of the data and the analysis on a deep exposure taken on the Huygens region at the center of the Orion Nebula.","The Local Volume Mapper (LVM, Drory et al., 2024) is one of the mappers that comprises the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V, Kollmeier et al., 2017, Kollmeier in prep.). The core science goal for the LVM is to quantify stellar feedback physics at the energy injection scale (<10 pc), connecting ionizing stars with ionized gas diagnostics of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM). To achieve this goal, it is currently conducting a unique Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) survey of the Milky Way, the Large and Small Magellan Clouds, and nearby galaxies in the Local Volume using a new facility comprising 4 alt-alt mounted celiostats, 16 cm refractive telescopes, a lenslet-coupled fiber-optic system, and an array of spectrographs covering 3600-9800 Å at R\sim 4000. The ultra-wide field science Integral Field Unit (IFU) has a diameter of 0.5 degrees with 1801 35.3″ clear apertures in a hexagonal arrangement of 25 rings. The celiostat design ensures stationary optics and a stable fiber system, mitigating issues in traditional fiber systems (e.g. Law et al., 2021). This innovative instrument will provide over 55\times 10^{6} spectra, covering the Milky Way at spatial resolutions of 0.05 to 1 pc, the Magellanic Clouds at 10 pc resolution, and very nearby galaxies of large apparent diameter at 100 pc. Survey operations began in November 2023 and will continue through May 2027. Following the precedent of previous SDSS surveys, all raw and reduced data, and the data products from dedicated analyses, as well as the codes, will be made publicly available, starting with SDSS DR20 in late 2025. Early science data have demonstrated the LVM’s capability to deliver high-quality spectral mapping of Galactic nebulae (Kreckel et al., 2024), crucial for addressing its core science goals and providing new insights into the energy injection scales within Local Group galaxies. To achieve these goals and digest the amount of data produced in these unique observations, it is required to create dedicated pipelines to reduce and analyze the data. In this article we present the first version of the LVM data analysis pipeline (DAP, version 1.0.0). The main goal of this tool is to automatically analyze the reduced, extracted and calibrated spectra provided by the Data Reduction Pipeline (Mejía-Narváez et al., in prep), decoupling the stellar and ionized gas emission line components, and providing observational and physical parameters of both components. There are several tools and pipelines already available in the literature that perform similar analyses (e.g., PPxF, MaNGA-DAP, PyCASSO, Fit3D, pyPipe3D, Cappellari & Emsellem, 2004; de Amorim et al., 2017; Westfall et al., 2019; Lacerda et al., 2022, for citing just a few). However, none of them has been developed to explore spectra that sample targets at the small physical scales of the LVM. At those scales it cannot be guaranteed that the number of stars within a single aperture is large enough to apply stellar population spectral synthesis, the basic physical reasoning behind all these tools (Walcher et al., 2011; Conroy, 2013). We have implemented in the DAP a new approach that we consider valid when the requirement to sample a fully populated IMF is not fulfilled. In this approach, instead of modelling the stellar component using single stellar populations (SSP), we adopt combinations of representative stellar spectra valid for these resolved stellar populations (RSP). Our primary goal with the DAP is to robustly recover emission line properties (flux, equivalent width, systematic velocity, velocity dispersion), accurately correcting for underlying stellar continuum features. Our secondary goal is to recover stellar parameters associated with the stellar continuum (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], [\alpha/Fe]), flexibly allowing for either small or large combinations of individual stars. In this article we aim to: (i) present the new methodology required to model the stellar spectrum when the number of stars in the considered aperture is not sufficiently large to apply the stellar synthesis method; (ii) present the procedure adopted to create the RSP template library propagating the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the physical parameters that are represented by each template; (iii) describe and distribute the first operational version of the DAP, that is able to recover the ionized emission line properties (its primarily goal) and to obtain a preliminary model for the stellar component; (iv) present the proposed format with which we will distribute the dataproducts, distributing some example codes of how to use them; (v) characterize the quality of the recovered parameters based on simulated and real data, highlighting the current limitations and suggesting possible future improvements; and (vi) show the implementation on real LVM data. The code we present here is working end-to-end, however we acknowledge that it will require additional updates throughout the course of the survey, as it is usually the case in this kind of project. For example, a refinement in the input parameters (e.g., RSP templates) can flexibly be implemented in future applications of the DAP. The structure of this article is as follows: a summary of the data to be analyzed is presented in Sec. 2, with the implemented methodology being described in Sec. 3, including an overview of the analysis sequence in Section 3.1, details on the adopted stellar component analysis and how the stellar templates are created in Sec. 3.3, and a description of the delivered data products in Sec. 3.4; the reliability of the methodology is tested with extensive simulations described in Sec. 4, including both physically motivated (Sec. 4.1) and purely empirical (Sec. 4.2) simulations; the accuracy and prevision in the recovery of the emission lines and the stellar population properties are described in Sec. 4.3, 4.4, and 4.3; an example of the use of the DAP is presented in Sec. 5.1, in which we analyze a deep exposure centred in the Huygens region of the Orion nebula, including a description of this particular dataset in Sec. 5.2, with a summary of the performed analysis results in Sec. 5.3, a detailed exploration of the generated deep integrated spectrum in Sec. 5.4, the list of detected emission lines in Sec. 5.5, the physical properties derived from those emission lines in Sec. 5.6, and the spatial distribution of the emission line fluxes presented in Sec. 5.7; how to download the code is presented in Sec. 6, and finally a summary of the main results of this study is presented in Sec. 7."

Extensive, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of nearby and higher redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) have shown that the UV/optical variations are well correlated with time delays which increase with increasing wavelength. Such behaviour is expected in the context of the X-ray thermal reverberation of the accretion disc in AGN. Aims. Our main objective is to use time-lag measurements of luminous AGN and fit them with sophisticated X-ray reverberation time-lags models. In this way we can investigate whether X-ray reverberation can indeed explain the observed continuum time lags, and whether time-lag measurements can be used to measure physical parameters such as the X-ray corona height and the spin of the black hole (BH) in these systems.Methods. We use archival time-lag measurements for quasars from different surveys, and we compute their rest frame, mean time-lags spectrum. We fit the data with analytical X-ray reverberation models, using \chi^{2} statistics, and fitting for both maximal and non spinning BHs, for various colour correction values and X-ray corona heights.Results. We found that X-ray reverberation can explain very well the observed time lags, assuming the measured BH mass, accretion rate and X-ray luminosity of the quasars in the sample. The model agrees well with the data both for non-rotating and maximally rotating BHs, as long as the corona height is larger than \sim 40 gravitational radii. This is in agreement with previous results which showed that X-ray reverberation can also explain the disc radius in micro-lensed quasars, for the same corona heights. The corona height we measure depends on the model assumption of a perfectly flat disc. More realistic disc models may result in lower heights for the X-ray corona.Conclusions.","In the last decade, there have been many monitoring, multi-wavelength campaigns with the goal of studying the X-ray/UV/optical variations in active galactic nuclei (AGN). These campaigns are split, broadly speaking, into two categories. The first category includes the intensive monitoring of nearby AGN using the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, AstroSat (to a lesser extent), and in many cases ground based telescopes as well (e.g. McHardy et al. 2014; Edelson et al. 2015; Fausnaugh et al. 2016; Edelson et al. 2017; Cackett et al. 2018; Chelouche et al. 2019; Edelson et al. 2019; Cackett et al. 2020; Hernández Santisteban et al. 2020; Vincentelli et al. 2021; Kara et al. 2021; Donnan et al. 2023; Miller et al. 2023; Kara et al. 2023; Kumari et al. 2023, 2024). Only a few, bright Seyferts belong to this category of intensively sampled observations over a prolonged period of time, albeit their number is increasing. The second category includes long-term monitoring campaigns of quasars, that is AGN which are at higher redshifts and are brighter than their nearby counterparts (e.g. Jiang et al. 2017; Mudd et al. 2018; Homayouni et al. 2019; Yu et al. 2020; Guo et al. 2022; Jha et al. 2022; Homayouni et al. 2022). There are usually many AGN observed during each campaign, but their light curves are not as densely sampled as the ones from the monitoring of the nearby Seyfert galaxies. In all cases, the UV/optical variations are well correlated, with the variations at longer wavelengths being delayed with respect to the variations at shorter wavelengths. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of X-ray reverberation in AGN. According to this hypothesis, some of the photons emitted by the X-ray corona are directed straight to the observer, while the rest are directed towards the accretion disc. A fraction of the latter is ‘reflected’ by the disc in the X-ray range. The remaining fraction is absorbed, increasing the temperature of the disc and the emitted UV/optical flux. Since X-rays are highly variable, the additional disc emission in the UV/optical bands is expected to be also variable, revealing a time lag (with respect to the X-ray), which should increase with wavelength (as observed). This phenomenon is referred to as the disc X-ray thermal reverberation (e.g. Kazanas & Nayakshin 2001; Cackett et al. 2007). In the last few years, we have studied in detail X-ray reverberation in AGN, for instance Kammoun et al. (2021a; hereafter K21a) and Dovčiak et al. (2022). We have been able to successfully fit the time-lags spectra of nearby AGN (Kammoun et al. 2019, Kammoun et al. (2021b; hereafter K21b), Kammoun et al. 2023), the mean and the variable, optical/UV/X-ray spectral energy distribution in NGC 5548 (Dovčiak et al. 2022; Kammoun et al. 2024), and the radial flux profiles in micro-lensed quasars (Papadakis et al. 2022). Additionally, Panagiotou et al. (2020, 2022) utilised the same model to compute model power spectral density function (PSD) in the UV/optical range, and successfully fitted the optical/UV PSDs from the extensive monitoring campaign of NGC 5548. So far, we have studied results from the intensive monitoring campaigns of nearby Seyferts. In this work, we use archival time-lag measurements of high(er) redshift and more luminous AGN, compute their mean time-lags spectrum, and we fit them with the analytical models of K21a and b, considering the modifications recently proposed by Kammoun et al. (2023). Our objective is to investigate whether X-ray reverberation can explain the observed time lags in these objects as well. Our paper is organised as follows: In Sect. 2, we present the archival time-lag measurements that we use in our sample. In Sect. 3 we present the theoretical models we used, while in Sect. 4 we present the results of our analysis. Finally, we summarise and discuss the results and their implications in Sect. 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09443v1,A search for  absorption in distant star-forming galaxies with ASKAP-FLASH - I. Selection and analysis of the radio sample,"We present and discuss two catalogues of UV-selected (NUV <22.8 mag) galaxies that lie within a 200 deg2 area of sky covered by the ASKAP FLASH survey and have an impact parameter of less than 20 arcsec to a FLASH radio continuum source. These catalogues are designed to enable a future search for 21 cm H i absorption in and around star-forming galaxies at redshift 0.4<z<1. We outline the production of this UV-bright dataset, which has optical spectroscopy from the WiggleZ and SDSS surveys and a median redshift of \sim 0.6. Analysis of the optical spectra, using multiple diagnostic diagrams, shows that galaxies with an impact parameter of less than 5 arcsec are likely to be physically associated with the radio source and are five times more likely to be an AGN than objects without a radio match. Conversely, objects with impact factors between 5 and 20 arcsec are largely (> 80 percent) star-forming and resemble the overall WiggleZ population. The (g-i) colour evolution with redshift is consistent with a history of active star-formation, but the radio-associated objects are typically redder and have colours similar to high-excitation radio galaxies. The redshift distribution of the two catalogues matches the overall distribution for WiggleZ galaxies, despite their otherwise rare radio properties. These catalogues can be expanded in future as new radio data become available, and a forthcoming paper will present the H i absorption results.","There is a well-observed decline in the global star-formation rate by almost a factor of \sim10 between ‘cosmic noon’ - where global SFR hit its peak at z \sim{2.0} - and present day, referred to as ‘cosmic downsizing’ (Cowie et al., 1996; Madau et al., 1996; Madau & Dickinson, 2014; Cochrane et al., 2023). The reasons for this phenomenon are not well understood, but it may be connected to the evolution of the cosmic neutral hydrogen abundance over time. Neutral hydrogen is a primary constituent of the reservoirs of cool matter surrounding galaxies (Emonts et al., 2007; Kaufmann et al., 2006), which fuel stellar formation (Sancisi et al., 2008; Stroe et al., 2015) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) evolution (Geréb et al., 2014; Stroe et al., 2015). If H i can be probed via 21 cm absorption detected in galaxies across a large range of redshifts, it offers the opportunity to study the rates of H i detection over cosmic time. If we can specifically limit our sample to star-forming galaxies, we can also investigate the role of H i in star formation, or alternatively the impact of star formation on H i . Though we expect that H i reservoirs should be detected around star-forming galaxies, due to the UV-luminosity produced by massive stars, there is also a possibility that even after running spectral stacking experiments, detections will not occur at all, or only for galaxies where the production of ionising UV radiation - and likely the star formation rate - is low enough (Curran & Duchesne, 2019). This would offer the opportunity to analyse the feedback between H i and star formation specifically, while excluding contamination from AGN emission. H i is prevalent throughout the Universe (Wolfe et al., 2005; Cortese et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2020), and produces an emission line at 21 cm (1.42 GHz). This hyperfine transition is very faint, limiting associated detection of the 21 cm emission to galaxies with redshift z < 0.4 (Fernández et al., 2016), except in exceptional cases such as the Chakraborty & Roy (2023) observation at z \sim{1.3} which was enabled by gravitational lensing of the source. The study of H i emission using the 21 cm line is generally restricted to the local Universe and low redshift regions. Stacked H i emission signals may be detected at higher redshift, but this is difficult, requiring many H i targets to increase signal-to-noise, and long integration times (Rhee et al., 2018; Chowdhury et al., 2021). Damped Ly \upalpha absorption lines can be effective tracers of distant H i (e.g. Wolfe et al., 2005; Noterdaeme et al., 2012; Zafar et al., 2013), but it is only detectable from the ground for z > 1.7. At lower redshift, this line lies in the UV and can only be observed from space. Because of this, the current samples of lower-redshift quasar DLAs are small and may suffer from a range of selection effects (Neeleman et al., 2016; Rao et al., 2017). Thus, for the redshift range 0.4 < z < 1.7, there is currently an incomplete understanding of the evolution of neutral hydrogen through time. Surveys for 21 cm H i absorption against background radio sources provide an alternative probe (Grasha et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2021), and a new generation of wide-band SKA precursor telescopes on radio-quiet sites has opened a new parameter space for such studies (Allison et al., 2022). As star formation and AGN activity are expected to be linked to the quantity of neutral gas in and around a galaxy, searches for 21 cm H i absorption on sightlines near galaxies with a high SFR or hosting AGN can provide new insights into the properties of H i in distant galaxies. These galaxies would be UV-bright (Smith & Heckman, 1989; Tadhunter et al., 2002), and so can be identified from large-area imaging surveys like GALEX (Martin et al., 2005). We aim to produce a catalogue of UV-bright galaxies suitable for a large-area H i search with the ASKAP radio telescope (Hotan et al., 2021). We use objects from the WiggleZ survey (Drinkwater et al., 2010, 2018), due to its selection of objects with NUV < 22.8 mag, 90 percent of which lie in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1.0, and 90 percent of which are star-forming, across a total area of 1000 deg2 of sky. A substantial fraction of the WiggleZ survey area also has existing H i absorption data from the ASKAP-FLASH survey (Allison et al., 2022), covering the redshift range 0.4 < z < 1.0. In this paper we describe the process of producing catalogues of optical objects in the redshift range 0.4 < z < 1.0 which either host - or alternatively are in the foreground of - radio sources detected by ASKAP-FLASH. As part of this work, we extend the initial catalogue of optical objects by producing an additional field of ‘WiggleZ-type’ objects which match the WiggleZ selection criteria, and show that the resulting objects match the properties of WiggleZ objects well. We investigate the properties of our two radio cross-matched subsamples of objects, and their similarity to the WiggleZ survey as a whole by investigating their optical emission line properties, redshift distributions, and (g - i) colour evolutions. This allows us to evaluate the suitability of our data for this future H i absorption work, which would be some of the first done at these redshifts. The catalogue presented here will later be used to search FLASH spectra for 21 cm absorption signals, both via associated detections and through absorption-line stacking experiments to statistically test for the presence of H i even when column densities would otherwise be too low for a direct detection to be made. We are also interested in the possibility of investigating ionisation of neutral gas due to the ionising emission of massive stars in star-forming galaxies, which could impact potential H i existing around these galaxies. Section 2 discusses the surveys of interest for this work: WiggleZ optical data, FLASH radio data, and outlines the production of our extended sample data in accordance with WiggleZ selection criteria (Drinkwater et al., 2010). In Section 3 we cover our optical-radio cross-matching approach, and the two separate populations of interest we produce via this process. We analyse the optical spectra of our overall catalogue of objects, and our two cross-matched samples, by producing BPT and WHAN spectral line diagnostic diagrams in Section 4. In Section 5 we do further studies of our objects, looking at colour evolution over redshift, redshift distribution, and MEx data, while comparing against existing literature, before concluding our findings in Section 6. Sample entries of the data produced in this work are presented in the Appendix, as well as example spectra. Throughout this work, we assume a concordance cosmology model where \upOmega_{\upLambda} = 0.7, \upOmega_{\mathrm{m}} = 0.3, and H0 = 70 km s-1 Mpc-1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09298v1,Constraining the Galactic Structure using Time Domain Gravitational Wave Signal from Double White Dwarfs Detected by Space Gravitational Wave Detectors,"The Gravitation Wave (GW) signals from a large number of double white dwarfs (DWDs) in the Galaxy are expected to be detected by space GW detectors, e.g., the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Taiji, and Tianqin in the millihertz band. In this paper, we present an alternative method by directly using the time-domain GW signal detected by space GW detectors to constrain the anisotropic structure of the Galaxy. The information of anisotropic distribution of DWDs is naturally encoded in the time-domain GW signal because of the variation of the detectors’ directions and consequently the pattern functions due to their annual motion around the sun. The direct use of the time-domain GW signal enables simple calculations, such as utilizing an analytical method to assess the noise arising from the superposition of random phases of DWDs and using appropriate weights to improve the constraints. We investigate the possible constraints on the scale of the Galactic thin disk and bulge that may be obtained from LISA and Taiji by using this method with mock signals obtained from population synthesis models. We further show the different constraining capabilities of the low-frequency signal (foreground) and the high-frequency signal (resolvable-sources) via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, and find that the scale height and length of the Galactic thin disk and the scale radius of bulge can be constrained to a fractional accuracy of \sim 30\%, 30\%, 40\% (or 20\%, 10\%, 40\%) by using the low-frequency (or high-frequency) signal detected by LISA or Taiji.","Space gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) (LISA; Amaro-Seoane et al., 2017), Taiji (Ruan et al., 2018), and Tianqin (Luo et al., 2016), are expected to detect the GW signals in the millihertz (mHz) band. The target sources include the merging massive binary black holes (\sim 10^{4}-10^{7}{\ \rm M_{\odot}}), extreme/intermediate mass ratio inspirals, inspiralling stellar-mass binary black holes and neutron stars, Galactic double white dwarfs (DWDs), as well as the stochastic foreground and background due to the large amount of unresolved DWDs in the Galaxy and stellar mass compact binaries in extragalactic galaxies (e.g., Cornish & Porter, 2007; Klein et al., 2016; Babak et al., 2017; Moore et al., 2017; Bonetti & Sesana, 2020; Babak et al., 2023; Amaro-Seoane, 2022; Lau et al., 2020; Lamberts et al., 2018; Amaro-Seoane et al., 2017, 2023, 2013, 2007; Thorpe et al., 2019). Among these sources, the DWDs may be the most common ones and about 10,000-60,000 Galactic DWDs are expected to be detected individually by LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin (e.g., Nelemans et al., 2004; Ruiter et al., 2010; Marsh, 2011; Yu & Jeffery, 2010; Korol et al., 2017, 2019, 2022; Huang et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022), which may reveal abundant information about the physical properties, the formation and evolution processes of DWDs (e.g., Lamberts et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Georgousi et al., 2023; Wilhelm et al., 2021; Adams et al., 2012; Edlund et al., 2005). The rest (\sim 10^{7}-10^{8}) DWDs, the majority of the DWD population in the LISA/Taiji band, cannot be resolved, but the GW signals from these sources combine together to form a stochastic foreground, which can be detected. The population properties may also be extracted from these DWD signal, one of which is the anisotropic distribution of the DWDs, an independent tracer of the anisotropic Galactic structure. The anisotropic distribution of those DWDs is encoded in the GW signal because of the direction change of the space GW detector constellation due to their annual motion around sun over the long observation period (four year or longer) and thus the annual variation of the response functions, which may be extracted from the GW signal. It has been investigated in the literature that the scale height of the Galactic disk may be well constrained by analysis using the spatial distribution of the resolved individual DWDs (extract from the observations) and the GW foreground in the frequency-domain (e.g., Benacquista & Holley-Bockelmann, 2006; Breivik et al., 2020; Korol et al., 2019; Lamberts et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Georgousi et al., 2023; Wilhelm et al., 2021; Adams et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2023). In addition, a number of studies investigate the modulation of the mHz GW signals from the Galactic DWDs based on the time-domain GW signals or the time-frequency domain techniques, in which various properties of the GW signal (but not the Galaxy shape) were proposed to be constrained by the modulation profile (Digman & Cornish, 2022; Buscicchio et al., 2024; Criswell et al., 2024; Pozzoli et al., 2024). Here we present an alternative method by directly using the GW signal in the time-domain modulated by the annual motion of the detectors around sun to constrain the anisotropic structure of the Galaxy, which is simple and efficient. Furthermore, we explore the different constrain capability for low-frequency and high-frequency DWDs with our techniques. By using mock GW signals from a population synthesis model, we demonstrate the feasibility of such a method for LISA and Taiji on constraining the scale height and length of the Galactic thin disk, and the scale radius of the bulge. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly describe how the mock DWD population in the Galaxy with disk and bulge components is obtained by population synthesis model. In Section 3, we show the calculation process of the GW signal from the mock Galactic DWDs. The noise analysis on parameter estimation and the signal and noise spectrum are detailed in this section. The detailed method to estimate the Galactic structure parameters by using the mock GW signal detected by Taiji and LISA with either a top-hat filter or an enhanced filter can also be seen in this section. We demonstrate the method validity via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and present our main results in Section 4. Conclusions and discussions are given in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09262v1,"ON THE AVERAGE ULTRAVIOLET EMISSION LINE SPECTRA OF HIGH-REDSHIFT GALAXIES: 
HOT AND COLD, CARBON-POOR, NITROGEN-MODEST, AND OOZING IONIZING PHOTONS","We determine the spectroscopic properties of \simeq 1000 ostensibly star-forming galaxies at redshifts (z=4-10) using prism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRSpec. With rest-wavelength coverage between Ly\alpha and [S ii] in the optical, we stack spectra as a function of nebular conditions, and compare UV spectral properties with stellar age. This reveals UV lines of N iii], N iv], C iii], C iv, He ii, and O iii] in the average high-z galaxy. All UV lines are more intense in younger starbursts. We measure electron temperatures from the collisionally excited [O iii] line ratios, finding T_{\mathrm{e}}=18000-22000 K for the O++ regions. We also detect a significant nebular Balmer Jump from which we estimate only T_{\mathrm{e}}=8000-13000 K. Accounting for typical temperature offsets between zones bearing doubly and singly ionized oxygen, these two temperatures remain discrepant by around 40%. We use the [O iii] temperatures to estimate abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We find that log(C/O) is consistently \simeq-1, with no evolution of C/O with metallicity or stellar age. The average spectra are mildly enhanced in Nitrogen, with higher N/O than low-z starbursts, but are less enhanced than samples of high-z galaxies with visible UV N iii] and N iv]. Whatever processes produce the N-enhancement in the individual galaxies must also be ongoing, at lower levels, in the median galaxy in the early Universe. The strongest starbursts are a source of significant ionizing emission: ionizing photon production efficiencies reach 10^{25.7} Hz erg-1, and show multiple signatures of high Lyman continuum escape, including Mg ii escape fractions nearing 100%, significant deficits in [S ii] emission, high degrees of ionization, and blue UV colors.","The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized our understanding of early galaxy formation. Over the last two years, data from the telescope have updated our view on the number density of galaxies at the dawn of cosmic star-formation (e.g. Bouwens et al., 2023; Donnan et al., 2023; Finkelstein et al., 2024; Harikane et al., 2023a; Robertson et al., 2024), and enabled the intriguing discovery of massive-black-hole galaxy hosts (e.g. Maiolino et al., 2023; Kocevski et al., 2024; Kokorev et al., 2024; Scholtz et al., 2024), and dusty, quenched systems at high-z (Barrufet et al., 2024; Carnall et al., 2024; Weibel et al., 2024). It has allowed us to witness the early chemical enrichment of galaxies (e.g. Arellano-Córdova et al., 2022; Curti et al., 2023; Schaerer et al., 2022a; Trump et al., 2023; Stiavelli et al., 2023), as well as the ionization history and topology of the Universe using the Ly\alpha emission line (e.g. Hayes & Scarlata, 2023; Bruton et al., 2023a, b; Tang et al., 2023, 2024; Witstok et al., 2024; Napolitano et al., 2024). With the advent of NIRSpec spectroscopy (Jakobsen et al., 2022), the first statistical samples of high-z galaxies with rest-optical spectroscopy have been assembled. Emission line ratio diagrams (e.g. Backhaus et al., 2024; Cameron et al., 2023; Mascia et al., 2023; Shapley et al., 2024; Sanders et al., 2024), suggest gas to be highly excited, due to illumination by a hard ionizing spectrum. Moreover, access to emission lines whose ratios are temperature-sensitive has enabled the determination of robust estimates of oxygen abundances, facilitating new metallicity calibrations (e.g. Sanders et al., 2024; Curti et al., 2024) and therefore the determination of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for the first time at z\geq 4 (e.g. He et al., 2024; Nakajima et al., 2023; Chemerynska et al., 2024). At these low masses (or high redshifts), not only does the normalization of the MZR decrease, but its slope also flattens, hinting a change in the wind mechanisms from energy (high-mass) to momentum-driven outflows (in the dwarf regime), with substantial implications for our understanding of the baryon cycle of early galaxies. However, the rest-ultraviolet wavelength range provides additional and even-more-valuable constraints on the nebular conditions of the warm and hot gas (e.g. Berg et al., 2019a; Senchyna et al., 2022). UV diagnostic diagrams are pivotal to break the degeneracies inherent in classical optical diagnostics (e.g. Feltre et al., 2016; Jaskot & Ravindranath, 2016; Nakajima et al., 2018; Mingozzi et al., 2022, 2024), and have the potential to reveal the true, underlying ionizing mechanisms. Some UV lines ratios provide insights on the physical conditions (density and temperature) of the more highly ionized media (where the gas is denser and highly ionized), and at densities above the critical densities of some of the strong optical diagnostics. Finally, carbon and nitrogen emission lines can be relatively strong in the UV but weak or absent in the optical, providing information on the chemical evolution/abundance patterns of early galaxies. JWST has made substantial progress in constraining the chemical enrichment of high-z galaxies. Carbon abundances (usually given as C/O) have been studied from the ground (e.g. Erb et al., 2010; Stark et al., 2014; Mainali et al., 2020; Matthee et al., 2021; Citro et al., 2024) upon which JWST could build (e.g. Arellano-Córdova et al., 2022; Curti et al., 2023; Isobe et al., 2023; Jones et al., 2023), usually finding C/O ratios consistent with the local universe at fixed (and usually low) oxygen abundance. Perhaps even more interestingly, JWST spectra have identified a handful of ‘nitrogen-loud’ galaxies, of which seven are currently known: GNz11 (Bunker et al., 2023), GLASS_150008 (Isobe et al., 2023), CEERS-1019 (Marques-Chaves et al., 2024), GS3073 (Ji et al., 2024, originally found by Vanzella et al. 2010), GHZ2 (Castellano et al., 2024), RXCJ2248-4431 (Topping et al., 2024), and GN-z9p4 (Schaerer et al., 2024). These objects are peculiar, and seem to be absent at lower redshifts, although the noteworthy exception of Mrk 996 implies this is not uniquely true (James et al., 2009). While nitrogen should follow qualitatively similar primary (core-collapse supernova) and secondary (low-intermediate mass late stages/AGB) enrichment patterns as carbon, it is difficult to explain the combined finding that carbon is lacking but nitrogen is enhanced (e.g. Berg et al., 2019b, 2020). These objects have therefore triggered a lot of speculation about the reasons for their nitrogen luminosity, including exotic scenarios such as supermassive stars produced by stellar mergers in dense star clusters (e.g. Charbonnel et al., 2023), AGN activity (e.g. Maiolino et al., 2024), redshift 11 Tidal Disruption Events (Cameron et al., 2023) or carefully balanced recent star-formation histories (Kobayashi & Ferrara, 2024). Finally, many of the objects discussed above for which detailed emission line spectroscopy has been obtained lie at redshifts where the Universe is demonstrated to be substantially neutral. Some of the same features used for classification and abundance inferences are also key estimators of both the intrinsic ionizing power of a galaxy (e.g. the Balmer series of emission lines) and the escape of ionizing radiation (e.g. [O iii]5008, [O ii]3727, [S ii]6717,31, Mg ii2800). At these redshifts, the Universe is fully opaque to ionizing radiation (LyC, Inoue et al., 2014) and the ioniziong power of galaxies can never be observed directly. Thus the mentioned emission lines are critical observables in the reionization epoch, as they provide indirect diagnostics of the amount of ionizing radiation escaping galaxies (f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{LyC}}, E.g. Leitet et al., 2013; Izotov et al., 2016; Flury et al., 2022a; Chisholm et al., 2022). As exciting as these results are, they are mostly restricted to small samples of individual galaxies (usually one per paper, where nitrogen enhancement is concerned) that are identified by carefully inspecting archival spectra and publishing the gems. Given the smaller rest-frame EWs of these UV emission lines (compared to their optical counterparts) they are harder to detect – this causes JWST to lag somewhat in the delivery of UV-based inferences compared to more traditional methods using optical lines. The uncertainties on these metal abundances are often large, and it is likely that there is little to be gained by publishing large numbers of limits on (C/O) and (N/O) for the plethora of non-detections. Thus we have little insight into the distribution of these abundances across the majority of the iceberg that remains submerged. There is one obvious way out of this: to co-add the restframe spectra of large numbers of galaxies, in a technique known as a stacking analysis. Stacking has, for example, allowed Hu et al. (2024) to produce a composite spectrum of 63 high-redshifts galaxies observed with NIRSpec in medium resolution gratings to study metallicities, dust attenuation, and various other properties of the ionized gas. They conclude that average >5.5 galaxies are highly ionized and deficient in carbon, similarly to the remarks above. Roberts-Borsani et al. (2024) similarly stack \simeq 500 galaxies observed with the lower resolution prism and study their redshift evolution, finding them to be bluer and younger at higher redshifts and deficient in metals. In this paper we adopt a similar approach, and perform a stacking analysis of \simeq 1000 galaxies at z>4 for which NIRSpec prism observations have been obtained. We use the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA111https://dawn-cph.github.io/dja ; see Heintz et al., 2024) to obtain a large sample of galaxies at 4<z<13, which we then combine in subsets of \simeq 200 galaxies per bin, arriving at total effective integration times of several million seconds per spectral pixel. This extremely deep spectroscopy reveals the UV line emission from the galaxies, which we then measure to explore astrophysical processes in concert with the optical lines. We study emission lines of [C ii], C iii], C iv, He ii, O iii], N iii] and N iv] in the UV, as well as many strong lines in the optical range. We make a concerted effort to understand the nebular abundances, the variation in their patterns, and evolution with the youth of the star formation episode. In Section 2 we present the sample selection, data, and data analysis methods. In Section 3 we show the average spectra of high-z galaxies, describe the main trends with star-formation evolutionary state, and quantify the lines ratios and EWs. In Section 4 we calculate electron temperatures using both collisional lines of [O iii] and the nebular Balmer Jump, and estimate the abundances of oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. We describe measurements related to the production and escape of ionizing radiation (f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{LyC}} and \xi_{\mathrm{ion}}) in Section 5. In Section 6 we discuss how these observations relate to other efforts to understand the buildup and chemical enrichment of galaxies, and in Section 7 we present our concluding remarks. Throughout we assume a cosmology of \{H_{0},\Omega_{\mathrm{M}},\Omega_{\Lambda}\}=\{70~{}\mathrm{km~{}s}^{-1}~{}% \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1},0.3,0.7\}, and the AB magnitude system (Oke & Gunn, 1983)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09138v1,Mapping the dense molecular gas towards thirteen supernova remnants,"Supernova remnants (SNRs) can exert strong influence on molecular clouds (MCs) through interaction by shock wave and cosmic rays. In this paper, we present our mapping observation of \rm HCO^{+} and \rm HCN 1–0 lines towards 13 SNRs interacting with MCs, together with archival data of CO isotopes. Strong \rm HCO^{+} emission is found in the fields of view (FOVs) of SNRs W30, G9.7-0.0, Kes 69, 3C 391, 3C 396, W51C, HC 40, and CTB109 in the local-standard-of-rest (LSR) velocity intervals in which they are suggested to show evidence of SNR-MC interaction. We find an incomplete \rm{}^{12}CO shell surrounding G9.7-0.0 with an expanding motion. This shell may be driven by the stellar wind of the SNR progenitor. We also find an arc of \rm{}^{12}CO gas spatially coincident with the northwestern radio shell of Kes 69. As for the \rm HCO^{+} line emission, SNRs 3C 391 and W51C exhibit significant line profile broadening indicative of shock perturbation, and CTB109 exhibits a possible blue-shifted line wing brought by shock interaction. We do not find significant variation of the I({\rm HCO^{+}})/I({\rm HCN}) line ratio between broad-line and narrow-line regions, among different SNRs, and between MCs associated with SNRs and typical Galactic MCs. Therefore, we caution on using the I({\rm HCO^{+}})/I({\rm HCN}) line ratio as a diagnostic of SNR feedback and CR ionization. We also estimate the N({\rm HCO^{+}})/N({\rm CO}) abundance ratio in 11 regions towards the observed SNRs, but they show little difference from the typical values in quiescent MCs, possibly because N({\rm HCO^{+}})/N({\rm CO}) is not an effective tracer of CR ionization.","Massive (\gtrsim 8M_{\odot}) stars, born in molecular clouds (MCs) and ending their lives as supernovae (SNe), each re-deposit \sim 10^{51}\rm\ erg back to the interstellar medium and regulate the galactic ecology and evolution (Pillepich et al., 2018). Many supernova remnants (SNRs) are found to be located in the vicinity of MCs (e.g. Jiang et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2014). If an SNR is interacting with an MC, the shock, X-ray emission, and the cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated by the SNR can strongly affect the physical and chemical properties of the MC (Vink, 2020), which can be observed in terms of molecular transitions. CO and its isotopes are the most popular molecular species employed to investigate the SNR-MC interaction (e.g., Zhou et al., 2023) which can be evidenced by morphology alignment of the CO emission with the SNR radio emission, and the line broadening or line wings (e.g., Zhou et al., 2009; Su et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2016b). However, the CO molecules can only trace the most extended and low-density (with critical density111The definition of critical density of a molecular transition is not consistent in a variety of the literature. Here we define it as the Einstein A coefficient divided by the collisional rate coefficient at a specific temperature. The coefficients are taken from the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (LAMDA): https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/. of \sim 2\times 10^{3}\rm\ cm^{-3} for the 1–0 line and 3\times 10^{4}\rm\ cm^{-3} for the 3–2 line at 10 K) part of the MCs. Although denser shocked gas with broadened line profiles has been found in several SNRs (e.g., Koo & Moon, 1997; Reach & Rho, 1999; Reach et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2012), mapping observations of dense molecular gas around SNRs still lack. The \rm HCO^{+} and \rm HCN 1–0 lines, with critical densities of \sim 2\times 10^{5}\rm\ cm^{-3} and 10^{6}\rm\ cm^{-3}, respectively, are typical dense gas tracers in MCs (Shirley, 2015). The integrated intensity ratio of the two lines (hereafter called line ratio for simplicity) have been used as diagnostics of physical processes in extragalactic studies (e.g. Krips et al., 2008; Costagliola et al., 2011). A simultaneous mapping of CO and these two dense gas tracers can provide a comprehensive view of the molecular environment of SNRs. SNRs are believed to be the main accelerators of Galactic CRs (e.g., Aharonian, 2013). The high-energy (with kinetic energy \gtrsim 280 MeV) CR protons can generate \gamma-ray emission originated from the decay of \pi^{0} mesons produced in the collision between the high-energy CR protons and H nuclei in MCs, which is called the hadronic scenario. The high-energy CR electrons can produce \gamma-ray emission via the inverse Compton scattering of background radiation, which is called the leptonic scenario. The \gamma-ray emission can be detected by instruments such as the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Acero et al., 2016). On the other hand, the low-energy CR protons serve as the main source of ionization in dark MCs shielded from UV radiation (Padovani et al., 2009). This process starts the formation of poly-atomic molecules in MCs and regulates the molecular chemistry in MCs. Direct estimation of CR ionization rates in MCs associated with SNRs typically uses the N({\rm HCO^{+}})/N({\rm CO}) and N({\rm DCO^{+}})/N({\rm HCO^{+}}) abundance ratios (Ceccarelli et al., 2011; Vaupré et al., 2014). Although the emission of \rm DCO^{+} is hard to detect, both observations obtained enhanced CR ionization rates. The enhanced CR ionization rates induced by SNRs can also be revealed indirectly by various observations, including 1720 MHz OH masers and 6.4 keV Fe I K\alpha line. The production of the 1720 MHz OH masers requires enhanced CR ionization rate in addition to SNR-MC interaction (Lockett et al., 1999; Wardle & Yusef-Zadeh, 2002). The Fe I K\alpha line is produced via inner-shell ionization of neutral iron when protons in the MeV band collide with MCs (Nobukawa et al., 2018). Detection of hadronic \gamma-ray emission also hints that low-energy CR protons are possibly also accelerated and ionizing the MCs. The \rm HCO^{+} molecule has been expected to be a tracer of CR ionization rate in MCs (Ceccarelli et al., 2011; Bayet et al., 2011; Albertsson et al., 2018). Specifically, enhanced abundance of \rm HCO^{+} relative to CO due to CR ionization in shocked MCs has been found in SNRs W49B and W28 (Zhou et al., 2022; Tu et al., 2024a) Therefore, observation of \rm HCO^{+} in MCs associated SNRs may provide information about the CR acceleration and ionization in SNRs. In this paper, we performed new mapping observations in \rm HCO^{+} and \rm HCN 1–0 lines, supplemented by archival data of CO isotopes, towards a sample of 13 SNRs suggested to be interacting with MCs in order to obtain the spatial distribution of dense molecular gas around them, search for shocked dense gas with line profiles broadened, and study the viability of I({\rm HCO^{+}})/I({\rm HCN}) line ratio as a diagnostic of SN feedback and CR ionization. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe our new observations and other archival data. We present the observational results in Section 3 and discuss the SNR-MC interaction, the I({\rm HCO^{+}})/I({\rm HCN}) line ratio, and the N({\rm HCO^{+}})/N({\rm CO}) abundance ratio in Section 4. Finally, a summary is given in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09099v1,Detection of an orthogonal alignment between parsec scale AGN jets and their host galaxies,"The relationship between galaxies and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is an area of active research. One way to investigate this is to compare parsec-scale jets formed by SMBHs with the projected shape of their kiloparsec-scale host galaxies. We analyse Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) images of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and optical images of their host galaxies. We compare the inner-jet position angle in VLBI-detected radio sources with the optical shapes of galaxies as measured by several large optical surveys. In total 6273 galaxy-AGN pairs were found. We carefully account for the systematics of the cross-matched sources and find that Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys data (DESI LS) is significantly less affected by them. Using DESI LS, with which 5853 galaxy-AGN pairs were cross-matched, we find a weak but significant alignment signal (with a p-value \lesssim 0.01) between the parsec-scale AGN jet and the kpc projected minor axis of the optical host galaxy in sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. Our results show that the observed source properties are connected over 3 orders of magnitude in scale. This points towards an intimate connection between the SMBH, their host galaxies and their subsequent evolution.","Conclusion We find good evidence that the pc-scale VLBI jet is connected to the projected kpc-scale optical host galaxy morphology. The direction of the pc-scale jet (which may be a proxy for the SMBH-accretion disk system) appears to be oriented perpendicularly to the projected optical shape of the host galaxy with a p-value < 0.05. The interpretation of these results is complicated but may have far-reaching implications. Ultimately these results will need to be followed up with higher source counts and higher-resolution optical observations (e.g. HST, JWST) and with radio-quiet VLBI observations in order to determine how universal such a connection may be. In the near future there will be large surveys such will be performed using the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Square Kilometer Array (SKA) VLBI and therefore the potential to vastly increase our sample sizes."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09081v1,Hawking Radiation from non-evaporating primordial black holes cannot enable the formation of direct collapse black holes,"The formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe is a subject of significant debate. In this study, we examine whether non-evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) can offer a solution. We establish initial constraints on the range of PBH masses that correspond to Hawking radiation (HR) effective temperatures in the range needed to avoid the fragmentation of primordial gas into smaller, stellar-mass black holes. We also investigate the specific intensity of the HR from non-evaporating PBHs and compare it with the critical radiation needed for direct collapse black holes (DCBHs). We show that HR from non-evaporating PBHs cannot serve as the heating mechanism to facilitate the formation of the seeds for the SMBHs we observe in the high-redshift Universe unless, perhaps, the PBHs within the relevant mass range comprise a significant fraction of dark matter and are significantly clustered towards the center of the primordial halo.","In the standard model of cosmology, our Universe is expanding from a hot and dense state [e.g. 1]. Astrophysical structures begin to form when initial fluctuations collapse to form the first gas clouds (also known as primordial gas clouds). These are the birthplaces of the first galaxies [e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5]. Many, if not all, of these galaxies are believed to harbor a massive black hole (BH) in their center. Observations of quasars formed in the early Universe indicate that a number of these BHs have masses of more than a billion solar masses, and were formed before the Universe was a billion years old111Such as the quasar ULAS J1342+0928, whose SMBH has a mass of 800 million solar masses [6]. See also [7, 8, 9, 10].. The formation of these high-mass black holes, aptly called supermassive black holes (SMBHs), is a matter of considerable debate [e.g. 11, 10]. Three of the most prevalent proposed scenarios, outlined in [11], include: 1) the collapse of massive Pop III stars and their growth due to accretion [12, 13, 14, 15], 2) runaway mergers in dense star clusters [16], and 3) the collapse of a primordial, metal-free gas cloud [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Alternative scenarios, among others, involve the growth of primordial black holes (PBHs) [26, 27], the increase of the mass of protostellar collapse in the presence of magnetic fields [28, 29] or gas dynamical processes [30, 31]. For a more detailed coverage of these and other scenarios, see [32, 33, 34, 35, 10, 36, 5]. Even the most common proposals are not without problems. For example, a newly-born Pop III star in the range of \sim\rm 100\>M_{\odot} would need to accrete continuously at a rate close to the Eddington limit for at least a Gyr to reach masses close to \rm 10^{9}\>M_{\odot} at redshifts z=6-7 [37, 33, 35], which poses difficulties for the first scenario. Dense star clusters would need to be able to retain their members after the mergers (i.e. to overpower the gravitational kicks that lead to the ejection of the merged object from the cluster [38, 39]), posing difficulties for the second scenario. This paper focuses on the third scenario: the direct collapse of metal-free gas clouds, a ‘heavy seeds’ scenario. In this case, the masses of the initial BHs are on the order of \rm 10^{5}-10^{6}\>M_{\odot} [e.g. 40, 22]. Therefore, they could grow through more viable rates of accretion into the SMBHs we observe by z\approx 6-7. One of the key prerequisites of this scenario is to avoid fragmentation of the collapsing gas cloud222The presence of angular momentum is also an obstacle to massive BH collapse that needs to be overcome. Here, we assume that the gas clouds in question have overcome this issue by assuming they have either formed with negligible angular momentum or that they have lost their initial angular momentum due to interactions with their environment [41].. To avoid fragmentation, this family of models usually assumes the presence of an ‘atomic cooling halo’–a halo without significant metals or molecules that could cool efficiently and lead to fragmentation of the original cloud into smaller clumps–with an equilibrium temperature on the order of T_{\rm crit}\sim 10^{4} K [32, 23] (for some alternative direct-collapse scenarios see e.g. [42, 31]). To achieve such high temperatures, a number of mechanisms have been invoked [10, 43, 44, 45]. In this paper, we consider the presence of strong UV radiation in the Lyman-Werner (LW) range (11.2-13.6 eV) that is able to suppress the formation of molecular hydrogen H2 [12, 46, 47, 48, 49] through radiation from PBHs. For the heating mechanism, we investigate whether the Hawking radiation (HR) [50] emitted from early-Universe PBHs [51, 52] can create the necessary conditions for the formation of large BH seeds via the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds. In this proposed mechanism, the required energy is supplied by the HR of an evaporating PBH that is still far from “exploding”. We model this radiation as a blackbody spectrum, focusing only on primary photon emission. The role of PBHs in the formation of the first stars and galaxies has been investigated before [53, 54, 55], but remains an important unanswered question in the scientific community. Most recently, [55] studied the heating effects of secondary HR spectra from “exploding” PBHs in primordial gas clouds. They find that in the presence of significant clustering of the PBHs in the clouds, PBHs of masses on the order of 10^{14} g can lead to a successful direct collapse of the cloud. On the other hand, [53, 54] used cosmological simulations and semi-analytical models to explore the effects of stellar-mass (\sim 10-100\ \rm M_{\odot}) PBHs in the acceleration of structure formation and gas heating by accretion feedback on the BHs. In the former case, they find that structures are similar to the ones found in \LambdaCDM simulations, but in latter case, they show that LW photons from accretion onto stellar-mass PBHs in the halo can indeed promote the formation of massive seeds through the direct-collapse scenario. In this work, we describe a simplified and easily-modifiable analysis framework, more in line with [55], in hopes that the scientific community can continue to build on this work to answer this open question. For all cosmological calculations in this paper, we assume a flat \LambdaCDM cosmology with H_{0}=70 km/s/Mpc and \Omega_{m}=0.3. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the main consequences of Hawking radiation. Section 3 introduces some of the relevant features of primordial black holes. Section 4 sets constraints on the primordial black holes that could act as sources of the Hawking radiation needed to produce ‘heavy seeds’, and compares these constraints with current observational limits. Finally, Section 5 provides a comprehensive discussion of the assumptions and caveats of this work and proposes extensions to this simplified model."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09033v1,The ALMA-CRISTAL Survey:,"The history of gas assembly in early galaxies is reflected in their complex kinematics. While a considerable fraction of galaxies at z\sim 5 are consistent with rotating disks, current studies indicate that the dominant galaxy assembly mechanism corresponds to minor and major mergers. Despite the important progress, the dynamical classification of galaxies at these epochs is still severely limited by observations’ angular and spectral resolution. We present a detailed morphological and kinematic analysis of the far-infrared bright main sequence galaxy HZ10 (CRISTAL-22) at z=5.65, making use of new sensitive high-resolution (\lesssim 0.3\arcsec) [C ii] 158\mum ALMA and rest-frame optical JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy observations. These observations reveal a previously unresolved complex morphology and kinematics of the HZ10 system. Using position-velocity diagrams, we confirm that HZ10 is not a single massive galaxy but consists of at least three components in close projected separation along the east-to-west direction. We find a [C ii] bright central component (C), separated by 1.5 kpc and 4 kpc from the east (E) and west (W) components, respectively. Our [C ii] observations resolve the HZ10-C component resulting in a velocity gradient, which could be produced by either rotation or a close-in merger. We test the rotating disk possibility using DysmalPy kinematical modeling. Based on this, we propose three different dynamical scenarios for the HZ10 system: (i) a double merger, in which the companion galaxy HZ10-W merges with the disturbed clumpy rotation disk complex formed by the HZ10-C and E components; (ii) a triple merger, where the companion satellite galaxies, HZ10-W and HZ10-E, merge with the rotation disk HZ10-C; and (iii) a quadruple merger, in which the companion galaxies HZ10-W and HZ10-E merge with the close double merger HZ10-C. Additionally, from the comparison between ALMA [C ii] 158\mum and JWST/NIRSpec data, we find that [C ii] 158\mum emission closely resembles the broad [O iii] 5007Å emission both spatially and kinematically. The latter reflects the interacting nature of the system and suggests that ionized and neutral gas phases in HZ10 are well mixed.","Studying early galaxies and early-stage galaxy assemblies is essential for understanding the fundamental processes of galaxy formation and evolution. While present-day galaxies are mostly quiescent, this picture dramatically differs from the early Universe, when galaxies were undergoing active interactions that shaped their assembly history. According to observations and simulations, the relative contribution of smooth cold gas accretion from the intergalactic medium and major mergers to the galaxy mass growth evolves across time (Overzier, 2016). While at low redshifts the mass assembly is dominated by the smooth gas accretion, at higher redshifts, z>3, merger processes become increasingly important (e.g. Duncan et al., 2019; Romano et al., 2021). The morpho-kinematic analysis of emission lines in the spectra of galaxies is a powerful tool for determining the history of the gas assembly of the galaxies. This method, however, in addition to high spectral resolution, requires also high spatial resolution, which is challenging to achieve at high redshift. While in the local Universe one of the most accessible tracers used to study the galaxy kinematics is the H i 21cm emission line (e.g. Walter et al., 2008; Begum et al., 2008; Hunter et al., 2012; Patra et al., 2016; de Blok et al., 2024), at high redshift such observations are currently unavailable. So far, the most distant H i 21cm emission line detections are at z\approx 0.4 (Xi et al., 2024) from a few non-lensed galaxies and at z\approx 1.3 from one strongly lensed galaxy (Chakraborty & Roy, 2023). While the Square Kilometre Array shows promise in exploring H i 21cm signal from the early Universe, studying galaxy kinematics at redshifts z>2 will continue to be challenging (Staveley-Smith & Oosterloo, 2015). However, the [C ii] fine structure {}^{2}P^{\circ}_{3/2}\to {}^{2}P^{\circ}_{1/2} transition at rest-frame wavelength of 158\mum provides a reasonable alternative. Since this line is easily excited by collisions of the carbon ion with electrons, as well as molecular and atomic hydrogen (Goldsmith et al., 2012), it traces multiple gas phases and is widely regarded as a good probe of galaxy kinematics in the early Universe (de Blok et al., 2016). Being one of the key coolants of interstellar gas in galaxies and the strongest far-infrared emission lines, [C ii] is detectable up to very high redshifts (e.g., up to z\sim 8.5, Bakx et al., 2020; Bouwens et al., 2022; Fujimoto et al., 2024). A major step forward in the systematic study of high-redshift galaxies has been possible thanks to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program to INvestigate [C ii] at Early times (ALPINE) (Le Fèvre et al., 2020) and Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) (Bouwens et al., 2022). Among many other results such as the presence of extended [C ii] halos around early star-forming galaxies (e.g. Fujimoto et al., 2019, 2020; Ginolfi et al., 2020), these surveys revealed a significant fraction of merging galaxies at z\sim 5 (Romano et al., 2021), yet with a considerable fraction of possible rotating disks, even at z\sim 7 (Jones et al., 2021; Smit et al., 2018). The ALPINE and most of the REBELS observations, however, were limited by their coarse angular resolution (\sim 1\arcsec), yielding the need for targeted higher-resolution observations to investigate the morphology and kinematics of galaxies at z>4. Indeed, these previously barely resolved observations were not suited for dynamical analysis and could lead to a considerable misclassification between rotation disks and mergers (e.g. Rizzo et al., 2022). Thanks to the unprecedented spatial resolution reachable with ALMA and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we are entering the era of kpc-scale studies of galaxies within the first billion years of the Universe (e.g. Herrera-Camus et al., 2022; Posses et al., 2023; Mitsuhashi et al., 2023; Solimano et al., 2024a, b; Posses et al., 2024; Villanueva et al., 2024; Jones et al., 2024; Ikeda et al., 2024). High-resolution ALMA observations confirmed the presence of disk-like galaxies at very high redshifts z\sim 6-7 (e.g. Neeleman et al., 2023; Rowland et al., 2024), however, frequently unveiling a complex morphology and interactions instead (e.g. Solimano et al., 2024b; Posses et al., 2024; Ikeda et al., 2024). Moreover, these observations confirmed the existence of extended [C ii] emission and its possible connection to mergers and/or outflows (e.g. Pizzati et al., 2020; Akins et al., 2022; Ikeda et al., 2024). However, such high-resolution observations remain scarce, and even with the advent of JWST, observations of [C ii] are essential as [C ii] emission in galaxies predominantly originates from photodissociation regions with contribution from atomic neutral and ionized gas (e.g., Pineda et al., 2013; Pallottini et al., 2017; Olsen et al., 2017) and typically traces galaxy kinematics (e.g., Kohandel et al., 2019). In contrast, rest-frame optical line kinematics such as H\alpha and [O iii] might be dominated by outflows. Using new high angular resolution ALMA observations (\sim 0.3\arcsec) presented in this work, complemented by JWST data, we aim to perform detailed morphological and kinematic analyses of the cool and ionized gas in HZ10, a far-infrared bright and gas-rich galaxy in the COSMOS field at z=5.65. This source is part of a protocluster with recent or ongoing major merging processes (Pavesi et al., 2018), and thus provides an exceptional opportunity to look at the complex picture of starburst-driven phenomena and interactions occurring in overdensity environments at high redshifts (Oteo et al., 2018; Guaita et al., 2022; Lewis et al., 2018). The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe previous studies of the HZ10 and its neighborhood. In section 3 we describe the sensitive high-resolution ALMA [C ii] observations used for the analysis and briefly describe Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST data used for the comparison. In section 4 we present moment maps of HZ10 derived from new high-resolution ALMA [C ii] observations, along with a 2D parametric modeling of the moment-0 map and a kinematic analysis based on position-velocity (PV) diagrams and rotation curves. In section 5 we perform kinematic modeling of the brightest [C ii] component of HZ10, assuming this component represents a rotating disk. We also examine the validity of this assumption, considering alternative dynamic scenarios for the system, such as a triple merger or a merger involving a disturbed disk and a satellite galaxy. In section 6 we compare ALMA observations with those from JWST/NIRSpec. Lastly, we discuss the results and present our conclusions in sections 7 and 8, respectively. Throughout the paper, we adopt a standard flat \LambdaCDM cosmology with the matter and dark energy density parameters \Omega_{m}=0.3, and \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7, respectively, and with the reduced Hubble constant h=0.7, which gives a conversion scale of 5.899 kpc/″ at redshift z=5.65."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08991v1,S^{5}: New insights from deep spectroscopic observations of the tidal tails of the globular clusters NGC 1261 and NGC 1904,"As globular clusters (GCs) orbit the Milky Way, their stars are tidally stripped forming tidal tails that follow the orbit of the cluster around the Galaxy. The morphology of these tails is complex and shows correlations with the phase of orbit and the orbital angular velocity, especially for GCs on eccentric orbits. Here, we focus on two GCs, NGC 1261 and NGC 1904, that have potentially been accreted alongside Gaia-Enceladus and that have shown signatures of having, in addition to tidal tails, structures formed by distributions of extra-tidal stars that are misaligned with the general direction of the clusters’ respective orbits. To provide an explanation for the formation of these structures, we make use of spectroscopic measurements from the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S^{5}) as well as proper motion measurements from Gaia’s third data release (DR3), and apply a Bayesian mixture modelling approach to isolate high-probability member stars. We recover extra-tidal features similar to those found in Shipp et al. (2018) surrounding each cluster. We conduct N-body simulations and compare the expected spatial distribution and variation in the dynamical parameters along the orbit with those of our potential member sample. Furthermore, we use Dark Energy Camera (DECam) photometry to inspect the distribution of the member stars in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). We find that potential members agree reasonably with the N-body simulations and that the majority of them follow a simple stellar population-like distribution in the CMD which is characteristic of GCs. We link the extra-tidal features with their orbital properties and find that the presence of the tails agrees well with the theory of stellar stream formation through tidal disruption. In the case of NGC 1904, we clearly detect the tidal debris escaping the inner and outer Lagrange points which are expected to be prominent when at or close to the apocenter of its orbit. Our analysis allows for further exploration of other GCs in the Milky Way that exhibit similar extra-tidal features.","Globular clusters (GCs) are densely packed, spheroidal distributions of stars bound together by their gravity. Milky Way GCs can mostly be found within its halo or the bulge in orbit around the Galaxy. During a GC’s orbit, the Galactic tidal interaction leads to a gradual loss of member stars. According to Reina-Campos et al. (2020) who used 25 present-day Milky Way-mass zoom simulations from the E-MOSAICS project to estimate the fraction of globular cluster stars within the halo, \sim 0.3\% of the stars in the halo can be attributed to disrupted globular clusters. Meanwhile, 2.3\% can be attributed to other star clusters, and the majority of the halo is rather formed by the accretion of dwarf galaxies. Observationally, around 2% of halo field stars show the chemical abundance anomalies of second-generation globular cluster stars (Martell & Grebel, 2010; Martell, S. L. et al., 2011; Martell et al., 2016; Schiavon et al., 2017; Koch et al., 2019; Horta et al., 2021). Converting this into a fraction of the halo that originally formed in globular clusters is strongly influenced by the model one uses for the star formation history in a globular cluster and the extent of early first-generation mass loss, but estimates have ranged from 11% (Horta et al., 2021) to 50% (Martell & Grebel, 2010). The gradual loss of mass that GCs undergo can be the result of several mechanisms. In the outskirts of a GC, stars can be stripped away by the Galaxy’s potential therefore gaining an energy above the critical energy needed for their escape from the GC’s potential. This leads to the formation of a diffuse stellar envelope surrounding the cluster beyond its tidal radius (Fukushige & Heggie, 2000; Baumgardt, 2001; Claydon et al., 2017; Daniel et al., 2017). Other mechanisms are possible that lead to the ejection of stars from within GCs (Leigh & Sills, 2011; Grondin et al., 2023). These processes include natal kicks (Merritt et al., 2004), ejections via supernova events (Shen et al., 2018; Kounkel et al., 2022), or three-body encounters that can result in the ejection of one of the stars leaving behind a binary (Stone & Leigh, 2019; Manwadkar et al., 2020; Montanari & García-Bellido, 2022; Grondin et al., 2023). The main depopulation mechanism of GCs is the escape of stars through the Lagrange points, formed by the combined potentials of a given GC and the Galaxy (e.g. Küpper et al., 2008; Weatherford et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024). This mechanism results in the formation of long streams of stars sometimes referred to as tidal tails (e.g., Ibata et al., 2021, and references therein). Uncovering these streams is of great importance as they provide a means to probe the acceleration field of the Galaxy (e.g. Johnston et al., 1999; Ibata et al., 2001; Fellhauer et al., 2009) which can then constrain the dark matter distribution within the halo. Given the hierarchical merging scenario, the detection of stellar streams also reveals past merger events. Additionally, dark matter subhalos can be studied using stellar streams by examining gaps in the streams that could have resulted from impacts with these halos (e.g. Ibata et al., 2002; Johnston et al., 2002; Carlberg, 2012; Bovy, 2016; Erkal et al., 2016; Banik et al., 2018; Bonaca et al., 2019; Montanari & García-Bellido, 2022) allowing for tests of \LambdaCDM itself. Tidal tails of GCs have complex morphologies, and the orientation of the tails is correlated with the phase of orbit around the Galaxy – especially for GCs with eccentric orbits (Capuzzo Dolcetta et al., 2005; Montuori et al., 2007). Refer to Figure 5 of Montuori et al. (2007) for a schematic of all forces acting on a tidally disrupted GC that lead to the formation of tidal tails. Palomar 5 is a well studied example of a GC with prominent tidal tails (Odenkirchen et al., 2001, 2003; Ibata et al., 2016; Bonaca et al., 2020). The outer parts of the tails of Palomar 5 align with the direction of the orbit. The leading tail has a slightly lower energy and thus orbits closer to the Milky Way, while the trailing tail has a higher energy and thus orbits further from the Milky Way, both tails forming the characteristic S-shape centered on the cluster. Since the location of the Sun is above the orbital plane of Palomar 5, the difference in the tails’ distances from the Galactic center is projected onto the sky and is thus easily detectable. The orientation of the tails of GCs is also correlated with the location of the GC along its orbit and its eccentricity. The outer tails, or parts of the tidal tails that are farther away from the cluster, always align with the path of the orbit. On the other hand, the inner tails, i.e. parts of the tidal tails close to the GC, roughly align with the orbital path only when the cluster is near the pericenter (Capuzzo Dolcetta et al., 2005; Montuori et al., 2007). When the cluster approaches apocenter, the inner tails point in the direction of the Galactic center and anti-center. This distinction between the orientation of the inner and outer tails when the cluster is at apocenter then gives the impression that the GC has multiple tidal tails surrounding it. The same morphology dependence has been demonstrated for dwarf galaxies accreted onto the Milky Way in Klimentowski et al. (2009). Finally, a GC that has spent a long time in the Galactic halo will undergo several orbital periods, potentially leading to the production of many streams within the halo. This mechanism also leads to observing more than one pair of streams when probing an area on the sky surrounding such a GC. Some GCs that have been found with such structures surrounding them include NGC 288 (Leon et al., 2000; Sollima, 2020) and NGC 2298 (Balbinot et al., 2011). In this work we explore two other GCs, NGC 1261 and NGC 1904, which have also shown multiple stream-like structures surrounding them. Both GCs are relatively metal-rich with mean metallicities of -1.33\pm 0.02 and -1.66\pm 0.01 respectively (Wan et al., 2023) and are thought to have been accreted alongside the Gaia-Enceladus event (Limberg et al., 2022). NGC 1261 has a present-day mass of 1.67\times 10^{5} M⊙ with a heliocentric distance of 16.4 kpc and Galactocentric distance of 18.28 kpc (Baumgardt & Hilker, 2018). Based on the simulations of Wan et al. (2023), the orbital period of NGC 1261 is \sim 170 Myr, with a pericenter distance of \sim 2 kpc, and an apocenter distance of \sim 20 kpc. With such an orbital period, NGC 1261 is likely to have completed more than 10 full orbits around the galaxy within 2 Gyrs and lost a large portion (\sim 50\%) of its mass due to stellar evolution and the frequent interaction with the Galaxy’s tidal field (e.g. Balbinot & Gieles, 2017). NGC 1904 (M 79), has a present-day mass of 1.69\times 10^{5} M⊙ with heliocentric and Galactocentric distances of 13.08 kpc and 19.1 kpc respectively (Baumgardt & Hilker, 2018). It has a small pericenter with a Galactocentric radius of \sim 0.33 kpc where the tidal effect from the Galaxy is strong. At the present, this GC lies very close to the apocenter of its orbit. Leon et al. (2000) pointed out the existence of a tidal tail for NGC 1261 oriented in the direction of the Galactic center, and works including Kuzma et al. (2017) and Wan et al. (2023) pointed out the existence of a stellar envelope surrounding this cluster. Similarly, an extended halo of stars was found around NGC 1904, first in Grillmair et al. (1995) and also in Leon et al. (2000), Zhang et al. (2022), Wan et al. (2023) and Xu et al. (2024). In Shipp et al. (2018), data from the first three years of the Dark Energy Survey (DES: Abbott et al., 2018) were used to identify stellar streams in the Milky Way halo. Their results also included evidence for extra-tidal features around four Milky Way GCs, namely NGC 288, NGC 1261, NGC 1851, and NGC 1904. Shipp et al. (2018) found stellar overdensities associated with NGC 1261 and NGC 1904 that do not align with the general direction of their orbits and in fact form a cross-shaped pattern centered on the clusters. Though they have pointed out these overdensities, they left further exploration to future work. More recently, Sollima (2020) has found three extra-tidal structures surrounding NGC 1904 that point in multiple directions, and Ibata et al. (2024) suggested that two streams could be associated to NGC 1261. In this paper, we focus on these two GCs, and perform the subsequent analysis hinted at by Shipp et al. (2018) to provide further clarity pertaining to the origin of the clusters’ extra-tidal features. Given the detection of these features in the aforementioned works, and the current location of NGC 1904 along its orbit, it seems possible that multiple stream-like features can be associated to these GCs, though more work is required to make that connection. Consequently, the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (Li et al., 2019, S^{5}), has performed follow-up observations of these two clusters and in the fields surrounding them to expand on the findings of Shipp et al. (2018). The survey has targeted regions on the sky along the expected orbit of the clusters as well as in the regions where the extra-tidal features from Shipp et al. (2018) were found. The survey provides radial velocities as well as metallicity measurements to help constrain extra-tidal member stars associated with these clusters in the targeted fields. The goal of this paper is to explore the cross-shaped features reported by Shipp et al. (2018) around the GCs NGC 1261 and NGC 1904, making use of the deep spectroscopic observations of S^{5}. We employ a Bayesian mixture modelling technique that incorporates proper motion measurements as well as radial velocity and metallicity values to isolate the GC and stream stars from the surrounding field stars within an area spanning \sim 10r_{J} where r_{J} is the Jacobi radius of each cluster. After extracting the studied structures, we compare their spatial distribution and properties to what is expected when running N-body simulations of the two GCs. We primarily attempt to link the substructure found surrounding the clusters to their orbits around the Galaxy. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we explain the data collected by S^{5}, specifically the target selection during the follow-up observations and the processing that the measurements undergo. In Section 3, we describe the methodology applied to the selected sample of stars for each GC to distinguish high probability member stars. We also explain how the N-body simulations are constructed for comparison with our results. Section 4 describes our results pertaining to the detected streams or substructure detected around the studied GCs. We then discuss these results in Section 5. In particular, we discuss the reliability of our methodology as well as the formation mechanisms of any uncovered substructure. Section 6 then summarizes our results and presents future prospects of this work. Figure 1: 3D sky plots for NGC 1261 (top) and NGC 1904 (bottom). The position of each GC is shown as a red star and the particles from the N-body simulations are shown in blue throughout the paper. The zoomed panels show the distribution of particles close to the clusters and the outlines of the fields targeted by S^{5} (black circles). We also plot in purple the integrated orbit of each GC given the gravitational potential described in Section 3.1 and the direction of motion of the cluster is indicated by the red arrow."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08983v1,From seagull to hummingbird: New diagnostic methods for resolving galaxy activity,"Context. One of the principal challenges in astrophysics involves the classification of galaxies based on their activity. Presently, the characterization of galactic activity usually requires multiple diagnostics to fully cover the diverse spectrum of galaxy activity types. Additionally, the presence of multiple sources of excitation with similar observational signatures hinders the exploration of the activity of a galaxy.Aims. In this study, our objective is to develop an activity diagnostic tool that addresses the degeneracy inherent in the existing emission line diagnostics by identifying the underlying excitation mechanisms of a mixed-activity galaxy principal components (star formation, active nucleus, or old stellar populations) and identifying the dominant ones.Methods. We utilize the random forest machine-learning algorithm, trained on three primary activity classes of star-forming, active galactic nucleus (AGN), and passive, that represent the three key gas excitation mechanisms. This diagnostic relies on four discriminating features: the equivalent widths of three spectral lines–[O III] \lambda5007, [N II] \lambda6584, and H\alpha–along with the D4000 continuum break index.Results. We find that this classifier achieves almost perfect performance scores in the principal activity classes. In particular, the achieved overall accuracy is \sim99%, while the recall scores are: \sim100% for star-forming, \sim98% for AGN, and \sim99% for passive. The nearly perfect scores achieved enable the decomposition of mixed activity classes into the three primary gas excitation mechanisms with high confidence, thereby resolving the degeneracy inherent in current activity classification methods. Furthermore, we find that our classifier scheme can be simplified to a two-dimensional diagnostic diagram of D4000 index against log10(EW([O III]){}^{2}) line without significant loss of its diagnostic power.Conclusions. We introduce a diagnostic capable of classifying galaxies based on their primary gas excitation mechanisms. Simultaneously, it can deconstruct the activity of mixed-activity galaxies into these principal components. This diagnostic encompasses the entire range of galaxy activity. Additionally, D4000 index serves as a valuable indicator for resolving the degeneracy among various activity components by estimating the age of the stellar populations within a galaxy.","One of the most challenging and important topics in astrophysics is the activity classification of galaxies. Galaxies can be separated into categories based on their prevailing gas excitation mechanism. Typically, the identification of the radiation source that excites the gas is determined from the observed spectrum of a galaxy (e.g., atomic emission lines; Baldwin et al., 1981). In a galaxy, three primary gas excitation mechanisms can occur. The first involves the presence of young stars that emit substantial amounts of intense UV radiation, thereby ionizing the surrounding gas cloud. Another distinct mechanism arises from an active black hole situated at the galaxy’s center, where circumnuclear material undergoes accretion and produces intense UV and X-ray radiation. Finally, hot-evolved stellar populations can generate sufficient UV radiation to excite the surrounding gas in their vicinity. Furthermore, the spectrum of a galaxy cannot be exclusively linked to a specific excitation mechanism. For instance, a population of post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) stars can emulate an active galaxy (Stasińska et al., 2008). This intricate nature of galaxies complicates the characterization of their activity. Moreover, the development of highly effective activity diagnostic tools, in terms of completeness and reliability, are critical for demographic surveys of galactic activity. These are a key element for understanding the interplay between interstellar medium, star formation, stellar populations, and AGN activity in galactic cores and hence the general galactic evolution process (e.g., Ho et al., 1997b). Numerous approaches have been taken in this direction, leading to the creation of a multitude of diagnostic tools, in an endeavor to address this problem, which is both highly important and complex. Some of these approaches rely on atomic emission-line fluxes (e.g., ratios of Balmer hydrogen lines with forbidden emission lines; Baldwin et al., 1981), while others use infrared colors (e.g., Donley et al., 2012; Mateos et al., 2012; Stern et al., 2012; Daoutis et al., 2023), aiming to pinpoint the primary source of radiation driving the observed galaxy spectrum and thus categorize its activity class. One of the most successful and widely used diagnostics is the Baldwin et al. (1981) diagram (hereafter referred to as the BPT diagram). It’s most commonly used version employs the ratios of the first two Balmer series lines (H\alpha and H\beta) and two forbidden emission lines ([O III] \lambda 5007 and [N II] \lambda 6584) to construct a two-dimensional plot of [O III] \lambda 5007/H\beta versus [N II] \lambda 6584/H\alpha. Based on their position on this diagram, galaxies are categorized as active galactic nuclei (AGN), star-forming (SF), or transition objects (TO or composite galaxies, e.g., Ho et al., 1997b). The galaxies on this diagram form a seagull-like shape, with star-forming galaxies situated in the left wing, composite galaxies comprising its body, and AGN positioned in the right wing. Similarly, additional diagrams involving the [S II] \lambda\lambda 6717,6731/H\alpha and [O I] \lambda 6300/H\alpha ratios have been utilized, expanding the usefulness of emission-line ratios to objects hosting low-ionization sources. As a result, a new activity class was introduced: the class of LINER (Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Region; Heckman, 1980). Another activity diagnostic tool for galaxies in the optical spectrum has been introduced by Cid Fernandes et al. (2010). This approach, which can be viewed as a modified BPT diagram, employs optical emission lines and the H\alpha equivalent width to classify galaxies. An advantage of this diagram is its versatility beyond emission spectra allowing the inclusion of objects with weaker emission lines. Machine learning algorithms are powerful tools for discerning intricate relationships and patterns within data. They have already been applied to numerous problems across various scientific domains. In astrophysics, specifically, examples of their application ranges from stellar classification tasks (e.g., Kyritsis et al., 2022) to galaxy classification challenges, such as classification based on the BPT diagram (Stampoulis et al., 2019), the identification of AGN properties (e.g., Pennock et al., 2021), and the classification of galaxy morphology (e.g., Domínguez Sánchez et al., 2018). Up to this point, we have described the activity of galaxies that are exclusively characterized by a singular gas excitation mechanism. However, a galaxy spectrum can rarely be a result of only one gas excitation mechanism. Composite and LINER are two galaxy classes introduced as distinct classes but in practice they are characterized by different sources of excitation or a combination of excitation mechanisms. Identifying the activity source in a composite galaxy can be intricate. Positioned between star-forming and AGN galaxies in the BPT diagram, the spectra of these galaxies can be excited by AGN or young stellar populations. Moreover, recent investigations propose that not all composite galaxies host an active nucleus; instead, the added ionization source may originate from populations of hot-evolved stars (Byler et al., 2017, 2019). The mechanism driving the activity of LINER galaxies is more challenging to interpret. For several years, it was believed that their activity resulted from a low-luminosity active nucleus (Ho et al., 1997b). Some studies introduced the notion that the activity can also be attributed to post-AGB stars (Binette et al., 1994; Stasińska et al., 2008; Papaderos et al., 2013). Agostino et al. (2021) provide further evidence that LINERs can be separated into two subclasses based on the hardness of their ionization field. To date, all available diagnostic methods converge on the conclusion that these two classes result from mixed activities, yet they fail to provide detailed insight into the characterization of the true underlying excitation mechanism. While some of the aforementioned classification methods have demonstrated success in discerning the AGN from star formation based on the hardness of the radiation source, the majority possess limited applicability, complex implementation, or inability to simultaneously include all activity classes. However, none of these methods can effectively characterize complex instances of galaxy activity where combinations of coexisting principal activity mechanisms result in degeneracy in the observed spectrum (e.g., composite galaxies). In this study, we intend to develop a machine-learning diagnostic tool that employs four key features and can effectively categorize galaxies into activity classes based on their similarities (i.e., shared properties) with the three primary excitation mechanisms: star formation, AGN, and emission from hot-evolved stellar populations. To achieve this, we employ a machine-learning approach. Our choice of discriminative features includes the equivalent widths (EW) of [O III] \lambda 5007, [N II] \lambda 6584, H\alpha, and the D4000 continuum break index (Balogh et al., 1999). Using equivalent widths instead of actual flux values for spectral lines enables us to encompass passive galaxies within a unified classification framework. Additionally, we anticipate that the D4000 index will help to identify the excitation resulting from hot-evolved stellar populations, which is frequently misidentified as emission from active galaxies. This confusion is especially pronounced in cases of mixed activity classes (e.g., composite galaxies). Our ultimate objectives encompass the identification of the dominant gas excitation mechanism in a galaxy, as well as the recognition of combinations of gas excitation mechanisms coexisting within galaxies exhibiting mixed activity classes. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we introduce the data sample, selection method of the galaxy activity classes, and data processing. In Sect. 3 we present the algorithm used for the development of our diagnostic tool, its training process, and the metrics used to evaluate its performance. In Sect. 4 we present the results and how we treat mixed-activity galaxy classes. In the same section, we introduce a new activity diagnostic diagram tailored to handle all galaxy activity types (active to passive) offering more resolution (in terms of activity) for mixed-activity classes that are not addressed in the current diagnostics. In Sect. 5 we discuss potential limitations and we compare our diagnostic with other diagnostic methods. In Sect. 6 we summarize our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08978v1,What Rogue Hydrogen Clouds tell us about Galactic Magnetic Fields,"Observations of the Milky Way and external galaxies support the idea that large-scale magnetic fields are concentrated in galactic disks, with halo magnetic fields at least an order of magnitude weaker. However, very little is known about the transition between the two. We present the discovery of linearly polarized radio emission at the interface between interacting shells of gas within a well-known grouping of high-velocity clouds (HVCs), the Anti-Center Shell. Faraday rotation of diffuse emission and of background extragalactic compact sources demonstrates an enhancement of the field at the interface. This is the clearest observed example of an HVC altering the large-scale magnetic field at the disk-halo interface and is the first image of magnetic field effects in an HVC. These results demonstrate the possibility of future three-dimensional reconstruction of the Galactic magnetic field and showcase the versatility of the Synthesis Telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory as one of the few existing telescopes which can exploit this new method of probing Galactic magnetism.","The interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy has three main constituents: gas and dust in different phases, relativistic cosmic rays, and magnetic fields (Ferrière, 2001). Cosmic rays spiral around the magnetic field threaded through the gas, generating linearly polarized synchrotron emission. Magnetic fields cause Faraday rotation of linearly polarized radiation, allowing us to infer the properties of the magnetic field along the line of sight. Faraday rotation observations from compact extragalactic sources (Simard-Normandin & Kronberg, 1980; Brown & Taylor, 2001; Brown et al., 2007; Taylor et al., 2009; Van Eck et al., 2011; Hutschenreuter et al., 2022; Anderson et al., 2021, 2024) and diffuse emission (Landecker et al., 2010; Hill et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2020; Dickey et al., 2022) show evidence that the magnetic field in the disk has a spiral pattern with possible field reversals (Han et al., 2006; Ordog et al., 2017). These data have been used to constrain models of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field (Sun et al., 2008; Jansson & Farrar, 2012). In the halo, Mao et al. (2010, 2012) showed that there is no coherent vertical field directly above and below the Sun, and Sobey et al. (2019) found a 2\textrm{ kpc} halo field scale height in the inner Galaxy. In face-on galaxies, a two-layer model of the disk magneto-ionic medium is preferred (Kierdorf et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2024). However, the interface between the disk and halo is difficult to probe directly. High velocity clouds (HVCs) may offer a way to probe interactions in this interface and gain insight into the magnetic transition. HVCs trace the cycle of baryons between the disks and halos of star-forming galaxies (Putman et al., 2012). Gas falls onto the Galactic disk either as part of a supernova- and stellar wind-driven “galactic fountain” process (Bregman, 1980) or as fresh infall from outside the Galaxy, falling into the disk with radial velocities (relative to the local standard-of-rest; V_{\mathrm{LSR}}) higher than permitted by galactic rotation. As HVCs fall from the halo into the warm disk (\sim 10^{3}-10^{4}\textrm{ K}; scale height \sim 1-2\textrm{ kpc} for warm ionized gas [Ocker et al. 2020] and \sim 100-200\textrm{ pc} for warm neutral gas [Foster & MacWilliams 2006; Malhotra 1995]), they interact, forming hydrodynamic instabilities (Lockman et al., 2008) and compressing magnetic fields. Evidence of compression of magnetic fields in HVCs has been seen through Faraday rotation of compact extragalactic sources in the Smith Cloud (Hill et al., 2013; Betti et al., 2019) and Magellanic Bridge (Kaczmarek et al., 2017). This effect was first claimed by McClure-Griffiths et al. (2010) in the Magellanic leading arm, but Jung et al. (2021) found this detection to in fact be foreground confusion. Simulations also show evidence of compression of magnetic fields as HVCs interact with the disk (Galyardt & Shelton, 2016; Jung et al., 2023). For this work, we focus on the Anti-Center Shell (ACS; Heiles 1984; Tamanaha 1997), shown in Figure 1 with Effelsberg-Bonn H I Survey (EBHIS) data (Winkel et al., 2016). The ACS is a collection of clouds around Galactic longitude \ell\sim 180\arcdeg separated from Galactic emission by approximately 50\textrm{ km s}^{-1} in radial velocity (Tamanaha, 1997). The ACS consists of two main filaments on opposite sides of the Galactic plane: a southern filament at Galactic latitude b\approx-5\arcdeg and a northern filament at b\approx+7\arcdeg. With previously published observations (all single antenna), the Northern Filament is unresolved and appears as one large, elongated HVC, with its appearance suggesting an extremely large super-shell driven by supernova feedback (Heiles, 1984). Others have argued that it is colliding and merging with the disc underneath (Tamanaha, 1997) because it resembles the shapes of simulated HVCs that collide with the disc obliquely (Comeron et al., 1992). With |V_{\mathrm{LSR}}|\gtrsim 80\textrm{ km s}^{-1} and a separation from the disk gas in velocity space of \gtrsim 40\textrm{ km s}^{-1}, the ACS meets most definitions of an HVC (Wakker, 1991; Putman et al., 2012). However, its origin — stellar feedback or fresh infall — remains unknown. Whereas the Smith Cloud is relatively high in the halo at height |z|\approx 3\textrm{ kpc} (Lockman et al., 2008) along a complicated sightline passing through the Sagittarius Arm, interacting with the inner Galaxy, the ACS is at |z|\sim 400\textrm{ pc} in a much simpler direction with little confusion and the large-scale field perpendicular to line of sight. In this work, we investigate the magnetic field structure in the vicinity of the ACS using new observations from the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) Synthesis Telescope (ST). We describe our observations in Section 2. We then discuss the morphology of H I-emitting gas and diffuse polarized emission in Section 3. We discuss estimates of the distance to the ACS in Section 4. We discuss the dynamics and kinematics of the region in Section 5 and the implications for the magnetic field associated with the HVC and the disk-halo region in Section 6. We finish with a summary in Section 7."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08974v1,HETDEX-LOFAR Spectroscopic Redshift Catalog,"We combine the power of blind integral field spectroscopy from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) with sources detected by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) to construct the HETDEX-LOFAR Spectroscopic Redshift Catalog. Starting from the first data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), including a value-added catalog with photometric redshifts, we extracted 28,705 HETDEX spectra. Using an automatic classifying algorithm, we assigned each object a star, galaxy, or quasar label along with a velocity/redshift, with supplemental classifications coming from the continuum and emission line catalogs of the internal, fourth data release from HETDEX (HDR4). We measured 9,087 new redshifts; in combination with the value-added catalog, our final spectroscopic redshift sample is 9,710 sources. This new catalog contains the highest substantial fraction of LOFAR galaxies with spectroscopic redshift information; it improves archival spectroscopic redshifts, and facilitates research to determine the [O II] emission properties of radio galaxies from 0.0<z<0.5, and the Ly\alpha emission characteristics of both radio galaxies and quasars from 1.9<z<3.5. Additionally, by combining the unique properties of LOFAR and HETDEX, we are able to measure star formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses. Using the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS), we measure the emission lines of [O III], [Ne III], and [O II] and evaluate line-ratio diagnostics to determine whether the emission from these galaxies is dominated by AGN or star formation and fit a new SFR-L150MHz relationship.","For several decades, extragalactic radio surveys were a powerful probe of the distant Universe. In fact, until the mid-1990s, they served as an effective method for finding high redshift galaxies through optical identification of ultra steep radio sources, a poorly understood type of diffuse radio source characterized by power law spectra (e.g., Slee et al., 2001; Feretti et al., 2012; Whyley et al., 2024). Recent radio surveys have reached sub-milliJansky flux density levels, providing the framework to make these surveys a means of identifying star-forming galaxies. Previous studies have demonstrated a tight correlation between low-frequency radio continuum, which is dominated by synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons produced by supernovae, and the far-infrared (FIR) flux of galaxies (e.g., Yun et al., 2001). FIR emission is an established strong indicator of star formation rate (SFR) (Yun et al., 2001), thereby legitimizing the idea that radio continuum can act as a tracer of SFR (e.g., Condon et al., 2002; Pannella et al., 2009; Heesen et al., 2014; Davies et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2021). Radio surveys have played a small part in investigating star formation history, as they are generally limited by their sensitivity; however, star forming galaxies become increasingly important at fainter flux densities and totally dominate the source counts below \simeq 0.1 mJy at 1.4 GHz (e.g., Padovani et al., 2011, 2015; Bonzini et al., 2013), opening the door for new, more sensitive radio surveys to push to the forefront of SFR investigations (De Zotti et al., 2019). In particular, the introduction of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA; Grainge et al., 2017) with its square kilometer collecting surface and large range of frequencies (between 50 MHz - 24 GHz) will extend the flux density limit more than three orders of magnitude. The science of the SKA will be used to explore areas such as strong-field tests with pulsars and black holes, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization, cosmology and dark energy, the origin and evolution of cosmic magnetism, galaxy evolution probed by neutral hydrogen, the cradle of life and astrobiology, and galaxy and cluster evolution (De Zotti et al., 2019). To prepare for this new era of radio surveys, SKA will work alongside Pathfinders, like the International Low-frequency Array (LOFAR) Telescope (ILT), to contribute scientific and technical developments for direct use by SKA. The combination of multiple massive surveys at different wavelengths enables scientific projects otherwise unachievable (e.g., Smith et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2019). The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) is a sensitive, high-resolution (120-168 MHz, centered at 150 MHz) survey that has already collected millions of sources and is advancing our understanding of the formation and growth of massive black holes (e.g., Best et al., 2014; Mingo et al., 2019, 2022; Yue et al., 2023; Sabater et al., 2019), the evolution of galaxy clusters (e.g., Venemans et al., 2007; Wylezalek et al., 2013; Timmerman et al., 2022, 2024; Botteon et al., 2020), and the properties of high redshift radio sources (e.g., Gloudemans et al., 2021; Cordun et al., 2023). However, many of these scientific forefronts require optical counterparts for multi-wavelength matching as well as a robust set of distances or redshifts. HETDEX (Gebhardt et al., 2021; Hill et al., 2021) is blind-spectroscopic survey conducted with the wide-field upgraded Hobby Eberly Telescope (Ramsey et al., 1998; Hill et al., 2021) using the Visible Integral Field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS; Hill et al., 2021).222VIRUS is a joint project of the University of Texas at Austin, Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP), Texas A&M University (TAMU), Max-Planck-Institut für Extraterrestriche-Physik (MPE), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Pennsylvania State University, Institut für Astrophysik Göttingen, University of Oxford, Max-Planck-Institut für Astrophysik (MPA), and The University of Tokyo. HETDEX aims to measure the expansion history of the Universe at z\simeq 2.5 by detecting and mapping the spatial distribution of about a million Ly\alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs). The redshift range for LAE detection is 1.9<z<3.5 over a total of \sim 540 deg2 (11 Gpc3 comoving volume) including \sim 400 deg2 in the HETDEX Spring field. The internal data release 4 includes 67.48 deg2 of spectroscopic observations in the Spring Field with wavelengths spanning 3470-5540 Å. This amounts to 523 million fiber spectra. In the LOFAR/HETDEX overlap region, we aim to produce a new, large spectroscopic radio-source catalog that would facilitate breakthroughs in the study of galaxy proto-clusters, emission line properties of radio galaxies, and even radio-loud stars. The combination of wide-field photometric surveys for spectral energy distribution information and optical spectroscopic follow-up from HETDEX/VIRUS offers a characterization of key physical parameters, the most important of which being distance as represented by spectroscopic redshift (e.g., SDSS; Almeida et al., 2023). The combination of HETDEX and LOFAR will also allow the measurement of SFR, and stellar mass because of the VIRUS sensitivity. Both the LOFAR radio selection and HETDEX optical spectroscopic identifications are sensitive to SFR and AGN activity. Using VIRUS, we can measure the emission lines of [O III], H\beta, [Ne III], and [O II]. Emission line diagnostics like those of [O III]/H\beta, [Ne III]/[O II], R23, and [O III]/[O II] can provide information on a system’s metallicity and ionization parameter, and discriminate between excitation by AGN or star formation. Moreover, by comparing these line ratios as a function of stellar mass with those determined for galaxies found via selection methods, we can ultimately investigate how similar or dissimilar populations of galaxies are. In \S2, we describe the observations, data sets, and tools required to identify HETDEX counterparts to LOFAR sources and analyze the objects \S3 focuses on the redshift analysis of the sample, including a description of the classification code Diagnose that was developed for the HET VIRUS Parallel Survey (HETVIPS) and its application in this catalog. We also describe the matching process for the sources within both the HETDEX survey and LoTSS, as well as the criteria for determining whether the matches were accurate. This section also features a broad overview of the redshift results alongside the overall catalog breakdown and selected results from the catalog. In addition, we examine star formation in a sub-sample of galaxies in \S4. Finally, we discuss possible scientific applications and uses for this data set in \S5. Throughout this work, we use flat \LambdaCDM cosmological parameters H_{0}=67.66 km Mpc-1 s-1 and \Omega_{m,0}=0.30966 (Planck Collaboration et al., 2020)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08971v1,Challenges in constraining dust properties from starlight polarization,"Context. Dust polarization, which comes from the alignment of aspherical grains to magnetic fields, has been widely employed to study the interstellar medium (ISM) dust properties. The wavelength dependence of the degree of optical polarization, known as the Serkowski relation, was a key observational discovery that advanced grain modeling, and alignment theories. However, it was recently shown that line-of-sight (LOS) variations in the structure of the ISM or the magnetic field morphology contaminate the constraints extracted from fits to the Serkowski relation. These cases can be identified by the wavelength-dependent variability in the polarization angles. Aims. We aim to investigate to the extent to which we can constrain the intrinsic dust properties, and alignment efficiency from dust polarization data, by accounting for LOS variations of the magnetic field morphology.Methods. We employed the following archival data: 1) multi-wavelength starlight polarization from the largest agglomerated catalogue to date, 2) 3D dust extinction maps, and 3) stellar parallaxes from Gaia. We fit the Serkowski relation to the polarization data to constrain its free parameters, and explored potential imprints of LOS variations of the magnetic field morphology in them.Results. We found that these LOS integration effects contaminate the majority of the existing dataset, thus biasing the obtained Serkowski parameters by approximately 10\%. The constancy of the polarization angles with wavelength does not necessarily guarantee the absence of 3D averaging effects. We examined the efficiency of dust grains in polarizing starlight, as probed by the ratio of the degree of polarization to dust reddening, E(B-V). We found that all measurements respect the limit established by polarized dust emission data. A suppression in polarization efficiencies occurs at E(B-V) \approx 0.5 mag. We found evidence that this happens due to projection effects and may be unrelated to the intrinsic alignment of dust grains.Conclusions. The contribution of multiple LOS clouds to the observed polarization signal contaminates the obtained dust model parameters extracted from the fit of the Serkowski relation. This effect is more prominent in molecular hydrogen sightlines. The only reliable constraints on the intrinsic (aligned) dust grain properties from the existing data can be obtained from diffuse regions with E(B-V) \lesssim 0.5 mag. Projection effects are expected to be prominent in polarized dust emission data as well. This result could have important consequences on the interpretations of this dataset and its relation to grain alignment physics. Accurate knowledge of the 3D morphology of the ISM magnetic field is required to probe grain properties from dust polarization.","Despite accounting for only \sim 1\% of the total (interstellar medium) ISM mass, dust is omnipresent and integral to numerous processes, such as protostar formation (Mouschovias, 1996), molecular cloud dynamics (Hopkins, 2014; Squire & Hopkins, 2018; Hopkins et al., 2022; Hennebelle & Lebreuilly, 2023), cloud thermodynamics, astrochemistry (Goldsmith, 2001; Bialy & Sternberg, 2019), and Galaxy evolution. It is thus imperative to understand the ISM dust grain properties. Dust polarization is one of the most widely used and accurate methods for investigating the ISM dust grain properties. This effect comes from the interaction between aspherical dust grains and magnetic fields (Andersson et al., 2015). Dust polarization provides important constraints on the ISM grain properties (Guillet et al., 2018; Hensley & Draine, 2021; Hensley & Draine, 2023) and magnetic fields (Davis, 1951; Chandrasekhar & Fermi, 1953; Ostriker et al., 2001; Hildebrand et al., 2009; Houde et al., 2009; Cho & Yoo, 2016; Chen et al., 2022; Panopoulou et al., 2015, 2016; Versteeg et al., 2023; Panopoulou et al., 2019b; Hu & Lazarian, 2023; Pelgrims et al., 2023; Schmaltz et al., 2024; Doi et al., 2024; Skalidis & Pelgrims, 2019; Skalidis & Tassis, 2021; Skalidis et al., 2021). Single-band polarization measurements suffice for magnetic field studies (e.g., Skalidis et al., 2022, 2023), but for the exploration of dust grain properties, multi-band measurements are necessary (Serkowski, 1973; Whittet et al., 1992; Andersson & Potter, 2010). Variations in the degree of optical dust-induced polarization (p_{\lambda}) with wavelength (polarization spectrum) follow an empirical relation, which is usually referred to as the Serkowski relation (Serkowski, 1973; Serkowski et al., 1975). The Serkowski relation provides important constraints on grain properties (Hensley & Draine, 2021; Hensley & Draine, 2023). It reads as follows: p_{\lambda}=p_{max}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \exp\left[-K\leavevmode\nobreak\ \ln^{% 2}{\left(\frac{\lambda_{max}}{\lambda}\right)}\right], (1) where p_{max} is the maximum polarization fraction, usually observed at the V-band; \lambda_{max} is the wavelength where p_{max} is observed, and is proportional to the average size of aligned dust grains (Mathis, 1986); K quantifies the spread of p_{\lambda}; large K corresponds to narrow profiles, and vice versa. K is considered a proxy for the dust grain size distribution (Serkowski et al., 1975), or for the optical property variations of silicate grains (Papoular, 2018). Initially, it was found that K=1.15 (Serkowski, 1973), but more data suggested a linear relationship between K and \lambda_{max} (Wilking et al., 1980; Whittet et al., 1992; Whittet, 2022), K=(1.66\pm 0.09)\leavevmode\nobreak\ \lambda_{max}+(0.01\pm 0.05). (2) This is known as the Wilking relation. Eqs. (1), and (2) hold for \lambda\leavevmode\nobreak\ \epsilon\leavevmode\nobreak\ [0.1,1] \mum. The wavelength dependence of the degree of polarization can be understood as a consequence of the underlying (aligned) grain size distribution. Grain (symmetric and asymmetric) size distributions can be accurately approximated as power laws with negative slopes, indicating that small grains are more abundant than large grains (MRN, Mathis et al., 1977; Weingartner & Draine, 2001). Small grains (nanoparticles) are not easily aligned due to higher collision rates with gas particles (Hoang et al., 2015). Large grains are less susceptible to collisional disalignment but are less abundant. The two effects are balanced for intermediate-sized grains because they are neither too small nor too scarce. Consequently, the maximum degree of polarization is expected for intermediate size grains. In our Galaxy, this optimal size of aligned grains, which is proportional to \lambda_{max}, corresponds to \lambda_{max} \approx 0.55 \mum (Whittet, 2022). The empirical discovery of the polarization fraction’s wavelength dependence by Serkowski et al. (1975) revolutionized multi-wavelength polarization studies; it provided a critical framework for understanding ISM dust and magnetic fields. Soon after this discovery, it became apparent that multi-band polarization is a powerful tool for studying ISM dust, and magnetic fields. The impact of the 3D ISM structure on the Serkowski relation was predicted early on (Clarke & Al-Roubaie, 1984), but observational evidence was limited due to the lack of data. In the last two decades, however, the influx of optical polarization data greatly increased, allowing for systematic explorations of the 3D effects on the p_{\lambda} relation. This is evident by the recent agglomeration of starlight polarization data (Panopoulou et al., 2023), which increased the number of polarization measurements by a factor of five from the previous agglomeration Heiles (2000). Mandarakas et al. (2024) performed a multi-wavelength starlight polarization study to investigate the impact of the 3D ISM structure, and magnetic field morphology on the Serkowski fits. Through a combination of polarization data, Gaia distances, and 3D dust extinction maps (Edenhofer et al., 2024), Mandarakas et al. (2024) showed that when multiple clouds along the line of sight (LOS) with different magnetic field geometries, or dust properties contribute to the observed polarization signal, p_{\lambda} can either significantly deviate from or accurately follow the Serkowski relation. The latter case is particularly important: it highlights that the standard practice of only fitting the polarization measurements in the p_{\lambda} - \lambda space can be misleading due to the 3D structure of the ISM, even when the fits are accurate. In these cases, variations in the electric vector position angles (EVPA) should be taken into account through a joint fit in the Stokes Q, and U space. This result has important consequences for the interpretations of multi-wavelength polarization data, and limits our capacity to probe the intrinsic properties of (aligned) dust. In light of this discovery, we aimed to assess the accuracy with which we can constrain the intrinsic Serkowski parameters, which is required for grain modeling (Hensley & Draine, 2023); as well as for the alignment efficiency of grains, which is necessary for grain alignment theories (Lazarian & Hoang, 2007; Andersson et al., 2015). We explored the contribution of LOS integration to the obtained Serkowski parameters. In particular, we focused on the correlations between K and \lambda_{max} (Wilking relation, Eq. 2), and the polarization efficiencies, p_{max} / E(B-V). We found that a significant fraction of the existing data is contaminated by LOS variations of the magnetic field morphology, hence it is untrustworthy for constraining the grain properties. Knowledge of the 3D morphology of the ISM magnetic field is required to study the properties of (aligned) dust grains. The paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2 we present the employed dataset. In Sect. 3, we fit the Serkowski relation to the data using two methods. In Sect. 4, we explore the correlations between K and \lambda_{max}, and we present individual cases of measurements deviating from the Wilking relation because of the contribution of LOS integration. We also show that measurements following the Wilking relation can be affected by these effects. In Sect. 5, we explore the impact of LOS effects on the polarization efficiency obtained from starlight polarization data. We find a suppression in the polarization efficiency of molecular sightlines due to projection effects. In Sects. 6, and 7, we discuss our results in the context of existing literature, and summarize the main outcomes of this work. Figure 1: Characteristic examples of good fits (\chi^{2}\leq 1). The top two rows shows stars with variable EVPAs (\Delta\theta >3), while bottom rows shows stars with constant EVPAs (\Delta\theta <1). The third row star (identified as BD+26746), has a higher K / \lambda_{max} ratio than predicted by the Wilking relation. Stars that deviate from the Wilking relation, likely due LOS integration effects, tend to have relatively high degrees of polarization, p_{max} \gtrsim 2.5\% (Sect. 4.1). Figure 2: Analytical examples of the Serkowski relation (Eq. 1). The colored curves have different K but fixed p_{max}, and \lambda_{max} at 1\% and 0.6 \mum respectively. The black curve is typical of the ISM, while other curves, such as red, and green, are extreme cases that are unlike to observe in our Galaxy. Fitting models with only a few data around \lambda_{max}, leads to a spectrum of K solutions, which can favor extreme (unphysical) values. For these cases, propagating prior knowledge was crucial for the fits."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08970v1,Discovery of a Dense Association of Stars in the Vicinity of the Supermassive Black Hole Sgr A*,"We focus on a sample of 42 sources in the vicinity of the bow-shock source IRS 1W (N-sources), located at the distance of 6.05^{\prime\prime} north-east of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), within the radius of 1.35^{\prime\prime}. We present the first proper motion measurements of N-sources and find that a larger subset of N-sources (28 sources) exhibit a north-westward flying angle. These sources can be bound by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) or the concentration that we observe is due to a disk-like distribution projection along the line of sight. We detect the N-sources in H, K_{s}, and L’ bands. The north-westward flying sources could be a bound collection of stars. We discuss a tentative existence of an IMBH or an inclined disk distribution to explain a significant overdensity of stars. The first scenario of having an IMBH implies the lower limit of \sim 10^{4}~{}M_{\odot} for the putative IMBH. Our measurements for the first time reveal that the dense association of stars containing IRS 1W is a co-moving group of massive, young stars. This stellar association might be the remnant core of a massive stellar cluster that is currently being tidally stripped as it inspirals towards Sgr A*. The second scenario suggests that the appearance of the N-sources might be influenced by the projection of a disk-like distribution of younger He-stars and/or dust-enshrouded stars.","The extended radio source Sgr A consists of three components in terms of different radiative and spatial properties: Sgr A East, which is a non-thermal supernova remnant, Sgr A West which is a thermal region associated with the ionized mini-spiral structure, and the compact variable radio source Sgr A * associated with the supermassive black hole (SMBH) of \sim 4\times 10^{6}\,M_{\odot} (Balick & Brown, 1974; Goss & McGee, 1996; Eckart & Genzel, 1996; Ghez et al., 1998; Genzel et al., 2010; Eckart et al., 2017; GRAVITY Collaboration et al., 2019; Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2022; Genzel et al., 2024, and references therein) at the center of the Milky Way. The thermal Sgr A West region or the mini-spiral (Ekers et al., 1983; Lo & Claussen, 1983) is detected as a distinct filamentary structure in near- and mid-infrared bands (Clénet et al., 2004; Viehmann et al., 2006; Mužić et al., 2007; Bhat et al., 2022) as well as in the mm- and radio domain (Zhao et al., 2009, 2010; Moser et al., 2017). It is composed of three clumpy streamers orbiting around Sgr A* that consist of dust and ionized and atomic gas with the dust temperature of \sim 100\,K and the gas temperature of \sim 10^{4} K (Yusef-Zadeh et al., 1998; Kunneriath et al., 2012). A surprisingly large number of massive young stars with the age of a few million years resides in the Milky Way’s innermost half parsec (pc). They form at least one disk-like structure of clockwise orbiting stars (CW) (Genzel et al., 2003; Levin & Beloborodov, 2003). Paumard et al. (2006) also propose the existence of a second disk of counter-clockwise orbiting stars (CCW), which, however, appears to be less populous. The existence of disk-like structures, which can be traced even within the innermost S cluster (Ali et al., 2020), suggests the association of star-formation in the Galactic Center with the accretion disks that formed during the previous enhanced accretion activity of Sgr A*. The mechanism which leads to the presence of young stars with the age of \lesssim 5{\rm Myr} is still not completely understood because there are several factors in the Galactic Center environment that should be inhibiting the star-formation process, such as intense UV radiation and stellar winds, large turbulence, enhanced magnetic field, and the tidal forces from the SMBH (Morris, 1993). This problem is known as the “Paradox of youth” (Ghez et al., 2003), though with the advance of star-formation and dynamical models in galactic nuclei, it has been possible to explain the occurrence of young stars in the Galactic Center, see e.g. Mapelli & Gualandris (2016) for a review. Three plausible scenarios are generally discussed: 1. in-situ star-formation approach, in which stars form in the gravitationally unstable accretion disk or within an infalling molecular cloud that gets shocked due to collisions with the surrounding gas or is tidally compressed (Morris, 1993; Levin & Beloborodov, 2003; Nayakshin et al., 2006; Hobbs & Nayakshin, 2009; Lu et al., 2009; Bartko et al., 2009a; Paumard et al., 2006; Jalali et al., 2014; Bartko et al., 2010); 2. in-spiral star formation approach which claims that the star cluster first starts forming outside the central parsec, e.g. within the circum-nuclear disk or even further away in the central molecular zone. The presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) can shorten the dynamical friction timescale, which needs to be at most a few million years long in order for stars to be still young when they settle around the SMBH (Gerhard, 2001; McMillan & Portegies Zwart, 2003; Hansen & Milosavljević, 2003; Portegies Zwart et al., 2006; Berukoff & Hansen, 2006; Rizzuto et al., 2021; Peißker et al., 2021); 3. rejuvenation scenario, which proposes that late-type stars have undergone collisions with other stars, a dense accretion disc, or a jet, which caused their colder outer layers to be stripped off and made them appear hotter and younger than they actually would be (Morris, 1992, 1993; Genzel et al., 2003; Zajaček et al., 2020). In addition, late-type stars aligned with an accretion disk accrete material from it, which also leads to their rejuvenation by gaining fresh hydrogen (Cantiello et al., 2021). Apart from the cluster of young stars centered around Sgr A* within \sim 0.5\,{\rm pc}, there is a distinct concentration of infrared sources IRS 13 located at the projected distance of \sim 3-4^{\prime\prime} (\sim 0.12-0.16 pc) south-west of Sgr A * (Peißker et al., 2023; Dinh et al., 2024; Peißker et al., 2024). IRS 13 has been studied as a suitable candidate for the first two aforementioned scenarios for the origin of young stars in the central parsec. IRS 13 consists of two components – the northern part IRS 13N and the eastern part IRS 13E. IRS 13N hosts young, infrared-excess sources (Maillard et al., 2004; Eckart et al., 2004; Paumard et al., 2006; Mužić et al., 2008; Eckart et al., 2013). IRS 13E mainly contains massive Wolf- Rayet (WR) stars and the violent supergiant E1(OBI) (Maillard et al., 2004; Moultaka et al., 2005; Paumard et al., 2006), whereas the rest of the stars are fainter ones, identified as late-type stars and are most likely the background stars (Fritz et al., 2010). The velocity dispersion of the IRS 13E sources motivated the speculation about the existence of an IMBH to bind the cluster and thus prevent it from tidal disruption at the given distance from Sgr A*. The required mass of the assumed IMBH was inferred to be about \sim 10^{4}M_{\odot} (Maillard et al., 2004; Schödel et al., 2005). The existence of the prominent X-ray source in the IRS 13E cluster reinforced the discussion about the IMBH. On the other hand, Zhu et al. (2020) argue that a colliding wind scenario between E2 and E4 can explain the X-ray spectrum as well as the morphology of IRS 13E and suggests that there is no significant evidence that IRS 13E hosts an IMBH more massive than \sim 10^{3}M_{\odot}. In general, the occurrence of IMBHs in nuclear star clusters is expected based on dynamical arguments. Rose et al. (2022) propose that dynamical mechanisms operating in galactic nuclei, specifically black hole-star collisions, mass segregation, and relaxation, are particularly effective in the formation of IMBHs of \lesssim 10^{4}M_{\odot}. Their findings imply that at least one IMBH is likely to exist in the central parsec of the Galaxy. Another channel for the occurrence of IMBHs in galactic nuclei is their infall within massive stellar clusters (Spitzer, 1969; Portegies Zwart & McMillan, 2002; Rasio et al., 2004; Fragione, 2022), which directly relates dense stellar associations such as IRS13 with an IMBH. Rose et al. (2022) suggest that the collisions between black holes and stars can contribute to the diffuse X-ray emission in the Galactic Center region. Hence, also a growing black hole inside IRS13E that collides with the surrounding stars could contribute to the X-ray emission of the cluster. Another apparent concentration of stars in the inner parsec of the Galactic Center is associated with the source IRS 1W that is located within the northern arm of the mini-spiral. The mini-spiral contains mostly hot, ionized gas traced by bright Br\gamma emission. Vollmer & Duschl (2000) interpret the kinematics of the ionized gas in the northern arm to be Keplerian. IRS 1W has been studied previously as a bow shock source interacting with the material of the northern arm. Its broad-band infrared continuum emission is consistent with the temperature of \sim 300 K (Tanner et al., 2002, 2003, 2005) suggesting the presence of warm dust in its bow shock. Ott et al. (1999) used the speckle camera SHARP on the New Technology Telescope (NTT) and showed that IRS 1W is an extended source which could be a young star. Previously it was suggested that it could have formed in the northern arm of the mini-spiral or from the accreted gas and dust in the infalling material out of the northern arm. However, due to the current low inferred mass of the minispiral gas of \sim 100\,M_{\odot} it is unlikely that it formed within the northern arm. Tanner et al. (2005) observed IRS 1W alongside IRS 10W and IRS 21 by W.M. Keck 10 meter and Gemini 8 meter telescopes and identified them as bow-shock sources with central sources as Wolf-Rayet stars. The stellar-wind properties and kinematics of IRS 1W are similar to the properties of the clockwise orbiting He emission-line stars. Viehmann et al. (2006) showed that IRS 1W is very red and has a featureless spectral energy distribution (SED). Sanchez-Bermudez et al. (2014) analyzed the bow-shock orientation alongside the proper motion and confirmed that IRS 1W is a Wolf-Rayet star with a bow shock created by the interaction between the mass-losing star and the surrounding interstellar gas. The apparent stellar overabundance in the vicinity of IRS 1W could hypothetically be a stellar cluster similar to IRS 13 that is getting tidally disrupted upon the approach towards the SMBH. We investigate this possibility in more detail in this paper. We focus on the area around IRS 1W that contains 42 sources including IRS 1W. The geometrical center of these sources is situated at 6.24\pm 0.47 arcsec (right ascension) and 0.25\pm 0.42 arcsec (declination) with respect to Sgr A* in 2005.366 epoch within the circular region with a radius of 1.35^{\prime\prime}. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe analyzed datasets in the near-infrared (NIR) domain. The identification of stars associated with IRS 1W that constitute an apparent overabundance in comparison with other fields around Sgr A* is analyzed in Section 3. The NIR photometry colour-colour diagram of the sources is presented in Section 4. Proper motions of the sources are analyzed in Section 5, where the significant stellar concentration with the common proper motion in the north-western direction is identified. We discuss potential clustering scenarios (IMBH-bound cluster or a projected disk-like distribution) in Section 6. Finally, we summarize the main results in Section 7.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08963v1,The Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo T: A perturbed cored dwarf,"The impact of the dynamical state of gas-rich satellite galaxies at the early moments of their infall into their host systems and the relation to their quenching process are not completely understood at the low-mass regime. Two such nearby systems are the infalling Milky Way (MW) dwarfs Leo T and Phoenix located near the MW virial radius at 414\,{\rm kpc}\,(1.4R_{\rm vir}), both of which present intriguing offsets between their gaseous and stellar distributions. Here we present hydrodynamic simulations with ramses to reproduce the observed dynamics of Leo T: its 80\,{\rm pc} stellar-HI offset and the 35\,{\rm pc} offset between its older (\gtrsim 5\,{\rm Gyr}) and younger (\sim\!200\!-\!1000\,{\rm Myr}) stellar population. We considered internal and environmental properties such as stellar winds, two HI components, cored and cuspy dark matter profiles, and different satellite orbits considering the MW circumgalactic medium. We find that the models that best match the observed morphology of the gas and stars include mild stellar winds that interact with the HI generating the observed offset, and dark matter profiles with extended cores. The latter allow long oscillations of the off-centred younger stellar component, due to long mixing timescales (\gtrsim 200\,{\rm Myr}), and the slow precession of near-closed orbits in the cored potentials; instead, cuspy and compact cored dark matter models result in the rapid mixing of the material (\lesssim 200\,{\rm Myr}). These models predict that non-equilibrium substructures, such as spatial and kinematic offsets, are likely to persist in cored low-mass dwarfs and to remain detectable on long timescales in systems with recent star formation.","Dynamical equilibrium is a fundamental and common assumption in the dynamical and mass modelling of observed galaxies, and of the material used to trace the potential (Binney & Tremaine, 2008). However, this material could be under different degrees of perturbation, depending on the specific system. The Gaia observatory, for example, has revolutionised the understanding of our home galaxy, revealing a number of transient stellar substructures in the Milky Way (MW) or ‘digging up’ satellite galaxy ‘fossils’ from previous accretion events (Belokurov et al., 2018; Deason et al., 2018; Haywood et al., 2018; Helmi et al., 2018). The most massive dwarf galaxy satellites, the Magellanic Clouds, show substructures in a much more obvious state of perturbation. Furthermore, Gaia has also allowed us to determine the internal kinematic structure of the closest dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) (\lesssim 150\,{\rm kpc}) (Martínez-García et al., 2021; Qi et al., 2022; Tolstoy et al., 2023), as well as their orbital properties around the MW halo (Fritz et al., 2018; McConnachie & Venn, 2020; McConnachie et al., 2020). However, the more distant population of satellites, located in the outskirts of the MW, near or beyond its virial radius (R_{\rm vir}), has significantly larger proper motion errors given their large distances, which only allow us to determine some constraints on their orbital properties, determining, for example, if some of these are falling into the Galaxy for the first time (Blaña et al. 2020, hereafter B20; McConnachie & Venn; McConnachie et al. 2020; 2020). Furthermore, this outskirts population, with Leo T, Phoenix, Eridanus II, and others as members, is particularly interesting for studying the accretion history of the MW at later times (Diemer, 2017, 2020b; Deason et al., 2020; Fritz et al., 2020; Diemer, 2021; Bakels et al., 2021; O’Neil et al., 2021, and B20), and also for understanding the quenching process of satellites that fall into their host (Rodriguez Wimberly et al., 2019; Simpson et al., 2018; Buck et al., 2018), allowing us to understand the transformation of gas-rich dwarf galaxies into dSph galaxies. In addition, dwarf galaxies are the most abundant type of galaxy and play an important role as laboratories to study the nature of dark matter, which remains one of the most important challenges in astrophysics today. Dwarf galaxies can help us probe dark-matter models at the low-mass regime and address studies such as the cuspy versus cored dark-matter profile subject. We have known for some time that dwarfs can contain cored dark-matter densities (Burkert, 1995) instead of the predicted cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile produced in \LambdaCDM dark matter-only simulations (Navarro et al., 1996b). Many theories have addressed this phenomenon, suggesting that it is a consequence of gravitational interactions with the baryonic mass components (Navarro et al., 1996a; Read et al., 2006; Ogiya et al., 2014; Ogiya & Mori, 2014) or an intrinsic property of dark matter such as warm dark matter (Feng, 2010; Bullock & Boylan-Kolchin, 2017), fuzzy dark matter (Hu et al., 2000; Burkert, 2020), self-interacting dark matter (Burkert, 2000; Markevitch et al., 2004; Harvey et al., 2018; Nishikawa et al., 2020), or more common external mechanisms such as tidal stripping and shocking due to interactions with the host or a nearby galaxy. Therefore, it is of interest to identify pristine isolated dwarfs falling for the first time on the MW and to distinguish them from backsplash satellites (B20), which could have been affected by the MW in the past, or even by the Andromeda galaxy in the case of more exotic ‘renegade’ satellites (Knebe et al., 2011; Fouquet et al., 2012; Teyssier et al., 2012) (also called Hermeian satellites; Newton et al., 2021), or to distinguish them from satellites that arrive within smaller groups such as the Magellanic Cloud subgroup (Sales et al., 2017; Kallivayalil et al., 2018; Pardy et al., 2020). In this paper we complement the satellite orbital study of Leo T performed in B20, in which the authors explored first infall and backsplash orbital solutions, where both solutions lay within the proper motions measurements given the large observational errors (McConnachie & Venn, 2020). Here we investigate the internal dynamics of Leo T and possible perturbations generated by the interaction with the environment as it enters the MW, or due to internal processes. In particular, we focus on qualitatively reproducing the main properties of the exquisite HI observations of Adams & Oosterloo (2018, hereafter AO18), and the observed offset between the distributions of the HI and the younger and older stellar populations. The article continues with Sect. 2 where we describe the set-up of our models based on the main observational properties of Leo T, its environment, and the scenarios that we explored. In Sect. 3 we present the results, with separate subsections for the analysis of environmental effects and the analysis of internal processes. We conclude with a summary and discussion in Sect. 4.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08958v1,"Gas dynamics in an AGN-host galaxy at z\simeq 2.6:
regular rotation, non-circular motions, and mass models","The gas dynamics of galaxies provide critical insights into the evolution of both baryons and dark matter (DM) across cosmic time. In this context, galaxies at cosmic noon — the period characterized by the most intense star formation and black hole activities — are particularly significant. In this work, we present an analysis of the gas dynamics of PKS 0529-549: a galaxy at z\simeq 2.6, hosting a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN). We use new ALMA observations of the [C i] (2-1) line at a spatial resolution of 0.18′′ (\sim1.5 kpc). We find that (1) the molecular gas forms a rotation-supported disk with V_{\rm vrot}/\sigma_{\rm v}=6\pm 3 and displays a flat rotation curve out to 3.3 kpc; (2) there are several non-circular components including a kinematically anomalous structure near the galaxy center, a gas tail to the South-West, and possibly a second weaker tail to the East; (3) dynamical estimates of gas and stellar masses from fitting the rotation curve are inconsistent with photometric estimates using standard gas conversion factors and stellar population models, respectively; these discrepancies may be due to systematic uncertainties in the photometric masses, in the dynamical masses, or in the case a more massive radio-loud AGN-host galaxy is hidden behind the gas-rich [C i] emitting starburst galaxy along the line of sight. Our work shows that in-depth investigations of 3D line cubes are crucial for revealing the complexity of gas dynamics in high-z galaxies, in which regular rotation may coexist with non-circular motions and possibly tidal structures.","The study of gas dynamics provides key insights in the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. On global scales, the distributions of baryons and dark matter (DM) shape the gravitational potential of galaxies, affecting their overall gas kinematics (e.g., van Albada & Sancisi 1986). In addition, the feedback effects from massive stars (e.g., stellar winds and supernovae) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) inject energy into the interstellar medium (ISM), stirring the star-forming gas and possibly quenching the star formation of galaxies (e.g., Silk & Mamon 2012). In this context, galaxies at redshift z\simeq 1-3 are particularly important because both the cosmic star formation history and the accretion history of supermassive black holes peak around this epoch, which is known as “cosmic noon” (Madau & Dickinson 2014). Rapid developments in astronomical instruments have been boosting spatially-resolved studies of gas kinematics in high-z galaxies. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy with integral field units (IFUs) has enabled studies of the kinematics of warm ionized gas in galaxies at z\simeq 1-3, using H\alpha or [O iii] emission lines (e.g., Förster Schreiber et al. 2009; Gnerucci et al. 2011; Wisnioski et al. 2015, 2019; Di Teodoro et al. 2016; Stott et al. 2016; Turner et al. 2017). Radio and (sub-)millimeter interferometers can resolve kinematics of cold molecular gas, which is composed mostly of molecular hydrogen (H2). However, the symmetric H2 molecule does not have a permanent dipole moment so it hardly emits any lines in the cold molecular gas. Practically, we observe H2-tracers like CO (Hodge et al. 2012; Tadaki et al. 2017; Talia et al. 2018; Übler et al. 2018; Rizzo et al. 2023; Lelli et al. 2023), [C i] (Lelli et al. 2018; Dye et al. 2022; Gururajan et al. 2022; Rizzo et al. 2023), or [C ii] (De Breuck et al. 2014; Jones et al. 2017; Smit et al. 2018; Rizzo et al. 2020; Lelli et al. 2021; Rizzo et al. 2021) lines. Emission lines of different species trace distinct phases of the interstellar gas. In nearby galaxies, the warm ionized gas traced by H\alpha is often found to rotate slower and has a larger velocity dispersion than the cold molecular gas traced by low-J CO lines (e.g., Levy et al. 2018; Su et al. 2022). In galaxies hosting starbursts and/or AGNs, emission lines of H\alpha and [O iii] can be dominated by galactic outflows (Arribas et al. 2014; Harrison et al. 2014; Concas et al. 2017, 2019, 2022), which further complicates analyses of galaxy rotation. For high-z galaxies, the beam smearing effect (Warner et al. 1973; Bosma 1978; Begeman 1989) also becomes significant as usually these galaxies can be spatially resolved only with a few independent elements with current facilities. This will lead to the observed emission lines being broadened by both the intrinsic turbulent motion of the interstellar gas and the unresolved rotation velocity (V_{\rm rot}) structure within the telescope beam. In addition, the observed line-of-sight velocity is intensity-weighted so it is biased towards small galactic radii where the surface brightness is higher. To overcome the beam smearing effect, various tools have been developed to fit a rotating disk model directly to the 3-dimensional (3D) emission-line cubes (e.g., Bouché et al. 2015; Di Teodoro & Fraternali 2015; Kamphuis et al. 2015). Therefore, to study the dynamics of high-z galaxies, especially the extreme cases at cosmic noon, one needs multi-phase gas tracers for a panchromatic view of both circular and non-circular motions as well as careful treatment of beam smearing effects (i.e., high-resolution data and reliable modeling). To date, such studies are only limited to a handful of cases (e.g., Chen et al. 2017; Übler et al. 2018; Lelli et al. 2018, 2023). PKS 0529-549 is a well-studied radio galaxy at z\simeq 2.57 with plenty of multi-wavelength data — optical spectroscopy, NIR imaging, and radio polarimetry (Broderick et al. 2007), Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC), Infrared Spectrograph (IRS), and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) imaging (De Breuck et al. 2010), Herschel Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) and Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) imaging (Drouart et al. 2014), 1.1-mm data from AzTEC (Humphrey et al. 2011), Very Large Telescope (VLT) Spectrograph for INtegral Field Observations in the Near Infrared (SINFONI) imaging spectroscopy (Nesvadba et al. 2017), Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) [C i] (2-1) line (Lelli et al. 2018) and band-6 continuum (Falkendal et al. 2019), and VLT/X-Shooter spectra from rest-frame ultra-violet (UV) to optical (Man et al. 2019). PKS 0529-549 hosts a Type-ii AGN and two radio lobes (Broderick et al. 2007). The Eastern lobe has the highest Faraday rotation measure ever observed to date (Broderick et al. 2007), suggesting that the galaxy is surrounded by a medium with high electron density and/or a strong magnetic field. PKS 0529-549 has an estimated stellar mass (M_{\star}) of 3\times 10^{11} M⊙ (De Breuck et al. 2010) derived by fitting the stellar spectral energy distribution (SED), and a star formation rate (SFR) of 1020_{-170}^{+190} M⊙ yr-1 (Falkendal et al. 2019) derived by the total infrared luminosity. PKS 0529-549 has experienced at least two bursts of recent star formation in the past, 6 Myr and > 20 Myr, respectively, based on an analysis of the photospheric absorption features in the rest-frame UV spectrum (Man et al. 2019). Using ALMA observations, Lelli et al. (2018) found that the [C i] 3P{}_{2}\rightarrow^{3}P1 emission (hereafter [C i] (2-1)) is consistent with a rotating disk. The [O iii] \lambda 5007 emission (Nesvadba et al. 2017), on the other hand, is more extended and is aligned with the radio lobes, so it is probably dominated by an AGN-driven outflow. The rotation speed of the gas disk traced by [C i] provided a total dynamical mass consistent with the observed baryonic mass, but detailed mass models that separate the gravitational contributions of baryons and/or DM could not be constructed due to the low resolution and sensitivity of the [C i] (2-1) data. For the same reasons, it was not possible to measure the gas velocity dispersion and to investigate possible non-circular motions in the molecular disk. In this work, we present new ALMA [C i] (2-1) observations of PKS 0529-549 with high spatial resolution and sensitivity. The [C i] lines are among the most efficient H2-tracers for galaxies at cosmic noon because they are accessible through ALMA band 4 and band 6. At z\sim 2, the CO lines (J\geq 3) covered by ALMA are weak. The [C ii] 158-\mum line, instead, is difficult to observe at z\simeq 1-3 due to its high frequency (even though redshifted) that requires excellent weather conditions at the ALMA site, but it is cost-effective for galaxies at z>4 because it becomes observable with ALMA band 7 (e.g., De Breuck et al. 2014; Jones et al. 2017; Smit et al. 2018; Lelli et al. 2021). This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the new ALMA observations and the data reduction. Section 3 describes the gas and dust distribution as well as their radial surface brightness profile. Section 4 studies the gas kinematics and measures the rotation curve of PKS 0529-549 as well as non-circular motions. Section 5 builds mass models with different combinations of baryonic and DM components, testing the consistency of our observations with the expectations from the \Lambda cold dark matter (\LambdaCDM) cosmology. Section 6 discusses the implications of our results. Section 7 provides a summary. Throughout this paper, we assume a flat \LambdaCDM cosmology with H_{0}= 67.4 km s-1 Mpc-1, \Omega_{\rm m} = 0.315, and \Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.685 (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020). In this cosmology, 1 arcsec corresponds to 8.22 kpc at the redshift of PKS 0529-549 (z=2.57), while the age of the Universe and the lookback time are 2.5 Gyr and 11.3 Gyr, respectively."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08956v1,Reconciling concentration to virial mass relations,"Context. The concentration–virial mass (c-M) relation is a fundamental scaling relation within the standard cold dark matter (\LambdaCDM) framework well established in numerical simulations. However, observational constraints of this relation are hampered by the difficulty of characterising the properties of dark matter haloes. Recent comparisons between simulations and observations have suggested a systematic difference of the c-M relation, with higher concentrations in the latter.Aims. In this work, we undertake detailed comparisons between simulated galaxies and observations of a sample of strong-lensing galaxies.Methods. We explore several factors of the comparison with strong gravitational lensing constraints, including the choice of the generic dark matter density profile, the effect of radial resolution, the reconstruction limits of observed versus simulated mass profiles, and the role of the initial mass function in the derivation of the dark matter parameters. Furthermore, we show the dependence of the c-M relation on reconstruction and model errors through a detailed comparison of real and simulated gravitational lensing systems.Results. An effective reconciliation of simulated and observed c-M relations can be achieved if one considers less strict assumptions on the dark matter profile, for example, by changing the slope of a generic NFW profile or focusing on rather extreme combinations of stellar-to-dark matter distributions. A minor effect is inherent to the applied method: fits to the NFW profile on a less well-constrained inner mass profile yield slightly higher concentrations and lower virial masses.","The standard paradigm of galaxy formation rests on the presence of two main ingredients: dark matter and baryons. Both are subject to gravitational forces, but only the latter can be detected with photons. In this framework, dark matter represents a fundamental component, as it provides the backbone structure over large scales (cosmic web) and within the scales in which galaxies are found (haloes). The properties of dark matter haloes are thus essential to understanding galaxy formation, but these properties are limited to indirect constraints involving observations of the baryonic matter. Gravitational lensing provides a special method of detection by using the distortions exerted on the photons emitted by a background source as they pass through a gravitating structure. By ‘removing’ the contribution of the baryons from the lensing signal, it is thus possible to study dark matter haloes. One of the main correlations found in haloes is the concentration versus mass relation (hereafter c-M, Navarro et al. 1997), by which more massive haloes tend to have progressively lower concentrations, albeit with a large scatter. This relation has been readily found in simulations (e.g. Bullock et al., 2001; Macciò et al., 2007; Dutton & Macciò, 2014; Diemer & Joyce, 2019; Ishiyama et al., 2021), and its scatter could unravel the details concerning the growth of haloes (e.g. Wang et al., 2020). As a first approximation, this trend is a direct consequence of the bottom-up scenario of structure formation, as lower mass haloes formed statistically at earlier cosmic times, when the density in the expanding Universe was higher (see, e.g. Mo et al., 2010). The concentration of dark matter haloes depends on the adopted cosmology (Macciò et al., 2008). However, this result is expected from a simple spherical collapse scenario, whereas a more realistic depiction would involve non-spherical structures and extended mass assembly histories, making the interpretation of concentration more complicated. Virialised haloes, in principle, should have higher concentrations (Neto et al., 2007). If the subsequent growth after the formation of the ”first” structure is slow, we can expect a gradual increase of the concentration with total mass, whereas faster growth can keep the concentration unchanged (Correa et al., 2015). Therefore, variations among haloes on the c-M plane depend on their mass assembly history. The large scatter of the c-M relation found in simulations is thus an indicator of the diverse formation histories of structures. While virial mass is a good guess for a first-order parameter, more information is needed to describe the details of individual haloes (e.g. assembly bias; Wechsler et al. 2006). For instance, at a fixed halo mass, one would expect ‘older’ haloes to populate the high concentration envelope of the c-M relation. The dynamical state of a halo – shape, spin, virialisation – also affects its location on the c-M plot. Observational constraints are harder to come by and mostly rely on the X-ray emission from the hot gas surrounding the most massive structures (e.g. Buote et al., 2007). Gravitational lensing offers a complementary method to determine the properties of dark matter haloes (e.g. Comerford & Natarajan, 2007; Mandelbaum et al., 2008; Merten et al., 2015). Moreover, when restricting the lenses to galaxy scales, it is possible to constrain dark matter haloes for masses below \lesssim 10^{13}M⊙ (e.g. Leier et al., 2011). However, all observational methods are based on an indirect detection of the dark matter via the gravitational potential. Simulations such as EAGLE (Schaye et al., 2015) or Illustris (Vogelsberger et al., 2014) do not suffer from this disadvantage, as the dark matter distribution is directly accessible from the simulation outputs. However, even the simulations rely on the parameterisation of mass and concentration, which require the adoption of a specific density profile function, such as those proposed by Navarro et al. (1997) or Einasto (1965). The goal of this work is to assess the concentrations derived from strong lensing analysis over galaxy scales, which appear inconsistently high with respect to the predictions from numerical simulations (e.g. Leier et al., 2012). We show how the extracted c-M values (see Table 1) depend on resolution, modelling uncertainties, and assumptions of the underlying analytic functions, such as the dark matter profile and the initial mass function (IMF). We build upon a recent analysis of the c-M relation (Leier et al., 2022) in a sample of strong-lensing galaxies versus simulated galaxies from EAGLE using a Monte-Carlo type combination of pixelised lens models (Saha & Williams, 2003) and stellar population synthesis maps, as used in Ferreras et al. (2005). In Sect. 2 we describe the data, and in Sect. 3, the method used in this study is presented. Table 1: Overview of the c-\rm M_{\rm vir} power-law parameters.

Col. 2 is the slope of the scaling relation and col. 3 is the concentration of the best fit at virial mass 10^{13}M⊙. We provide errors from bootstrap. Our results in Sect. 4 show how fitted c-M relations change if the reconstructed lens profile is less well resolved in the inner part – in other words how the c-M relation changes as a function of the minimum radius. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a transformation that keeps the total enclosed mass at the Einstein radius constant but changes the steepness of the inner profile affects the c-M relation as well as the goodness-of-fit. In addition, we compare our findings with non-parametric concentrations derived from the inner radial region of lenses and simulated haloes alike. In Sect. 4.4, we show how dark matter distributions based on parametric functions other than the standard NFW profile (named after Navarro et al., 1997), change the c-M relation. Subsequently, in Sect. 4.5, we study how the adoption of different choices of the stellar IMF affects the c-M relation. Finally, in Sect. 5, we discuss whether or not all of these factors can reconcile the observed and simulated c-M relations."

The aim of the present study is to disentangle the nature of the transient AT 2021hdr, whose optical light curve used to be consistent with a classic Seyfert 1 nucleus, which was also confirmed by its optical spectrum and high-energy properties. From late 2021, AT 2021hdr started to present sudden brightening episodes in the form of oscillating peaks in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream, and the same shape is observed in X-rays and UV from Swift data. The oscillations occur every \sim60-90 days with amplitudes of \sim0.2 mag in the g and r bands. Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations show no radio emission at milliarcseconds scale. It is argued that these findings are inconsistent with a standard tidal disruption event (TDE), a binary supermassive black hole (BSMBH), or a changing-look active galactic nucleus (AGN); neither does this object resemble previous observed AGN flares, and disk or jet instabilities are an unlikely scenario. Here, we propose that the behavior of AT 2021hdr might be due to the tidal disruption of a gas cloud by a BSMBH. In this scenario, we estimate that the putative binary has a separation of \sim0.83 mpc and would merge in \sim7\times104 years. This galaxy is located at 9 kpc from a companion galaxy, and in this work we report this merger for the first time. The oscillations are not related to the companion galaxy.","The centers of most galaxies are thought to host a supermassive black hole (SMBH). If fed by a surrounding accretion disk, the system shines and becomes an active galactic nucleus (AGN; Rees, 1984). A common property of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum (Netzer, 2013), which occurs stochastically and is thought to be related mostly to flux variations in the accretion disc, with typical amplitudes of < 0.5 mag in the optical continuum on timescales of between months and years (e.g., Vanden Berk et al., 2004; MacLeod et al., 2016). In recent decades, objects whose behavior deviates from typical AGN-like variations have been discovered. These include tidal disruption events (TDEs, Gezari 2021; Zabludoff et al. 2021), binary supermassive black hole (BSMBH; Charisi et al. 2016; De Rosa et al. 2019) candidates, changing-look (CL; LaMassa et al. 2015; Ricci & Trakhtenbrot 2023; Zeltyn et al. 2024) events, the recently discovered ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs; e.g., Hinkle et al., 2022), and anomalous-variability flares, which are due to disk instabilities or similar perturbations to the accretion process (Graham et al., 2017; Trakhtenbrot et al., 2019b; Frederick et al., 2021; Dotti et al., 2023). Many of the previous novel SMBH-related events were found thanks to the ever-increasing expansion of optical time domain facilities, which monitor the entire observable sky in search of variable objects. Among them, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, Graham et al., 2019; Bellm et al., 2019; Masci et al., 2019) observes the same region of the sky approximately every 3 days, allowing the construction of well-sampled light curves, and alerting the scientific community to significant changes in the sky. A multiwavelength perspective is often crucial to properly assess the evolving emission mechanisms and energetics of these variable sources (e.g., Hernández-García et al., 2023). For this, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Roming et al., 2005; Burrows et al., 2005) is an ideal facility, as it allows a rapid response to proposals that request follow-up observations, obtaining data in X-rays, UV, and optical. In this paper, we present an intriguing source that was discovered in 2021 thanks to the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events broker (ALeRCE; Förster et al., 2021) using ZTF data, and that we began monitoring with Swift in 2022. We complement these data with observations in radio and optical spectra. The host of this new transient or variable event, whose light curves show relatively well-defined oscillations on timescales of months, is an early stage merger composed of an AGN and a low-ionization nuclear emission line region (LINER); the combination of these two rare phenomena is reported for the first time (De Rosa et al., 2019). The paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2 we present the selection of the target, in Sect. 2.2 we include information about the nuclear region of the host galaxy and its environment, in Sect. 3 we present the data used for our analysis, in Sect. 4 we describe the multiwavelength light curves obtained during the transient phase, and in Sect. 5 we discuss the main results obtained in this work. Finally, we present our conclusions in Sect. 6. The appendix provides further details and analysis of the data as well as the full light curves."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08944v1,Why is the Galactic disk so cool?,"The bulk of old stars in the Galactic disk have migrated radially by up to several kpc in their lifetimes, yet the disk has remained relatively cool, i.e., the ratio of radial heating to migration has been small. Here, we demonstrate that this small ratio places very strong constraints on which mechanisms could have been responsible for orbital transport in our Galaxy. For instance, Sellwood & Binney’s mechanism of nonlinear horseshoe transport by spirals tends to produce too high a ratio of heating to migration, unless the spirals’ amplitudes are heavily suppressed away from their corotation resonances, or their pitch angles are significantly larger than is observed. This problem is only made worse if one includes the effect of the Galactic bar, diffusion due to disk or halo substructure, etc. Resonant (but non-horseshoe) scattering by spirals can drive transport consistent with the data, but even this requires some fine-tuning. In short, reproducing both the observed radial migration and the small ratio of heating to migration is a highly nontrivial requirement, and poses a significant challenge to models of the Milky Way’s dynamical history, theories of spiral structure, and the identification of ‘Milky Way analogues’ in cosmological simulations.","A central goal of Galactic astronomy in the era of surveys such as GAIA, APOGEE, etc., is to infer the assembly history and evolution of our Galaxy from the imprints left in the kinematics and chemistry of disk stars by certain ‘perturbers.’ For example, features of the Hercules moving group have been interpreted as evidence for a slowing Galactic bar [1], the vertical phase space snail has been tied to perturbations from infalling dwarf galaxies and/or dark matter subhaloes [2, 3, 4], and the Galactic disk’s warp and flare have been linked both to satellite impacts and to possible asphericity or precession of the dark halo [5, 6, 7]. However, a significant limitation of all such studies has been that we have little knowledge of the statistics of stochastic dynamical perturbations in the Galactic disk over the last several Gyr. In other words, we have scant idea of the statistical properties of the spiral arms, molecular clouds, etc. that ought to accompany the ‘perturbers’ referred to above in any realistic dynamical model. These stochastic fluctuations are important partly because they lead to direct orbital transport [8], and partly because they can destroy delicate resonant effects upon which some of the aforementioned results rely [9]. In lieu of an understanding of these fluctuations, modelers have had to resort to (i) ignoring them altogether (e.g., [1]), (ii) applying toy models with additional free parameters (e.g., [4]), or (iii) running full N-body simulations (e.g., [3]). None of these approaches is perfectly satisfying, because one can never be entirely confident that the signal in the data is not due, at least in part, to perturbations absent from the model. Here, we take a major step toward constraining the aforementioned fluctuation spectrum by honing in on a single observational fact: namely, that the Galactic disk is cool. More precisely, we focus on the fact that the old stars in the Milky Way’s disk have been ‘churned’ efficiently in orbital guiding radius R_{\mathrm{g}} throughout their lifetimes — often by several kpc in total — while remaining on orbits of remarkably low eccentricity [10]. It is even possible that the entire outer disk beyond \sim 15 kpc formed via radial migration of stars from smaller radii [11]. Said in more technical language, in the Milky Way’s disk, radial migration (shuffling of angular momenta, a.k.a. azimuthal actions J_{\varphi}) is a significantly more efficient process than radial heating (increasing the radial actions J_{R}). To measure this tendency quantitatively, Frankel et al. [10] constructed a parameterized model of radial migration and heating, assuming simple functional forms for the stellar distribution function (DF), and assuming that its evolution followed a Fokker-Planck equation. Their model that best fit the GAIA/APOGEE data revealed that over the last 6 Gyr, Milky Way disk stars have roughly random-walked in guiding radius R_{\mathrm{g}} according to rms \delta R_{\mathrm{g}}(t)\sim 1\,\mathrm{kpc}\times\left(t/1\,\mathrm{Gyr}% \right)^{1/2}. (Here, and throughout this paper, we define the rms change in a quantity x as rms \delta x(t)\equiv(\sum_{i=1}^{N}[x_{i}(t)-x_{i}(0)]^{2}/N)^{1/2}, where the index i labels individual stars). More precisely, Frankel et al. [10] found that stars’ angular momenta J_{\varphi} have changed over the last 6 Gyr by \mathrm{rms}\,\,\delta J_{\varphi}\approx 619\ \mathrm{kpc\,km\,s}^{-1}. (1) Likewise, Frankel et al. [10] found a total deviation in radial action close to the Sun over the last 6 Gyr of \mathrm{rms}\,\,\delta J_{R}\approx 63\,\mathrm{kpc\ km\,s}^{-1}, (2) though this quantity was found to increase weakly with Galactocentric radius. Comparing (1) with (2) we have that in the Milky Way over the last 6 Gyr, \frac{\mathrm{rms}\,\,\delta J_{R}}{\mathrm{rms}\,\,\delta J_{\varphi}}\approx 0% .1. (3) The quantities (1) and (2) and especially their ratio (3) encode important information about the key drivers of dynamical evolution in our Galaxy. For instance, suppose stars underwent many impulsive kicks in velocity \Delta\bm{v} (due to e.g., ISM or dark matter substructure) drawn from a random, homogeneous, isotropic distribution. This would drive migration on the order of \mathrm{rms}\,\,\delta J_{\varphi}\sim R_{\mathrm{g}}\langle(\Delta\bm{v})^{2}% \rangle^{1/2} and heating on the order of \mathrm{rms}\,\,\delta J_{R}\sim{\langle(\Delta\bm{v})^{2}\rangle}/{\kappa}, where \kappa is the local epicyclic frequency [8]. Then \displaystyle\frac{\mathrm{rms}\,\delta J_{R}}{\mathrm{rms}\,\delta J_{\varphi% }}\sim f\times\frac{\mathrm{rms}\,\delta J_{\varphi}}{J_{\varphi}} \displaystyle\approx 2.5\left(\frac{f}{7}\right)\left(\frac{\mathrm{rms}\,% \delta J_{\varphi}}{619\,\mathrm{kpc}\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}}\right)\left(\frac{% J_{\varphi}}{1760\,\mathrm{kpc}\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}}\right)^{-1}, (4) where f is the product of various order-unity factors. Though we do not show any details here, we have confirmed the scaling \mathrm{rms}\,\delta J_{R}\,/\,\mathrm{rms}\,\delta J_{\varphi}\propto\mathrm{% rms}\,\delta J_{\varphi} using local shearing sheet simulations of stars interacting with isotropic, white noise Gaussian random fields of potential fluctuations with various power spectra. These simulations suggest f\sim 7, which would certainly produce too much heating-per-unit-migration compared to the measurement (3). Thus, to the extent that such fluctuations do exist in real galaxies, the ratio (3) immediately places a strong constraint on their efficiency, since the large fractional heating they produce would need to be heavily diluted by other, ‘colder’ mechanisms. However, currently, there does not exist a quantitative theory that links the measurements (1)-(3) to the spatio-temporal power spectrum of gravitational potential fluctuations in the disk, and in turn to specific perturbations like spiral arms, molecular clouds, dark matter substructure, etc. In a separate work (Hamilton, Modak & Tremaine, in prep.), we have built upon the formalism of Hamilton et al. [12] to develop such a radial transport theory, and verified it numerically for perturbations of various amplitudes, wavelengths, frequencies, etc. in generic (thin) galactic disks. For the remainder of this paper we focus only on the Milky Way, and in particular on the effects of transient spiral structure, since this is believed to play a major role in the efficient radial migration of disk stars [13]. The community has focused so much on transient spirals because of the classic paper by Sellwood & Binney [14], hereafter referred to as SB02. These authors emphasized two important facts concerning star-spiral interactions. First, provided the spiral lifetime \tau is longer than the typical orbital period, the radial action J_{R} of stars at the corotation resonance is adiabatically invariant. Thus, resonant scattering at corotation can drive radial migration without radial heating. Second, SB02 discussed how this corotation-scattering process works in the nonlinear regime. Precisely, the spiral will trap corotating stars onto ‘horseshoe’ orbits, provided \tau\gtrsim t_{\mathrm{lib}}/2, where t_{\mathrm{lib}} is the horseshoe libration period. For an m-armed spiral potential perturbation \delta\phi with dimensionless amplitude \eta\equiv|\delta\phi/(V_{0}^{2}/2)| (here, V_{0} is the circular speed), this is (SB02; [15]): \displaystyle t_{\mathrm{lib}} \displaystyle\equiv\frac{t_{\mathrm{dyn}}}{m\,\eta^{1/2}} \displaystyle\approx 0.64\,\mathrm{Gyr}\,\left(\frac{m}{2}\right)^{-1}\left(% \frac{\eta}{0.03}\right)^{-1/2}\left(\frac{t_{\mathrm{dyn}}}{220\,\mathrm{Myr}% }\right), (5) where t_{\mathrm{dyn}} is the orbital period at corotation. In this nonlinear horseshoe regime, when the spiral decays the trapped stars are ‘dropped off’ with a new guiding radius, differing on average from the initial guiding radius by about one resonance half-width R_{\mathrm{h}}, where \displaystyle R_{\mathrm{h}} \displaystyle\equiv\eta^{1/2}R_{\mathrm{CR}} \displaystyle\approx 1.4\,\mathrm{kpc}\,\,\left(\frac{\eta}{0.03}\right)^{1/2}% \left(\frac{R_{\mathrm{CR}}}{8\,\mathrm{kpc}}\right) (6) and R_{\mathrm{CR}} denotes the corotation radius. The smallness of the observed ratio (3) suggests that the first piece of SB02’s argument, namely resonant scattering at corotation, does play a major role in transport in our Galaxy. However, the second piece of SB02’s argument, namely nonlinear horseshoe behavior, suffers from a possible pitfall. Efficient radial migration seems to have occurred across a broad range of Galactocentric radii [10, 11], meaning we require not just one localized ‘horseshoe’ event, but multiple such events spread across several disk scale-lengths. In each event, the spiral must not only live long enough to trap stars and produce horseshoe libration, it must also decay rapidly enough to make room for the next spiral. The latter requirement is important because if multiple spiral patterns are present simultaneously, the clean, coherent horseshoe behavior described above can be destroyed by resonance overlaps, which can drive efficient radial migration [16, 17] but also significant radial heating. In fact, Daniel et al. [18] showed that resonance overlaps (and associated heating) can even occur for a single spiral, between its corotation and ultraharmonic resonances, should its amplitude be large enough. Thus, SB02’s horseshoe mechanism is rather delicate, and it is not clear whether it can produce all the radial migration (1) without excessive heating above the observed level (3). In this paper, we address this question using numerical simulations of test-particle disks subject to transient spiral arm perturbations. Our fiducial spirals are designed to be morphologically similar to those observed in the Milky Way today [19], but we also explore the effect of modifying each spiral’s strength, pitch angle, number of arms, lifetime, and radial envelope, and also including a bar perturbation. We demonstrate that there are three distinct dynamical regimes of star-spiral interaction — impulsive, resonant and horseshoe — and that Milky-Way-like spirals in SB02’s horseshoe regime are typically unable to reproduce the observations (1) and (3). The data is better reproduced if one assumes spirals in the past were more open, more concentrated around corotation, shorter-lived, or some combination of these. While we offer heuristic explanations for some of the trends we report here, we defer a rigorous treatment to a future comprehensive theory paper. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In §II, we describe the setup of our test-particle simulations of the Galactic disk. In §III.1, we illustrate the three key dynamical regimes that dictate the radial transport behavior by performing controlled simulations involving a single transient spiral. In §III.2, we simulate ensembles of many randomly generated spirals with various morphologies over 6 Gyr, and compare our results directly with the Milky Way data. In §IV, we discuss the constraints that our results place on the spectrum of stochastic fluctuations present in our Galaxy over the last 6 Gyr. We summarize in §V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08943v1,The  project: tracking the expansion and merger histories of ionized bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization,"The growth of ionized hydrogen bubbles in the intergalactic medium around early luminous objects is a fundamental process during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Observations using Lyman-\alpha emission from high-redshift galaxies and forthcoming 21 cm maps are beginning to constrain the sizes of these ionized regions. In this study, we analyze bubble sizes and their evolution using the state-of-the-art thesan radiation-hydrodynamics simulation suite, which self-consistently models radiation transport and realistic galaxy formation throughout a large (95.5\,\text{cMpc})^{3} volume of the Universe. Analogous to the accretion and merger tree histories employed in galaxy formation simulations, we characterize the growth and merger rates of ionized bubbles by focusing on the spatially-resolved redshift of reionization. By tracing the chronological expansion of bubbles, we partition the simulation volume and construct a natural ionization history. We identify three distinct stages of ionized bubble growth: (1) initial slow expansion around the earliest ionizing sources seeding formation sites, (2) accelerated growth through percolation as bubbles begin to merge, and (3) rapid expansion dominated by the largest bubble. Notably, we find that the largest bubble emerges by z\approx 9\!-\!10, well before the midpoint of reionization. This bubble becomes dominant during the second growth stage, and defines the third stage by rapidly expanding to eventually encompass the remainder of the simulation volume and becoming one of the few bubbles actively growing. Additionally, we observe a sharp decline in the number of bubbles with radii around \sim 10 cMpc compared to smaller sizes, indicating a characteristic scale in the final segmented bubble size distribution. Overall, these chronologically sequenced spatial reconstructions offer crucial insights into the physical mechanisms driving ionized bubble growth during the EoR and provide a framework for interpreting the structure and evolution of reionization itself.","As the first luminous objects formed and emitted hydrogen ionizing radiation billions of years ago, they initiated the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), spanning redshifts from z\approx 5\!-\!20 (EoR; Shapiro & Giroux, 1987; Barkana & Loeb, 2001; Furlanetto et al., 2006; Wise, 2019). The radiation from these early sources locally and inhomogeneously ionized the surrounding neutral hydrogen gas, creating ionized regions or “bubbles” in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Over time, these ionized bubbles grew, at first in isolation but eventually different bubbles began to overlap with each other, leading to percolation and a rapid increase in bubble sizes as they merged (Furlanetto & Oh, 2016). This process ultimately resulted in the nearly fully ionized Universe observed today. The EoR presents several astrophysical and cosmological frontiers, including understanding the physical mechanisms driving ionized bubble growth. Observing galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and the ambient IGM during the EoR is challenging due to the extremely high redshifts. However, characterizing and interpreting observational signatures is of crucial importance, especially as recent and forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) surveys and 21 cm radio telescopes offer promising avenues to probe high-redshift galaxies and the properties of ionized bubbles (Robertson, 2022). To fully understand the EoR, studying both the IGM and galaxy sources is paramount, motivating investigations into the dynamics and morphologies of ionized bubbles and their connection to the local and large-scale environments (Gnedin & Madau, 2022). The 21 cm radio interferometers, including the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR; van Haarlem et al., 2013), Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA; DeBoer et al., 2017; HERA Collaboration et al., 2023), Square Kilometer Array (SKA; Mellema et al., 2013), and others are beginning to map the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the Universe. The 21 cm line, arising from the forbidden spin-flip hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen, directly probes the IGM. By detecting the redshifted 21 cm signal from the EoR, these instruments can reveal the global evolution, statistical spatial correlations, and even a tomographic picture of neutral and ionized gas. These measurements will be critical for studying ionized bubbles during the EoR as well as constraining cosmological parameters (McQuinn et al., 2006; Mesinger et al., 2011; Liu & Parsons, 2016; Park et al., 2019; Kannan et al., 2022b). In anticipation of the forthcoming 21 cm data, numerous theoretical studies have sought to characterize the properties of ionized bubbles and their connections to the dominant processes in cosmic reionization. Different reionization scenarios and source models can lead to varying bubble morphologies; thus, the distribution of bubble sizes has emerged as a crucial diagnostic for distinguishing between reionization models (McQuinn et al., 2007a, b; Majumdar et al., 2016). Several methods have been developed to detect and analyze ionized bubble sizes within hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models. Prominent among these are: • Mean-Free Path (MFP) Method: Calculates effective bubble sizes by tracing rays from ionized cells to the nearest neutral cell in all directions (Mesinger & Furlanetto, 2007). • Spherical Averaging (SPA): Determines the largest sphere over which the average ionization fraction exceeds a set ionization threshold (Zahn et al., 2007). • Friends-of-Friends (FOF) Algorithm: Links ionized cells within a given distance to form bubbles (Ivezić et al., 2014). • Granulometry: Uses a “sieving” process to count objects that fit within a given structural hierarchy (Kakiichi et al., 2017). • Watershed Method: Identifies bubbles by filling “catchment basins” from local minima until neighbouring basins intersect (Lin et al., 2016). Beyond this, topological analyses have been fruitful in characterizing further distinctive signatures of reionization (Friedrich et al., 2011; Busch et al., 2020; Giri et al., 2020; Elbers & van de Weygaert, 2023). Building upon these existing studies, we perform an analysis of ionized bubble sizes within the thesan simulation suite (Garaldi et al., 2022; Kannan et al., 2022a; Smith et al., 2022; Garaldi et al., 2024). thesan combines the galaxy formation model of IllustrisTNG (Weinberger et al., 2017; Pillepich et al., 2018a, b) with detailed on-the-fly modeling of radiative processes, including radiation transport (arepo-rt; Kannan et al., 2019), non-equilibrium heating and cooling, and realistic ionizing sources, within a large cosmological volume of 95.5 cMpc per box side. The thesan simulations have been employed to make a wide range of EoR predictions (e.g. Kannan et al., 2022b; Qin et al., 2022; Borrow et al., 2023; Kannan et al., 2023; Yeh et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2024b, a). Specifically, we examine the ionized bubbles by analyzing the reionization redshift (z_{\text{reion}}), which we define as the last time the ionized hydrogen fraction (H ii) crosses the threshold value of 0.5 from below (e.g. Thélie et al., 2022). z_{\text{reion}} serves as an effective tracer for bubble sizes, particularly at scales below approximately 1 cMpc (Neyer et al., 2024). A distinction of our study is that we employ a chronological time-ordering of z_{\text{reion}} to construct a natural segmentation of the simulation volume. The resulting expansion and merger histories provide a unique and intuitive perspective on the evolution of ionized bubbles during the EoR. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our methods, including a brief overview of the thesan simulation suite and the bubble tree algorithm used to analyze z_{\text{reion}}. In Section 3, we present our main findings, including the growth of ionized bubbles (3.1) and the distribution of bubble sizes (3.2) throughout the EoR. We explore the physical effects of different model parameters in Section 4. Finally, we synthesize our conclusions in Section 5. Supplementary discussion of grid resolution is found in Appendix A and the impact of corners being counted as neighbours in Appendix B. All further mentions of “reionization” refer specifically to hydrogen reionization, and any mention of “bubbles,” “bubble groups,” or “groups” refers to ionized bubbles."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08931v1,Does the fluid-static equilibrium of a self-gravitating isothermal sphere of van der Waals’ gas present multiple solutions?,"We take up the investigation we had to put in the future-work stack at the end of Sec. V B 2 of Ref. Giordano et al., 2024, in which we pointed out the obvious necessity to inquire about existence or absence of values of the characteristic numbers a and b in correspondence to which the perfect-gas model’s self gravitational effects, namely upper boundedness of the gravitational number, spiraling behavior of peripheral density, oscillating behavior of central density, and existence of multiple solutions corresponding to the same value of the gravitational number, appear also for the van der Waals’ model. The development of our investigation brings to the conversion of our M2 scheme based on a second-order differential equation into an equivalent system of two first-order differential equations that incorporates Milne’s homology invariant variables. The converted scheme 1oM2 turns out to be much more efficacious than the M2 scheme in terms of numerical calculations’ easiness and richness of results. We use the perfect-gas model as benchmark to test the 1oM2 scheme; we re-derive familiar results and put them in a more general and rational perspective that paves the way to deal with the van der Waals’ gas model. We introduce variable transformations that turn out to be the key to study (almost) analytically the monotonicity of the peripheral density with respect to variations of the gravitational number. The study brings to the proof that the gravitational number is not constrained by upper boundedness, the peripheral density does not spiral, and the central density does not oscillate for any couple of values assumed by the characteristic numbers a and b; however, multiple solutions corresponding to the same value of the gravitational number can exist but their genesis is completely different from that of the perfect-gas model’s multiple solutions. We provide the boundary in the \mbox{{\tengr a}},\mbox{{\tengr b}} plane between the two regions of solution’s uniqueness and multiplicity. Finally, by the application of the 1oM2 scheme, we resolve the mystery of the missing steep curve corresponding to Aronson and Hansen’s 60km caseAronson and Hansen (1972) that we unsuccessfully chased in Ref. Giordano et al., 2024 and we even detect another solution that had somehow escaped the attention of those authors.","Our series of studies regarding self-gravitating fluids began with Ref. Giordano et al., 2019 centered on the perfect gas model (PG-m) and continued with Ref. Giordano et al., 2024 focused on the van der Waals’ gas model (vdWG-m). Here, we take up the investigation we had to put in the future-work stack at the end of Sec. V B 2 of Ref. Giordano et al., 2024.

We also pointed out the obvious necessity of an investigation regarding existence or absence of values of a and b in correspondence to which the PG-sge appear also for the vdWG-m. The contents of this communication describe our efforts to go to the bottom of this matter."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09556v1,Two-temperature treatments in magnetically arrested disk GRMHD simulations more accurately predict light curves of Sagittarius A,"The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) observed the Galactic centre source Sgr A∗ and used emission models primarily based on single ion temperature (1T) general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. This predicted emission is strongly dependent on a modelled prescription of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. The two most promising models are magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states. However, these and nearly all MAD models exhibit greater light-curve variability at 230 GHz compared to historical observations. Moreover, no model successfully passes all the variability and multiwavelength constraints. This limitation possibly stems from the fact that the actual temperature ratio depends on microphysical dissipation, radiative processes and other effects not captured in ideal fluid simulations. Therefore, we investigate the effects of two-temperature (2T) thermodynamics in MAD GRMHD simulations of Sgr A∗, where the temperatures of both species are evolved more self-consistently. We include Coulomb coupling, radiative cooling of electrons, and model heating via magnetic reconnection. We find that the light-curve variability more closely matches historical observations when we include the 2T treatment and variable adiabatic indices, compared to 1T simulations. Contrary to the common assumption of neglecting radiative cooling for the low accretion rates of Sgr A∗, we also find that radiative cooling still affects the accretion flow, reducing the electron temperature in the inner disk by about 10%, which in turn lowers both the average flux and variability at 230 GHz by roughly 10%.","Sagittarius A∗ (Sgr A∗) was discovered as a bright compact radio source in the centre of the Milky Way galaxy (Balick & Brown, 1974; Ekers et al., 1975; Lo et al., 1975). Subsequent observations provided compelling evidence that this object is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) by analysing its proper motion and the dynamics of individual stars in orbit around it (Schödel et al., 2002; Ghez et al., 2003, 2008; Gillessen et al., 2009; GRAVITY Collaboration et al., 2018; Do et al., 2019; GRAVITY Collaboration et al., 2019). More recently, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) presented direct evidence for the presence of this SMBH via imaging of the near-event-horizon regions (\al@SgrAEHTC2017I,SgrAEHTC2017VII; \al@SgrAEHTC2017I,SgrAEHTC2017VII). When the mass accretion rate onto black holes is low (f_{\mathrm{edd}}\equiv\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\mathrm{edd}}\lesssim 10^{-3})111\dot{M}_{\mathrm{edd}}=4\pi GM/(c\kappa_{es}\eta_{\mathrm{NT}}) is the Eddington accretion rate, M is the mass of the black hole, \kappa_{es} is the opacity due to electron scattering, and \eta_{\mathrm{NT}}=0.178 is the radiative efficiency of a thin accretion disk with BH spin a=0.9375 (Novikov & Thorne, 1973). For Sgr A∗ , \dot{M}_{\mathrm{edd}}\approx 0.05M_{\odot}/\mathrm{yr}., it is commonly thought that a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) is formed, such as in the case of Sgr A∗ with the Eddington ratio f_{\mathrm{edd}}\sim[1-100]\times 10^{-8} (e.g. Agol 2000; Bower et al. 2003; Marrone et al. 2007; \al@SgrAEHTC2017V,SgrAEHTC2017VIII; \al@SgrAEHTC2017V,SgrAEHTC2017VIII). This type of flow is considered to be thermally stable and optically thin (Narayan & Yi, 1994; Yuan & Narayan, 2014). RIAFs are collisionless, in the sense that the electron-ion collision timescale is much longer than the accretion timescale, and likely have two distinct temperatures for ions and electrons (Shapiro et al., 1976; Rees et al., 1982; Mahadevan & Quataert, 1997; Quataert, 1998). Most state-of-the-art radiatively inefficient models assume that the accretion structure is governed by ideal general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD; e.g. Gammie et al., 2003). The EHTC so far has employed a fiducial set of GRMHD models of Sgr A∗ that treat the fluid as comprised of single temperature (1T) ions, where the electron density and temperature is not explicitly considered in the evolution equations (EHTC Sgr A∗2017 V). Therefore, the question is raised of how incorporating a two-temperature (2T) treatment would impact the predicted observables from simulations of Sgr A∗. Narayan et al. (1995) proposed an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model for Sgr A∗, where less than 0.1\% of the available accretion energy is radiated. They modelled an accreting plasma with the ions at nearly virial temperature and colder electrons. Later, Yuan et al. (2002) proposed a coupled system of a jet and ADAF with a fixed ion-to-electron temperature ratio R=T_{i}/T_{e} in the jet, which better fit the low-frequency radio emission of Sgr A∗ than an ADAF alone. In the 1T GRMHD simulations explored by the EHTC, the thermal electron distribution function (eDF) is determined using the so-called R(\beta) prescriptions (e.g. Mościbrodzka et al., 2016; Anantua et al., 2020). In regions of the accretion flow where the gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio \beta\neq 1, the electron temperature is approximately independent of \beta. Consequently, T_{e} fluctuates approximately as much as T_{i} (see section 3.5). None of the EHTC models fully satisfy all the constraints from multi-wavelength observations (\al@SgrAEHTC2017II,SgrAEHTC2017V; \al@SgrAEHTC2017II,SgrAEHTC2017V). Light-curve variability at 230 GHz poses a particularly stringent challenge, as nearly all MAD models—and a significant portion of weakly magnetized (SANE) models—exhibit greater variability than seen in historical observations (Wielgus et al. 2022 and references therein). The two most promising MAD models fail only on the variability constraint, possibly attributed to the unknown electron distribution function (eDF). The actual T_{i}/T_{e} depends on microphysical dissipation and radiative processes not captured in ideal fluid simulations. Future models of Sgr A∗ need to incorporate collisionless effects and a more sophisticated treatment of electron thermodynamics, including radiative effects (e.g. Chatterjee et al., 2023). While the physics of electron cooling is well understood, the mechanisms of heating in collisionless plasma remain largely unconstrained. Heating models include prescriptions for weakly collisional MHD turbulent cascades (Howes 2010, H10; Kawazura et al. 2019, K19) and magnetic reconnection mechanisms (Rowan et al. 2017, R17; Rowan et al. 2019, R19). Ressler et al. (2015, 2017) introduced a method to evolve a gas consisting of ions and electrons that share the same dynamics but have independent thermodynamical evolution using the H10 model. Sądowski et al. (2017); Chael et al. (2018); Chael et al. (2019); Liska et al. (2024) implemented this so-called 2T treatment in a GR radiation MHD (GRRMHD) scheme with coupling between gas, radiation, magnetic fields and gravity. When using the R17 model, it was demonstrated that electrons are always cooler than ions and that electron heating is more uniform (Chael et al., 2018). Additionally, the R17 model was favoured in a polarimetric parameter survey of Sgr A∗, comparing H10, K19 and R17 (Dexter et al., 2020). For f_{\mathrm{edd}}\lesssim 10^{-5} and R17 model, a gas mixture consisting of relativistic electrons with an adiabatic index \gamma_{e}=4/3 and non-relativistic ions with \gamma_{i}=5/3 was found (Chael et al., 2018; Liska et al., 2024). As a result, assuming a single fixed value for the gas adiabatic index could also lead to inconsistencies between the total and individual temperatures and pressures. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct a detailed comparison between the evolved T_{e} from 2T GRMHD simulations and the T_{e} calculated using the R(\beta) prescription. A common assumption for Sgr A∗ is that radiative cooling and transport do not have a significant impact on the dynamics. However, recent GRMHD simulations have shown that radiative cooling has an impact when the mass accretion rate is above certain threshold. Building on the pioneering work of (Fragile & Meier, 2009), significant changes in the dynamical evolution and broad-band spectra were found when f_{\mathrm{edd}}\gtrsim 10^{-7}, for a SANE state with electron radiative cooling and fixed T_{i}/T_{e} (Dibi et al., 2012; Drappeau et al., 2013; Yoon et al., 2020). Similarly, variations in T_{i}/T_{e} were identified when f_{\mathrm{edd}}\gtrsim 10^{-7} in a 2T-treatment (Dihingia et al., 2023). For a SANE state, radiation has a negligible effect on either the dynamics or the thermodynamics of the accreting gas when f_{\mathrm{edd}}\sim 2\times 10^{-8} (Sądowski et al., 2017). In a Monte Carlo radiation MHD scheme, where emission, absorption, and scattering are treated probabilistically, radiative cooling was found to affect the spectrum for f_{\mathrm{edd}}\gtrsim 10^{-6} in SANE states (Ryan et al., 2015; Ryan et al., 2017). On the other hand, a MAD state has significantly higher radiative efficiency due to more efficient synchrotron emission, and consequently an increasing T_{i}/T_{e} was found when f_{\mathrm{edd}}\gtrsim 10^{-7} (Liska et al., 2024). However, a detailed analysis of the impact of the 2T treatment on light curve variability at 230 GHz has not been conducted, particularly for a MAD state. In this paper, we simulate a 2T GRMHD MAD state of Sgr A∗ with variable adiabatic index (Ressler et al., 2015; Sądowski et al., 2017), Coulomb coupling (Stepney & Guilbert, 1983), radiative cooling of electrons including synchrotron, bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton (Esin et al., 1997; Yoon et al., 2020). Additionally, we model electron/ion heating via magnetic reconnection (R17) but we do not account for anisotropic thermal conduction along magnetic field lines, as considered in Ressler et al. (2015). Recent studies have incorporated similar or more advanced physics at lower grid resolutions (Chael et al., 2018; Dexter et al., 2020; Ressler et al., 2023). However, an analysis of variability that systematically adds one layer of physics at a time has been lacking. We quantify the variability of the total flux density using the modulation index M_{3}, calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, measured over three-hour intervals. Our results show that the inclusion of 2T treatment, variable adiabatic index, and cooling systematically shifts the M_{3} distribution towards lower variability values at 86, 230, 345, and 1360 GHz. The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 provides the numerical setup for simulations. The results of the impact of including a two temperature treatment, heating, variable adiabatic index, radiative cooling of electrons on the light-curve variability are discussed in Section 3. The conclusions of the study are presented in Section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09278v1,"A Recent Supermassive Black Hole Binary in the Galactic Center Unveiled
by the Hypervelocity Stars","Dozens of B-type hypervelocity stars (HVSs) moving faster than the Galactic escape speed have been discovered in the Galactic halo and are produced most likely by the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic Center (GC). However, the velocity distribution and in particular the deficit of the HVSs above 700 km/s is seriously inconsistent with the expectations of the present models. Here we show that the high-velocity deficit is due to the deficiency in close interactions of stars with the SMBH, because an orbiting intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) of about 15,000 Solar mass kicked away slowly approaching stars 50-250 million years ago. The SMBH-IMBH binary formed probably after the merger of the Galaxy with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) dwarf galaxy, and coalesced about 10 million years ago. Afterwards, HVSs with speed up to above 3000 km/s are produced by binary tidal disruptions and the counterparts formed the S-star cluster at the GC.","HVSs in the Galactic halo In Fig. 1, we give our numerical results of the cumulative distributions of velocity (v-CDF) and Galactocentric distance (R-CDF) of HVSs with the model of SMBHB system in empty loss cone regime (see Methods and SI). In order to compare with the observations of the halo HVSs by Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) survey (brown_gaia_2018, ), only the early type main-sequence HVSs with mass \geq 2.5M_{\odot} and Galactocentric distance between 50 kpc and 120\,{\rm kpc} are considered. In Fig. 1, we also give the numerical results of v-CDF and R-CDF for HVSs in the same ranges of stellar mass and Galactocentric distance obtained with both the Hills mechanism in empty loss cone regime and the SMBHB slingshot in full loss cone regime. The v-CDF obtained with the Hills mechanism in empty loss cone regime is consistent with the results obtained by (generozov_constraints_2022, ), which adopted the same observed distributions of the semimajor axis, eccentricity, and mass ratio of stellar binaries of moe_mind_2017 . Fig. 1 shows that the v-CDF and R-CDF of HVSs obtained with both the SMBHB slingshot effect in full loss cone regime and the Hills mechanism in empty loss cone are significantly different from the observations of the HVSs of the MMT sample. However, the v-CDF and R-CDF of HVSs produced by the SMBHB system in empty loss cone regime are significantly different. In particular, the v-CDF shows a deficit of HVSs above a specific velocity associated with the orbit size and mass ratio of the SMBHB. Such a velocity distribution is unique and well consistent with the observations of the halo HVSs. To give quantitive constraints on the parameters of the SMBHB system, we jointly fit the v-CDF and R-CDF of HVSs of the MMT HVS sample with those of the mock samples of the SMBHB model in empty loss cone regime (Methods). Both the observational data with (kreuzer_hypervelocity_2020, ) (MMT+Gaia sample) and without (brown_gaia_2018, ) (MMT sample) the corrections of the Gaia proper motions of the MMT HVS survey sample have been fitted. The results are showed in Fig. 1 and the best fitted parameters are given in Table 1. The best fitted parameters of the SMBHB model for both MMT and MMT+Gaia samples have some differences. Because the tangential velocities of HVSs in the Galactic halo should not be significant (yu2007, ) and the corrections of the Gaia proper motions of the halo HVSs have very large observational uncertainties, here we give the discussions and conclusions mainly based on the results obtained with the MMT sample. Fig. 1 and Table 1 show that both the velocity and Galactocentric distance distributions of the halo HVSs, in particular the deficit of HVSs above 700\,{\rm km/s}, can be well reproduced with the mock HVSs ejected by the SMBHB system in empty loss cone regime when the SMBHB has the mass ratio q_{\rm MBHB}\simeq 3\times 10^{-3}, eccentricity e_{\rm MBHB}\simeq 0.4 (e_{\rm 500}), and semimajor axis a_{\rm MBHB}\simeq 160\,{\rm AU} (a_{\rm 500}) at the look-back time 500\,{\rm Myr}. The best fitted two-body relaxation timescale is about twice (with the MMT HVS sample) or one-third (with the MMT+Gaia sample) of the fiducial value at the SMBH influence radius obtained with the typical Coulomb-logarithmic \ln{\Lambda}=15. Because both the velocity correction of the Gaia proper motions of the halo HVSs and \ln{\Lambda} are in large uncertainties, the results are consistent with the two-body relaxation processes and suggest a weak effect of the massive perturbers (perets_massive_2007, ). In the SMBHB model in empty loss cone regime, about 97.5% the early-type halo HVSs are expected to have velocity below 700\,{\rm km/s} and about 2.5% of them are expected to have velocity above 700\,{\rm km/s}, which is about twenty times less than the expectations of either the Hills mechanism in empty loss cone regime or the SMBHB slingshot in full loss cone regime (see Fig. 1, or (generozov_constraints_2022, )). The probability suggests that only about half a HVS is expected to have velocity above 700\,{\rm km/s} among the observed about 20 late B-type halo HVSs of the MMT sample. During the dynamical interaction with the SMBHB, a loose binary with r_{\mathrm{bt}}\gtrsim a_{\mathrm{MBHB}} would be tidally separated and a tight binary with r_{\mathrm{bt}}\ll a_{\mathrm{MBHB}} would survive and be ejected out without disruption. Our results (Table 1) suggest that about 10% of the expected late B-type halo HVSs are in binary. The results imply that about two hypervelocity binaries (HVBs) would be detected among the 20 halo MMT HVSs and are consistent with the discovery of one candidate of HVB or rejuvenated hyper-velocity blue straggler (edelmann_he_2005, ; gualandris_hypervelocity_2007, ; przybilla_lmc_2008, ; perets_runaway_2009, ; erkal_hypervelocity_2019, ). The Galactocentric distance distribution of the HVSs could give constraints on the variation of the production rate with the lookback time and the results are given in Fig. 2. It shows that the production of the early-type HVSs begins with the start of the star formation of the young stellar population of the NSC at about 500\,{\rm Myr} ago. The production rate increases with the star formation and reaches a maximum of about 10^{-6}\,{\rm HVS\;yr^{-1}} at 150\,{\rm Myr} ago, when the first star formation episode ends schodel_milky_2020 . Thereafter, the production rate decreases with time, following the dynamical relaxation of the young stellar population of the NSC and the orbital evolution of the SMBHB. The early type HVSs are produced mainly by the gravitational slingshot effect until about 12\,{\rm Myr} ago, when the SMBHB is about to coalescence due to the gravitational wave (GW) radiations. After the coalescence of the SMBHB, all the HVSs are produced with the Hills mechanism. During the past about 6\,{\rm Myr}, the tidal disruptions of binaries originating in the CWD give rise to a burst production of early type HVSs of mass \geq 2.5\,{\rm M_{\odot}} with a peak production rate R_{\rm CWD}\simeq 7\times 10^{-6}\,{\rm HVS\;yr^{-1}}."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09195v1,"The origin channels of hierarchical binary black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O1, O2, and O3 runs","We infer the origin channels of hierarchical mergers observed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O1, O2, and O3 runs using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis under a parametric population model. By assuming the active galactic nucleus (ANG) disk and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, we find that NSCs likely dominate the hierarchical merger rate in the universe, corresponding to a fraction of f_{\rm NSC}=0.87_{-0.29}^{+0.10} at 90% credible intervals in our fiducial model; AGN disks may contribute up to nearly half of hierarchical mergers detectable with LVK, specifically f_{\rm det,AGN}=0.34_{-0.26}^{+0.38}. We investigate the impact of the escape speed, along with other population parameters on the branching fraction, suggesting that the mass, mass ratio, and spin of the sources play significant roles in population analysis. We show that hierarchical mergers constitute at least \sim10\% of the gravitational wave events detected by LVK during the O1-O3 runs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is challenging to effectively infer detailed information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of black hole merger parameters if multiple formation channels are considered.","During the first three observing runs, the LIGO (LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al., 2015), Virgo (Acernese et al., 2015), and KAGRA (Somiya, 2012; Aso et al., 2013) (LVK) Collaboration reported nearly a hundred binary compact merger events (Abbott et al., 2019, 2021; The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al., 2021; Abbott et al., 2023a). The majority of binary black hole (BBH) mergers could be explained by first-generation (1G) mergers formed from the collapse of stars. These primarily arise from isolated binary evolution, as well as dynamical formation in young/open star clusters and globular clusters (Mapelli, 2021; Mandel & Farmer, 2022). Others might stem from second (or higher) generation mergers, referred to hierarchical (repeated) mergers (O’Leary et al., 2016; Gerosa & Berti, 2017; Fishbach et al., 2017), which could mainly originate from active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks and nuclear star clusters (NSCs) (Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021; Arca Sedda et al., 2023b), although hierarchical mergers can also occur in globular clusters (GCs) and young massive clusters (YSCs). Because they are less frequent in the latter environments, which strongly depends on the escape speed of their dynamical environments (see e.g., Antonini & Gieles, 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2019; Mapelli et al., 2021; Kimball et al., 2021; Arca Sedda et al., 2023a). Hierarchical mergers can efficiently bridge the pair-instability (PI) mass gap predicted by PI supernovae (Heger et al., 2003) and Pulsational PI supernovae (Woosley et al., 2007; Belczynski et al., 2016), explaining the growth of intermediate-mass black holes (BHs) in dense stellar environments (e.g., Di Carlo et al., 2020b, a; Tagawa et al., 2021; Fragione et al., 2022; González Prieto et al., 2022; Kritos et al., 2023; Di Cintio et al., 2023). In the active phase of galactic nuclei, a high-density gas disk can efficiently capture stellar-mass BHs and facilitate binary formation and mergers (Bellovary et al., 2016; Bartos et al., 2017; Tagawa et al., 2020b). This unique environment leads to distinctive characteristics of BBHs. The BH mass spectrum is expected to undergo hardening due to the orbital alignment of BHs with the AGN disks, which preferentially selects heavier BHs (Yang et al., 2019a). Under accretion, the spin magnitudes of BHs are likely to be higher, with spin directions tending to align or anti-align with the disk (Bogdanović et al., 2007; Tagawa et al., 2020a; Yi & Cheng, 2019; McKernan et al., 2020). Moreover, migration and migration traps efficiently promotes BH hierarchical growth with extreme mass ratio mergers (Yang et al., 2019b; Li, 2022a). NSCs are also efficient sites for the occurrence of hierarchical mergers (Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021). BBHs in NSCs are formed through dynamical pairing, either via exchanges between a binary star and an intruder, or via dynamical encounters of three initially single bodies (Heggie, 1975; Hills & Fullerton, 1980). The remnant of a 1G BBH merger can be retained by the host cluster if the escape speed of the host cluster is larger than its kick velocity. This surviving remnant can then pair up with another BH to form a hierarchical BBH. Therefore, the crucial condition for hierarchical mergers in NSCs is the escape speed of the host cluster—higher escape speeds result in more efficient hierarchical mergers (Gerosa & Berti, 2019; Li, 2022b; Li et al., 2023a). Additionally, the occurrence of relatively symmetric binary for hierarchical mergers may be preferential in NSCs due to mass segregation (Pavlík & Vesperini, 2022). As a result, the difference in hierarchical mergers lies in the presence of additional changes in the mass and spin of BHs in NSCs compared to those in AGN disks. This implies that the mass and effective spin distributions of hierarchical mergers in AGN disks are higher than those in NSCs (Li et al., 2023a). Regarding the mass ratios of hierarchical mergers, unequal-mass pairings are favored in AGN disks, represented by the hierarchical branch of NG+1G mergers (NG refers to the BH generation), while in NSCs, relatively equal-mass pairings are still favored, represented by the hierarchical branch of NG+NG mergers. In addition, it is generally agreed that the efficiency of BH hierarchical growth in AGN disks may be higher than in NSCs (e.g., Yang et al., 2019b; Li et al., 2023a), although it depends on several parameters that are currently unknown. These parameters include the formation channel of NSCs, the real structure and dynamics of an AGN disk, the possible existence of migration traps, the presence of a supermassive BH in the NSC, and the dynamical evolution of the NSC and its co-evolution with the surrounding environment (Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021; Arca Sedda et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023b). Primarily focusing on 1G mergers, previous research has examined the branching fractions of their isolated binary evolution or cluster channels for BBH mergers (Zevin et al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2023; Iwaya et al., 2023; Vaccaro et al., 2024). However, some of the BBH mergers detected by LVK might be hierarchical mergers originating from dynamical channels, such as AGN disks and NSCs. In this study, our objective is to infer the branching fractions of the AGN disk and NSC channels for hierarchical mergers. Our focus is on investigating the population parameters (see Table 1) that influence branching fractions, which suggests that effectively inferring information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of BBH merger parameters presents a significant challenge."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09163v1,Impact of Large-Scale Anisotropies on Galaxy Clustering and Cosmological Constraints,"We critically assess the impact of significant dipole and large-scale anisotropies on galaxy clustering signals, with a focus on radio continuum surveys. Our study reveals that these anisotropies—resulting from intrinsic cosmological effects and/or observational systematics—profoundly influence the two-point correlation function (2PCF) and angular power spectrum (C_{\ell}). Notably, large-scale anisotropies can obscure or simulate non-Gaussianity signals, complicating the extraction of precise cosmological information. The results emphasize that it is crucial to address systematics and rigorously mask the dipole and its surrounding multipoles to obtain accurate cosmological constraints. This approach is essential for extracting cosmological results from clustering signals, particularly for future surveys such as SKA, DESI, and LSST, to ensure the precision and reliability of cosmological analyses.","Galaxy clustering is a key tool for probing cosmological parameters, offering critical insights into the matter distribution and evolution of the Universe (Peebles, 1980). By comparing observed clustering patterns with theoretical models, we impose constraints on fundamental parameters such as matter density, fluctuation amplitude, and structure growth. This process refines our understanding of the Universe’s composition and the mechanisms behind galaxy and large-scale structure formation. In the era of precision cosmology, where achieving exceptional accuracy in parameter measurements is crucial, we rely on advanced observational techniques and data analysis methods. Next-generation surveys, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA; Wilkinson 1991; Bacon et al. 2020), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI; DESI Collaboration et al. 2016, 2022), and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST; Ivezić et al. 2019), are set to dramatically enhance our ability to map the Universe and explore phenomena like dark energy, modified gravity (Clifton et al., 2012), and primordial non-Gaussianities (Komatsu & Spergel, 2001). These advancements will critically evaluate the current cosmological model and explore alternative cosmological models. However, these analyses face challenges due to large-scale anisotropies in galaxy distributions. Whether arising from intrinsic cosmological effects or observational systematics, these anisotropies can distort clustering signals and complicate accurate cosmological inference. A prime example is the observed dipole in radio and infrared galaxy counts, first identified in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) (Blake & Wall, 2002; Singal, 2011). This dipole has generated debate over its origin-whether it reflects our motion relative to the cosmic rest frame, an intrinsic large-scale structure feature, or uncorrected systematics (Gibelyou & Huterer, 2012; Rubart & Schwarz, 2013; Tiwari et al., 2015; Tiwari & Nusser, 2016; Colin et al., 2017; Dolfi et al., 2019; Tiwari et al., 2019; Secrest et al., 2022). The impact of such anisotropies is profound. The dipole and other large-scale modes can obscure the isotropic Gaussian assumption commonly used in standard analyses, complicating the detection of subtle effects such as primordial non-Gaussianity or scale-dependent biases from inflationary models (Matarrese et al., 2000; Dalal et al., 2008; Bruni et al., 2012). Most leading cosmological clustering studies have thus far overlooked these effects, operating under the assumption of large-scale isotropy and homogeneity—commonly known as the Cosmological Principle, a fundamental basis for standard cosmological analyses. Yet recent observations, especially from radio and infrared surveys (Tiwari et al., 2015; Tiwari & Nusser, 2016; Colin et al., 2017; Secrest et al., 2021, 2022; Singal, 2024; von Hausegger, 2024), reveal a prominent dipole signal in galaxy distributions, making it crucial to consider this signal and underscoring the urgency of addressing this issue. In this letter, we investigate the effect of large-scale anisotropies on galaxy clustering measurements, focusing on the two-point correlation function (2PCF) and the angular power spectrum (C_{\ell}). Using NVSS data as a case study, we assess implications for upcoming surveys like SKA, DESI, and LSST. We highlight the necessity of aggressive masking of large-scale anisotropies and rigorous systematic treatment to mitigate the dipole and adjacent multipoles, which can otherwise introduce significant biases in cosmological parameter estimates. We demonstrate how anisotropies can mimic or obscure key cosmological signals, such as non-Gaussianities and scale-dependent biases. We need for robust data processing techniques and careful management of large-scale systematics to fully exploit the capabilities of next-generation surveys. We conclude that effectively addressing large-scale anisotropies is essential for achieving precise cosmological inferences."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09135v1,Fast Radio Bursts and Interstellar Objects,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient radio events with millisecond-scale durations, and debated origins. Collisions between planetesimals and neutron stars have been proposed as a mechanism to produce FRBs; the planetesimal strength, size and density determine the time duration and energy of the resulting event. One source of planetesimals is the population of interstellar objects (ISOs), free-floating objects expected to be extremely abundant in galaxies across the Universe as products of planetary formation. We explore using the ISO population as a reservoir of planetesimals for FRB production, finding that the expected ISO-neutron star collision rate is comparable with the observed FRB event rate. Using a model linking the properties of planetesimals and the FRBs they produce, we further show that observed FRB durations are consistent with the sizes of known ISOs, and the FRB energy distribution is consistent with the observed size distributions of Solar System planetesimal populations. Finally, we argue that the rate of ISO-neutron star collisions must increase with cosmic time, matching the observed evolution of the FRB rate. Thus, ISO-neutron star collisions are a feasible mechanism for producing FRBs.","Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are gigahertz radio-emitting, millisecond-timescale transient events. First detected in 2007 (Lorimer et al., 2007), a large catalogue has been assembled by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al., 2021). The majority of known FRBs are extragalactic (Mannings et al., 2021), with only one yet known in the Milky Way (Bochenek et al., 2020; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al., 2020). They exist in a wide range of host galaxies and local environments, but remain sparse: the inferred volumetric FRB rate for events above a threshold energy of 10^{35}\mathrm{~{}erg} is (7^{+9}_{-6})\times 10^{7}\mathrm{\,Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}} (Bochenek et al., 2020). Two types are known: single (one-off) events, and repeating FRBs. One of the many (cf. Platts et al., 2019; Zhang, 2020) proposed mechanisms to produce an FRB is a collision between a planetesimal and a neutron star (NS), initially suggested by Geng & Huang (2015). Though neutron stars have been found to have planetary systems bound to them (Wolszczan & Frail, 1992), the radiation mechanism of Geng & Huang (2015) is specifically for unbound planetesimals, colliding on radial trajectories, as bound planetesimals are expected to interact differently (Brook et al., 2014). Dai et al. (2016) and Bagchi (2017) invoked the mechanism of Geng & Huang (2015) to explain repeating FRBs as NS undergoing frequent encounters in debris disks around other stars. However, the feasibility of this scenario producing repeating FRBs at the rate observed is debated (Smallwood et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2024). Nevertheless, non-repeating FRBs may still be generated by NS-planetesimal collisions, if impacts can occur at a suitable rate in free space. In this work we consider the collisions between NS and interstellar objects (ISOs). An expected feature of planet formation (McGlynn & Chapman, 1989), ISOs are planetesimals unbound from the planetary systems they formed in (’Oumuamua ISSI Team et al., 2019) with a density of 10^{15}~{}\mathrm{pc}^{-3} in the Solar neighbourhood (Do et al., 2018) and a total number of \sim 10^{27} across the Milky Way, and two discovered so far: 1I/ ‘ Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. We first quantify the ISO-NS collision rate and consider its implications (Section 2). We then use the radiation mechanism of Dai et al. (2016) to compare the observed durations and energetics of FRBs to the sizes of ISOs (Section 3). Finally in Section 4 we discuss testable implications of FRBs being produced by ISO-NS collisions, and challenges with scaling the ISO-NS collision rate with the FRB event rate."

microlensing events involving two lens masses and two source stars","Aims. We carried out a project involving the systematic analysis of microlensing data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network survey. The aim of this project is to identify lensing events with complex anomaly features that are difficult to explain using standard binary-lens or binary-source models.Methods. Our investigation reveals that the light curves of microlensing events KMT-2021-BLG-0284, KMT-2022-BLG-2480, and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 display highly complex patterns with three or more anomaly features. These features cannot be adequately explained by a binary-lens (2L1S) model alone. However, the 2L1S model can effectively describe certain segments of the light curve. By incorporating an additional source into the modeling, we identified a comprehensive model that accounts for all the observed anomaly features.Results. Bayesian analysis, based on constraints provided by lensing observables, indicates that the lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are binary systems composed of M dwarfs. For KMT-2022-BLG-2480, the primary lens is an early K-type main-sequence star with an M dwarf companion. The lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are likely located in the bulge, whereas the lens of KMT-2022-BLG-2480 is more likely situated in the disk. In all events, the binary stars of the sources have similar magnitudes due to a detection bias favoring binary source events with a relatively bright secondary source star, which increases detection efficiency.","Since the mid-2010s, the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) team has been conducting gravitational microlensing experiments using a network of three wide-field telescopes deployed in the Southern Hemisphere (Kim et al., 2016). The data collected from these observations are transmitted almost in real-time to the headquarters of the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) for processing. A self-developed algorithm (Kim et al., 2018) is employed to identify lensing events, and the light curves of these detected events are meticulously examined for any discontinuous anomalies. These anomalies undergo careful analysis by multiple researchers to determine their origins and confirm whether they are caused by planetary companions to the lens, which is the primary objective of the experiment. Currently, the KMTNet experiment detects over 3,000 gravitational lensing events annually, with about 10% of these events exhibiting anomalies of various origins (Zang et al., 2021b, 2022). Of these anomalies, approximately 10% are confirmed to be of planetary origin (Gould et al., 2022). Anomalies in lensing light curves can arise from various factors. The most common cause is the binarity of the lens (Mao & Paczyński, 1991). In these binary-lens single-source (2L1S) events, caustics form on the source plane, and the source’s passage through these caustics results in light curves that differ from those of single-lens single-source (1L1S) events (Schneider & Weiss, 1986). These caustics exhibit complex patterns depending on the separation and mass ratio between the lens components and, along with various source trajectories, produce a wide range of anomaly patterns (Erdl & Schneider, 1993; Han, 2006; Cassan, 2008; Gaudi, 2012). Another important cause of anomalies is the binarity of the source. In these single-lens binary-source (1L2S) cases, the event’s light curve is the superposition of the lensing events occurring for each individual source, which leads to deviations in the lensing light curves (Griest & Hu, 1992; Di Stefano & Esin, 1995; Han & Gould, 1997; Dominik, 1998; Han & Jeong, 1998). In some rare cases, the observed anomalies cannot be explained by a three-body lensing model (lens plus source) and require a four-body lensing model, which includes an additional lens or source component. To date, 14 events have been identified as 3L1S events, in which the lens consists of three masses. Of these, six events correspond to planetary systems consisting of a host star and two planets, seven involve binary systems that include a planet, and the remaining event has been identified as a triple stellar system composed of three stars. Another type of four-body event occurs when both the lens and the source are binaries, known as a 2L2S event. So far, ten such events have been identified, four of which involve binary lenses that include planetary companions. In Table 1, we provide a summary of some of the known four-body lensing events, along with a brief description of the corresponding lens systems.

In the initial phase, we examined lensing events from the KMTNet survey that exhibited anomalies in their light curves, which were then independently analyzed by multiple modelers. Most of these anomalies were successfully explained using either 2L1S or 1L2S models. However, for a small subset of events in which these three-body models could not account for the anomalies, we carried out more detailed analyses using advanced models. These analyses revealed that the difficulty in explaining the anomalies in some events was due to significant higher-order effects, such as lens orbital motion, as seen in events like OGLE-2018-BLG-0971, MOA-2023-BLG-065, and OGLE-2023-BLG-0136 (Han et al., 2024a). In other cases, the anomalies were caused by the presence of an additional source or lens component, as shown in the 2L2S and 3L1S events summarized in Table 1. It is important to note that the list of four-body lensing events in the table is not complete, as the nature of the anomalies in some events remains unclear, and more advanced models are currently being tested to interpret them. In this work, we present analyses of three lensing events with complex anomalies in their light curves that were successfully interpreted using 2L2S models. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we detail the observations conducted to collect the data used for our analyses, including a brief description of the instrumentation. We also outline the procedures for data reduction and photometry. Section 3 begins with the definition of the lensing parameters used in our modeling across different interpretations of lensing events. We then describe the procedure of light curve modeling employed to determine these parameters. Subsequent subsections present the analysis process and results for each individual event. Each subsection discusses specific anomalies observed in the event’s light curve, provides model parameters derived from the analysis, and outlines the configuration of the lens system. In Sect. 4 we identify the source stars associated with each event and estimate the angular Einstein radius based on the derived information on the source star. Section 5 outlines the physical quantities of the lens determined based on the observables of individual events. Lastly, Sect. 6 summarizes our findings and presents the conclusions drawn from the study."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08959v1,A complete Herbig disk mass survey in Orion,"Context. Disks around intermediate mass stars called Herbig disks are the formation sites of giant exoplanets. Obtaining a complete inventory of these disks will therefore give insights into giant planet formation. However, until now no complete disk survey has been done on Herbig disks in a single star-forming region. Aims. This work aims to obtain the first complete survey of Herbig disks. Orion is the only nearby region with a significant number of Herbig disks (N=35) to carry out such a survey. The resulting dust mass distribution is compared to other dust mass distributions of disks around proto- and pre-main sequence stars in Orion. In addition we ascertain if previous ALMA observations have been biased towards the most massive and brightest Herbig disks.Methods. Using new NOEMA observations of 25 Herbig disks, in combination with ALMA archival data of 10 Herbig disks, results in a complete sample of all know Herbig disks in Orion. Using uv-plane analysis for the NOEMA observed disks, and literature values of the ALMA observed disks, we obtain the dust masses of all Herbig disks and obtain a cumulative dust mass distribution. Additionally, six disks with new CO isotopologues detections are presented, one of which is detected in \ceC^17O. We calculate the external ultraviolet (UV) irradiance on each disk and compare the dust mass to it.Results. We find a median disk dust mass of 11.7 M_{\oplus} for the Herbig disks. Comparing the Herbig disks in Orion to previous surveys for mainly T Tauri disks in Orion, we find that while \sim 50% of the Herbig disks have a mass higher than 10 M⊕, this is at most 25% for the T Tauri disks. This difference is especially striking when considering that the Herbig disks are around a factor of two older than the T Tauri disks. Comparing to the Herbig disks observed with ALMA from a previous study, no significant difference is found between the distributions. We find a steeper (slope of -7.6) relationship between the dust mass and external UV irradation compared to that of the T Tauri disks (slope of -1.3). Comparing our results to a recent SPHERE survey of disks in Orion, we see that the Herbig disks present the largest and brightest disks and have structures indicative of gas-giant formation.Conclusions. Herbig disks are on average more massive compared to T Tauri disks. This work shows the importance of complete samples, giving rise to the need of a complete survey of the Herbig disk population.","Herbig disks are disks around pre-main sequence stars with spectral types of B, A, and F, and stellar masses of 1.5-10 M⊙ with H\alpha indicating ongoing accretion (Herbig, 1960; Brittain et al., 2023). These disks are the prime formation site of giant exoplanets: directly imaged exoplanets are often found around early spectral type stars (Marois et al., 2008, 2010; Lagrange et al., 2010), and exoplanet population studies show that the occurrence rate of massive exoplanets is highest around intermediate mass stars (e.g., Johnson et al., 2010; Nielsen et al., 2019). Recent work by Stapper et al. (2022) has shown that the mean mass of Herbig disks is higher compared to disks around lower mass T Tauri stars. The interpretation of these higher disk fluxes are still being discussed: either as a consequence of massive exoplanets forming in these disks stopping radial drift and keeping the emitting area of the dust large (Stapper et al., 2022), and/or high dust masses causing massive exoplanets to form in these disks (e.g., Guzmán-Díaz et al., 2023). Regardless of interpretation, massive exoplanets are likely forming in these disks. Some of the most well-known protoplanetary disks are Herbig disk. These millimeter-bright disks display many different types of structures, and are therefore especially favored for in-depth morphological (e.g., Andrews et al., 2018), kinematical (Pinte et al., 2018, 2019; Izquierdo et al., 2022), and chemical studies (e.g., Öberg et al., 2021; Booth et al., 2024). Stapper et al. (2022) compiled all ALMA data available of Herbig disks within 450 pc, including these well-studied disks. They found a clear increase in the mean dust mass compared to disks in the Lupus and Upper Sco star-forming regions, which primarily consist of T Tauri stars, showing that the stellar mass - disk mass relationship extends to the intermediate mass regime. Still, both Herbig and T Tauri disks span the same range of masses, although their distributions are skewed to different averages. Since the T Tauri samples are complete and the Herbig sample of Stapper et al. (2022) is constructed from Herbig disks studied in a variety of ALMA projects (still 64% complete including all nearby star-forming regions), the question remains if the ALMA coverage of Herbig disks is biased toward well-known and ‘interesting’ objects with higher disk masses. Figure 1: Positions on the sky of the Herbig disk sample used in this work shown as the gray markers. The numbers next to the markers correspond to the numbers in Table 1. The background is an IRAS 100\mum image (Neugebauer et al., 1984). The positions of six disk surveys have been indicated as well: \sigma Ori (Ansdell et al., 2017), ONC (Eisner et al., 2018), OMC-2 (van Terwisga et al., 2019), \lambda Ori (Ansdell et al., 2020), NGC 2024 (van Terwisga et al., 2020), and L1641/L1647 (SODA, van Terwisga et al., 2022). Orion (\sim300–475 pc, Großschedl et al. 2018) is the closest star-forming complex with enough pre-main-sequence stars to harbor a sizeable number of Herbig Ae/Be stars. Many population studies have been done in different parts of Orion, tracing different star-formation environments from tranquil regions to more UV-dominated regions. In the \sigma Orionis cluster, an intermediate aged region of 3 Myr old, the disk dust masses were found to depend strongly on the distance to the O9 star at its center (Ansdell et al., 2017). Only 12% of their disks were more than 10 M⊕ in mass. Furthermore, CO was only detected in disks more than 1.5 pc separated from the O-star. On the other hand, the disks in the older \lambda Orionis cluster of 5 Myr have not been significantly impacted by the massive stars or the supernova which occurred in the cluster (Ansdell et al., 2020). Interestingly, there is one significant outlier, HD 245185 which is a Herbig disk, which has a more than an order of magnitude higher disk mass than any of the other disks in this region. The younger (0.5 Myr) NGC 2024 cluster was surveyed by van Terwisga et al. (2020). This cluster consists of two populations, the eastern population is shielded from FUV irradiation and is similar to other isolated regions, while the western population is older and may be affected by the FUV irradiation. Other younger clusters such as the Orion Nebula Cluster and Orion Molecular Cloud-2 have been surveyed as well (Eisner et al., 2018; van Terwisga et al., 2019), and even class 0 and I surveys have been done (Tobin et al., 2020). Lastly, the largest population study of disks to date, consisting of 873 disks, has been done in the L1641 and L1647 regions of the Orion A cloud (SODA, van Terwisga et al. 2022, for L1641 also see Grant et al. 2021). The plethora of population studies available in Orion gives a solid basis for a comparison between T Tauri disks and Herbig disks. In this work we present new Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations of all Herbig disks in Orion. Section 2 shows how the targets were selected, the NOEMA data were reduced, and the dust masses were obtained. In Section 3 the resulting dust mass distribution is presented and compared to distributions of other proto- and pre-main sequence stars in Orion, in addition CO spectra are presented. In Section 4.1 the dust mass distribution is compared to the one of ALMA from Stapper et al. (2022). The impact of external UV irradiation on the dust masses is determined in Section 4.2, and a comparison to scattered light is made in Section 4.3. Our results are summarized in Section 5.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08945v1,Evaluating cosmological simulations of galaxy formation with spectral variance in the optical window,"Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations provide valuable insights on galaxy evolution when coupled with observational data. Comparisons with real galaxies are typically performed via scaling relations of model fitting. Here we follow an alternative approach based on the spectral variance in a model-independent way. We build upon the work presented in Sharbaf et al. (2023) that studied the covariance of high quality SDSS continuum-subtracted spectra in a relatively narrow range of velocity dispersion (\sigma\in[100,150] km s-1). Here the same analysis is applied to synthetic data from the EAGLE and Illustris TNG100 simulations, to assess the ability of these runs to mimic real galaxies. The real and simulated spectra are consistent regarding spectral variance, although with subtle differences that can inform the implementation of subgrid physics. Spectral fitting done a posteriori on stacks segregated with respect to latent space reveals that the first principal component (PC1) is predominantly influenced by the stellar age distribution, with an underlying age-metallicity degeneracy. Good agreement is found regarding star formation prescriptions but there is disagreement with AGN feedback, that also affects the subset of quiescent galaxies. We show a substantial difference in the implementation of the AGN subgrid, regarding central black hole seeding, that could lead to the mismatch. Differences are manifest between these two simulations in the star formation histories stacked with respect to latent space. We emphasise that this methodology only relies on the spectral variance to assess whether simulations provide a true representation of galaxy formation.","Galaxy formation and evolution represent one of the most significant frontiers of astrophysics over the past decade. An exploration of the formation history of galaxies provides insights into the various physical processes involved in creating the stellar and gaseous components that we can observe through telescopes or investigate through simulations. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, such as EAGLE (Schaye et al., 2015) and IllustrisTNG (Pillepich et al., 2018), offer valuable insights when coupled with high-quality survey data most notably the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (York et al., 2000), enhancing our understanding of galaxy evolution. There is a complementary role for both observation and simulation data. This is because observations are used to constrain various parameters in simulations, while simulations are used to interpret the observations with fundamental properties of galaxies. Galaxies form and evolve as a result of the interaction between diverse physical processes that, in addition to gravity, influence baryonic matter. Given the inherent resolution limit of simulations that rely on a finite set of particles, or gridpoints, sub-grid physics is employed for the modeling of baryonic processes below the galactic scale, such as the formation of Black Holes (BHs), their growth, and feedback. Incorporating these processes into simulations represents a significant challenge because these are complex physical processes and it is difficult to develop numerical algorithms that can accurately model their effects in a computationally efficient manner (see, e.g, Somerville & Davé, 2015; Naab & Ostriker, 2017; Crain & van de Voort, 2023). A variety of sub-grid models are employed in the simulations, including different locations and masses for seeding BHs, different models for computing accretion on BHs, various efficiency factors and modeling techniques to inject energy released by AGNs, AGN feedback channels are explicitly determined by the BH mass in some models, while uniform feedback is assumed in others. Feedback from star formation is another important subgrid process that is expected to affect in a fundamental way the observed distribution of galaxies(e.g., Schaye & Dalla Vecchia, 2008). From a theoretical standpoint, state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations such as EAGLE (Schaye et al., 2015) and IllustrisTNG (Pillepich et al., 2018) reproduce the general fundamental properties of galaxies i.e. the evolution of the galaxy mass function (Furlong et al., 2015; Kaviraj et al., 2017; Pillepich et al., 2018), AGN luminosity (Rosas-Guevara et al., 2016; Volonteri et al., 2016; McAlpine et al., 2017) as well as the bimodality of galaxy color (Trayford et al., 2015; Trayford et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2018), and the SFR and UVJ-based quenched fraction at z\lesssim 2-3 (Donnari et al., 2019, 2021). Despite the good agreement between observational constraints and simulations, and the recent tremendous progress that has been made in these areas, there are still challenges to overcome. Non-trivial subgrid physics is therefore the major source of uncertainty in cosmological simulations, and adjusting these parameters can significantly alter results (Okamoto et al., 2005; Schaye et al., 2010; Scannapieco et al., 2012; Haas et al., 2013a, b; Le Brun et al., 2014; Torrey et al., 2014; Negri & Volonteri, 2017). By comparing simulations and observations, sub-grid physics can be tested. Simulations and observations are frequently compared in papers (e.g., Nelson et al., 2015; Pillepich et al., 2018; Vogelsberger et al., 2014; Habouzit et al., 2021), but the comparison with observational constraints can be challenging since these constraints often require physical modeling or assumptions. Using variance111In the strictest sense, we refer here to covariance, as we are dealing with multivariate analysis, but we use both terms with a similar meaning and prefer to use the term “spectral variance”. analysis, it is possible to obtain information from galaxy spectra in a model-independent manner, and without imposing physical constraints on the model (e.g., Ferreras et al., 2006; Rogers et al., 2007, 2010b; Sharbaf et al., 2023). Galaxy spectra encode the kinematics, age, and chemical composition of the stellar populations underlying them, thus representing one of the most reliable sources of information about galaxies. The spectral variance can be combined with stellar population synthesis models (e.g., Bruzual & Charlot, 2003; Vazdekis et al., 2016) to retrieve information from galaxy spectra. Following the methodology of Rogers et al. (2007), we use a multivariate analysis method to explore the retrieval of information from galaxy spectra on a model-independent basis. This method has been applied to a general sample of SDSS galaxies in Sharbaf et al. (2023), hereafter referenced as PCA-SDSS. We performed principal component analysis on three separate groups of galaxy spectra: Star Forming (SF), AGN, and Quiescent (Q), based on the nebular emission properties. We emphasize that the variance of the input data in this work only relates to the absorption lines in the photospheres of stellar populations. The PCA-SDSS study analyses SDSS optical spectra using PCA to determine what physical phenomena contribute to the spectral variance, and suggested that galaxy structure may be controlled by a single (or a few) parameters, since only one component demonstrates a correlation with age, and plays a primary role as an evolutionary trend. In this study, we evaluate how the variance in the synthetic spectra created from the EAGLE (Schaye et al., 2015) and IllustrisTNG (Pillepich et al., 2018) simulations behaves in comparison with the optical spectra (York et al., 2000), and evaluate the subgrid physics. A comparison of the different properties that are successfully reproduced and those that are not is made. We are interested in understanding how different sub-grid models can produce different spectral variance. The structure of the paper is as follows: the sample and the simulations are presented in section 2, followed by data pre-processing and an explanation of the restrictions in section 3. In section 4 we show how the synthetic spectra are produced from the simulations. The decomposition of optical spectra into principal components and projection of the synthetic and optical spectra to those principal components are explained in section 5, and the projections are explored in section 6, along with models of population synthesis. We discuss the results and present our conclusions in section 7."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08838v1,Diverse pathways for supermassive black hole-galaxy coevolution,"Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are observed in diverse galaxy populations across time yet a clear understanding of how they coevolve with their hosts has not been reached. Physically-motivated models of SMBH accretion and feedback vary widely between galaxy formation simulations due to the difficulty of modeling the range of scales important for galactic and SMBH processes. Here we use observational data to build an empirical model for SMBH growth. We apply observed specific accretion rate probability distributions as a function of galaxy star formation rate between z=0-2 to the UniverseMachine galaxy formation model to determine SMBH accretion rates based on galaxy properties. We use observed z=0 SMBH-stellar mass relations for the quiescent and star-forming populations to provide the local boundary conditions for SMBH growth histories. We then track the coevolutionary histories of galaxy stellar mass and their SMBHs backwards in time to z=2. We find that the most massive SMBHs at z=0 have grown very little of their total mass between z=0-2, indicating early SMBH mass assembly for these systems. Conversely, lower mass SMBHs at z=0 assembled their mass gradually across z=0-2. This results in substantial evolution of the SMBH-stellar mass relation, shifting to higher normalization and shallower slope with increasing redshift. We find that the substantial scatter observed in the z=0 SMBH-stellar mass relation results in the diversity of growth pathways found in our model, with some galaxies assembling their stellar mass before their SMBHs and others doing the opposite.","There are compelling reasons for why supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to play a crucial role in shaping galaxy evolution. Many of the most luminous and energetic events in the universe are produced by accretion onto these compact objects (Salpeter, 1964; Lynden-Bell, 1969; Rees, 1984). For example, a Sagittarius A∗-like SMBH with a mass of 4\times 10^{6} M⊙ accreting at its theoretical maximum, commonly called the Eddington limit, would release the equivalent of the Milky Way halo’s binding energy in only \sim30 million years. This demonstrates the enormous potential for SMBHs to affect their host galaxies’ evolution via feedback and accretion processes. (Fabian, 2012; Harrison et al., 2018). This energetic output is thought to couple to the evolutionary processes of galaxies via preventative feedback, where it suppresses large-scale gas cooling from the circumgalactic medium, or ejective feedback, where it removes cold gas from the galaxy’s interstellar medium (ISM, Somerville & Davé, 2015). Some combination of both of these feedback mechanisms throughout the lifetime of a subset of galaxies eventually produces systems devoid of fuel for star formation, resulting in a quiescent galaxy population (Morganti, 2017; Brennan et al., 2018). The accretion of material onto SMBHs produces light across the electromagnetic spectrum from X-ray to radio. The ability to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxies by tracing the emission at particular wavelength regimes depends strongly on the viewing angle, the amount of obscuring material, and the physical state of the disk (Antonucci, 1993; Kauffmann et al., 2003). Star-forming galaxies with large cold gas reservoirs that can feed SMBH accretion are also subject to the most obscuration from their ISM (Fornasini et al., 2018). X-ray emission from the accretion disk is often the most reliable AGN detection method since it can penetrate high column densities (with the exception of Compton-thick regions with equivalent hydrogen column densities >10^{24} cm-2, e.g. Della Ceca et al., 2008) and provides a robust tracer of SMBH accretion across cosmic time. Several studies have used the power of X-ray surveys to track SMBH growth over the evolving galaxy population. These studies find a broad distribution of X-ray AGN luminosities within galaxies of a given star formation rate (SFR, Azadi et al., 2017). While star-forming galaxies are more likely to host an AGN (Santini et al., 2012), the X-ray luminosity of these galaxies has a very broad distrubiton that is only weakly dependent on their host galaxy SFR (Aird et al., 2012; Harrison et al., 2012; Azadi et al., 2015; Ramasawmy et al., 2019). The broad distribution of luminosities likely reflects variability in the accretion rate of SMBHs at much shorter timescales compared to changes in global galactic properties such as SFR (Hickox et al., 2014). Once the variability on galactic timescales is accounted for, a complex but more direct connection between AGN feeding and star formation is revealed (Aird et al., 2019, 2022). In the local Universe, we find the end result of this accretion-powered growth: a diverse galaxy population hosting SMBHs with a wide range of masses identified using dynamical tracers at z\sim 0 (Kormendy & Ho, 2013; Greene et al., 2020). While SMBH mass (MBH) broadly correlates with galaxy properties, there is substantial scatter in MBH at a given host galaxy stellar mass (Mstar). SMBHs that are overmassive relative to their host’s Mstar tend to be found in galaxies with lower star formation activity (Terrazas et al., 2016, 2017; Martín-Navarro et al., 2018; Piotrowska et al., 2022). SMBH mass is therefore an important indicator of quiescence in galaxies, at least in the local Universe where high-fidelity dynamical SMBH masses can be measured (Kormendy & Ho, 2013; Saglia et al., 2016; van den Bosch, 2016). However, these MBH measurements are difficult to obtain for a representative sample of galaxies since it is necessary to resolve and detect unobscured dynamical tracers within the SMBH’s gravitational sphere of influence, introducing selection effects that are poorly understood (Shankar et al., 2016, 2019). Using a variety of methods to trace the dynamical mass (e.g., stars, gas, reverberation mapping) allows for SMBH masses to be measured in several types of host galaxy, somewhat alleviating this problem. At higher redshifts, resolving the sphere of influence is impossible with current observational capabilities. While some studies have attempted to place constraints on the evolution of SMBH scaling relations for AGN out to z\sim 2 (Suh et al., 2020; Mountrichas, 2023; Li et al., 2023; Tanaka et al., 2024), the samples used are heavily biased towards the most massive and highly accreting SMBHs. As such, determining the representative coevolutionary pathway(s) taken by SMBHs and their host galaxies to reproduce the observed z=0 relations remains an open question. Galaxy formation simulations have historically relied on SMBH feedback for suppressing star formation in massive galaxies and thus reproducing the observed stellar mass functions and quenched fractions across redshift (Di Matteo et al., 2005; Bower et al., 2006; Cattaneo et al., 2009). More massive SMBHs are observed to live in more massive galaxies (Ferrarese & Merritt, 2000; Gebhardt et al., 2000), and simulations have broadly reproduced the importance of SMBH mass as an indicator for quiescence. However, physical models of SMBH growth and feedback still vary substantially between the latest state-of-the-art simulations (Terrazas et al., 2016, 2017; Habouzit et al., 2021; Dattathri et al., 2024). Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation that model regions of space \gtrsim 1 Mpc lack the resolution needed to capture the processes governing SMBH physics at scales of \ll 0.1 pc. This reflects the difficult task of simulating the large range of spatial and temporal scales necessary for modeling galactic processes, particularly those pertaining to the central SMBH. In order to overcome this challenge simulators often employ sub-grid physics that model the effects of sub-resolution scales on the smallest resolution elements in the simulations (e.g., Croton et al., 2006; Hirschmann et al., 2014; Sijacki et al., 2015; Crain et al., 2015; Weinberger et al., 2018). These sub-grid models for SMBH accretion and feedback differ greatly between galaxy formation simulations due to the lack of a consensus model for these processes, motivating the need to further constrain these models with observational data. Despite the differences in SMBH subgrid models, different simulations successfully reproduce the suppression of star formation in massive galaxies at late times (Terrazas et al., 2016). This indicates that other metrics that are more sensitive to the differences between SMBH models are necessary to fully understand how a quiescent population is produced (Shi et al., 2022). One such powerful metric that reflects the differences in simulations is the relationship between SMBH mass and total host galaxy stellar mass (Terrazas et al., 2016, 2017). In this work, we focus on better understanding how this relation evolves over time. Here, we use observational data to build an empirical model of SMBH growth. These data place constraints on SMBH masses at z=0 and accretion rates at z=0-2, as a function of host galaxy star formation rate (SFR). Our model uses the observed MBH–Mstar relations for quiescent and star-forming galaxies at z=0 from Greene et al. (2020) as the local boundary conditions. We also use the observed probability distribution functions for specific SMBH accretion rate (sBHAR) as a function of both redshift and SFR from Aird et al. (2019), who carefully correct their distributions for incompleteness using a Bayesian approach. Our goal is to use these data to understand how the z=0 distribution of galaxies on the MBH–Mstar relation established itself from z=2 to the present day. This exercise will provide constraints on how SMBH growth proceeds within a diversity of galaxies based on observational data. We begin with a description of the observational data used in our empirical approach and an explanation of our model in Section 2. We then describe the evolution of the MBH–Mstar relation from z=0-2 in Section 3, indicating the diversity of possible coevolutionary growth histories. Section 4 describes how much SMBH growth occurs in different phases of star formation across time. Section 5 focuses on the small fractional mass growth since z=2 of the most massive SMBHs at z=0, indicating the early assembly of these objects in a subset of massive galaxies. We then describe the impact of varying the z=0 MBH–Mstar relation which serve as the local boundary conditions for our model in Section 6. We end with a discussion of our most interesting results in Section 7 and a summarizing conclusion in Section 8. Throughout this paper, we adopt a flat cosmology with \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7 and H_{0}=70 km s-1 Mpc-1."

The available rovibrational rate coefficients for water have been calculated using a number of approximations. We present a numerically exact calculation for the rovibrational quenching for all water vibrational modes due to collisions with atomic hydrogen. The scattering theory implements a quantum close-coupling (CC) method on a high level ab initio six-dimensional (6D) potential energy surface (PES). Total rovibrational quenching cross sections for excited bending levels were compared with earlier results on a 4D PES with the rigid-bender close-coupling (RBCC) approximation. General agreement between 6D-CC and 4D-RBCC calculations are found, but differences are evident including the energy and amplitude of low-energy orbiting resonances. Quenching cross sections from the symmetric and asymmetric stretch modes are provided for the first time. The current 6D-CC calculation provides accurate inelastic data needed for astrophysical modeling.","1 Supporting Information A table comparing H2O-H PES global minimum, rigid-rotor scattering results, and additional rovibrational scattering cross sections and rate coefficients of H2O in collision with H."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08704v1,Starburst heating and synthetic ion column densities in multiphase galactic outflows,"Stellar-driven galactic winds are multiphase outflows of energy and matter connecting the interstellar and circumgalactic media (CGM) with the intergalactic medium. Galactic winds contain a hot and diffuse phase detected in X-rays, and a cold and dense phase detected via emission and absorption lines from the ions populating the outflow. The ion production within galactic winds largely depends on the background UV radiation field produced by star formation, and this in turn depends on the age of the starburst, the gas metallicity, the proximity of the outflowing gas to the central star-forming regions. Our study probes the influence of the proximity of wind-cloud systems to the UV background source, and the effects of magnetic fields on the N v ion production through the analysis of synthetic column densities and spectral lines. We utilise magnetohydrodynamical simulations to study weakly-magnetised wind-cloud systems, and extract synthetic spectral lines with Trident and yt. Our simulations indicate that magnetic fields transverse to the wind have a shielding effect on dense gas, producing broader N v absorption lines. Also, a weak (distant) UV background produces N v only in the outer cloud layers with no spectral signature, while a strong (nearby) UV background produces it in the cloud core with a narrow spectral line. Overall, transverse magnetic fields and a UV radiation at 50\,\rm kpc produce the stronger N v spectral lines.","The exact mechanisms of galaxy evolution that provide an external supply of gas to the interstellar medium (ISM) in order to maintain star formation and sustain small fractions of baryons and metals are still unknown ([Tumlinson et al. 2017]). Galatic outflows fueled by supernovae or active galactic nuclei are essential to regulate the exchange of gases between the ISM and the intergalactic medium (IGM) and provide the observed chemical enrichment in galaxies and low metal retention ([Peeples et al. 2014]), The circumgalactic medium (CGM) acts as a transition region where this exchange takes place. Evidence of these outflows is obtained through absorption spectra given different UV background sources, such as quasars. Looking at the starlight produced by a galaxy is especially useful for spectroscopy of the galactic outflows and inflows of the galaxy ([Tumlinson et al. 2017]). One fundamental problem is the extension of lifetime and stability of clouds to the observed time scales given the presence of neutral atoms and high velocities. The addition of magnetic fields of various strengths to simulations suggest higher consistency among models due to the inhibition of small-scale hydrodynamical instabilities, along with cloud lifetime increase for magnetic fields transverse to the direction of the galactic winds by a draping effect, with generally smoother morphologies ([Cottle et al. 2020, Casavecchia et al. 2024]), as well as general lifetime increase including radiative cooling. Obtaining observables is crucial for agreement comparison of computational and observational results of multiphase gas, including absorption lines ([de la Cruz et al. 2021, Casavecchia et al. 2024]) with the aim to improve theoretical understanding. Nevertheless, similarities are still limited by resolution, reproduction of environmental conditions close to those observed in the CGM and the understanding of the effects of UV sources. In this paper we present the effects different UV backgrounds on the chemistry of high-resolution wind-cloud systems affected by magnetic fields in different orientations through the production of synthetic ion column densities using a Python suite developed by our group."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08676v1,Investigating Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei with Long-term Optical and X-Ray Observations,"Context. Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) show the appearance and disappearance of broad emission lines in their UV/optical spectra on timescales of months to decades.Aims. We investigate here how CL transitions depend on several AGN parameters such as accretion rate, obscuration properties and black hole mass.Methods. We study a sample of 20 nearby optically-identified CLAGNs from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), using quasi-simultaneous optical and X-ray observations taken in the last \sim 40 years.Results. We find that for all CLAGNs, the transition is accompanied by a change in Eddington ratio. The CL transitions are not associated with changes in the obscuration properties of the AGN. CLAGNs are found to have a median Eddington ratio lower than the AGNs in the BASS sample in which CL transitions were not detected. The median of the transition Eddington ratio (Eddington ratio at which AGN changes its state) is found to be \sim 0.01 for type 1 \leftrightarrow 1.8/1.9/2 transition, which is consistent with the hard \leftrightarrow soft state transition in black hole X-ray binaries. Most CL events are constrained to occur within 3–4 years, which is considerably shorter than the expected viscous timescale in AGN accretion disk.Conclusions. The transitions of the optical CLAGNs studied here are likely associated to state changes in the accretion flow, possibly driven by disk-instability.","Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are powered by the accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located at the center of galaxies (e.g., Rees, 1988). In the optical/UV, AGNs are generally classified as either type 1 or type 2. Type 1 AGNs show both broad emission lines (BELs; full-width half maxima; FWHM >1000 km s-1 ) originating in the broad line region (BLR) and narrow emission lines (NELs; FWHM <1000 km s-1 ) originating in the narrow line region (NLR). Type 2 AGNs show only NELs in their UV/optical spectra. Depending on the strength of the BELs, finer classifications (type 1.5, 1.8, and 1.9) can be used (e.g., Osterbrock, 1981; Winkler, 1992a). In the X-rays, on the other hand, AGNs are classified based on their obscuration properties, and in particular by their line-of-sight hydrogen column density (N_{\rm H}). AGNs can be usually defined to be obscured if N_{\rm H}>10^{22} cm-2 , while they are referred as unobscured if N_{\rm H}<10^{22} cm-2 . Furthermore, obscured AGNs can be divided into Compton-thick (CT; N_{\rm H}>10^{24} cm-2 ) and Compton thin (N_{\rm H}<10^{24} cm-2 ). Generally, type 1 AGNs are found to be unobscured, while type 2 AGNs are obscured (e.g., Awaki et al., 1991; Koss et al., 2017; Ricci et al., 2017a; Oh et al., 2022). The FWHM of the emission lines is in good agreement with the X-ray obscuration, with type 1–1.8 AGNs having N_{\rm H}<10^{21.9} cm-2 , and type 2 AGNs having N_{\rm H}>10^{21.9} cm-2 ; however, type 1.9 AGNs show a range of N_{\rm H} (Koss et al., 2017, 2022b). These different classes of AGN can be explained by the simplified AGN unification model (UM), which is based on the orientation with respect to an anisotropic absorber (e.g., Urry & Padovani, 1995; Antonucci, 1993; Netzer, 2015; Ramos Almeida & Ricci, 2017). According to this scheme, type 1s are observed face-on, with BLR and NLR visible to the observer, while type 2s are observed edge-on, with the view to the BLR covered by the obscuring material, which leaves only the NLR directly visible to the observer. The intermediate classes of AGNs (type 1.5, 1.8, 1.9) are thought to be seen through the edge of the obscuring material, where the gas is not optically thick enough to block the entire BLR (e.g., Antonucci, 1993; Goodrich, 1995; Runco et al., 2016). While the UM provides a good first-order explanation to the different AGN populations, over the past few decades it has been shown that several additional parameters, such as the covering factor of obscuring materials, accretion rate, can affect the probability of an AGN to be observed as obscured or unobscured (e.g., Elitzur & Ho, 2009; Ricci et al., 2017b, 2023). Changing-look AGNs (CLAGNs) are the objects that show drastic optical and X-ray spectral variability on timescales that range from hours to years and can be generally divided into two classes (see Ricci & Trakhtenbrot, 2023, for a recent review). In the UV/optical, CLAGNs transition from type 1 to type 2, or vice versa, within timescales of months to decades. Most of these objects can be considered as ‘changing-state’ AGNs (CSAGNs). In X-rays, typically, a different kind of CL event is observed. In these objects, the N_{\rm H} show rapid variability on a timescale of hours to years. We refer to these objects as ‘changing-obscuration’ AGNs (COAGNs). Over the years, many AGNs, such as NGC 1566 (Oknyansky et al., 2019), NGC 3516 (Ilić et al., 2020), Mrk 1018 (Cohen et al., 1986), Mrk 590 (Shappee et al., 2014), have been found to show CL transitions on a timescale of months to decades. Many of those sources had undergone such transitions more than once. For example, Mrk 1018 was turned off to enter the type 1.9 state in 1984 (Cohen et al., 1986) and re-brightened again to transition to type 1 state in 2008 (Shappee et al., 2014). NGC 1566 showed CL transition several times in the past 60 years, changing its state between type 1 and 1.8/1.9 (Shobbrook, 1966; Pastoriza & Gerola, 1970; Alloin et al., 1986; Baribaud et al., 1992; Oknyansky et al., 2020). NGC 4151 was initially identified as type 1 AGN in the 1970s, but it moved to type 1.8/1.9 in the 1980s with the disappearance of the broad lines (Osterbrock, 1981; Shapovalova et al., 2010). Later, the source changed back to type 1 state as it re-gained the broad lines. In addition to the local Seyfert galaxies, several higher redshift quasars have been found to show the CL transitions (e.g., LaMassa et al., 2015; Merloni et al., 2015; MacLeod et al., 2016). Recently, Zeltyn et al. (2024) identified 116 CLAGNs in the first year data in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) with repeated spectroscopic observations, of which 107 sources are newly identified CLAGNs. That sample of CLAGNs is the largest reported to date. The origin of the CS and CO events is still unclear, and many models have been proposed to explain these events. Generally, the COAGNs are linked to obscuration associated with the clumpiness of the BLR or the circumnuclear molecular dusty gas and dust (e.g., Nenkova et al., 2008a, b; Yaqoob et al., 2015; Ricci et al., 2016; Jana et al., 2020, 2022). The CSAGNs are believed to be caused by the change in the accretion rate, which is attributed to the local disk instabilities (Stern et al., 2018; Noda & Done, 2018), or major disk perturbation, such as tidal disruption events (TDEs; e.g., Merloni et al., 2015; Ricci et al., 2020). Some CS events were explained by moving gas clouds and dust which attenuate the BLR emission (e.g., Goodrich, 1989, 1995; Zeltyn et al., 2022). However, various problems arise when explaining the CS events with obscuration. One needs a large dusty cloud to cover the BLR efficiently, which would take tens of years, assuming reasonable cloud velocity (e.g., LaMassa et al., 2015). However, many CS transitions are observed in a much shorter timescale of months to years (e.g., Denney et al., 2014; Trakhtenbrot et al., 2019; Oknyansky et al., 2019). Additionally, the signature of the obscuration is not observed in the X-ray spectra during/after the transitions (e.g., Denney et al., 2014). In fact, many CSAGNs show the same level of obscuration before and after the transition. Furthermore, many CSAGNs are found to be unobscured, discarding obscuration as a reason for CS events (e.g., Lyu et al., 2021; Jana et al., 2021). The optical continuum flux also changes with the BEL flux, indicating the accretion flow as a reason for the CS transitions (e.g., Ricci & Trakhtenbrot, 2023). Few AGNs, such as NGC 1365 and NGC 7582, showed both CS and CO transitions in the past (e.g., Risaliti et al., 2007; Temple et al., 2023b; Neustadt et al., 2023). However, those transitions are not correlated and are observed in different timescales, indicating independent transitions. Polarimetric studies also suggest that CS transitions are unlikely due to changes in the obscuration properties of the source (e.g., Marin, 2017; Hutsemékers et al., 2019, 2020). The BELs flux responds to changes in the ionizing luminosity, which is evident from reverberation studies (e.g., Blandford & McKee, 1982; Peterson, 1993; Runco et al., 2016; Fonseca Alvarez et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2021a; Oknyansky et al., 2023a). The appearance and disappearance of the BELs are examples of the extreme variability of the BLR. In the disk-wind model, the BLR could originate from outflows produced by the accretion disk, which directly connects the BELs with the accretion rate (e.g., Emmering et al., 1992; Nicastro, 2000; Elitzur & Ho, 2009; Temple et al., 2023a). In this framework, the BLR would not be sustained below a certain luminosity, L_{\rm crit}<2.3\times 10^{40} M_{8}^{2/3} erg s-1 (M_{8} is black hole mass in 10^{8} M_{\odot}; Elitzur & Ho, 2009). This model suggests that the AGN would follow the transition sequence as type 2 \rightarrow 1.8/1.9 \rightarrow 1.2/1.5 \rightarrow 1.0, with increasing accretion rate (Elitzur, 2012; Elitzur et al., 2014). Local disk instabilities in the accretion disk could also explain CS events (Noda & Done, 2018; Sniegowska et al., 2020). The instabilities can be triggered by various mechanisms on different timescales (e.g., Ricci & Trakhtenbrot, 2023). In Mrk 1018, the CS transition is explained with the disk-instability model (Noda & Done, 2018). The CS transition is linked with the soft excess, which is believed to ionize the gas clouds in the BLR. In Mrk 1018, the BEL disappeared when the Eddington ratio (\lambda_{\rm Edd} ) decreased from \sim 0.08 to \sim 0.006, with the primary continuum and soft excess flux reduced by a factor of \sim 60 and \sim 7, respectively. This transition is tied with the soft-to-hard spectral state transition, similar to black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), which occurs at \lambda_{\rm Edd} \simeq 0.01-0.02 (e.g., Maccarone, 2003; Done et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2015). Similar behavior is also found in other CSAGNs (e.g., Ai et al., 2020; Ruan et al., 2019). Figure 1: Distribution of \lambda_{\rm Edd} with the spectral states for each source. The red-dashed horizontal lines in each panel represent the transition Eddington ratio (\lambda_{\rm Edd}^{\rm tr}) for each source, except NGC 2992. NGC 2992 did not show transition between type 1 and type 1.8–2 states. The timescale of CSAGNs is a concerning factor when comparing it with state transitions in BHXBs. Simple mass-scaling relations indicate the viscous timescale for the AGNs with mass of \sim 10^{6-8}M_{\odot} would be \sim 10^{4-6} years. However, the timescale would reduce as the accretion disk of AGN is radiation pressure-driven, as opposed to the gas pressure-driven accretion disk in BHXBs (Noda & Done, 2018). The inclusion of magnetic field would further decrease the timescale (Feng et al., 2021b). Additionally, various instability mechanisms are suggested to explain the timescale of the CS transitions (e.g., Sheng et al., 2017; Sniegowska et al., 2020; Scepi et al., 2021). Some CSAGNs are associated with external perturbation, such as TDE. In CS quasar SDSS J0159+0033, TDE is believed to cause the CS transition (Merloni et al., 2015). In the local universe, the CS transition in 1ES 1927+654 is also found to be caused by TDE (Trakhtenbrot et al., 2019; Ricci et al., 2020). The CL event in narrow line Seyfert galaxy SDSS J015804.75–005221.8 can also be associated with the TDE (Petrushevska et al., 2023). In a sample of CLAGN with Swift-BAT light curves, Temple et al. (2023b) found that a majority of CLAGN showed clear changes in their 14-195 keV X-ray flux at the same time as the change in optical type. This suggests that the majority of CL events in local AGN are not due to changes in obscuration but must instead be driven by changes in the accretion state. However, detailed spectral modeling across the full X-ray energy range is needed to confirm this suggestion, which is one aim of this work. In this paper, we investigate how the optically identified CL transitions depend on several AGN parameters, such as accretion rate (in terms of \lambda_{\rm Edd} ), obscuration (in terms of N_{\rm H}), and black hole mass. Additionally, we provide constraints on the timescale of the CL transitions with long-term observations. For this purpose, we study a sample of 20 optically-identified CLAGNs using the archival quasi-simultaneous optical and X-ray observations taken in the last \sim 40 years. In Section 2, we present our sample and measurements. In Section 3, we present the result of our analysis. In Section 4, we discuss our findings. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize our results. Throughout the paper, we used \LambdaCDM cosmology, with the H_{0} = 70 km s-1 Mpc-1, \Omega_{\rm M} = 0.3, \Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.7. Figure 2: Median Eddington ratio in each spectral state. The blue circles represent the median for \lambda_{\rm Edd} for CLAGNs. The orange diamonds represent the median of \lambda_{\rm Edd} for the other AGNs from BASS sample for which CL transitions were not detected."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08627v1,GA-NIFS: Dissecting the multiple sub-structures and probing their complex interactions in the  emitter galaxy CR7 at z = 6.6 with JWST/NIRSpec,"We present JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopic (IFS) observations of the Ly\textalpha emitter CR7 at z \sim 6.6, observed as part of the GA-NIFS program. Using low-resolution PRISM (R \sim 100) data, we confirm a bright Ly\textalpha emitter, and a diffuse Ly\textalpha halo extending up to 3 kpc from the peak of ionized emission, both of them associated to the most massive, UV bright galaxy in the system (CR7-A). We confirm the presence of two additional UV-bright satellites (CR7-B and CR7-C) detected at projected distances of 6.4 and 5.2 kpc from the primary source. We perform SED fitting of the low-resolution data and revealed an inverted star formation history between two satellites at early epochs and a spatially resolved anti-correlation of the gas-phase metallicity and the star formation rate density, likely driven by the gas exchange among the satellites, favouring the merger scenario for CR7. From the high-resolution G395H (R \sim 2700) data, we discover at least three additional companions mainly traced by the [O iii]\textlambda5007 emission line, although they are not detected in continuum. We disentangle the kinematics of the system and reveal extended ionised emission linking the main galaxy and the satellites. We spatially resolve the [O iii]\textlambda5007, [O iii]4363, and H\textgamma emission lines and use a diagnostic diagram tailored to high-z systems to reveal tentative evidence of AGN ionisation across the main galaxy (CR7-A) and the N-E companion (CR7-B). Moreover, we detect an unresolved blue-shifted outflow from one of the satellites and present first evidence for a redshifted outflow from the main galaxy. Finally, we compute resolved electron temperature (T{}_{e}\sim 1.6\times 10^{4} K) and metallicity maps (log(Z/\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}) from –0.8 to –0.5), and provide insights on how the physical properties of the system evolved at earlier epochs.","The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has established a new era for observational astronomy, revolutionizing our understanding of galaxy properties and assembly processes in the early Universe (redshift z \geq 5.5, t \leq 1 Gyr). Recent observations of galaxies at the epoch of reionization revealed for the first time their stellar population and age, providing key insights into the star-formation process and star-formation history (SFH) in pristine environments (Whitler et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Endsley et al., 2023; Santini et al., 2023; Treu et al., 2023; Topping et al., 2024; Weibel et al., 2024). The combination of JWST’s unmatched sensitivity and spectral coverage allow us to trace for the first time the rest-optical emission of galaxies at z>4, resolving the internal structure of primordial star forming systems. Moreover, the superb sensitivity of JWST NIRSpec (Jakobsen et al., 2022) in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range allow us to investigate the distribution of the ionised gas in primordial galaxies, providing new insights into the interstellar medium (ISM) properties at high-redshift, such as the electron density and gas-phase metallicity (Taylor et al., 2022; Schaerer et al., 2022; Rhoads et al., 2023; Isobe et al., 2023; Curti et al., 2023, 2024; Abdurro’uf et al., 2024; Sarkar et al., 2024; Marconcini et al., 2024, Cresci et al. in prep). Simulations and theoretical models predict that powerful sources of ionizing photons are crucial to define the physical conditions during the reionization era (z \sim 6-10), i.e. when most hydrogen in the Universe transitioned from the neutral to the ionized phase, driven by energetic UV photons (Lyman continuum or LyC photons, with wavelengths shorter than 912 Å) (Partridge & Peebles, 1967; Ciardi et al., 2003; Fan et al., 2006; Stark, 2016; Ma et al., 2020; Maji et al., 2022). Due to the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) it is challenging to directly trace LyC photons at high redshift, and thus a valid alternative is to study Ly\textalpha emitter (LAE) galaxies, as their properties are fundamental to shed light on the reionisation of intergalactic hydrogen (Blanc et al., 2011; Robertson et al., 2013; Dijkstra et al., 2016; Goovaerts et al., 2024). In particular, the escape fraction of Ly\textalpha photons is observed to correlate with the escape fraction of the energetic LyC photons (Dijkstra et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2022; Izotov et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2024), thus making LAEs the optimal candidates to comprehend the process of cosmic reionisation. Recent JWST observations played a major role in investigating the physical properties of LAEs during the epoch of reionization, providing stringent constraints on the ionising photon production, the gas-phase metallicity, and the fraction of escaping Ly\textalpha photons (Tang et al., 2023; Bunker et al., 2023; Jones et al., 2024; Kumari et al., 2024; Saxena et al., 2024; Muñoz et al., 2024). The goal of this paper is to study the gas and stellar population properties in the merger system of CR7 (COSMOS Redshift 7; z = 6.60425). This source was first identified by Matthee et al. (2015) using Suprime-Cam on the Subaru telescope to inspect a region of the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field and detect bright Ly\textalpha emitters in the reionization era. Sobral et al. (2015) performed follow-up spectroscopic observations with X-shooter, SINFONI, and FORS2 at the VLT and DEIMOS at Keck and confirmed CR7 as one of the most luminous Ly\textalpha emitters at z \geq6 (L{}_{\rm\text{Ly\textalpha}} \sim 1044 erg s-1). Moreover, Sobral et al. (2015) disfavoured the presence of an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) or Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, as they only detected a narrow He ii\textlambda1640 emission line and no metal lines in their X-shooter spectrum covering wavelengths from the UV to the NIR. Instead, they proposed a combination of a PopIII-like stellar population (10^{7} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}) and an older metal-enriched stellar population (10^{10} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}, 0.2 \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}) to explain the mass of the system. Visbal et al. (2016) further investigated this scenario exploring the formation of a massive PopIII cluster through photoionization feedback. They concluded that pristine gas collapsing into the host halo could potentially explain such high PopIII stellar masses in CR7 as a result of a massive PopIII starburst. On the other hand, Bowler et al. (2017) used Spitzer photometry in IRAC ch1 and ch2 to provide observational constraints on the [O iii]\textlambda5007 line strengths, discarding the presence of PopIII stars in favour of a narrow-line, low-mass AGN or a young, metal-poor starburst. Further Ly\textalpha focused works discussed the possibility that the Ly\textalpha luminosity in CR7 might be explained by a Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH) accreting pristine gas (Pallottini et al., 2015; Sobral et al., 2015; Dijkstra et al., 2016; Hartwig et al., 2016; Agarwal et al., 2016, 2017). In particular, Pacucci et al. (2017) performed radiation-hydrodynamic simulations and found that a 7 \times 10{}^{6}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}} BH accreting metal-free or low-metallicity gas (5 \times 10-3 \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}) is consistent with the DCBH hypothesis and could explain the IR photometry of CR7. Matthee et al. (2017b) constrained the rest-frame IR continuum of CR7 with band 6 ALMA observations showing the presence of at least four [C ii]\textlambda158µm satellites, compared to the three observed in the UV (Matthee et al., 2015). They showed that the two brightest satellites are observed in both [C ii]\textlambda158µm and UV emission, then other smaller satellites detected only in [C ii]\textlambda158µm emission are observed in the surrounding of the two least massive companions. In this work the three main UV-bright companions are labelled as CR7-A, CR7-B, and CR7-C, following the nomenclature of previous works and as shown in Fig. 1. From the dynamical mass measurements, Matthee et al. (2017b) found Mdyn(CR7-A) = 3.9 \pm 1.7 \times 1010 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}, and estimated CR7-A to be the most massive and therefore main or central galaxy of the halo, with indications of a potential ongoing major merger with CR7-C. They used the ALMA observations to constrain the star-formation rate (SFR) in each component, and found values of 28, 5, 7 \mathrm{M_{\odot}} yr-1, for CR7-A, CR7-B, and CR7-C, respectively. Overall, Matthee et al. (2017b) found gas metallicities for CR7-A of Z \sim 0.1 - 0.2 \mathrm{Z_{\odot}} (i.e., 12 + log(O/H) \sim 7.7 - 8.0), which is entirely inconsistent with the PopIII-like stellar population scenario. Similarly, Dors et al. (2018) found Z \sim 0.1 - 0.5 \mathrm{Z_{\odot}} fitting UV emission lines with photoionisation models. Finally, Sobral et al. (2019) re-analysed SINFONI data and provided a new, lower, \sim 2 \sigma detection of the He ii\textlambda1640 emission line. They concluded that all three of CR7-A, B and C are consistent with a young starbursts scenario and a low gas-phase metallicity, in agreement with previous works (Matthee et al., 2017b; Dors et al., 2018). Moreover, they argue that based on current data availability there is no evidence for the presence of an AGN in any of the satellites of the system, with only a tentative evidence for CR7-C to have a higher ionization parameter and to potentially host an AGN. This scenario is supported by the comparison of UV emission lines with photoionisation models, which tend to attribute a non-thermal nature to the central source of CR7-C, and thus pointing towards the AGN scenario (Dors et al., 2018). Matthee et al. (2020) analysed spatially resolved Ly\textalpha observations with VLT/MUSE and reported a total Ly\textalpha luminosity fainter by a factor of 1.5 with respect to previous works (Sobral et al., 2015). They observed a \sim1 kpc offset between the Ly\textalpha and UV peak over CR7-A, with the former being elongated towards CR7-B. Moreover, they explained the observed Ly\textalpha equivalent width (EW) with a metal-poor starburst only, without the need to include high-ionisation sources. Finally, by spatially resolving the Ly\textalpha morphology they confirmed that the main contribution to the total emission originates from CR7-A, and the elongated nature of the Ly\textalpha halo might indicate the presence of multiple star-forming regions, consistent with the presence of three UV clumps, and possibly multiple sub-clumps (e.g. Matthee et al., 2017b). While this system has been extensively studied with both ground- and space-based instruments targeting the rest-UV and FIR bands, JWST/NIRSpec is the first instrument capable of measuring the rest-frame optical spectrum of this intriguing source, to shed light on its nature and provide insights on galaxy assembly processes via mergers at high redshift. Figure 1: JWST NIRSpec images from collapsed [O iii]\textlambda5007 emission in the high-resolution G395H (top) and low-resolution prism (bottom) data cubes. Sub-cubes with the selected and labelled clumps are shown on the right. The yellow circle is the fiducial PSF of \sim 0.15 ′′. Black contours represent the selected regions for the integrated analysis of the three main satellites described in Sec. 3.2. North is up and East to the left. In this work, we present spatially resolved high resolution (R \sim 2700) and low resolution (R \sim 100) NIRSpec/IFS observations of CR7, providing, for the first time, spatially resolved rest-frame optical spectroscopy of this intriguing system. This paper is organised as follows. In Sec. 2 we present the NIRSpec observations, together with the data reduction. In Sec. 3 we discuss the emission line analysis of the G395H and prism data cubes, the emission line fitting method and the following results via line ratio analysis and spatially resolved kinematics. Then, in Sec. 4 we discuss the implications of our results in the broad context of galaxy assembly processes. Finally, in Sec. 5 we summarize the main results, comparing our findings with previous works. In this paper, we assume the Planck Collaboration et al. (2020) cosmology, i.e. a flat \LambdaCDM cosmology with H0= 67.4 km s-1 Mpc-1, \Omega_{\mathrm{m}} = 0.315, and \Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.685."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08485v1,"The circumgalactic medium traced by Mg  absorption with DESI: dependence on galaxy stellar mass, star formation rate and azimuthal angle","Understanding the circumgalactic medium (CGM) distribution of galaxies is the key to revealing the dynamical exchange of materials between galaxies and their surroundings. In this work, we use DESI EDR dataset to investigate the cool CGM of galaxies (0.3<z<1.7) with stacking the spectra of background QSOs to obtain Mg ii absorption of foreground galaxies. The equivalent width of Mg ii absorption strongly correlates to stellar mass with EW(Mg ii) \propto M_{*}^{0.5} for star-forming galaxies with \log M_{*}/M_{\odot}<10, but is independent with mass for galaxies above this mass. At given stellar mass, EW(Mg ii) is larger for galaxies of higher star formation rate with impact parameter less than 50 kpc, while showing little dependence on galaxy size. By studying the dependence on azimuthal angle, we find EW(Mg ii) is strongest at the direction near the minor axis for star-forming galaxies with \log M_{*}/M_{\odot}<10.0, while no dependence on azimuthal angle is seen for luminous red galaxies. This indicates that the outflow associated with star formation enhances the Mg ii absorption. However, for galaxies with \log M_{*}/M_{\odot}>10.0, the EW(Mg ii) at the minor axis is largely suppressed with respect to low mass galaxies. This suggests that the competing processes, such as stellar feedback and gravity, play a key role in shaping the distribution of outflowing gas.","The circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding galaxies plays a crucial role in driving the formation and evolution of galaxies (e.g. Tumlinson et al., 2017; Péroux et al., 2020). In recent years, simulations and observations of this component of galaxies are going on like wildfire (e.g. Nelson et al., 2020, 2023; Lim et al., 2021; DeFelippis et al., 2024). High-resolution “zoom-in” simulations of Eris2 have demonstrated that galaxies can produce large-scale galactic outflows, which is crucial for generating realistic dwarf galaxies and large late-type spiral galaxies (Governato et al., 2010; Guedes et al., 2011). Shen et al. (2013) found that about one-third of all the gas within R_{\rm vir} is outflowing and inflows bring in material along optically thick “cold” streams in their simulation of z\sim 3 massive galaxies. More recently, there are increasing evidences in simulations that the inflowing gas is almost co-planar and more or less co-rotating with the gas disk (e.g. Danovich et al., 2015; Stewart et al., 2017; Péroux et al., 2020; Trapp et al., 2021; Hafen et al., 2022; Gurvich et al., 2022; Faucher-Giguère & Oh, 2023), while the outflowing gas driven by stellar feedback is preferentially along the direction that is perpendicular to the disk (Nelson et al., 2019; Péroux et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Weng et al., 2024). Observationally, the technique of absorption line spectroscopy is a powerful tool to extract the properties of CGM. By observing the spectra of distant quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), we can detect absorption features within the CGM of these foreground galaxies, thereby obtaining valuable information about the surrounding galactic environment. By stacking the spectra of background QSO at the redshift of foreground galaxies, Zhu & Ménard (2013a) studied the Ca ii H and K line absorption of galaxies at z\sim 0.1, and discovered that bipolar outflows induced by star formation must have played a significant role in producing Ca ii in galaxy halos. Liang & Chen (2014) found differential covering fraction between low- and high-ionization gas based on observations of \textLy\alpha, C ii, C IV, Si ii, Si iii, and Si iv absorption transitions. More recently, Zou et al. (2024a) detected nine high-redshift (z>6) absorbers in quasar spectra, including O i, Mg ii, C ii, C iv, Si ii and Fe ii , and found that the absorbing gas with a higher [\alpha/Fe] is possibly associated with a less overdense region. Among all the detected metal lines, the most extensively examined is the \rm{Mg\,\textsc{ii}}\thinspace\lambda\lambda 2796,2803 doublet. Bergeron & Stasinska (1986) first discovered the Mg ii doublet absorption lines in a pair of galaxies, and claimed that this metal absorber is a crucial indicator of enriched cold gas. The Mg ii absorption originally arises from photo-ionized gas with temperatures of approximately T\sim 10{}^{4}K (Bergeron & Stasinska, 1986; Charlton et al., 2003) at the neutral Hydrogen column densities ranging from {\rm N(H\,\textsc{i})}\approx 1016 – 1022 cm-2 (Churchill et al., 2000; Rao et al., 2006). Mg ii absorption is ubiquitously detected in the gaseous halo in and round galaxies. This absorption line provides a unique opportunity for us to study the properties of gaseous environment surrounding galaxies, such as gas density, temperature, flow velocity, and chemical composition within the CGM. By associating the Mg ii absorption systems with the locations of galaxies, Dutta et al. (2020) obtained the absorption strength of the CGM of galaxies at different impact parameters111The impact parameter is defined as the projected distance between the absorber to the galaxy at the galaxy redshift. (R), and found a trend of stronger Mg ii absorption being associated with more massive galaxies, and to a lesser extent, with higher star forming galaxies. Anand et al. (2021) calculated the excess surface density of Mg ii absorption systems around galaxies of different types and found there is a weak evolution of EW(Mg ii) with galaxy redshift and emission line galaxies (ELGs) have 2–4 times higher covering fractions than luminous red galaxies (LRGs) within R\thinspace[\rm{kpc}]<50. Using strong intervening absorption systems in the near-IR spectra of 31 luminous quasars, Zou et al. (2021) found the line density of strong Mg ii absorbers decrease toward higher redshifts at z>3. Using deep JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy of quasar J0100+2802, Bordoloi et al. (2024) discovered the Mg ii radial absorption profile falls off sharply with radius, extending out to 2–3 R_{200} of the host galaxies. However, the study of individual absorbers usually requires high signal-to-noise spectra and strong absorption features (e.g. Chen et al., 2017; Zou et al., 2021; Davies et al., 2023; Napolitano et al., 2023; Bordoloi et al., 2024; Sebastian et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2024b), which may be biased to trace dense and metal-rich gas in CGM. This therefore calls for the spectra stacking technique to obtain the mean or median absorption features of CGM gas at given impact parameters. By stacking the SDSS spectra, Ménard et al. (2011) showed that Mg ii absorbers trace a substantial fraction of the [O ii] luminosity density in the host galaxy (also see Joshi et al., 2017). By using co-added spectra of more than 5000 background galaxies from zCOSMOS Redshift Survey (Lilly et al., 2007), Bordoloi et al. (2011) found a clear correlation between Mg ii absorption line strength and the host galaxy stellar mass for the blue galaxies. Later Bordoloi et al. (2014b) found that the blue galaxies are associated with a much stronger outflowing component as compared to the red galaxies in terms of their rest frame equivalent widths (also see Lan & Mo, 2018). In this paper, we aim at revisiting the Mg ii absorption features in the CGM of foreground galaxies from the background QSOs, using the largest on-going spectroscopy survey, Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI; DESI collaboration et al., 2016a, b). DESI aims at mapping the nature of dark energy with spectroscopic measurements of 40 million galaxies and quasars. Compared to other notable large programs such as MUSE Analysis of Gas around Galaxies (MAGG; Lofthouse et al. (2020); Dutta et al. (2020); Fossati et al. (2021)), MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MAGAFLOW; Schroetter et al. (2016); Zabl et al. (2019); Schroetter et al. (2019); Zabl et al. (2020)), The Mg ii Absorber–Galaxy Catalog (MAGIICAT; Nielsen et al. (2013b, a); Churchill et al. (2013); Nielsen et al. (2016)), and MUSE-ALMA Haloes Survey (Hamanowicz et al., 2020; Szakacs et al., 2021; Péroux et al., 2022), DESI has unique advantages in terms of the volume of data that will be released in the future. The DESI Early Data Release has released 437,664 ELGs, 227,318 LRGs, and 76,079 QSOs. These large mount spectra enable us to explore the Mg ii absorption with stacking technique to unprecedented details. As the first paper of this series, we mainly investigate the dependence of the EW(Mg ii) on a set of parameters, such as stellar mass (M_{*}), star formation rate (SFR), half-light radius (R_{\rm e}) and inclination of host galaxies. We also investigate EW(Mg ii) at different impact parameters (R) as well as different azimuthal angles from the host galaxies. This paper is structured as follows. We introduce the DESI survey, the galaxy sample of DESI EDR, and the spectral stacking technique in Section 2. In Section 3.1, we focus on discussing the impact of stellar mass on the EW(Mg ii) for ELGs and the variation of EW(Mg ii) with impact parameter. In Section 3.2, we examine the evolution of Mg ii absorption strength, with controlling stellar mass of galaxies. We also investigate the influence of SFR and effective radius on the EW(Mg ii), as well as the angular distribution in the CGM, in Section 3.3 and 3.4. In Section 4, we discuss the covering fraction of Mg ii in galaxies and the mass integral of H i in CGM. Finally, we summarize our results in Section 5. We adopt a flat \LambdaCDM cosmology with h=0.677, \Omega_{\rm M}=0.309 and \Omega_{\rm Lambda}=0.691 using the Planck15 package (Planck Collaboration et al., 2016)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08255v1,Emergence of the Galaxy Morphology-Star Formation Activity-Clustercentric Radius Relations in Galaxy Clusters,"We investigate when and how the relations of galaxy morphology and star forming activity with clustercentric radius become evident in galaxy clusters. We identify 162 galaxy clusters with total mass \mathinner{M_{\rm tot}^{\rm cl}}>5\times 10^{13}\mathinner{{\rm M}_{\odot}} at z=0.625 in the Horizon Run 5 (HR5) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and study how the properties of the galaxies with stellar mass \mathinner{M_{\ast}}>5\times 10^{9}\mathinner{{\rm M}_{\odot}} near the cluster main progenitors have evolved in the past. Galaxies are classified into disk, spheroid, and irregular morphological types according to the asymmetry and Sérsic index of their stellar mass distribution. We also classify galaxies into active and passive ones depending on their specific star-formation rate. We find that the morphology-clustercentric radius relation (MRR) emerges at z\simeq 1.8 as the fraction of spheroidal types exceeds 50% in the central region (d\lesssim 0.1\mathinner{R_{200}}). Galaxies outside the central region remain disk-dominated. Numerous encounters between galaxies in the central region seem to be responsible for the morphology transformation from disks to spheroids. We also find that the star formation activity-clustercentric radius relation emerges at an epoch different from that of MRR. At z\simeq 0.8, passive galaxies start to dominate the intermediate radius region (0.1\lesssim d/\mathinner{R_{200}}\lesssim 0.3) and this “quenching region” grows inward and outward thereafter. The region dominated by early-type galaxies (spheroids and passive disks) first appears at the central region at z\simeq 1.8, expands rapidly to larger radii as the population of passive disks grows in the intermediate radii, and clusters are dominated by early types after z\simeq 0.8.","Galaxies in the nearby universe exhibit tremendous diversity in their structure and star formation properties. The necessity for a systematic study of galaxy populations has led astronomers to classify galaxies into various morphological classes (Hubble, 1926; de Vaucouleurs, 1959; Sandage, 1975). The low-redshift galaxy population can be divided into spheroidal ellipticals, disky lenticulars (S0s), spirals, and irregulars. The elliptical and S0 galaxies are often grouped together and called early-type galaxies (ETGs), while spirals and irregulars are combined into late-type galaxies (LTGs) (Park & Choi, 2005). Despite our extensive knowledge of the detailed structural and star formation properties of these different morphological classes, we do not fully understand the origin of their diversity. Recent studies of galaxy morphology from observations and simulations have shown that the vast majority of the low-mass (M_{*}<10^{10}M_{\odot}) galaxies at high redshifts (z\geq 2) are dominated by disks, with only minor contributions from spheroids and irregulars (Park et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2024). This result, when juxtaposed with the fact that the majority of massive low-redshift galaxies are early types (Kelvin et al., 2014), points to the morphological transformation of high-redshift galaxies with cosmic time. Understanding the underlying factors that govern this morphological evolution of galaxies is an active area of research. One crucial factor that has been argued to impact morphology is the surrounding environment of galaxies. Observations have revealed that early-type galaxies are more abundant in galaxy clusters than in the field environment. Dressler (1980) found that the fraction of ETGs increased smoothly as one moved from low to high locally dense regions or radially toward the cluster center. These connections are known as the morphology-density relation (MDR) and morphology-radius relation (MRR), respectively. The MDR was later generalized to group and field environments (Goto et al., 2003) and was observed to be in place up to redshift z\sim 1 (Smith et al., 2005; Hwang & Park, 2009). The validity of MDR in galaxy clusters and also in the field environment, however, has been questioned in several works. Research on low-to-intermediate redshift galaxy clusters has shown that the clustercentric distance, often normalized by a characteristic cluster radius, is a more important factor related to morphological fractions than the local environmental density (Whitmore et al., 1993; Treu et al., 2003; Park & Hwang, 2009; Fasano et al., 2015). The idea that MDR is a fundamental relation extending from field to group to cluster environments has also been scrutinized. Several studies (e.g., Park et al., 2007, 2008; Park & Choi, 2009) investigated the dependence of various galaxy properties, including morphology, on small- and large-scale environments at fixed galaxy absolute magnitude or mass. They found that the environmental effects on the galaxy morphology are best described by two dominant factors: the distance to the nearest neighbor (d_{\rm nei}) and its morphology, rather than the local galaxy number density smoothed over a 3 to 8\mathinner{h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}} scale (Park et al., 2007). When the nearest neighbor environment is fixed, galaxy morphology does not vary with the local density. Moving into galaxy clusters, they found that, at fixed mass, the morphology of a cluster galaxy is mainly determined by the clustercentric radius. Only when d_{\rm nei} is very small (d_{\rm nei}/R_{\rm vir,nei}\lesssim 0.1, where R_{\rm vir,nei} is the neighbor’s virial radius), galaxy morphology is determined by d_{\rm nei} and its neighbor’s morphology (Park & Hwang, 2009). According to this study, the MDR is an apparent phenomenon arising from the statistical correlation of the local density with galaxy mass and the nearest neighbor environment. Despite its importance over MDR, the study of MRR and its redshift evolution has received less attention. Observations show that MRR is well-established at low redshift, slightly stronger in relaxed clusters than in irregular/clumpy clusters (Dressler et al., 1997; Fasano et al., 2015). The major population of ETGs also seems to be in place at redshift z\sim 1 and shows weak evolution over cosmic time with most of the evolution happening only in the outskirts (Huertas-Company et al., 2009). Due to the limited high-redshift observations of MRR and the lack of related attention in simulations, our understanding of the origin and evolution of MRR remains quite limited. It must be noted that a complete understanding of MRR in clusters requires understanding not only the evolution of galaxy structure but also the star formation activity therein. For example, the lenticulars, the main constituent of the cluster population, are structurally similar to spirals (e.g., Barway et al., 2009; Laurikainen et al., 2010; Mishra et al., 2019), but are labelled as ETGs because of their red color or passive star-formation activity. Therefore, the radial distribution of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of cluster galaxies should be explored together with the MRR. The study of the star formation activity-clustercentric radius relation (ARR) of galaxies is interesting in its own right. For low redshift clusters, it is known that cluster members have lower SFR compared to field galaxies. However, the epoch of cosmic time at which such a difference in star formation properties between cluster and field galaxies arises is a topic of active debate. Several studies find the sSFR of cluster galaxies to be largely consistent with that of field galaxies (e.g., Brodwin et al., 2013; Alberts et al., 2016; Trudeau et al., 2024) at z\gtrsim 1.5, while a few others (e.g., Cooke et al., 2019; Strazzullo et al., 2019) claim significant differences in sSFR between the two populations at this redshift. From these aforementioned findings, it is crucial to factor out star formation activities in the morphological classification to fully understand the MRR of clusters. For the purpose of this study, we adopt a convention in which we define galaxy morphology purely based on galaxy structure and classify galaxies into spheroids, disks, and irregulars. However, we also use a combination of galaxy structural parameters and star formation rate to classify galaxies into early or late types. In this work, we explore the emergence of the galaxy morphology-star formation activity-clustercentric radius relation using the Horizon Run 5 (Lee et al., 2021) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. Because of its large volume and high resolution, the Horizon Run 5 simulation has been successful in accurately predicting high-redshift galaxy morphology (Park et al., 2022), which has been verified using the data from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations (Lee et al., 2024). This makes Horizon Run 5 an ideal simulation to study the morphological evolution of galaxies in and around clusters as a function of cosmic time. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the mock galaxy samples from the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamic simulation and how we assign the morphology and star formation activity types to our galaxy samples. We then show how various physical parameters of cluster galaxies evolve in various environments in Section 3. Finally, we summarize our results in Section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08193v1,Revisiting rotationally excited CH at radio wavelengths: A case study towards W51,"Context. Ever since they were first detected in the interstellar medium, the radio wavelength (3.3 GHz) hyperfine-structure splitting transitions in the rotational ground state of CH have been observed to show anomalous excitation. Astonishingly, this behaviour has been uniformly observed towards a variety of different sources probing a wide range of physical conditions. While the observed level inversion can be explained globally by a pumping scheme involving collisions, a description of the extent of ‘over-excitation’ observed in individual sources requires the inclusion of radiative processes, involving transitions at higher rotational levels. Therefore, a complete description of the excitation mechanism in the CH ground state, observed towards individual sources entails observational constraints from the rotationally excited levels of CH and in particular that of its first rotationally excited state ({}^{2}\Pi_{3/2},N=1,J=3/2).Aims. Given the limited detections of these lines, the objective of this work is to characterise the physical and excitation properties of the rotationally excited lines of CH between the \Lambda-doublet levels of its {}^{2}\Pi_{3/2},N=1,J=3/2 state near 700 MHz, and investigate their influence on the pumping mechanisms of the ground-state lines of CH.Methods. This work presents the first interferometric search for the rotationally excited lines of CH between the \Lambda-doublet levels of its {}^{2}\Pi_{3/2},N=1,J=3/2 state near 700 MHz carried out using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) array towards six star-forming regions, W51 E, Sgr B2 (M), M8, M17, W43 and DR21 Main.Results. We detect the two main hyperfine structure lines within the first rotationally excited state of CH, in absorption towards W51 E. To jointly model the physical and excitation conditions traced by lines from both the ground and first rotationally excited states of CH, we performed non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) radiative transfer calculations using the code MOLPOP-CEP. These models account for the effects of line overlap and are aided by column density constraints from the far-infrared (FIR) wavelength rotational transitions of CH that connect to the ground state and use collisional rate coefficients for collisions of CH with H, H2 and electrons (the latter are computed in this work using cross-sections estimated within the Born approximation).Conclusions. The non-LTE analysis revealed that physical properties typical of diffuse and translucent clouds best reproduce the higher rates of level inversion seen in the ground-state lines at 3.3 GHz, observed at velocities near 66 km s-1 along the sightline towards W51 E. In contrast, the excited lines near 700 MHz were only excited in much denser environments with {n_{\rm H}\sim 10^{5}}\leavevmode\nobreak\ cm-3 towards which the anomalous excitation in two of the three ground state lines is quenched, but not in the 3.264 GHz line. This is in alignment with our observations and suggests that while FIR pumping and line overlap effects are essential for exciting and producing line inversion in the ground state, excitation to the first rotational level is dominated by collisional excitation from the ground state. For the rotationally excited state of CH, the models indicate low excitation temperatures and column densities of 2\times 10^{14}\leavevmode\nobreak\ cm-2. Furthermore, modelling these lines helps us understand the complexities of the spectral features observed in the 532/536 GHz rotational transitions of CH. These transitions, connecting sub-levels of the first rotationally excited state to the ground state, play a crucial role in trapping FIR radiation and enhancing the degree of inversion seen in the ground state lines. Based on the physical conditions constrained, we predict the potential of detecting hyperfine-splitting transitions arising from higher rotationally excited transitions of CH in the context of their current non-detections.","First identified by Swings & Rosenfeld (1937), via one of the transitions between its A{}^{2}\Delta-X{}^{2}\Pi electronic states near 4300.2 Å in optical absorption spectra observed towards several early-type stars by Dunham (1937) (and later Adams, 1941), the methylidyne radical, CH, has the unique distinction of being the first molecule to be detected in the interstellar medium (ISM). An exciting new discovery, the presence of interstellar CH was soon corroborated by the subsequent identification of other CH lines near 3880 Å corresponding to its B{}^{2}\Sigma-X{}^{2}\Pi electronic transitions by McKellar (1940). The successful detection and identification of CH in the ISM motivated laboratory investigations of other unidentified absorption lines and led to the birth of molecular astrophysics. To date, CH has been observed across the electromagnetic spectrum from far-UV (Watson, 2001) to long radio wavelengths (Rydbeck et al., 1973; Turner & Zuckerman, 1974) and maintains an important role as a fundamental building block in gas-phase interstellar chemistry and as a diagnostic probe of diffuse and CO-dark molecular gas (Federman & Willson, 1982; Sheffer et al., 2008; Gerin et al., 2010; Weselak et al., 2010). The lines resulting from the hyperfine structure (HFS) splitting of the \Lambda-doublet levels of the rotational ground state of CH at 3.3 GHz (9 cm) have been of particular interest owing to the ease with which they can be observed in the midst of the microwave range. However, the interpretation of these observations proved challenging, since the line intensities of these lines were found to be inconsistent with predictions made under conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). In particular, these lines are almost always seen in emission, even along lines of sight towards bright background continuum sources: The observed deviations were interpreted as being caused by the amplification of radiation by stimulated emission (for example, Zuckerman & Turner, 1975; Rydbeck et al., 1976; Genzel et al., 1979). The anomalous excitation of these (weak) maser lines could in principle be qualitatively understood by assuming a pumping cycle that involves collisional excitation to rotational states (via collisions with atomic and molecular hydrogen), followed by radiative decay back to the ground state (Bertojo et al., 1976; Elitzur, 1977). However, the relative intensities of CH’s ground state HFS lines and in particular the dominance of its lowest frequency satellite line at 3.264 GHz was not well understood and this greatly limited the use of CH as a probe of molecular gas properties at radio wavelengths. Bujarrabal et al. (1984) demonstrated that, while the universal inversion observed in the 3.3 GHz CH lines is a consequence of parity discrimination induced by collisions, radiative processes have to be considered to explain the ‘over-excitation’ observed in the lowest frequency satellite line. Recently, by including the effects of pumping from the radiative trapping of photons caused by the overlap of lines from higher rotational states at far-infrared (FIR) wavelengths, Jacob et al. (2021b) (henceforth Paper I) were able to model enhancements in the intensities of the lower satellite line and further study the physical and excitation conditions traced. The non-LTE radiative transfer models carried out in Paper I were facilitated by the latest HFS resolved collisional rate coefficients for collisions with atomic and molecular hydrogen as well as helium, computed by Dagdigian (2018) and Marinakis et al. (2019), respectively. Furthermore, the column densities of CH in the models presented in Paper I were constrained using values determined from the high spectral resolution observations of the {}^{2}\Pi_{1/2},N,J=2,3/2\rightarrow 1,1/2 FIR rotational transition of CH near 2006 GHz ({\sim\!149\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mu}m), which share a common lower energy level with the HFS lines of the rotational ground state (see Fig. 1). The latter was observed using the upGREAT111German REciever for Astronomy at Terahertz frequencies. instrument (Risacher et al., 2016) on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA; Young et al., 2012) and was seen in widespread and typically optically thin absorption, which makes it a reliable tool for measuring column densities (Wiesemeyer et al., 2018; Jacob et al., 2019). Given their importance in exciting the ground state lines, it is imperative to observe transitions of CH arising from higher rotational levels to obtain a comprehensive picture of the excitation of CH in different astrophysical systems. Figure 1: Lowest rotational energy levels of CH, where the rotational transitions relevant to this work are labelled and marked using arrows. Note that the \Lambda-doublet and HFS splitting level separations are not drawn to scale and that the transitions labelled by dashed arrows are not observed. a.) The inset zooms in on the ground and first rotationally excited levels, to show the sub-mm transitions connecting the two levels and highlights the general pumping mechanism. b.) All allowed transitions and HFS levels for lines lying within and connecting the {}^{2}\Pi_{3/2},J=3/2 and {}^{2}\Pi_{1/2},J=1/2 states are marked and labelled, respectively, to illustrate the effect of line overlap as referenced in the text. c.) Same as b.) but for the {}^{2}\Pi_{1/2},J=3/2 and {}^{2}\Pi_{1/2},J=1/2 states. As discussed above, the observed enhancements in the intensity of the lowest frequency HFS satellite line of the CH ground state is primarily due to line overlap effects from higher rotational states. The rotational ground state of CH is radiatively connected to only two rotationally excited states namely, the {{}^{2}\Pi_{3/2},N=1,J=3/2}, and {{}^{2}\Pi_{1/2},N=2,J=3/2} (see transitions highlighted in Fig. 1). The {{}^{2}\Pi_{3/2},N=1,J=3/2} level corresponds to the first rotationally excited level lying at an upper-level energy of only 25.7 K above the ground state. This transition is particularly important, given that its energy is low enough to selectively affect the relative populations of the ground state \Lambda-doublet levels (Rydbeck et al., 1973). The HFS lines of the {N,J=1,3/2\rightarrow 1,1/2} transition near 532/536 GHz (560 \mum) connect the rotational ground state to the first excited state (lying at 25.7 K) and the corresponding spectra were observed using the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI) on board the Herschel Space Observatory (Gerin et al., 2010). In addition to the 532/536 GHz rotational lines of CH, HFS transitions between the \Lambda-doublet levels of the lowest rotationally excited state, {}^{2}\Pi_{3/2},N=1,J=3/2, near 700 MHz (42 cm) were first successfully detected by Ziurys & Turner (1985). They observed the two main HFS transitions (F=2^{-}\rightarrow 2^{+} and F=1^{-}\rightarrow 1^{+}) towards the star-forming region W51 A using the Arecibo 305 m telescope. While focusing on the detection towards the W51 system, Ziurys & Turner (1985) also mentioned the detection of the same transitions towards three other Galactic sight lines, namely, W3, W43 and Orion B, but do not provide details. Shortly thereafter Turner (1988) detected the two satellite lines (F=2^{-}\rightarrow 1^{+} and F=1^{-}\rightarrow 2^{+}) of the rotationally excited CH system towards W51 A, once again using the Arecibo 305 m telescope. Apart from contributing to our understanding of the masing action of the ground state HFS lines of CH, the detection of the 700 MHz transitions of CH can also serve as a potentially highly interesting probe of magnetic fields as they exhibit Zeeman splitting (Truppe et al., 2013, 2014). While there have been recent attempts to observe these lines (for example, Tremblay et al., 2020), observations of the low frequency HFS transitions corresponding to the N,J=1,3/2 \Lambda-doublet system are nowadays challenging due to man-made radio frequency interference (RFI). As a consequence, to date the only unambiguous detections of the 700 MHz lines of CH remain those made by Ziurys & Turner (1985) and Turner (1988). In addition, efforts to detect other rotationally excited lines of CH within the 4.8 GHz to 24 GHz range, such as those reported by Matthews et al. (1986) and more recently by Tan et al. (2020) towards Galactic sources have been unsuccessful. With the goal to further our understanding of the anomalous excitation of the ground state \Lambda-doublet HFS lines of CH, this work revisits the radical’s rotationally excited lines at 700 MHz. A combined analysis of the CH transitions within the ground state and first excited levels at radio wavelengths alongside the sub-millimetre (sub-mm)/FIR rotational lines of CH promises to help form a comprehensive picture of excitation mechanisms relevant for the ground state lines of this species. In Sect. 2 we recount in more detail the excitation mechanism of the CH ground state lines. Section 3 presents the interferometric observations of the HFS lines lying within the 700 MHz {}^{2}\Pi_{3/2},N,J=1,3/2 \Lambda-doublet level of CH carried out using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT; Gupta et al., 2017). The observational results are presented alongside a description of the non-LTE radiative transfer models used, in Section 4. The resultant physical and excitation conditions are discussed in Sect. 5, with the main conclusions of this work summarised in Sect. 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08155v1,The VANDELS Survey: Star formation and quenching in two over-densities at 3<z<4,"Context. Exploring galaxy evolution in dense environments, such as proto-clusters, is pivotal for understanding the mechanisms that drive star formation and the quenching of star formation.Aims. This study provides insights into how two over-densities could have impacted the physical properties, such as the star formation rate, stellar mass, morphology, and the evolution of their members, particularly members characterised by a quenching of star formation.Methods. We focus on the over-densities identified at 3<z<4 in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and in the Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) regions of the VIMOS (VIsible MultiObject Spectrograph) Ultra Deep Survey (VANDELS). Our methodology involves the analysis of the spectral energy distribution of the members of the over-densities and of the galaxies in the field. We relied on Bayesian analysis techniques BEAGLE and BAGPIPES to study the best-fit physical parameters and the rest-frame U-V and V-J colours (UVJ). This approach allowed us to separate quenched and star-forming galaxies based on the UVJ diagram and by estimating their specific star formation rate (sSFR). We used the TNG300 simulation to interpret our results.Results. We find that two out of 13 over-densities host quenched galaxies, with red rest-frame U-V colour and low sSFR. The physical properties of them are consistent with those of massive passive galaxies from the literature. The quenched members are redder, older, more massive, and show a more compact morphology than the other galaxy members. The two over-densities, with the highest-density peaks at z\simeq 3.55 and z\simeq 3.43, respectively, have dark matter halo masses consistent with being proto-clusters at z\sim 3 and they each host an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We found five AGNs in the structure at z\simeq 3.55 and three AGNs in the one at z\simeq 3.43. In comparison to quenched galaxies in the field, our massive quenched members show a higher local density environment. By using the IllustrisTNG simulation (TNG300), we find that proto-cluster structures with quenched galaxies at high redshift are likely to evolve into a structure with a higher fraction of passive galaxies by z=1.Conclusions. The two over-densities studied here host massive quenched galaxies in their highest-density peaks and AGNs. By following the evolution of the passive galaxies in the simulated proto-clusters at z=3 from the TNG300 simulation, we find that the median of their sSFRs was larger than 10-8 yr-1 at z=6 and the median mass growth rate was 96% from z=6 to z=3. In 20% of the simulated proto-clusters, the passive galaxy had already accreted 10-20% of the mass at z=6, with SFRs >100 M⊙ yr-1 at z=8. The conditions for this favorable mass assembly could be the galaxy interactions and the high gas accretion rate in the dense environment. As a consequence, the quenching of the star formation at z=3 could be driven by the black hole mass growth and AGN feedback. This scenario is consistent with the properties of the two quenched galaxies we find in our two over-densities at z\sim 3.","The investigation into how galaxies evolve within proto-clusters and dense cosmic structures has been a pivotal area of astrophysical research, elucidating key mechanisms of galaxy formation, interaction, and quenching processes (Gunn & Gott, 1972; Dressler et al., 1997; Balogh et al., 1999; Ebeling et al., 2001; Weinmann et al., 2006; Olsen et al., 2007; Wetzel et al., 2012; Menanteau et al., 2013; Wetzel et al., 2013). These studies have significantly advanced our understanding by highlighting the influence of environmental factors on galaxy morphology, star formation rates, and the role of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in shaping galaxy evolution across cosmic time. Galaxies are expected to experience early growth at an accelerated rate in over-densities (regions where the galaxy density is significantly higher than the average) at high redshift (e.g. Chiang et al., 2013), where the intensity of star formation is expected to surpass that of the field. Observations at z>2.5 have reported higher star formation (SF) in over-density galaxies compared to field galaxies (e.g. Lemaux et al., 2022 and Darvish et al., 2016). Some of the processes that may be driving this rapid star formation include galaxy interactions, mergers (Lotz et al., 2011), and gas accretion. The significance of cold gas accretion as a mechanism for star formation in early galaxies within over-densities has been highlighted by Dekel et al. (2009) and Kereš et al. (2005). Based on simulations, Chiang et al. (2017) showed that the contribution of the galaxies in over-densities to the cosmic star formation rate density rises from 20% at z=2 to 50% at z=10. This increase underscores the critical role of over-densities in the cosmic star formation history and is supported by other simulation works, such as those of Overzier et al. (2009) and Pillepich et al. (2018). These studies have further detailed the mechanisms by which over-densities contribute to the broader context of galaxy formation and evolution. In the Local Universe, galaxies in clusters have evolved and exist in a passive state, where star formation has been stopped by phenomena that could be related to the environment (Baldry et al., 2006; Boselli & Gavazzi, 2006; Peng et al., 2010). More evolved galaxies are typically redder and more massive, so we expect to find such galaxies with those physical properties more often in clusters than in the field. The mechanisms that drive the increase and quenching of star formation in galaxy clusters are diverse and complex. Galaxy interactions (e.g. Park & Hwang, 2009) play a significant role in both enhancing and quenching star formation. Starvation, a process that prevents the inflow of gas essential for star formation, can often be caused by intra-cluster gas heating (Shahidi et al., 2020; Feldmann & Mayer, 2015). Ram pressure stripping, where the gas is removed from galaxies as they move through the intra-cluster medium, further inhibits star formation by directly stripping away the galaxy’s gas reservoir (Gunn & Gott, 1972; Abadi et al., 1999). Galaxy mergers (e.g. Pontzen et al., 2016; Davies et al., 2022) can also play a significant role in galaxy evolution, often triggering star formation and structural transformations. Environmental interactions, such as tidal interactions and harassment (e.g. Tal et al., 2014), ram-pressure stripping of the gas (e.g. Peng & Renzini, 2020), and the quenching of star formation through starvation when the hot intra-cluster medium cuts off the gas supply to galaxies (e.g. Foltz et al., 2018; Mao et al., 2022), significantly affect galaxy properties. These processes can lead to the removal of gas, halt star formation, and transform the galaxy’s morphology, underscoring the complex interplay between galaxies and their surroundings. AGN feedback that is not necessarily related to environment is another important mechanism to consider. Such feedback is the result of AGNs releasing energy in the surrounding medium. A consequence of this is that the surrounding gas is heated, subsequently inhibiting cooling and star formation, and it is also expelled from the galaxy (Fabian, 2012; Schawinski et al., 2007). Other processes contributing to the quenching of star formation include gravitational heating (Johansson et al., 2009; Dekel & Birnboim, 2008), stellar feedback mechanisms (Hopkins et al., 2012; Collins & Read, 2022), and morphological changes within galaxies (Lu et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2018). Peng & Renzini (2020) introduced the concept of ’morphological quenching’, where the growth of a central bulge in a galaxy impedes star formation in the surrounding disk. These authors highlighted the role of halo quenching, where the heating of baryons in the circumgalactic medium occurs in halos above a certain mass threshold. Recent studies (e.g. Shi et al., 2021; McConachie et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2024) have found star-forming galaxies that are simultaneously evolved with quenched star formation at z>2. By studying these sources, we can investigate the processes that contribute to accelerate star formation and to its halt at their high redshifts. Proto-clusters, the precursors of local galaxy clusters (Chiang et al., 2013), are of particular interest in the study of the phenomena that can lead to accelerated episodes of SF and then its quenching. They provide a unique window into the early stages of large-scale structure assembly, evolution, and quenching of galaxies in them. By examining these proto-clusters, we can gain insight into the initial processes that lead to the formation of passive galaxy populations. In this work, we delve into the over-densities detected in Guaita et al. (2020) within the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS; Giacconi et al., 2002) and Ultra Deep Survey (UDS; Lawrence et al., 2007) at an epoch of 3<z<4. This epoch marks a critical phase in the early history of mass assembly in the universe. Our primary goal is to analyse the galaxies residing in these dense regions to unravel both the external and internal factors influencing their evolution. This investigation offers a look into the dynamics at play in the early stages of cosmic structure formation. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we present our data. In Sect. 3, we explain the process of estimating the colours and the selection criteria for passive galaxies, along with a comparison of passive galaxies in the literature. In Sect. 4, we show the scaling relations. In Sect. 5, we study the over-densities with passive galaxies in detail. Throughout this paper, we use an AB magnitude (Oke & Gunn, 1983) and we assume a cosmology with H_{0}=70\,\text{km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}, \Omega_{m}=0.3, and \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08124v1,The ALPINE-ALMA [CII] Survey: Modelling ALMA and JWST lines to constrain the interstellar medium of z\sim 5 galaxies,"Aims. In this work we devise a model for estimating ultraviolet (UV) and optical line emission (i.e. CIII] 1909\rm\text{\AA}, H\beta, [OIII] 5007\rm\text{\AA}, H\alpha, [NII] 6583\rm\text{\AA}) tracing HII regions in the interstellar medium (ISM) of a subset of galaxies at z\sim 4-6 from the ALMA Large Programme ALPINE. The aim is to investigate the combined impact of binary stars in the stellar population along with the presence of an abrupt quenching in the Star Formation History (SFH) on the line emission. This is crucial for understanding the ISM’s physical properties in the universe’s earliest galaxies and identifying new star formation tracers in high-z galaxies.Methods. The model simulates HII+Photodissociation Region (PDR) complexes by performing radiative transfer through 1D slabs characterised by gas density (n), ionisation parameter (U), and metallicity (Z). The model takes into account of: (a) the heating from star formation (SF), whose spectrum has been simulated with the Starburst99 and Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) to quantify the impact of binary stars; (b) a constant, exponentially declining, and quenched SFH. For each galaxy we select from our CLOUDY models the theoretical ratios between the [CII] line emission, tracing PDRs, and nebular lines from HII regions. These ratios have been then used to derive the expected optical/UV lines from the observed [CII].Results. We find that binary stars have a strong impact on the line emission after quenching, by keeping the UV photon flux higher for longer time. This is relevant in maintaining the free electron temperature and ionised column density in HII regions unaltered up to 5 Myr after quenching. Furthermore, we constrain the ISM properties of our subsample, finding a low ionisation parameter \log U{\approx}-3.8\pm 0.2, and moderate/high densities of \log(n/\rm cm^{-3}){\approx}2.9\pm 0.6. Finally, we derive UV/optical line luminosities-SFR relations (\log(L_{line}/\rm erg\,s^{-1})=\alpha\log(\rm SFR/M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1})+\beta) for different burstiness parameter (k_{s}) values. We find that in the fiducial BPASS model, the relations have negligible SFH dependence but significantly depend on the k_{s} value, while in the SB99 case, the dominant dependence is on the SFH. We propose their potential use for characterising the burstiness of galaxies at high-z.","The Epoch of Reionisation (EoR; redshift 6<z<30) is a fundamental era of the cosmic history during which the ionising photons produced by star formation (SF) in the first galaxies affected the ionisation state of the Universe (Dayal & Ferrara 2018; Robertson 2022, and reference therein). For this reason, shedding light on the SF process during the transition period immediately after the EoR and before the beginning of cosmic noon, when the bulk of the stellar mass of the Universe was formed, is of utmost interest. Star formation is shaped by the properties of the gas collapsing into stars (Tacconi et al. 2020), therefore constraining the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies at z\sim 4-6 is crucial. On the theoretical side, ISM models and simulations seem to agree that the prevailing physical conditions within galaxies at the end of the EoR were different from those in the local Universe (Vallini et al. 2015; Katz et al. 2017, 2022; Lagache et al. 2018; Pallottini et al. 2019, 2022; Arata et al. 2020; Lupi et al. 2020). In particular, zoom-in simulations and analytical models developed to interpret neutral gas tracers (e.g. Vallini et al. 2015; Lagache et al. 2018; Pallottini et al. 2022), ionised gas tracers (e.g. Moriwaki et al. 2018; Arata et al. 2020; Katz et al. 2022), and dust continuum emission (e.g. Behrens et al. 2018; Di Cesare et al. 2023) find high turbulence (e.g. Kohandel et al. 2020), strong radiation fields (e.g. Katz et al. 2022), high densities (e.g. Nakazato et al. 2023), and warm dust temperatures (e.g. Sommovigo et al. 2021; Vallini et al. 2021), to be common on sub-kpc scales in the ISM of star-forming high-z galaxies. These findings have to be tested against high-resolution observations. In the last ten years, the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimeter Array (ALMA) revolutionised the study of neutral and molecular gas phases in high-z sources, by opening a window on the (rest frame) far-infrared (FIR) lines (Carilli & Walter 2013). The {}^{2}P_{3/2}\rightarrow^{2}P_{1/2} fine structure transition of the ionised carbon ([CII]) at 158\,\rm{\mu m}, being the most luminous line in the FIR band (Stacey et al. 2010), has become the most widely targeted transition by ALMA in the high-z Universe (e.g. Maiolino et al. 2015; Carniani et al. 2018a; Matthee et al. 2019). The C^{0} ionisation potential (11.26\rm\,eV) is lower than that of neutral hydrogen (13.6\,\rm{eV}) making C+ abundant in the diffuse neutral medium and in dense PhotoDissociation Regions (PDRs; Wolfire et al. 2022, for a recent review) associated with molecular clouds. PDRs are defined as regions where the far-ultraviolet (FUV, 6-13.6\,\rm{eV}) radiation from OB stars, energetic enough to dissociate molecules but not to ionise hydrogen, drives the chemistry and thermal balance of the gas. In addition to [CII] campaigns targeting single galaxies, two ALMA surveys have been carried out on large samples: the ALMA Large Programme to Investigate [CII] at Early Times (ALPINE, Le Fèvre et al. 2020; Faisst et al. 2020; Béthermin et al. 2020a, at z=4-5), and the Reionisation Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS, Bouwens et al. 2022, at z=6-7). Due to the balance between [CII] cooling and heating from star formation, De Looze et al. (2014) first established the [CII]-SFR relation on both galactic scales and on a spatially resolved level at z=0. On galactic scales, this relationship seems to hold both in ALPINE (e.g. Schaerer et al. 2020; Romano et al. 2022) and REBELS (Bouwens et al. 2022) and up to z=7 (Carniani et al. 2018b; Matthee et al. 2019), albeit with larger scatter. In addition to the SFR, the luminosity of [CII] also correlates with the gas mass (Zanella et al. 2018) due to the widespread C+ abundance in the neutral and molecular phases. The ionised gas in galaxies is instead usually traced with optical and ultraviolet (UV) nebular lines (e.g. [OII], H\beta, [OIII], [NII], H\alpha, [SII]; Kewley et al. 2019, and references therein). By leveraging line ratios diagnostics (e.g. R2, O3O2, R3, R23) and well-established correlations between their luminosity and the SFR (e.g. \rm L_{H\alpha}-SFR and \rm L_{[OII]}-SFR, Kennicutt 1998) it is possible to characterise the ionised gas temperature (Schaerer et al. 2022), metallicity (e.g. Curti et al. 2023; Venturi et al. 2024), and density (Isobe et al. 2023). Observations of the ionised gas in high-z galaxies have historically been performed with ground-based facilities (e.g. VLT and Keck telescopes) by targeting rest-frame optical/UV emission lines up to z\sim 3, and with the Hubble Space Telescope. Large programmes like the VIMOS Survey in the CANDELS UDS and CDFS fields (VANDELS, McLure et al. 2018); the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS, Steidel 2014) or the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey (Kriek et al. 2015) allowed a first analysis of the evolution of ionised gas properties. These campaigns enabled the analysis of the validity of commonly used line diagnostics (e.g. the BPT diagram, Baldwin et al. 1991), and the derivation of the underlying ionised gas properties in galaxies beyond the local Universe. Overall, such works suggest a complex interplay between star formation, gas kinematics, and chemical enrichment in relatively young galaxies at z\sim 3 (Llerena et al. 2023). However, it is only in the last two years that, thanks to the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the ionised gas has become accessible well within the EoR with deep spectro/photometric campaigns such as the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES; Eisenstein et al. 2023; Bunker et al. 2023; Rieke et al. 2023; Tacchella et al. 2023), the Cosmic Evolution Early universe Release Science Survey (CEERS; Yang et al. 2023; Backhaus et al. 2024), or the Public Release IMaging for Extragalactic Research (PRIMER; Dunlop et al. 2021; Donnan et al. 2024). JWST is making it possible to test commonly used relations that have been calibrated in local galaxies, and to link the HII region properties with those of the neutral gas traced with ALMA in [CII]. The goal of this work is to link the luminosity of nebular lines tracing ionised gas, to that of [CII] tracing neutral gas, and clarifying the effect of binary stars and quenching episodes in star formation on the line luminosity and ratios. In particular, we focused on a subsample of ALPINE galaxies at z\approx 4-6. A JWST proposal has been accepted (PI: A. Faisst, Cycle 2) to observe 18 representative ALPINE galaxies between 4.4<z<5.7 with NIRSpec, and obtain all major optical lines ([OII], H\beta, [OIII]5007\rm\text{\AA}, [NII], H\alpha and [SII]) for which we will provide luminosity predictions based on the known properties of ALPINE galaxies inferred from the [CII] and dust continuum observations. Works based on pre-JWST data suggest that ALPINE-like galaxies (Faisst et al. 2016, z\sim 5), and a subsample of 10 ALPINE sources (Vanderhoof et al. 2022) to be characterised by Z=0.5\,\rm Z_{\odot}, while ALMA [CII] and continuum detections allowed the characterisation of the morphology and distribution of the cold gas and dust (Fujimoto et al. 2020; Pozzi et al. 2021), the measure of the gas mass (Dessauges-Zavadsky et al. 2020), and of the [CII]-SFR relation (e.g. Béthermin et al. 2020b; Schaerer et al. 2020; Dessauges-Zavadsky et al. 2020; Romano et al. 2022)) in ALPINE. The upcoming JWST data, complemented with the models presented in this paper, will provide us with the unique opportunity of having a UV-to-submillimeter benchmark sample with well-characterised multiphase properties. This paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 we present the model. In Section 3 we describe the method used to apply the model to the selected ALPINE subsample. In Section 4 we discuss the results, in particular predictions about UV/optical lines ([OIII]5007\rm\text{\AA}, [NII]6583\rm\text{\AA}, \rm{H\alpha}, H\beta and CIII]1909\rm\text{\AA})-SFR relations, and the impact of binary stars and quenching on these predictions. In Section 5 we present our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08117v1,Tracing the Formation History of Intrahalo Light with Horizon Run 5,"We investigate the formation history of intrahalo light (IHL) using the high-resolution (\raise 0.81805pt\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}1 kpc), large-scale (\raise 0.81805pt\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}1 Gpc) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, Horizon Run 5 (HR5). IHL particles are identified by carefully considering both their binding energies and positions with respect to the tidal radii of individual galaxies. By analyzing more than 1,200 galaxy groups and clusters with \gtrsim 10^{13}~{}M_{\sun} and tracing their individual IHL particles back in time, we classify the origin of each IHL particle at each epoch based on the status of the originating galaxy into three categories: brightest halo galaxy (BHG) formation/merger, satellite galaxy stripping, and pre-processing. Our study reveals that the IHL production through BHG formation/merger is the predominant production channel, contributing over 60% of the total IHL mass across all redshifts. The second most significant IHL production channel is pre-processing, providing more than 20% in the final HR5 snapshot. Stripping is negligible at z>4 but becomes gradually more important as halos mature at z<4. Finally, we verify that IHL production through the disruption of dwarf galaxies and in-situ formation is negligible, contributing less than \raise 0.81805pt\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}3% and \scriptstyle\sim0.5% to the total IHL production, respectively.","Since Zwicky (1937) first reported the detection of faint diffuse light between galaxies in the Coma cluster, numerous studies have explored its origin. This faint light, originating from stars not gravitationally bound to individual galaxies within a cluster, has been referred to as intracluster light (ICL). More recently, similar low-surface brightness features have also been observed on group scales, referred to as intragroup light (IGL; e.g., Girardi et al., 2023; Martinez-Lombilla et al., 2023). In this paper, we adopt the term intrahalo light (IHL) to encompass both ICL and IGL, providing a unified framework for analyzing these phenomena across different scales. IHL has the potential to independently trace the global distribution of dark matter within halos, as suggested by both observational (e.g., Jee, 2010; Montes & Trujillo, 2019; Kluge et al., 2024) and theoretical (e.g., Asensio et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2022; Yoo et al., 2024) studies. Furthermore, Deason et al. (2021) and Gonzalez et al. (2021) discussed theoretical and observational cases, respectively, where IHL may be utilized to measure the splashback radii of halos. However, the exact justification for why IHL can serve as a luminous tracer of dark matter and the degree of the similarity remain unclear without a detailed understanding the formation channels of IHL. If the majority of IHL stars form at high redshift, they have ample time to travel extensively within the halo and trace the global halo dark matter distribution. On the other hand, if most IHL stars are produced only recently, their distribution may not be representative of the global dark matter distribution. Various scenarios have been suggested regarding the IHL production mechanisms, including the formation of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) (e.g., Conroy et al., 2007; Murante et al., 2007; Ko & Jee, 2018), stripping from satellite galaxies (e.g., Rudick et al., 2009; Contini et al., 2019), pre-processing within galaxy groups (e.g., Mihos, 2004; Rudick et al., 2006; Contini et al., 2014), disruption of dwarf galaxies (e.g., Purcell et al., 2007), and in-situ star formation (e.g., Puchwein et al., 2010; Barfety et al., 2022; Ahvazi et al., 2024). A number of studies have demonstrated that among these processes, the IHL production via the disruption of dwarf galaxies and in-situ star formation may be insignificant (e.g., Melnick et al., 2012; DeMaio et al., 2015, 2018). The primary mechanism contributing to IHL production is still under debate. Theoretically, for instance, while Murante et al. (2007), based on a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, demonstrate that the formation of ICL is mainly associated with the build-up of the BCG, Contini et al. (2014), based on a semi-analytic model, claim that the ICL production is predominantly contributed by satellite galaxy stripping. Observational studies are similarly inconclusive regarding the main IHL production channels. For example, DeMaio et al. (2015), using their analysis of observations of four clusters, argue that the negative color gradients cannot be explained if BCG formation is the dominant IHL production channel, supporting the stripping channel as the main IHL formation mechanism. However, recently, Joo & Jee (2023) show that the mean IHL fraction in 10 high-redshift clusters at 1\lesssim z\lesssim 2 observed with Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera IR is consistent with local measurements, which is interpreted as indicating that the dominant IHL production cannot be via satellite galaxy stripping. With the advent of the JWST, significant progress is expected on the observational front in the near future, particularly in the z>1 regime. There are four critical issues when the origin of IHL is studied with numerical simulations. First, there is a difficulty in identification of IHL particles. Similar to observations, unambiguously separating star particles from those gravitationally bound to galaxies is non-trivial. Second, caution is needed when interpreting the results from a limited sample size. IHL properties vary widely from halo to halo, depending on each halo’s detailed assembly history. Third, it is computationally challenging to trace the origins of individual IHL particles reliably in a large cosmological simulation, where the number of particles exceeds tens of billions. Fourth, the differentiation of various IHL formation mechanisms is not clearly defined. For example, merging and stripping within a cluster are not two distinctive processes but rather points on a continuum, whose classification depends on when we perform the classification. In addition, pre-processing may refer to the same merging and stripping processes occurring on a group scale. In this study, we study the origin of IHL using the high-resolution (\raise 0.81805pt\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}1 kpc), large-volume (1049\times 119\times 127 Mpc3) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, Horizon Run 5 (HR5, Lee et al. 2021), carefully addressing the aforementioned outstanding issues in simulation-based IHL studies. The large-volume allows us to find more than 1,200 halos with M_{200}>10^{13}M_{\sun}, enabling a statistically robust study. Also, its high mass (\raise 0.81805pt\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}10^{6}~{}M_{\sun}) and spatial (\raise 0.81805pt\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}1 kpc) resolutions effectively resolve small galaxies down to \raise 0.81805pt\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}10^{9}M_{\sun}, thereby reducing the risk of mistakenly identifying star particles in unresolved halos as IHL particles. The baryonic feedback of HR5 is carefully configured and tuned to closely emulate the cosmic star formation rate history, a crucial factor that may significantly influence the production rate of IHL. When selecting IHL star particles, we rely on the Physically Self-Bound (PSB) galaxy finder (PGalF; Kim et al., 2023), which is based on the PSB halo finder (Kim & Park, 2006). The PGalF algorithm identifies the star particles of galaxies using binding energies and tidal radii, objectively differentiating bound and unbound particles with physical criteria. Most importantly, we trace individual unbound particles back in time to their originating galaxies. By determining the status of the originating galaxies based on objective and quantitative criteria at the epoch of classification, we ascertain the production mechanism of the corresponding unbound particles. Our paper is organized as follows. In §2, we provide a brief description of HR5 and our scheme for tracing IHL origin. §3 presents the result. We discuss the interpretation of the results in §4 before we conclude in §5. M_{200} refers to the spherical mass of a halo at the radius, which encloses 200 times the critical density of the universe. Figure 1: Stellar particle distributions in HR5 clusters. Here, we arbitrarily select four massive clusters among 1,202 halos at z=0.625 as examples and display their stellar density distributions in the y-z projection. Each row represents a different halo. The left column shows the density of all (bound+unbound) stellar particles, whereas the middle column displays only the density of unbound stellar particles. The images in the right column are produced by using bound particles as masks to depict observations, where masks are placed over galaxies. They show a number of low-surface brightness features, including concentration near the BHGs, ongoing stripping, diffuse distribution associated with infalling groups, etc. The red dashed lines indicate r_{200}."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08104v1,"Radio-AGN activity across the galaxy population: dependence on stellar mass, star-formation rate, and redshift","We characterise the co-evolution of radio-loud AGN and their galaxies by mapping the dependence of radio-loud AGN activity on stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time (out to z\sim 1.5). Deep LOFAR radio observations are combined with large galaxy samples to study the incidence of radio-loud AGN across the galaxy population; the AGN are further split into low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs). We find that LERG activity occurs over a wide range of SFRs, whereas HERGs are typically found in galaxies with ongoing star formation. The LERGs are then split based on their SFRs relative to the main sequence, across redshift. Within quiescent galaxies, LERG activity shows a steep stellar mass dependence with the same normalisation across the past \sim 10 Gyr; this indicates that hot gas fuels LERGs in quiescent galaxies across cosmic time. In massive galaxies (\log_{10}(M/\rm{M_{\odot}})\gtrsim 11), the incidence of LERGs is roughly constant across the galaxy population, suggesting that LERGs in massive galaxies may be fuelled by hot gas regardless of the star-formation activity. At lower masses, however, LERG activity is significantly more enhanced (by a factor of up to 10) in star-forming galaxies compared to quiescent galaxies; this suggests that an additional fuelling mechanism, likely associated with cold gas, may fuel the LERGs in galaxies with higher SFRs. We find that HERGs typically accrete above 1 per cent of the Eddington-scaled accretion rate, and the LERGs typically accrete below this level.","It is now widely believed that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies co-evolve across cosmic time, with evidence for a link between the build-up of stars and the growth of the SMBHs (e.g. Kormendy & Ho, 2013), and a tight correlation between the mass of the SMBH and that of the galaxy bulge component (e.g. Ferrarese & Merritt, 2000; Merritt & Ferrarese, 2001). SMBHs can undergo an active phase, powered by accretion of matter onto the black hole, during which they are referred to as active galactic nuclei (AGN). These AGN can emit vast amounts of energy across the electromagnetic spectrum in the form of ionising outflows or relativistic jets, which can suppress or regulate subsequent star-formation within the host galaxy; this is referred to as AGN feedback (e.g. Best et al., 2005b; Cattaneo et al., 2009; Fabian, 2012; Heckman & Best, 2014; Hardcastle & Croston, 2020). AGN feedback is often invoked in cosmological simulations to suppress the growth of the most massive haloes and reproduce the observed local galaxy luminosity functions (e.g. Bower et al., 2006; Croton et al., 2006; Somerville & Davé, 2015). Of particular importance in the lifecycle of massive galaxies and clusters are radio-loud AGN (hereafter; radio-AGN), which emit powerful bi-polar jets of relativistic ionised material that radiate synchrotron emission, which is visible at radio wavelengths. The energy deposited by these radio-jets into the host galaxy and surrounding environment can balance the radiative cooling losses and regulate star-formation in massive galaxies, with recurrent radio-AGN heating required to ‘maintain’ galaxies as ‘red and dead’ once quenched, in the nearby Universe (see Best et al., 2006, 2007; McNamara & Nulsen, 2007; Heckman & Best, 2014; Hardcastle & Croston, 2020). Radio-AGN are typically classified into two modes, based on the nature of the emission lines in their optical spectra, as low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs). This classification is understood to be linked to the nature of the accretion flow onto the SMBH (see Best et al., 2005a; Allen et al., 2006; Hardcastle et al., 2007; Hardcastle, 2018), where HERGs are associated with radiatively-efficient accretion, typically from cold gas, which leads to the formation of a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disc and a dusty torus (e.g. Shakura & Sunyaev, 1973); as a result, they display high-excitation emission lines due to photoionization of gas from accretion disc photons. In contrast, LERGs are associated with a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow (e.g. Narayan & Yi, 1994, 1995; Yuan & Narayan, 2014), often modelled as arising from cooling hot gas, and as a result, do not display signs of a typical AGN such as an optically thick accretion disc or a torus, and therefore lack high-excitation emission lines in their optical spectra. In this scenario, the HERGs have been argued to typically accrete at \gtrsim 1 per cent of the Eddington-scaled accretion rate, whereas the LERGs accrete at much lower rates of \lesssim 1 per cent of the Eddington-scaled accretion rate (Best & Heckman, 2012; Mingo et al., 2014). Studies of LERGs and HERGs in the nearby Universe have also shown differences in host galaxy properties between the two classes. LERGs are typically found to be hosted in massive, quiescent, red galaxies with massive black holes, and are often found in rich group or cluster environments, whereas HERGs tend to be found in less massive galaxies, with recent or on-going star-formation, and in poorer environments (e.g. Tasse et al., 2008; Smolčić et al., 2009; Best & Heckman, 2012; Gendre et al., 2013; Sabater et al., 2013; Mingo et al., 2014; Ching et al., 2017; Williams & Röttgering, 2015; Williams et al., 2018; Croston et al., 2019; Magliocchetti, 2022). Although both LERGs and HERGs are found across a wide range of luminosities, the characteristic break in the luminosity function for HERGs occurs at higher luminosities, and they are found to also show a stronger space density evolution with redshift (e.g. Best & Heckman, 2012; Best et al., 2014; Pracy et al., 2016; Butler et al., 2019; Kondapally et al., 2022). These observed properties of the host galaxies of LERGs and HERGs can be understood in terms of the different accretion properties of these AGN. The cooling of hot gas within massive, quiescent galaxies is expected to lead to low accretion rates resulting in the formation of a LERG, whereas the plentiful supply of cold gas present in lower mass, star-forming systems may also lead to higher accretion rates, resulting in a HERG. Using deep observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields Data Release 1 (LoTSS-Deep DR1; Tasse et al. 2021; Sabater et al. 2021; Kondapally et al. 2021; Duncan et al. 2021; Best et al. 2023), Kondapally et al. (2022) studied the cosmic evolution of LERGs, finding that at z\gtrsim 1, most of the LERGs are hosted by star-forming galaxies, in contrast to studies at lower redshifts where LERGs are predominantly found in quiescent galaxies (e.g. Best & Heckman, 2012). These results suggest that there may be differences in the host galaxy properties of AGN in the early Universe and at lower luminosities, with some overlap with the host galaxy properties of HERGs (see also Whittam et al., 2018; Whittam et al., 2022). Moreover, the significant population of LERGs hosted in a different galaxy type (star-forming as opposed to quiescent) at early times can have interesting implications for both the fuelling mechanisms (see also Delvecchio et al., 2022) and our current understanding of AGN feedback processes and its effect on the galaxy population (e.g. Cattaneo et al., 2009; Smolčić et al., 2017b; Butler et al., 2019; Hardcastle & Croston, 2020; Kondapally et al., 2023; Heckman et al., 2024). It is well known that in the local Universe, the fraction of galaxies hosting a radio-AGN (which provides a measure of the duty cycle) strongly increases with stellar mass as f_{\rm{radio-AGN}}\propto M_{\star}^{2.5} (Best et al., 2005a; Smolčić et al., 2009), with recent work by Sabater et al. (2019) finding that at low luminosities almost all massive galaxies host a radio-AGN. Janssen et al. (2012) studied the dependence of radio-AGN activity on galaxy properties at z<0.3 using the radio-AGN sample of Best & Heckman (2012). Using this sample, Janssen et al. (2012) measured the incidence of LERGs and HERGs, separately, as a function of stellar mass at z<0.3, finding that LERG activity increases steeply with stellar mass, consistent with M_{\star}^{2.5}, whereas the HERGs showed a much shallower dependence of \propto M_{\star}^{1.5}. Moreover, they found that compared to red galaxies, HERG activity was significantly more enhanced in blue galaxies at fixed stellar mass. These results are consistent with the notion of LERGs undergoing accretion from cooling of hot gas within massive haloes, with the HERGs being fuelled by the abundant cold gas present in their lower mass (bluer), star-forming host galaxies (e.g. Best et al., 2005a). Early and recent works that extended this analysis out to higher redshifts have found a similarly steep stellar mass dependence for the entire radio-AGN population (e.g. Tasse et al., 2008; Smolčić et al., 2009; Simpson et al., 2013; Williams & Röttgering, 2015; Williams et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2024; Igo et al., 2024). Since the radio-AGN population consists of both the LERGs and HERGs, Kondapally et al. (2022) used data from one of the LoTSS Deep Fields to study how the incidence of LERGs, alone, depends on stellar mass within quiescent and star-forming galaxies, separately, to z\sim 1.5. They found that LERGs hosted by quiescent galaxies showed a redshift-invariant steep stellar mass dependence, highly consistent with observations in the local Universe of fuelling occurring from cooling hot gas (see also Williams et al., 2018). On the other hand, the LERGs hosted by star-forming galaxies showed a much shallower dependence on stellar mass, suggesting that LERGs in more star-forming systems may be fuelled in a manner different from those in quiescent galaxies. In this paper, we aim to extend these analyses to understand how radio-AGN are triggered across the galaxy population by measuring the incidence of these radio-AGN as a function of each of stellar mass, star-formation rate, and redshift; using the full LoTSS Deep Fields dataset allows us to split our sample across these parameters simultaneously. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the radio and multi-wavelength dataset, along with the selection of radio-AGN and the parent sample used for comparison. Section 3 presents the results on the incidence of LERGs and HERGs as a function of mass and star-formation rate. In Section 4 we present the results on the dependence of LERG activity as a function of star-formation rate relative to the main sequence of star-formation. In Section 5, we present the Eddington-scaled accretion rate properties of the LERGs and HERGs. In Section 6 we present the interpretation and discussion of our results. Section 7 presents the conclusions of our study. Throughout this work, we use a flat \LambdaCDM cosmology with \Omega_{\rm{M}}=0.3,~{}\Omega_{\rm{\Lambda}}=0.7 and H_{0}=70~{}\mathrm{km~{}s^{-1}~{}Mpc^{-1}}, and a radio spectral index \alpha=-0.7 (where S_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\alpha})."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08100v1,Unveiling the Dark Side of UV/Optical Bright Galaxies: Optically Thick Dust Absorption,"Over the past decades, a population of galaxies invisible in optical/near-infrared, but bright at longer wavelengths, have been identified through color selections. These so-called optically faint/dark galaxies are considered to be massive quiescent galaxies or highly dust-attenuated galaxies. Having the entire galaxy obscured by dust, however, is likely an extreme case of the much more common occurrence of optically thin and thick absorption coexisting in the same system. With the power of JWST imaging, we are able to spatially resolve massive galaxies at z\sim3, accurately model their spectral energy distributions, and identify candidate optically thick substructures. We target galaxies with \log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})>10.3 and 2.5<z<3.5, and get 486 galaxies in CEERS and PRIMER fields. Based on excess NIR luminosity, we identify 162 galaxies (\sim33% of the parent sample) as candidate hosts of optically thick substructures. We then carry out spatially resolved SED modeling to explore the physical properties of those dark substructures and estimate the amount of optically thick obscuration. We find that optically thick dust is ubiquitous in normal massive galaxies with a wide variety of SFR and morphology. 10-20% of the stellar mass/SFR are unaccounted for in our selected galaxies, and the fraction is insensitive to stellar mass or SFR. The dark substructures are generally dustier than the rest of the galaxies and are irregularly distributed, arguing against an obscured AGN as the source of the NIR excess. A correlation between the obscured luminosity and the presence of a recent starburst in the past \lesssim 100 Myr is also observed.","Since the advent of sensitive near, mid-infrared (NIR, MIR) and (sub)-millimeter imaging, a population of Ultra-Violet(UV)/optically invisible, massive galaxies at high redshifts (z>3) has been unveiled. For instance, some red galaxies undetected in deep optical or NIR Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, have been identified as bright sources at MIR wavelengths and are well detected by the IRAC camera onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope (Huang et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2016; Alcalde Pampliega et al. 2019; Sun et al. 2021; Kokorev et al. 2022). Our current understanding of the cosmic star formation history at z>3 relies in measure on Lyman-break galaxies, which are selected from their rest-frame UV/optical emission, and this radiation is attenuated by optically-thin dust, i.e. \tau_{\lambda}<1. Therefore, the existence of these so-called HST-dark galaxies (or H-dropouts) indicates that a significant amount of star formation, especially in massive galaxies, is unaccounted for in the cosmic stellar mass and star-formation rate budget at the same redshifts due to the obscuration by optically-thick dust, i.e. \tau_{\lambda}>1 at UV/Optical wavelengths (e.g., Pérez-González et al. 2023). The origin of these intrinsically red, high-redshift sources is being debated, and it has been proposed that they could be either massive galaxies undergoing very dusty star-formation, or the progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at early times (e.g., Franco et al., 2018; Yamaguchi et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2019; Talia et al., 2021; Manning et al., 2022; Gentile et al., 2024; Williams et al., 2024). Recently, the first simulation-based study of this population has been presented by Cochrane et al. (2024). Their results support that HST-dark galaxies are high-redshift (z\gtrsim4), highly dust-attenuated sources that appear ‘dark’ when viewed along certain lines of sight. In other words, this study suggests that the geometrical distribution of substructures with optically thick absorption is highly inhomogeneous. Before the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the spectral energy distribution (SEDs) of HST-dark galaxies was poorly constrained at NIR and longer wavelengths by limited spectral coverage and also by the lack of high-resolution information beyond 1.6\mu m. Most galaxies are also too faint for ground-based spectroscopy. Now, with the unprecedented capabilities of JWST at infrared wavelengths (Gardner et al., 2006, 2023), more optical/NIR-faint, MIR-bright sources have been identified, and the properties of these galaxies have been studied in detail to unveil the nature of their ‘darkness’ (e.g., Pérez-González et al., 2023; Rodighiero et al., 2023; Williams et al., 2023; Cochrane et al., 2024; Pérez-González et al., 2024a, b). A conclusion from these works is that these sources are massive dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshifts, and they are essential contributors to the star formation history (SFH), number density, and assembly history of massive galaxies in the early Universe. The major challenge in studying the properties of these galaxies includes the lack of systematic spectroscopic observations, limited wavelength coverage, and inhomogeneous sample selection. As demonstrated by Barrufet et al. (2024), spectroscopic data play a significant role in unveiling the nature and physical properties of HST-dark galaxies. Many existing studies apply integrated color selections to identify optically faint sources, which only catch galaxies whose UV/optical SED is fully obscured by dust everywhere (e.g., Zhou et al., 2020; Shu et al., 2022; Barrufet et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2023b, a). A situation in which a whole galaxy is optically dark, however, should be relatively rare. It should be more common for galaxies to have regions of optically thin obscuration coexisting with regions of optically thick obscuration (i.e. patchy obscuration and optically-dark substructures), and this should reflect in the spatial variation of their SFHs. In the local Universe, evidence of patchy optically thick clouds has been found in typical disk galaxies (e.g., Holwerda et al., 2005). At high redshift (z>2), the spatial variation of dust attenuation is also found through spatially resolved measurements of galaxy properties (Pérez-González et al., 2023; Giménez-Arteaga et al., 2023). If this situation is common at high redshift, unless high-resolution and deep far-infrared (FIR) and millimeter data for most galaxies are available, their stellar masses and SFRs (and thus the cosmic densities) could be significantly underestimated, as the hidden optically thick sub-regions completely absorb all the UV and optical photons, which thus cannot be recovered by any extinction correction. In other words, the stellar mass/SFR inferred from FIR data would be higher than that inferred from the UV/optical data. However, it is challenging to quantify and correct for the ‘missing’ stellar mass and star formation because of confusion with the optically thin dust absorption, if only rest-frame UV/optical data is available. The presence of an AGN component in the SED, with its own extinction by dust located both in the nuclear region and in the host galaxy, would further complicate the measure. The contribution of optically dark galaxies (obscured as a whole) to the cosmic star-formation rate density (CSFRD) is non-negligible, reaching \Phi\geq(1.9-4.4)\times 10^{-3}~{}cMpc^{-3} or >3-6% of the total CSFRD at z\sim3.5 (Meyer et al., 2024; Williams et al., 2024). The fraction gets higher for more massive galaxies and at higher redshifts. Thus, these obscured sources can affect the shape of the UV luminosity function (UVLF), especially at the bright end (van Leeuwen et al., 2024), and also bias our understanding of the mass and size evolution of galaxies. If galaxies with dark substructures are more frequent than ‘whole’ dark galaxies, then the contribution of the partially obscured ones could also be important, perhaps more important. Currently, such contribution is unconstrained, since the frequency and magnitude of spatially segregated optically-thick dust absorption in high-redshift galaxies have never been measured. In this paper, we quantify the star formation rate and stellar mass unaccounted due to the optically thick dust absorption in massive, M_{*}>10^{10.3} M⊙ galaxies at z\approx 3. We also explore the physical properties of the identified optically dark substructures in these galaxies. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the observed data and our parent sample selection. In Section 3, we develop selection criteria to identify candidate galaxies that potentially host optically thick dust absorption within the parent sample. Then the identification of optically dark substructures and their spatially resolved SED modeling are conducted in Section 4. We present our main results in Section 5 and make further discussions in Section 6. The conclusions of this paper are summarized in Section 7. Throughout this paper, we assume a flat cosmology with \Omega_{M} = 0.3, \Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.7 and Hubble parameter H_{0}=70~{}km^{-1}Mpc^{-1}. For SED fittings, we adopt a Chabrier (2003) initial mass function (IMF). All the magnitudes are given in the AB system (Oke & Gunn, 1983)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08827v1,"ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP): 
Nested Morphological and Kinematic Structures of Outflows Revealed in SiO and CO Emission","The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP) reveals complex nested morphological and kinematic features of molecular outflows through the CO (J=2-1) and SiO (J=5-4) emission. We characterize the jet and outflow kinematics of the ALMASOP sample in four representative sources (HOPS 10, 315, 358, and G203.21-11.20W2) through channel maps and position–velocity diagrams (PVDs) parallel and transverse to the outflow axes. The combined CO and SiO emission exhibits the coexistence of the conventional extremely–high-velocity (EHV) jets and shell-like low-velocity (LV) cavity walls and new features. More complex, nested bubble-like and filamentary structures in the images and channel maps, triangle-shaped regions near the base of the parallel PVDs, and regions composed of rhombus/oval shapes in the transverse PVDs, are also evident. Such features find natural explanations within the bubble structure of the unified model of jet, wind, and ambient medium. The reverse shock cavity is revealed on the PVD base regions, and other features naturally arise within the dynamic postshock region of magnetic interaction. The finer nested shells observed within the compressed wind region reveal previously unnoticed shocked emission between the jet and the conventional large cavity walls. These pseudopulse-produced filamentary features connect to the jet-like knotty blobs, creating an impression of episodicity in mass ejection. SiO emission is enhanced downstream of the reverse shock boundary, with jet-like excitation conditions. Combined, these observed features reveal the extended structures induced by the magnetic interplay between a jet-bearing magnetized wide-angle wind and its ambient magnetized surrounding medium.","Molecular outflows from young stellar objects (YSOs) are probes of the stellar vicinity and its immediate surrounding environment through the interaction between the jets, winds, and ambient medium. Observed around Class 0 to early Class II YSOs, molecular outflows exist across the evolutionary stages of star formation with various morphological and kinematic properties (e.g., Arce & Sargent, 2006). Interferometric observations have been used to reveal the morphological and kinematic structures within molecular outflows. Molecular outflows observed in CO emission are often dissected into roughly two morphologically distinct components when viewed through channel maps: a shell-like wide-angle outflow lobe in lower velocity channels surrounding jet-like emission in the highest velocity channels. Such a conventional jet–shell structure has been revealed in several Class 0/I outflow sources by the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA), including HH 211 (Gueth & Guilloteau, 1999; Palau et al., 2006), IRAS 04166+2706 (Santiago-García et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2014), and L1448C-N (Hirano et al., 2010). The jet-like structure is often referred to as the extremely–high-velocity (EHV) component, and the outer shell structure is referred to as the low-velocity (LV) component, which, along with the intermediate-velocity (IV) wing, is part of the standard–high-velocity (SHV) component of the molecular outflow (Bachiller, 1996; Bally, 2016; Tafalla et al., 2010). Spectroscopically, the LV component has a profile peaked close to the systemic velocity with the IV wing toward higher velocities, whereas the EHV component usually demonstrates a distinct peak. The EHV jet typically exhibits higher density than the IV wing in that the SiO transitions tend to be present in the EHV jet but absent in the IV wing (Tafalla et al., 2010). Detailed analyses of jet and outflow signatures require careful consideration of features produced by the EHV jet, the LV outflow cavities, and the intermediate regions connecting the two. With higher sensitivity and resolution, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revealed more complex kinematic features in the outflow lobes. These structures include multiple molecular layered features shown in Class 0/I sources (e.g., Plunkett et al., 2015; Tafalla, 2017; Lee et al., 2018) and low-velocity molecular outflows from Class I/II sources with known optical jets (e.g., Louvet et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; de Valon et al., 2020; Güdel et al., 2018). Such complex kinematics have provoked subsequent investigations and examinations as to how they can be consistently interpreted. From a theoretical perspective, Shu et al. (1991) extended our understanding of the nature of these molecular outflows by predicting the morphology and kinematics of outflows driven by a spherically distributed radial wind with a fundamental momentum-conserving law, yielding a momentum-conserving thin shell with a “Hubble-law” velocity pattern. Alternatively, a jet-driven mechanism was proposed to account for outflows with large length-to-width ratios. Lee et al. (2001) found reasonable results by fitting these kinematic properties of a hydrodynamic thin shell driven by both a wind and a pure cylindrical jet against radio observations. The unified model of bipolar outflows developed by Shang et al. (2006) naturally produces the features expected in the jet-driven and the wind-driven momentum-conserving shells. In the new framework of the magnetic interplay between magnetized winds and ambient toroids advanced by Shang et al. (2020), combinations within the parameter space of the wind magnetization (in terms of Alfvénic Mach number of the wind M_{\mathrm{A}}), ambient toroid flattening n, and ambient magnetization produce systematic nested kinematic and morphological features, for which Shang et al. (2023b) advanced a wide variety of kinematic features potentially observable within molecular outflows resulting from the interplay. Position–velocity diagrams (PVDs) parallel and transverse to the outflow axis are determined to be especially powerful in probing the key kinematic features predicted in Shang et al. (2023b), and for probing mixing of the entrained ambient material with the pristine wind in the shocked region (Shang et al., 2020). Ai et al. (2024) demonstrated how the multiple velocity components of HH 30 observed at both optical and radio wavelengths can be unified through an inner atomic wind interacting with the ambient surroundings without the requirement to invoke a separate slow molecular wind. The ALMA 12CO channel maps of the HH 30 outflow system show multiple filamentary structures surrounding the EHV optical jet. The observations also reveal nested kinematics of layered velocity components as intersecting ovals on the transverse PV diagrams, predicted in Shang et al. (2023b). The low-velocity \sim 5 {{\mathrm{\,km}}{\mathrm{\,s}}^{-1}} CO emission is therefore taken to be the ambient material mixed into the outflow lobe by the high-velocity \sim 100 {{\mathrm{\,km}}{\mathrm{\,s}}^{-1}} wide-angle magnetized atomic wind, with the velocity differences mainly due to the density contrast between the wind and surroundings together entrained via momentum-conserving shell formation. This work utilizes channel maps and position–velocity diagrams to investigate the morphological and kinematic properties of a selected sample of outflows from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP, Dutta et al., 2020). ALMASOP covers the Orion A/B and \lambda-Orionis regions and provides an unbiased survey of Class 0 and I sources, all at a similar distance of \sim 400{\mathrm{\,pc}}. An overview of the survey, including the properties of 1.3 mm continua and detection and identification of outflows through 12CO and SiO, has been summarized by Dutta et al. (2020). Subsequent analyses of the dataset have been performed on aspects including chemistry, hot corinos, and multiplicity (e.g., Hsu et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2022; Sahu et al., 2023). A series of outflow studies have also been undertaken for this sample, including detection and analysis of SiO jets from likely the earliest Class 0 phase and the late Class I phase (Dutta et al., 2022a, b) and analysis of 6 SiO jets with distinct knot structure along the jet allowing the derivation of inclination angles, jet velocities, and potential ejection periods (Jhan et al., 2022; Dutta et al., 2024). The outline of this work is as follows. Section 2 summarizes the properties of the ALMASOP dataset and the analyses performed. Section 3 demonstrates the properties of four representative outflow sources in the ALMASOP sample in both CO and SiO emission by identifying the morphological and kinematic features in the outflow lobes. Section 4 discusses the implication and interpretation of the outflow kinematic structures. A historical account of the theory and simulation aspects of molecular outflows is provided in Section 4.1. The advancement of the unified wind-blown bubble model and its applications to the observed features are discussed in Section 4.2, starting with a recapitulation of the selected samples in 4.2.1. Its insight to the previously unnoticed signature of the reverse-shock cavity and to the nested kinematic signatures are discussed in Sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3. Section 4.2.4 discusses the origins of the SiO emission in embedded young stellar systems. Section 4.2.5 discusses the appearance of apparent and real episodicity in molecular outflows using this subset of the ALMASOP sample as examples. Next, Section 4.3 discusses the problems of applying the conventional pictures of thin-shell, jet-driven, and wind-driven outflow models, and discusses the difficulties of the alternative slow wind model. Section 4.4 concludes the discussion with prospective to the broader ensemble of ALMASOP outflows. Section 5 summarizes our findings."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08774v1,JWST observations constrain the time evolution of fine structure constants and dark energy-electromagnetic coupling,"It was hypothesized in the literature that some physical parameters may be time-evolving and the astrophysical data can serve as a probe. Recently, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have released its early observations. In this work, we select the JWST spectroscopic observations of the high redshift (z>7.1) galaxies with strong [O III] (\lambda=4959Å and 5007Å in the rest frame) emission lines to constraint the evolution of the fine structure constant (\alpha). With the spectra from two galaxies at redshifts of 7.19 and 8.47, the deviation of \alpha to its fiducial value is found to be as small as 0.44^{+8.4+1.7}_{-8.3-1.7}\times 10^{-4} and -10.0^{+18+1.5}_{-18-1.5}\times 10^{-4}, respectively (the first error is statistical and the latter is systematic). The combination of our results with the previous data reveals that \frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{d\alpha}{dt}=0.30^{+4.5}_{-4.5}\times 10^{-17}~{}{\rm yr% ^{-1}}. Clearly, there is no evidence for a cosmic evolution of \alpha. The prospect of further constraining the time evolution of \alpha is also discussed. The scalar field of dark energy is hypothesized to drive the acceleration of the universe’s expansion through an interaction with the electromagnetic field. By integrating the observational data of the fine-structure constant variation, \frac{\Delta\alpha}{\alpha}(z), we have established a stringent upper limit on the coupling strength between dark energy and electromagnetism. Our analysis yields \zeta\leq 3.92\times 10^{-7} at the 95% confidence level, representing the most stringent bound to date.","Fundamental physical constants are one facet of nature’s laws, but are they really non-revolving in the universe? Dirac (1937) proposed the famous large-number coincidence, suggesting an association between fundamental constants and the current status of the universe. About one decade after that, Teller (1948) argued that the time variation of gravitational constant (G) seems impossible due to the ecosystems on our Earth. Nevertheless, further probe is still necessary to check whether there is the cosmic evolution of the physical constants or not. One good target is the fine-structure constant which can be expressed as \alpha=\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\hbar c}, where e is the electron charge, \varepsilon_{0} is the vacuum permittivity, \hbar is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light in the vacuum. The numerical value of this dimensionless constant is found to be \alpha^{-1}=137.035999206(11) (Morel et al. 2020). A reliable identification of a deviation of \alpha from such a standard value would suggest the presence of the new physics. In the middle of the 20^{th} century, Stanyukovich (1963) and Gamow (1967) introduced the idea of time-variation of \alpha in cosmology. Dyson (1967) deduced that the time variation of e is less than 1/1600 during the history of Earth from the terrestrial existence of the nuclei Re^{187} and Os^{187}. But Gamow (1967) did give suggestions on the detection of the time-varying \alpha through astronomical sources. Savedoff (1956) firstly analyzed the spectral fine-structure of the emission lines of [N II] and [Ne III] in the spectrum of the nearby Seyfert galaxy. Astronomers have since been clear that the upper bound of the relative variation \Delta\alpha/\alpha and the time variation \frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{d\alpha}{dt} in our local universe must be extremely small (Petrov et al. 2006; Rosenband et al. 2008; Wilczynska et al. 2015; Martins & Pinho 2017). Consequently, modern observations focus on high-redshift celestial bodies to explore the potential change of \alpha in the early universe (Alves et al. 2018; Wilczynska et al. 2020). Thanks to the successful launch and outstanding performance of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), astronomers are now able to catch a glimpse of the young generation of galaxies and stars at very high redshifts. Recently, Jiang et al. 2024a, b111After the initial submission of our manuscript for publication on May 4, 2024, Jiang et al. 2024b appeared in arXiv. In our analysis, just the high resolution spectral data have been taken into account, while Jiang et al. 2024b also analyzed the medium resolution data. constraint on high redshift evolution of fine-structure constant with galaxy spectrum, improved the high redshift research of electromagnetism force. With the JWST data, the possible cosmic evolution of \alpha and dark energy-electromagnetism coupling can be further explored, which is the main purpose of this work. In this paper we probe the cosmic variation of \alpha using the [O III] \lambda\lambda4959,5007 doublet emission-lines (hereafter [O III]) of the very high redshift (z>7) galaxies. These two lines do not suffer from serious absorption and are strong enough to be reliably measured in the infrared spectrum of the high redshift objects. We concentrate on two sources at the redshifts of z=8.47 and 7.19 from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES; Eisenstein et al. 2023; Bunker et al. 2023). The structure of this work is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our sample, discuss the advantages of the [O III] doublet to probe the possible variations of \alpha, and outline our method for fitting the spectroscopic data. Section 3 covers the calculation of the variation of \alpha and the presentation of our key findings. We will wrap up and delve into the implications of our results in Section 4. In Section 4, we constraint the time evolution of the fine-structure constant and Dark Energy-electromagnetism coupling. Additionally, we address potential contamination issues associated with the [O III] method utilized in this study. Throughout this work, we adopt a \Lambda-CDM Model with H_{0}=67.4{\rm\,km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}, \Omega_{m}=0.3, and \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7 (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08747v1,"Regression for Astronomical Data with Realistic Distributions, Errors and Non-linearity","We have developed a new regression technique, the maximum likelihood (ML)-based method and its variant, the KS-test based method, designed to obtain unbiased regression results from typical astronomical data. A normalizing flow model is employed to automatically estimate the unobservable intrinsic distribution of the independent variable as well as the unobservable correlation between uncertainty level and intrinsic value of both independent and dependent variables from the observed data points in a variational inference based empirical Bayes approach. By incorporating these estimated distributions, our method comprehensively accounts for the uncertainties associated with both independent and dependent variables. Our test on both mock data and real astronomical data from PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-JWST demonstrates that both the ML based method and the KS-test based method significantly outperform the existing widely-used methods, particularly in cases of low signal-to-noise ratios. The KS-test based method exhibits remarkable robustness against deviations from underlying assumptions, complex intrinsic distributions, varying correlations between uncertainty levels and intrinsic values, inaccuracies in uncertainty estimations, outliers, and saturation effects. We recommend the KS-test based method as the preferred choice for general applications, while the ML based method is suggested for small samples with sizes of N<100. A GPU-compatible Python implementation of our methods, nicknamed “raddest”, will be made publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.","Linear and log-linear regression analyses are extensively applied in astronomical research. As a generalization of the conventional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator, the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) method incorporates the unequal variance of data points (heteroscedasticity) into the regression. Both OLS and WLS are derived with assumption that the independent variables have no observational uncertainties. However, this assumption is generally invalid for astronomical data. The presence of uncertainties in both dependent and independent variables can lead to a bias towards zero in the estimated slope of the (log-)linear relation (e.g. Fuller, 2009). Therefore, Orthogonal Distance Regression (ODR) and similar techniques have been introduced to mitigate the bias (e.g. Isobe et al., 1990; Hogg et al., 2010; Robotham & Obreschkow, 2015). While ODR yields satisfactory results when its explicit and implicit assumptions are met, substantial accuracy is not guaranteed in some complex, yet not uncommon cases. In addition, OLS and ODR often produce significantly different results (e.g. Ellison et al., 2021), making the selection of regression techniques a non-trivial issue. In the past three decades, considerable efforts have been dedicated to develop regression techniques for astronomical data (e.g. Press et al., 1992; Akritas & Bershady, 1996; Kelly, 2007; Hogg et al., 2010; Cappellari et al., 2013; Robotham & Obreschkow, 2015; Feldmann, 2019; Bartlett & Desmond, 2023). Although providing significantly improved regression results in many cases, these methods have various limitations and still require further improvement in certain cases. For instance, when deal with log-linear Regression, the widely-applied LINMIX method (Kelly, 2007) relies on the “delta method” to convert uncertainties in variables to uncertainties in their logarithms, an approximation method that is accurate only for data of high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N). In order to address the uncertainties in an independent variable, one needs to model the intrinsic distribution of the variable in the first place. This is done by employing Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) in both LINMIX and ROXY, a recent JAX-based implementation of a similar technique with support for non-linear cases (Bartlett & Desmond, 2023). While GMMs offer a workable solution, they become inefficient when the intrinsic distribution of the variable is complex. Furthermore, GMMs introduce an additional hyperparameter, the number of Gaussian components, which needs to be determined. Bartlett & Desmond (2023) show analytically that a single Gaussian is sufficient, regardless of the actual intrinsic distribution of the independent variable, given an infinite sample size and constant uncertainties. However, these assumptions are not always valid for astronomical datasets, which often exhibit heteroscedasticity and more complex noise behaviors than assumed. The Gaussian distribution decays rapidly away from its mean, leading to a significant gradient vanishing problem which makes optimization difficult for gradient-based algorithms. In addition, these methods rely on hierarchical Bayesian approaches, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC, in LINMIX) or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC, in ROXY) to simultaneously sample the parameters of the GMM and the linear regression parameters, thereby providing a complete posterior distribution. While offering a comprehensive description of the results, this approach significantly increases computational costs. Additionally, these methods neglect the potential correlation between the uncertainty level of a variable and its intrinsic value (the value with no observational error), which could arise due to the Poisson nature of photon counting and observational strategies that aim for fixed S/N. Another widely-applied method, Leopy (Feldmann, 2019) addresses arbitrary correlation forms, dependence between data points, and the presence of censored or missing data. In this method, however, the intrinsic distribution of the independent variable is not modelled natively, but is required to be provided as user input. This presents a challenge in real-world applications where the intrinsic distribution is often unknown. To address these limitations, we propose a new regression technique that combines the approaches of Kelly (2007), Feldmann (2019) and Bartlett & Desmond (2023), the advanced machine learning technique of Normalizing Flows (NFs) (e.g., Dinh et al., 2014; Jimenez Rezende & Mohamed, 2015), and variational inference-based empirical Bayes analysis. This new technique employs NF to model both the intrinsic distribution of the independent variable and the correlation between uncertainty level and intrinsic value. These distributions are estimated directly from the observed data points. Incorporating these estimated distributions allows for a comprehensive consideration of uncertainties in both independent and dependent variables. Our method can be applied to problems exhibiting intrinsic scatter and non-linear relationships. Furthermore, to enhance robustness, we introduce a variant version that replaces the likelihood (or posterior) with a distribution distance as the optimization objective. We evaluate our proposed methods and compare them with other commonly used techniques in the context of log-linear regression (distinct from linear correlation, as we will demonstrate). Our analysis utilizes both simulated data exhibiting log-linear relationships and real astronomical data from PHANGS-ALMA (Leroy et al., 2021a, b) and PHANGS-JWST (Lee et al., 2023; Williams et al., 2024), specifically focusing on the log-linear correlation between the CO(2-1) emission line flux and the JWST mid-infrared fluxes observed with the F770W, F1000W, F1130W, and F2100W filters. Tests on both simulated and real data demonstrate that our proposed method, particularly the distribution distance based variant, exhibits superior overall performance and enhanced robustness. While the experiments on simulated and real data focus on one-dimensional regression problems, our method is derived within the framework of multidimensional regression (as detailed in subsection 2.1). Given NF’s effectiveness in modeling high-dimensional distributions, it would be straightforward to generalize our method for regression of higher dimensions. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe both the proposed method and other methods from previous studies. section 3 showcases the test in log-linear case on mock data. Next, section 4 presents the application of the method to real PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-JWST data. Finally, we discuss and summarize our results in section 5 and section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08723v1,Asymmetry in the distribution of HSC galaxy spin directions: comment on arXiv: 2410.18884v1,"In the past decade, an asymmetry in the large-scale distribution of galaxy spin directions has been observed in data from all relevant digital sky surveys, all showing a higher number of galaxies rotating in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way as observed from Earth. Additionally, JWST deep fields have shown that the asymmetry is clear and obvious, and can be sensed even by the naked human eye. These experiments were performed using two separate statistical methods: standard binomial distribution and simple \chi^{2} statistics. Stiskalek & Desmond (2024) suggested that the asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions is due to the use of binomial or \chi^{2} statistics. Instead, they developed a new complex ad-hoc statistical method that shows random distribution in galaxy spin directions, and specifically in data from HSC. Source code for the method was also made available. The primary downside of the new method is that it is not able to identify asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions. Even when the new method is provided with synthetic data with extreme and obvious asymmetry, it still reports a null-hypothesis Universe with random distribution. That shows empirically that the method cannot sense asymmetry in the distribution of the directions of rotation of galaxies. While this further concludes that the distribution of galaxy spin direction as observed from Earth is not symmetric, it is not necessarily an indication of an anomaly in the large-scale structure of the Universe. The excessive number of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way can also be driven by the internal structure of galaxies and the physics of galaxy rotation. The phenomenon can be related directly to other puzzling anomalies such the Ho tension. Data are publicly available, and code is not needed to reproduce the results since only conventional statistics is used.","The large-scale asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions has been suggested as early as the 1980’s (MacGillivray and Dodd,, 1985). Using the unprecedented data collection power of digital sky surveys, that asymmetry has been observed by all relevant sky surveys such as SDSS (Longo,, 2011; Shamir,, 2012; Shamir, 2020c, ; Mcadam et al.,, 2023), PanSTARRS (Shamir, 2020c, ), DES (Shamir, 2022b, ), HST (Shamir, 2020b, ), HCS (Shamir, 2024a, ), DECam (Shamir,, 2021), and DESI Legacy Survey (Shamir, 2022a, ). The largest experiment included \sim 1.3\cdot 10^{6} galaxies from the DESI Legacy Survey, allowing to perform binomial distribution analysis of the entire sky (Shamir, 2022a, ). The asymmetry exhibits itself in the form of a dipole axis that peaks at close proximity to the Galactic pole (Shamir, 2022a, ; McAdam and Shamir,, 2023; Shamir,, 2023) and becomes stronger as the redshift gets higher (Shamir, 2020c, ; Shamir, 2022c, ), leading to the possibility that a higher number of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way is observed from Earth (Shamir, 2022a, ; McAdam and Shamir,, 2023; Shamir,, 2023; Shamir, 2024a, ). Indeed, JWST has shown clearly that the number of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the MW is far higher than the number of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the MW (Shamir, 2024b, ). Recently, Stiskalek and Desmond, (2024) proposed a new statistical method that shows that the distribution of the galaxy spin directions is random, and use annotated HSC galaxies to make that claim Stiskalek and Desmond, (2024). Instead of using standard binomial statistics or simple \chi^{2} statistics, the new method is a complex ad-hoc method. This paper examines the new method empirically to test its ability to identify asymmetry in datasets of galaxies annotated by their direction of rotation."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08686v2,The Lense–Thirring effect at work in M87,"Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87∗ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole’s spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole’s external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense–Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post–Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87∗. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense–Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of 0.56\pm 0.02 radians per year of the jet’s one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole’s spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole’s spin axis and the jet’s one stays constant over the years amounting to 1.16^{\circ}, in agreement with its measured value of 1.25^{\circ}\pm 0.18^{\circ}. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet’s angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense–Thirring precessional model.","The focus of this paper is on the so–called Lense–Thirring (LT) effect111In fact, recent historical studies 2007GReGr..39.1735P ; 2008mgm..conf.2456P ; Pfister2014 pointed out that it would be more correct to rename it as Einstein–Thirring–Lense effect; however, the name which has now entered into common use will be used throughout the paper. 1918PhyZ…19..156L ; 1984GReGr..16..711M , arising to the first post–Newtonian (1pN) order of the General Theory of Relativity (GTR), and its applicability to the context of the temporal evolution of the accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBH) lurking at galactic cores.

This paper will confirm it clearly and transparently in a way hopefully understandable to a broader audience not specialized in GRMHD nor in black hole (BH) astrophysics. The present work aims also to build a bridge that confidently unites, on the one hand, the community that deals with celestial mechanics and astrodynamics and, on the other hand, the one that studies astrophysics of compact objects by translating the language used by one into that adopted by the other and vice versa. This should make it easier for the two communities to read each other’s work, potentially stimulating new collaborations. The following physical and orbital parameters are used throughout the paper. G is the Newtonian constant of universal gravitation, while c is the speed of light in vacuum. Furthermore, M is the mass of a localized gravitational field source, whether it is a material body with a physical surface or not, such as a BH, acting as the primary in a gravitationally bound restricted two–body system made of itself and a test particle orbiting it, {\mathchoice{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}}:=GM, is its standard gravitational parameter, R_{\mathrm{g}}:={\mathchoice{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}}/c^{2} is its gravitational radius, \boldsymbol{J} is its spin angular momentum, J is its magnitude, and \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}:=\boldsymbol{J}/J is its spin axis arbitrarily oriented with respect to some asymptotic333It means that, in principle, its inertial nature may be limited by some residual tidal effects due to external gravitational fields; here, they will be considered negligible. inertial reference frame \mathcal{K} centered in the field’s source. For a rotating BH 1970Natur.226…64B , whose external spacetime is believed to be described by the Kerr metric 1963PhRvL..11..237K ; 2015CQGra..32l4006T , it is 1986bhwd.book…..S J=\chi M^{2}G/c, where \chi is a dimensionless number whose (absolute) value ranges from 0 (no rotation, static Schwarzshild BH) to444The aforementioned condition on the dimensionless spin parameter holds only for the Kerr metric. For material bodies, it is generally not satisfied. Suffice it to say that for, e.g., the Earth and Jupiter it is \chi_{\oplus}\simeq 738,\chi_{\jupiter}\simeq 860; for the Sun, it is \chi_{\odot}\simeq 0.2. 1 (maximally rotating BH, or extreme Kerr BH). If \chi>1, a naked singularity without a horizon would occur, implying the possibility of causality violations because of closed timelike curves. It may be worth of recalling that, although not yet proven, the cosmic censorship conjecture 2002GReGr..34.1141P states that naked singularities may not be formed via the gravitational collapse of a material body. The parameter \chi, which can also be viewed as the second characteristic length555Sometimes, the symbol a is used for J/\left(Mc\right) itself, in which case it is dimensionally a length. J/\left(Mc\right) occurring in the Kerr metric 1963PhRvL..11..237K ; 2015CQGra..32l4006T measured in units of the gravitational radius R_{\mathrm{g}}, is usually denoted with a in BH studies. The motion of an uncharged and nonspinning massive particle in the full Kerr metric was described in 1972ApJ…178..347B ; 1972PhRvD…5..814W . Ways to probe possible departures from the Kerr metric in the strong–field regime are discussed, e.g., in 2024arXiv240602454G. As far as the orbit of the test particle is concerned, the semimajor axis is half the sum of its maximum and minimum distances from the primary, so that it characterizes the orbit’s size. In celestial mechanics, it is commonly denoted with a; thus, caution is in order since it may be confused with the BH’s spin parameter. The eccentricity, which determines the shape of the orbit, is usually denoted with e, being 0\leq e<1. A circle of radius a\equiv r_{0} is obtained for e=0 (the maximum and the minimum distances from the primary are identical), while a highly eccentric orbit has e close to unity. In BH studies, e can reach very large values as for many S–type stars revolving around the SMBH in the Galactic Centre (GC) at Sagittarius A∗ (Sgr A∗) 2009ApJ…692.1075G ; 2010RvMP…82.3121G ; 2017ApJ…837…30G . On the other hand, if the test particle is representative of a fluid element of an accretion disk around a SMBH, e is assumed to be zero. The orientation of the orbital plane with respect to \mathcal{K}, or, equivalently, of the orbital angular momentum \boldsymbol{h} of the test particle, is fixed by two angles which, in celestial mechanics, are customarily denoted with I and \mathit{\Omega}. The former, called inclination, is the tilt of \boldsymbol{h} with respect to some direction of \mathcal{K} chosen as reference z axis, and ranges from 0^{\circ} to 180^{\circ}. The orbits characterized by 0^{\circ}\leq I<90^{\circ} are called prograde, while those with 90^{\circ}<I\leq 180^{\circ} are defined as retrograde. Orbits with I=90^{\circ} are said polar since they pass through the poles of the primary. In BH studies, I is usually denoted with \phi and called viewing angle, while the reference z direction is the line of sight (LOS), usually oriented towards the observer 2023Natur.621..711C . The other angle \mathit{\Omega} is the longitude of the ascending node. It lies within the fundamental plane \Pi of \mathcal{K}; the latter one is the reference plane perpendicular to the direction with respect to which I is reckoned; in general, it does not coincide with the primary’s equatorial plane. \mathit{\Omega}, ranging from 0^{\circ} to 360^{\circ}, is counted from the reference x direction to the point on the line of nodes crossed by the particle from below, where the upward direction is that of \boldsymbol{h}; such a crossing point is the ascending node, denoted with \ascnode. In turn, the line of nodes is the intersection of the orbital plane with \Pi. Stated differently, \mathit{\Omega} is the angle reckoned from the reference x direction to the projection of \boldsymbol{h} onto \Pi. In the BH literature, \Pi is the plane of the sky, while \mathit{\Omega} is called position angle (PA) of the sky–projected orbital angular momentum, being denoted with \eta 2023Natur.621..711C . Finally, the orientation of the orbit within the orbital plane itself, or, equivalently, of the line of apsides being the latter ones the pericentre and the apocentre, is determined by the argument of pericentre \omega. It is an angle which ranges from 0^{\circ} to 360^{\circ}, and is reckoned within the orbital plane from the line of nodes towards the ascending node to the point of closest approach. Figure \T@reffigure0 displays a generic Keplerian ellipse, arbitrarily oriented in space and within its orbital plane, with a massive spinning primary located at one of its foci; its spin axis \boldsymbol{\hat{k}} is not directed along any preferred direction. Figure 1: Keplerian ellipse followed by a test particle orbiting an object of mass M located at one of its foci at distance r\left(t\right). The fundamental plane \Pi of the asymptotically inertial reference system \mathcal{K} adopted is shaded in gray. The unit vector \boldsymbol{\hat{k}} of the primary’s spin angular momentum is arbitrarily oriented with respect to \mathcal{K}. The angles I,\mathit{\Omega} and \omega, are the inclination, the longitude of the ascending node and the argument of pericentre, respectively. The ascending and descending nodes are labelled with \ascnode and \descnode, respectively. The unit vectors \boldsymbol{\hat{l}},\boldsymbol{\hat{m}},\boldsymbol{\hat{h}} and \boldsymbol{\hat{P}}, given by Equations (\T@refelle)–(\T@refacca) and Equation (\T@refPi), are clearly visible. The lines of nodes and apsides are shown dashed. Also the true anomaly f\left(t\right), reckoning the instantaneous position of the orbiter with respect to the pericentre, is displayed for completeness. Figure \T@reffigure0b is focussed on the SMBH’s spin axis and the orbital angular momentum. For the sake of convenience, the notation of 2023Natur.621..711C is adopted for the angles determining their orientation in space. Figure 2: SMBH’s spin axis \boldsymbol{\hat{k}} and unit vector of the disk’s orbital angular momentum \boldsymbol{\hat{h}}. The notation of 2023Natur.621..711C is adopted for their angles whose numerical values were chosen here solely for illustrative purposes. If only the Newtonian mass monopole acceleration A_{\mathrm{N}}={\mathchoice{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}}/r^{2} acts on the test particle, where r is its instantaneous distance from its primary, all the aforementioned orbital parameters stay constant. Should some post–Keplerian (pK) accelerations A_{\mathrm{pK}} other than A_{\mathrm{N}} be present, altering the otherwise purely Keplerian motion, then (some of) the orbital parameters undergo steady temporal variations which manifest themselves cumulatively revolution after revolution. Such a picture, which can be traced back to a perturbative scheme, is valid to the extent that the other pK accelerations are sufficiently smaller than A_{\mathrm{N}}. The LT effect is a consequences of the so–called gravitomagnetic field arising from the off–diagonal components g_{0i},\,i=1,2,3 of the spacetime metric tensor g_{\mu\nu},\,\mu,\nu=0,1,2,3, which, in turn, are determined by the mass–energy currents of the source under consideration Thorne86 ; 1986hmac.book..103T ; 1988nznf.conf..573T ; 2001rfg..conf..121M ; 2001rsgc.book…..R ; Mash07 . For a localized rotating object, such as a star or a Kerr BH, the gravitomagnetic field is generated by its angular momentum \boldsymbol{J}. Basically, the LT effect consists of variations of the orientation of both the orbital plane and of the orbit within the orbital plane itself over time 1918PhyZ…19..156L ; 1984GReGr..16..711M ; 2024gpno.book…..I . Instead, the shape and the size of the path are left unaffected along with the time of passage at the pericentre. Attempts to measure them in the Earth’s field with some geodetic satellites 2019JGeod..93.2181P tracked with the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLT) technique SLR11 have been underway for almost 30 years 1996NCimA.109..575C . For different points of view on their reliability and actual accuracy, see, e.g., the reviews 2011Ap&SS.331..351I ; 2013NuPhS.243..180C ; 2013CEJPh..11..531R , and references therein. It should be said that the magnitude of the LT effect around the Earth amounts to a few tens of milliarcseconds per year (mas yr-1), while it is expected to be as large as a few tens of sexagesimal degrees per year ({}^{\circ}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) around M87∗, i.e., more than a million times larger than around our planet. On the other hand, the several competing physical effects of non–gravitational origin which act as sources of systematic bias are generally much more accurately known in the terrestrial scenario than around SMBHs. Other tests of the LT effect were performed also in the fields of Jupiter 2011AGUFM.P41B1620F ; 2024ApJ…971..145D and the Sun 2015IAUGA..2227771P ; Pav2024 ; RussiLT , but they proved to be inconclusive because of the resulting far too large errors and high correlations with other estimated parameters. The only known experiment that has successfully measured a gravitomagnetic effect and which, to date, has not been criticized in the peer–reviewed literature is that conducted by the Gravity Probe B (GP–B) mission Varenna74 ; 2001LNP…562…52E . Indeed, it detected, among other things, the gravitomagnetic Pugh–Schiff precessions Pugh59 ; Schiff60 of the spins of four gyroscopes carried onboard a drag–free spacecraft orbiting the Earth with a 19\% accuracy 2011PhRvL.106v1101E ; 2015CQGra..32v4001E compared to the \simeq 1\% initially expected Varenna74 ; 2001LNP…562…52E . The paper is organized as follows. Section \T@refsect:anal reviews the analytical model of the LT effect, expressed in terms of the both the Keplerian orbital elements and in vectorial form, for a generic orientation of the primary’s spin axis in space. In Section \T@refsec:M87, the results of the previous Section are successfully applied to the case of the measured precession of the jet emanating from M87∗. Section \T@reffine summarizes the findings and offers conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08658v1,Probing cosmic chemical enrichment with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories,"By observing binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to the edge of the Universe, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will map the BBH merger rate across all of cosmic history. This merger rate traces the formation rate of their progenitor stars convolved with a delay time distribution. Given theoretically-motivated priors on the delay time distribution, we show how XG observations can measure the BBH progenitor formation rate, probing the star formation rate (SFR) up to z>15. However, the progenitor formation rate does not directly give a measurement of the SFR, but rather a combination of the SFR and its metallicity distribution as a function of redshift. Fortunately, the metallicity-dependence of BBH formation likely varies as a function of BBH mass and/or formation channel. We find that if different BBH subpopulations with distinct metallicity biases can be identified, comparing their rates as a function of redshift yields a simultaneous measurement of the SFR and its metallicity distribution. Given optimistic theoretical priors and one year of observation, this may provide a \sim 10\% measurement of the SFR at its peak and a 0.2 dex (0.7 dex) measurement of the median metallicity out to z=10 (z=15) at 90% credibility, although the uncertainties scale with theoretical uncertainties on BBH delay times and formation efficiencies.","The current generation of ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA are surveying the population of merging compact object binaries out to redshifts z\lesssim 2 (LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al., 2015; Acernese et al., 2015; Akutsu et al., 2021). In their first three observing runs, the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observatory network detected \approx 70 binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to z\approx 1 (Abbott et al., 2019, 2021a, 2023a). At design A+ sensitivity, the LVK network will observe hundreds to thousands of merging BBHs out to z\approx 2 (Borhanian & Sathyaprakash, 2022). The growing GW catalog is expanding our understanding of the BBH population and their progenitor stars. With hundreds of events, we can map the population properties of BBH systems, including how their merger rate varies with mass, spin and merger redshift, over the Universe’s past 10 billion years. The existing observations are revealing features in the BBH population, including peaks and dips in the mass distribution, correlations between BBH masses and spins, and evolution of the BBH merger rate with redshift (e.g. Fishbach & Holz, 2017; Talbot & Thrane, 2018; Fishbach et al., 2018; Abbott et al., 2021b; Tiwari & Fairhurst, 2021; Edelman et al., 2023; Callister & Farr, 2024; Farah et al., 2023; Callister et al., 2021; Abbott et al., 2023b). The proposed next-generation of ground-based GW observatories, including Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, would be sensitive enough to detect BBH mergers with total masses above 10\,M_{\odot} out to z\approx 30 (Hall & Evans, 2019; Maggiore et al., 2020; Kalogera et al., 2021; Evans et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2023; Branchesi et al., 2023). As Vitale et al. (2019) showed, this would enable a direct measurement of the BBH merger rate over the entire history of the Universe, from the very first mergers to the present day. The redshift evolution of the BBH merger rate informs a combination of their progenitor formation history and the delay time distribution between progenitor formation and BBH merger. For the remainder of this work, we assume that BBH systems are the remnants of massive stellar evolution (as opposed to, e.g., primordial BHs; Carr & Kühnel 2020). Starting from a massive star origin, the formation of merging BBH systems may involve isolated binary evolution and/or stellar dynamics (see, e.g. Mapelli, 2021; Mandel & Farmer, 2022, for reviews). Isolated binary evolution may include stable mass transfer (van den Heuvel, 1976; Neijssel et al., 2019; Gallegos-Garcia et al., 2021), unstable mass transfer leading to a common envelope (Paczynski, 1976; Dominik et al., 2012), and chemically homogeneous evolution (de Mink & Mandel, 2016; Marchant et al., 2016). Meanwhile, dynamical assembly may occur in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters (Kulkarni et al., 1993; Sigurdsson & Hernquist, 1993; Rodriguez et al., 2015), nuclear star clusters (Antonini & Rasio, 2016) (possibly involving a central supermassive BH; Rose et al. 2022), and the disks of active galactic nuclei (McKernan et al., 2014; Rowan et al., 2023), and involves dynamical friction and three-body interactions leading to binary hardening, exchanges and ejections. There are environments in which both binary stellar evolution and dynamical processes are relevant, including stellar triples (Thompson, 2011; Antonini et al., 2017) and young star clusters (Rastello et al., 2020). 1.1 Progenitor formation rate and dependence on metallicity Regardless of formation channel, as long as BBH systems have a stellar origin, the BBH progenitor formation rate depends on the properties of stellar populations across cosmic history, including the star formation rate, the stellar initial mass function (IMF), the initial chemical composition (metallicity) of stars, their binary fraction, and the star forming environment, such as whether stars form in a dense cluster or near a supermassive BH. The conditions of star formation vary significantly over cosmic time (Madau & Dickinson, 2014). The initial metallicity (particularly the iron abundance) of progenitor stars is especially relevant for BBH formation (Belczynski et al. 2010; see Chruślińska 2024 for a review). The high iron opacity in outer stellar layers drives stellar winds, which leads to mass loss and increased radial expansion (Kudritzki & Puls, 2000). This means that higher-metallicity stars with a greater iron abundance are less likely to retain enough mass in their cores to collapse to a BH, particularly one more massive than \sim 10\,M_{\odot}. Furthermore, high-metallicity stars are more likely to merge with their stellar companion due to the increased radial expansion, preempting BBH formation in isolated binaries. Supernova natal kicks, which can disrupt binary systems, may also be larger at higher metallicities. The effect of metallicity on BBH formation efficiency is amplified by the other properties of star formation that correlate with metallicity. For example, there are indications that the low-metallicity IMF favors more massive stars, which would increase the number of BHs formed (Li et al., 2023; Klessen & Glover, 2023; Hennebelle & Grudić, 2024). The fraction of star formation that occurs in dense stellar clusters is also thought to be higher at low metallicity, which increases the rate of BBH mergers driven by stellar dynamics (Lamers et al., 2017; El-Badry et al., 2019; Reina-Campos et al., 2019; Belokurov & Kravtsov, 2023). Thus, within most proposed formation channels, the formation of merging BBH systems is thought to be more efficient at low metallicities compared to high metallicities, although the details depend on the formation channel. The theoretical expectation that BBH formation is more efficient at low metallicities is consistent with current observations of BBH mergers at z\lesssim 1. The overall star formation peaks at redshift z\approx 2–3, while the star-forming metallicity increases monotonically with time (decreasing redshift) as stars enrich their environments with heavy elements during their lives and deaths. The steep evolution of the BBH merger rate, as inferred from the latest GW catalog GWTC-3 (Abbott et al., 2023b), favors a combination of short delay times and a progenitor formation rate that peaks at higher redshifts than the Madau & Fragos (2017) SFR, consistent with the low-metallicity SFR (Fishbach & Kalogera, 2021; Vijaykumar et al., 2023; Karathanasis et al., 2023; Fishbach & van Son, 2023; Turbang et al., 2024; Schiebelbein-Zwack & Fishbach, 2024). 1.2 Delay time distributions The delay time for merging binaries refers to the time between the formation of the progenitor stars and the merger of the BBH. This timescale is dominated by the GW inspiral time, which depends on how closely the two BHs can be brought together by their evolutionary pathway. For circular binaries, the inspiral time scales with the initial orbital separation as \tau_{\mathrm{insp}}\propto a^{4} (Peters, 1964). The delay time experienced by a given BBH merger is drawn from a probability distribution referred to as the delay time distribution. Regardless of formation channel, the delay time distribution is generally predicted to have a long tail towards long delay times because of the steep dependence of the GW inspiral time on the orbital separation: increasing the orbital separation only slightly results in a much longer delay time. The specific delay time distribution is determined by the evolutionary pathway. Within isolated binary evolution, it is generally expected that common envelope can lead to shorter delay times than stable mass transfer because a successful common envelope ejection can shrink the binary orbit more effectively (Gallegos-Garcia et al., 2021; van Son et al., 2022a). According to population synthesis models, common envelope evolution generally yields delay time distributions that can be approximated by power laws with slopes \alpha\approx-1, while stable mass transfer yields distributions with shallower slopes, although the details depend on uncertain physical parameters (Fishbach & van Son, 2023). Within dynamical assembly, the delay time distribution depends on the mass and size of the star cluster, with more massive, denser clusters leading to tighter BBH systems with shorter delay times between star cluster formation and BBH merger (Hong et al., 2018; Rodriguez & Loeb, 2018). For a realistic cluster mass function, the predicted delay time distribution is usually well-described by a power-law slope \approx-1 (Rodriguez et al., 2019; Ye & Fishbach, 2024). 1.3 Binary black hole subpopulations In reality, multiple evolutionary pathways, with different progenitor formation rates and delay time distributions, may contribute to the BBH population. Ng et al. (2021) argued that a combination of different subpopulations, including the remnants of the first (Pop III) stars, remnants of Pop II isolated binary evolution, and dynamically-assembled binaries in star clusters, may create multiple peaks in the BBH merger rate as a function of redshift. They showed that these different subpopulations could be identified by measuring the redshift evolution of the BBH merger rate with XG observatories. In addition to having different merger redshift distributions, BBH subpopulations from distinct formation channels exhibit different mass and spin distributions. Indeed, there are already indications that the BBH population consists of a superposition of distinct subpopulations from different formation channels, characterized by unique mass, spin and redshift features (Zevin et al., 2021b; Wong et al., 2021; Godfrey et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024; Ray et al., 2024). BBH systems that were dynamically assembled in dense star clusters, which can be identified by their isotropic distribution of spin orientations (Rodriguez et al., 2016), may dominate the merger rate at high component masses \gtrsim 30\,M_{\odot}, perhaps explaining the peak in the BBH mass spectrum at \sim 35\,M_{\odot} (Godfrey et al., 2023; Ray et al., 2024). This is in line with some theoretical models (Antonini et al., 2023). The highest mass BBH systems may be explained by repeated, hierarchical mergers in dense clusters, which cause these systems to be spinning more rapidly (Fishbach et al., 2017; Gerosa & Berti, 2017; Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021; Kimball et al., 2021; Li et al., 2024; Pierra et al., 2024). In the future, if orbital eccentricity can be robustly measured from the GW signal, it would provide a powerful discriminator for dynamical assembly that can place constraints on the formation history of globular clusters (Rodriguez et al., 2018; Samsing, 2018; Zevin et al., 2021a, a; Romero-Shaw et al., 2021). Among BBH mergers from isolated binary evolution, population synthesis models suggest that evolution involving a common envelope phase may dominate the merger rate at low component masses \sim 10\,M_{\odot}, while stable mass transfer may contribute more at higher masses (van Son et al., 2022a). Post-common envelope systems may experience tidal spin up, leading to second-born BHs with larger spins (Zaldarriaga et al., 2018; Bavera et al., 2020; Olejak & Belczynski, 2021). Even within a fixed BBH evolutionary channel, the formation efficiency and delay time distribution may correlate with BBH mass and spin. For example, within isolated binary evolution channels, population synthesis studies often predict that the formation efficiency of high-mass BBH mergers depends most strongly on metallicity, with low-mass BBH mergers (component masses \lesssim 10\,M_{\odot}) and BNS mergers exhibiting only mild, if any, dependence on metallicity (Giacobbo & Mapelli, 2018; Klencki et al., 2018; Neijssel et al., 2019; Iorio et al., 2023, although see Gallegos-Garcia et al. 2023). This means that high-mass BBH mergers probably prefer to form at higher redshifts compared to low-mass systems. Meanwhile, the delay time distribution from common envelope evolution may correlate with the spins of the BBH because of the correlation between tidal spin up and the orbital separation of the BBH (Qin et al., 2018; Bavera et al., 2022). Dense star clusters probably merge more massive BBHs faster than low-mass BBHs because of mass segregation (Belczynski et al., 2022; Ye & Fishbach, 2024). In this work, we make use of the fact that different subpopulations of binary compact object mergers (as identified based on their masses and/or spins) may trace different progenitor metallicities with different delay time distributions. We consider a simplified toy model in which the different subpopulations are perfectly identified from their masses and spins. If we have a theoretical expectation of the delay time distribution corresponding to each subpopulation, we can propagate sources back to their formation redshifts (Fishbach & van Son, 2023). Then, by measuring the formation rate of each subpopulation as a function of redshift and comparing them, we can disentangle the overall SFR and its metallicity dependence, as emphasized by Chruślińska (2024). The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In §2, we describe our model for the metallicity-specific SFR and explain its relationship to the BBH merger rate. We simulate populations of mock BBH mergers in §3, discuss their consistency with current LVK data, and show how XG detectors can reconstruct the merger rate as a function of redshift. In §4, we describe how to deconvolve the inferred merger rates with a theory-motivated prior on the delay time distribution, yielding a measurement of the BBH progenitor formation rate for each subpopulation (§4.1). Combining this with a theory-motivated prior on the BBH formation efficiency, we show how XG detectors can measure metallicity as a function of redshift (§4.2). We conclude in §5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08630v1,Black hole jets on the scale of the Cosmic Web,"Jets launched by supermassive black holes transport relativistic leptons, magnetic fields, and atomic nuclei from the centres of galaxies to their outskirts and beyond. These outflows embody the most energetic pathway by which galaxies respond to their Cosmic Web environment. Studying black hole feedback is an astrophysical frontier, providing insights on star formation, galaxy cluster stability, and the origin of cosmic rays, magnetism, and heavy elements throughout the Universe. This feedback’s cosmological importance is ultimately bounded by the reach of black hole jets, and could be sweeping if jets travel far at early epochs. Here we present the joint LOFAR–uGMRT–Keck discovery of a black hole jet pair extending over 7 megaparsecs — the largest galaxy-made structure ever found. The outflow, seen 7.5 gigayears into the past, spans two-thirds of a typical cosmic void radius, thus penetrating voids at {\sim}95\% probability. This system demonstrates that jets can avoid destruction by magnetohydrodynamical instabilities over cosmological distances, even at epochs when the Universe was 15–7 times denser than it is today. Whereas previous record-breaking outflows were powered by radiatively inefficient active galactic nuclei, this outflow is powered by a radiatively efficient active galactic nucleus, a type common at early epochs. If, as implied, a population of early void-penetrating outflows existed, then black hole jets could have overwritten the fields from primordial magnetogenesis. This outflow shows that energy transport from supermassive black holes operates on scales of the Cosmic Web and raises the possibility that cosmic rays and magnetism in the intergalactic medium have a non-local, cross-void origin.","1 Main text Nearly every galaxy harbours a spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH) in its centre. The episodic infall of dust, gas, and stars is believed to activate the Blandford–Znajek mechanism [5], in which electric and magnetic fields convert black hole spin to kinetic energy carried by electrons and positrons. These leptons form a pair of jets: collimated, relativistic flows along the spin axis that point away from the galactic centre. Supported by helical magnetic fields [e.g. 58], the most powerful jets avoid disruption by stellar winds [e.g. 54] and entrain wind-borne atomic nuclei [e.g. 77], while blasting off towards intergalactic space. These jet-driven outflows comprise the majority of bright sources in the known radio sky. To clarify the impact of black hole energy transport on the intergalactic medium (IGM), recent studies [e.g. 14, 47, 48, 45] searched for Mpc-scale outflows: Nature’s largest, and often most powerful, jet systems. The International LOFAR Telescope [ILT; 70] has emerged as the prime instrument for their discovery and characterisation. Our team systematically scanned the ILT’s ongoing northern sky survey at wavelength \lambda=2.08\ \mathrm{m} both with machine learning and by eye — the latter with significant contributions from citizen scientists [26]. This endeavour has increased the number of known Mpc-scale outflows from a few hundred to over eleven thousand [45]. Our largest find is the outflow shown in Fig. 1, which we name Porphyrion. Figure 1: Deep radio images of a 7 Mpc–long, black hole–driven outflow at central wavelengths \lambda=2.08\ \mathrm{m} (top) and \lambda=0.46\ \mathrm{m} (bottom). These images were taken with the ILT and uGMRT, respectively, and have resolutions of 6.2^{\prime\prime} and 4.3^{\prime\prime}. The top panel’s inset shows ILT VLBI imagery at \lambda=2.08\ \mathrm{m} and a resolution of 0.4^{\prime\prime}. The bottom panel’s inset shows Legacy Survey DR10 optical–infrared imagery. The larger images cover 15^{\prime}\times 15^{\prime} of sky area, whilst the insets cover 1^{\prime}\times 1^{\prime}. For scale, we show the stellar Milky Way disk (diameter: 50 kpc) and a ten times inflated version. The source, of angular length \phi=13.4^{\prime}\pm 0.1^{\prime}, is unusually thin. It consists of a northern lobe, a northern jet, a core, a southern jet with an inner hotspot, and a southern outer hotspot with a backflow. To investigate from which of two radio-emitting galaxies halfway along the jet axis the outflow originates, we processed ILT very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) data of the central 4^{\prime}\times 4^{\prime}. At a spatial resolution of 3\ \mathrm{kpc}, the image (Fig. 1’s top panel inset) shows lone, unresolved radio sources in these galaxies, in both cases implying active accretion onto an SMBH. Because the detection of jets near either black hole (and along the overarching NNE–SSW axis) would clarify Porphyrion’s origin, we performed deep follow-up observations with the Upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at \lambda=0.46\ \mathrm{m}. The resulting image and ancillary optical–infrared data (Fig. 1’s bottom panel) reveal that the outflow protrudes from a massive (M_{\star}=6.7\begin{subarray}{c}+1.4\\ -1.4\end{subarray}\cdot 10^{11}\ M_{\odot}) galaxy. We observed this galaxy with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer [LRIS; 51, 41, 64, 61] on the W. M. Keck Observatory’s Keck I Telescope, measuring a spectroscopic redshift z=0.896\pm 0.001 (Fig. 2). Figure 2: Both rest-frame ultraviolet–optical spectroscopy (top) and radio–ultraviolet photometry (bottom) demonstrate that the outflow’s host galaxy harbours an RE AGN. Top: LRIS spectrum exhibiting hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and neon emission. The forbidden lines from multiply ionised oxygen and neon (dark red) could not be generated by even the hottest stars, and instead stem from the narrow-line region of an RE AGN at a redshift z=0.896\pm 0.001. Bottom: Bayesian inference of the galaxy’s SED (Methods) favours the presence of an AGN accretion disk (dark blue) with an obscuring torus (purple), again indicating radiative efficiency. We witness Porphyrion at t_{\mathrm{BB}}=6.3\ \mathrm{Gyr} after the Big Bang. The outflow’s angular length and redshift entail a sky-projected length l_{\mathrm{p}}=6.43\pm 0.05\ \mathrm{Mpc}. This makes Porphyrion the projectively longest known structure generated by an astrophysical body. The outflow’s total length exceeds this projected length, but by how much depends on the unknown inclination of the jets with respect to the sky plane. Deprojection formulae [48] predict a total length l=6.8\begin{subarray}{c}+1.2\\ -0.3\end{subarray}\ \mathrm{Mpc}, with expectation \mathbb{E}[L\ |\ L_{\mathrm{p}}=l_{\mathrm{p}}]=7.28\pm 0.05\ \mathrm{Mpc} (Methods). We thus estimate Porphyrion to be {\sim}7\ \mathrm{Mpc} long in total. Spanning {\sim}66\% of the radius of a typical cosmic void at its redshift, the outflow is truly cosmological. The fact that outflows exceeding 4 Mpc have been known since the 1970s [76], whilst those exceeding 5 Mpc remained undiscovered half a century of technological progress later, hitherto suggested a physical limit to outflow growth near 5 Mpc. Our finding proves this suggestion false. Surprisingly, SMBH jets can remain collimated over several megaparsecs, despite the growth of (magneto)hydrodynamical (MHD) instabilities — chiefly Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities — predicted theoretically and seen in simulations of shorter jets [e.g. 53]. No MHD simulations of Mpc-scale jets yet exist: the spatio-temporal grids required imply a numerical cost {\sim}10^{2} times higher than that of state-of-the-art runs. Outflows like Porphyrion thus offer a window into a jet physics regime that, at present, cannot be explored numerically. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) with accretion disks extending to the innermost stable circular orbits of their SMBHs efficiently convert the gravitational potential energy of infalling matter into radiation, and are thus called radiatively efficient (RE); all others are called radiatively inefficient (RI) [27, 23]. In RE AGN, the luminous accretion disk photo-ionises a circumnuclear region emitting narrow, and often forbidden, spectral lines. The Keck-observed prominence of forbidden ultraviolet–optical lines from oxygen and neon (chiefly that of the [O III]\lambda5007 line, which is 10.3\pm 0.2 times brighter than the H\beta line) therefore reveals the presence of an RE AGN [7]. By contrast, all previous record-length outflows, such as 3C 236 (l_{\mathrm{p}}=4.6\ \mathrm{Mpc}; [76]), J1420–0545 (l_{\mathrm{p}}=4.9\ \mathrm{Mpc}; [39]), and Alcyoneus (l_{\mathrm{p}}=5.0\ \mathrm{Mpc}; [47]), are fuelled by RI AGN in recent history (t_{\mathrm{BB}}=10.2–12.4\ \mathrm{Gyr}). Whereas RI AGN occur primarily in evolved, ‘red and dead’ ellipticals [27], RE AGN feature vigorous gas inflows and are thus generally found in star-forming galaxies. Indeed, in the first billions of years of cosmic time, RE AGN dominated the radio-bright AGN population [75]. The potential of Mpc-scale outflows to spread cosmic rays (CRs), heat, heavy atoms, and magnetic fields through the IGM is particularly high if large specimina could emerge from the type of AGN abundant at early epochs, when the Universe’s volume was smaller. The discovery of a 7\ \mathrm{Mpc}–long, RE AGN–fuelled outflow before cosmic half-time therefore highlights the hitherto understudied cosmological transport capabilities of Mpc-scale outflows. Figure 3: By superimposing Porphyrion’s total length and radio luminosity (green dot) on evolutionary tracks from dynamical modelling (red–white–blue curves), we infer the outflow’s two-sided jet power and age. We assume the host galaxy to reside in a galaxy group bordering voids, through which the jets eventually travel. The host galaxy likely inhabits a Cosmic Web filament. Vast voids, which make up the bulk ({\sim}80\%) of the Universe’s volume [20], surround such massive structures in most directions. Jets as long as Porphyrion’s encounter void-like densities and temperatures with high probability ({\sim}95\%; Methods). Indeed, the collimated nature of the jets favours scenarios in which they descend into voids, as jets gain resilience against Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities when the ambient density declines [e.g. 53]. Dynamical modelling suggests a two-sided jet power Q=1.3\pm 0.1\cdot 10^{39}\ \mathrm{W} and an age T=1.9\begin{subarray}{c}+0.7\\ -0.2\end{subarray}\ \mathrm{Gyr} (Fig. 3; Methods). The outflow’s average expansion speed v=0.012\ c, comparable to Alcyoneus’ [47]. In voids and the warm–hot IGM, the speed of sound c_{\mathrm{s}}\sim 10^{0}–10^{1}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}: the jets grow hypersonically at Mach numbers \mathcal{M}\sim 10^{2}–10^{3} and drive strong shocks into voids. Porphyrion’s jets have carried an energy E=QT=8\begin{subarray}{c}+2\\ -1\end{subarray}\cdot 10^{55}\ \mathrm{J} into the IGM — an amount comparable to the energy released during galaxy cluster mergers [e.g. 71]. This suggests that the outflow is among the most energetic post–Big Bang events to have occurred in its Cosmic Web region. Even though the SMBH might have gained a significant fraction of its mass while powering the jets (\Delta M_{\bullet}>2\frac{E}{c^{2}}=9\begin{subarray}{c}+2\\ -1\end{subarray}\cdot 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}), it appears to have maintained a constant spin axis throughout gigayears of activity. Shocks running perpendicular to the jets dissipate enough heat into the filament to increase its temperature by \Delta T\sim 10^{7}\ \mathrm{K} and its radius by \Delta r\sim 10^{-1}–10^{0}\ \mathrm{Mpc} (Methods). Outflows like Porphyrion thus locally alter the Cosmic Web’s shape. Figure 3 illustrates that the radio luminosity — and, consequently, the radio surface brightness — of constant–jet power, Mpc-long outflows decreases over time. As Fig. 1 evinces, Porphyrion borders on the noise of leading current-day telescopes; all outflows further progressed on the same evolutionary track hitherto evade detection. Similar outflows at higher redshifts or at lower jet powers, and similar but less slenderly shaped outflows, are likewise undetectable. More generally, statistical modelling [48] suggests that the detectable population is just the tip of the iceberg: owing to their low radio surface brightnesses, most Mpc-scale outflows are still concealed by noise. These arguments imply the existence of a hidden population of outflows with sizes comparable to, and possibly larger than, Porphyrion’s. Figure 4: Leptons escaping from the lobes of void-penetrating Mpc-scale outflows diffuse rapidly in weakly magnetised voids. For a single void, and through cosmic time, we show the volumetric fraction filled by electrons and positrons (with 1\ \mathrm{GeV} of initial energy) originating from Porphyrion. Equally energetic protons diffuse faster, given their minimal inverse Compton losses to the CMB. We consider diffusion through turbulent magnetic fields with strengths B and coherence lengths \lambda_{\mathrm{c}}\sim 1\ \mathrm{Mpc} (spanning a factor two; see translucent bands). The hatched strip marks the time prior to Porphyrion’s observed state during which its lobes likely (with probability {>}80\%) penetrated voids. Mpc-scale outflows long enough to breach filaments, such as Porphyrion, transport large quantities of heavy atoms and CRs into voids [4]. In particular, Mpc-scale jets endow \mathrm{Mpc}^{3}-scale volumes in voids with metallicities Z\sim 10^{-3}–10^{-2}\ Z_{\odot} (Methods). Furthermore, we predict that — in voids — the jet- and buoyancy-dominated phases of outflow dynamics are followed by a diffusion phase. Figure 4 shows the time evolution of the volume-filling fraction of CRs escaping from a void-penetrating lobe. Many particles undergo this fate: the lobe leaks CR energy at a rate P\sim 10^{30}\ \mathrm{W}\sim 10^{3}\ L_{\odot} (Methods), equivalent to a flux of {\sim}10^{39} 1 GeV–particles per second.111However, in the context of lobe energetics, this loss channel is negligible. For example, as P\sim 10^{-9}\ Q, jet power fluctuations have a far greater effect [e.g. 74]. The weaker the magnetic fields in voids initially are (see annotations), the greater the mean free path of the diffusing CRs is, and thus the more rapidly they disperse. If these CRs spread an amount of magnetic energy comparable to their own energy, as suggested by equipartition at source, then a single void-penetrating lobe could fill its void with a magnetic field of strength B\sim 10^{-16}–10^{-15}\ \mathrm{G} within a Hubble time (Methods). Diffusion-driven magnetisation is self-regulating: as the magnetic field strength rises, the mean free path falls, slowing further diffusion. This mechanism for astrophysical magnetogenesis generates fields consistent with constraints from GeV gamma-ray searches around TeV blazars [e.g. 46, 10]. Porphyrion indicates that RE AGN may be at least as effective at generating Mpc-scale outflows as RI AGN are in the Local Universe. If the comoving number density of actively powered Mpc-scale outflows has remained roughly constant over time at {\sim}10^{1}\ (100\ \mathrm{Mpc})^{-3} [48, 45], and a comoving volume of (100\ \mathrm{Mpc})^{3} contains {\sim}10^{1} voids [13], then there would exist {\sim}1 actively powered Mpc-scale outflow near every void at every instant. As Mpc-scale outflows are powered for {\sim}10^{-2}–10^{0}\ \mathrm{Gyr} [e.g. 25, 47], {\sim}10^{2} Mpc-scale outflows may have been generated near every void throughout cosmic history. Only few ({\sim}0.5\%)222A single Mpc-scale outflow may penetrate two or more voids. would need to extend into voids to make CR diffusion from leaky lobes common enough to magnetise the Universe to the observed levels. Our work suggests that void magnetic fields only trace primordial fields if the latter were strong; otherwise, primordial signals are readily overwritten by void-penetrating Mpc-scale outflows. Rather than stemming from the Early Universe, magnetism in voids could thus trace the history of black hole energy transport on the scale of the Cosmic Web."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08565v1,The overconcentrated dark halo in the strong lens SDSS J0946+1006 is a subhalo: evidence for self interacting dark matter?,"The nature of dark matter is poorly constrained on subgalactic scales. Alternative models to cold dark matter, such as warm dark matter or self-interacting dark matter, could produce very different dark haloes on these scales. One of the few known dark haloes smaller than a galaxy was discovered in the triple source plane strong lens system J0946+1006. Previous studies have found that this structure is much more concentrated than expected in \LambdaCDM, but have assumed the dark halo is at the same redshift as the main deflector (z_{\rm main}=0.222). In this paper, we fit for the redshift of this dark halo. We reconstruct the first two sources in the system using a forward modelling approach, allowing for additional complexity from multipole perturbations. We find that the perturber redshift is z_{\rm halo}={0.207}^{+0.019}_{-0.019}, and lower bounds on the evidence strongly prefer a subhalo over a line-of-sight structure. Whilst modelling both background sources does not improve constraints on the redshift of the subhalo, it breaks important degeneracies affecting the reconstruction of multipole perturbations. We find that the subhalo is a more than 5\sigma outlier from the \LambdaCDM v_{\rm max}–r_{\rm max} relation and has a steep profile with an average slope of \gamma_{\rm 2D}={-1.81}^{+0.15}_{-0.11} for radii between 0.75-1.25 kpc. This steep slope might indicate dark matter self-interactions causing the subhalo to undergo gravothermal collapse; such collapsed haloes are expected to have \gamma_{\rm 2D}\approx-2.","While \LambdaCDM makes successful predictions about the large-scale structure of the Universe, no particle candidate for dark matter (DM) has so far been detected in the laboratory. Although it has been studied extensively, cold dark matter (CDM) is, therefore, merely a placeholder for a more fundamental theory of dark matter. It is crucial for our understanding of astrophysics and cosmology that we place stronger constraints on its nature. The standard \LambdaCDM model predicts the formation of dark matter haloes that closely follow NFW mass profiles (Navarro et al., 1997). State-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations (e.g. Schaye et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Hernández-Aguayo et al., 2023) indicate clear relations among the properties of these haloes, e.g. between their concentration and mass (see e.g. Sorini et al., 2024) or between the maximum circular velocity and the corresponding radius at which this velocity is found (see e.g. Moliné et al., 2023). However, the properties of dark matter that affect galactic and subgalactic scales are still not fully constrained. Alternatives to CDM might provide a better description of structure formation on these scales. For example, Warm dark matter (WDM) would be preferred if there is a suppressed number of small mass dark matter haloes (see e.g. Bode et al., 2001; Lovell et al., 2014; Lovell, 2020). Models such as fuzzy dark matter (FDM, see e.g. Hu et al., 2000; Hui et al., 2017) or self-interacting dark matter (SIDM, see e.g. Vogelsberger et al., 2012; Vogelsberger et al., 2016; Cyr-Racine et al., 2016; Despali et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2024) could further explain observed cores within dwarf galaxies. SIDM is particularly interesting, as it can generate a variety of haloes with both cores and cusps. Recently, velocity-dependent SIDM became more popular since these models can create cores in small galaxies while allowing Milky way-mass haloes to remain non-spherical and therefore consistent with observations (Vogelsberger et al., 2012; Zavala et al., 2013). A SIDM halo is initially cored because the self-interaction redistributes energy and momentum mostly in the centre where most interactions occur. The core then expands as heat flows inwards from the outskirts of the halo until it becomes isothermal. This process leads to halo profiles that are less cuspy in their centre than their CDM counterparts (see e.g. Spergel & Steinhardt, 2000; Shah & Adhikari, 2024; Yang et al., 2024). The expansion continues until a strong enough negative energy gradient is established and the random motion of particles in the core is no longer sufficient to support its own gravity. This leads eventually to gravothermal collapse, resulting in haloes with more cuspy density profiles than their CDM cousins (see e.g. Turner et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2024). Core collapse behaves similar to the gravothermal catastrophe found in globular clusters (Lynden-Bell & Eggleton, 1980). While these alternative models make predictions that differ from CDM, the presence of baryons can also resculpt haloes without the need for exotic dark matter models (see e.g. Vegetti et al., 2023, who provide a discussion specifically in the context of gravitational lensing). Baryonic physics will further affect dark halo concentrations (see e.g. Heinze et al., 2024) and the expected luminosity of the galaxies that they host (see e.g. Despali et al., 2024). Strong gravitational lensing has been employed extensively to study WDM and sterile neutrinos (see e.g. Vegetti et al., 2018; Ritondale et al., 2019; Gilman et al., 2020; Enzi et al., 2021; Nadler et al., 2021), SIDM (see e.g. Despali et al., 2022; Gilman et al., 2023; Kong et al., 2024), and FDM (see e.g. Powell et al., 2023; Amruth et al., 2023). It can be used to detect and constrain the profiles of dark haloes from their localised lensing effect on multiple images, therefore allowing us to draw conclusions on dark matter microphysics and baryonic physics. However, so far only a small number of subhalos (i.e. haloes that are hosted by more massive haloes) has been detected this way (less than five, Vegetti et al., 2010, 2012; Nierenberg et al., 2014; Hezaveh et al., 2016). A particularly interesting dark perturber has been detected by Vegetti et al. (2010) in the lens system is J0946+1006 (which is part of the SLACS sample of lens systems, see Gavazzi et al., 2008). Previous studies of this dark halo have found it to be unusually overconcentrated (Minor et al., 2021). Recently, Despali et al. (2024, referred to as D24 from here onwards) has further shown that it might further be an outlier in terms of its luminosity. Minor (2024, referred to as M24 from here onwards) found that supersampling plays a significant role in the detection significance. In agreement with Ballard et al. (2024, referred to as B24 from here onwards), they also find that the inclusion of the second source breaks several degeneracies in the lens model. Nonetheless, the concentration parameter remains in tension with \LambdaCDM. The contributed lensing effect from line-of-sight haloes can be more important than the one from subhaloes, depending on the geometry of a lens system (see, e.g. Despali et al., 2018). If the dark halo found in J0946+1006 is a line-of-sight halo, we would expect that its redshift has important implications for the observed arcs since compound lensing can lead to qualitatively different images than single plane lensing (Collett & Bacon, 2016). Only some of these effects can be absorbed by other parameters in the lens model, e.g. the mass distribution of the main deflector or the source light distribution (see e.g. Li et al., 2017; Amorisco et al., 2022). We, therefore, expect to constrain the redshift of this dark halo, even though we can not directly observe its light. So far, the redshift of this dark matter halo has not been constrained rigorously through lens modelling (although approximations have been made in the past, see, e.g. Minor et al., 2021). In this paper, we aim to constrain its redshift, test the power of compound lensing to improve these constraints, and discuss whether or not a free redshift can alleviate the observed tension with \LambdaCDM. Furthermore, while previous studies have not yet done so, we include the first-order multipole perturbations (the ""lopsidedness"") in our mass model. We infer our posteriors using the open source lens modelling code Herculens111https://github.com/Herculens/herculens (Galan et al., 2022) in combination with stochastic variational inference (SVI) and a Hamiltonian-Montecarlo-within-Gibbs sampler (Krawczyk, 2024) using Numpyro (Phan et al., 2019; Bingham et al., 2019). The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data that we consider for our analyses. In Section 3, we provide a brief summary on compound lensing and outline the parameteric and pixelated models we use in this paper. In Section 4, we give a description of the statistical methods that we apply in this work. In Section 5, we present our results, including constraints on the redshift of the halo, and discuss them in detail. Finally, we present our conclusions in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08551v1,Estimating Stellar Atmospheric Parameters and [\alpha/Fe] for LAMOST O-M type Stars Using a Spectral Emulator,"In this paper, we developed a spectral emulator based on the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory Stellar Library (MaStar) and a grouping optimization strategy to estimate effective temperature (T_{\text{eff}}), surface gravity (log g), metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the abundance of alpha elements with respect to iron ([\alpha/Fe]) for O-M-type stars within the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) low-resolution spectra. The primary aim is to use a rapid spectral-fitting method, specifically the spectral emulator with the grouping optimization strategy, to create a comprehensive catalog for stars of all types within LAMOST, addressing the shortcomings in parameter estimations for both cold and hot stars present in the official LAMOST AFGKM-type catalog. This effort is part of our series of studies dedicated to establishing an empirical spectral library for LAMOST. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effectively applicable to parameter prediction for LAMOST, with the single-machine processing time within 70 hr. We observed that the internal error dispersions for T_{\text{eff}}, log g, [Fe/H], and [\alpha/Fe] across different spectral types lie within the ranges of 15-594 K, 0.03-0.27 dex, 0.02-0.10 dex, and 0.01-0.04 dex, respectively, indicating a good consistency. A comparative analysis with external data highlighted deficiencies in the official LAMOST catalog and issues with MaStar parameters, as well as potential limitations of our method in processing spectra with strong emission lines and bad pixels. The derived atmospheric parameters as a part of this work are available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101402/.","A main task of modern astrophysics is to understand when and how galaxies formed and evolved. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, offers a unique opportunity to study galaxies in considerable detail by measuring and analyzing the properties of stars (Jurić et al., 2008; Ivezić et al., 2008). The principal properties of stars, such as effective temperature (T_{\text{eff}}), surface gravity (log g), metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the abundance of alpha elements with respect to iron ([\alpha/Fe]), can be measured from spectra. At present, more and more large surveys, such as the Radial Velocity Experiment (Steinmetz et al. 2006), the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE; Yanny et al. 2009), the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST; Zhao et al. 2012; Cui et al. 2012; Luo et al. 2015), the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (De Silva et al. 2015), the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE; Majewski et al. 2017), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS; Almeida et al. 2023), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI; DESI Collaboration et al. 2016a, 2016b; Abareshi et al. 2022), Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2023), the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer (Jin et al. 2023b), the Multi-Object Optical and Near-infrared Spectrograph (Cirasuolo et al. 2020), the upcoming the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (de Jong et al. 2022), the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST; Gong et al. 2019), provide a large amount of spectra to help us understand the evolution and chemical formation of the Milky Way and even the Universe. These large surveys have been specially designed to yield full sets of atmospheric parameters for a wide variety of stars, and the methods for constructing spectral emulators 111Spectral Emulator: A method using machine learning to map stellar parameters to spectra (Czekala et al., 2015; Tabernero et al., 2022). based on theoretical and empirical spectral libraries are the most widely used spectroscopic techniques for determining stellar atmospheric parameters. Their widespread adoption is evidenced by a variety of publicly available implementations within the community. These methods are foundational to several analytical tools, including the SEGUE atmospheric parameter Pipeline (Lee et al. 2011), My God It’s Full Of Stars (Sbordone et al. 2014), the LAMOST atmospheric parameter Pipeline (LASP; Luo et al. 2015), the APOGEE atmospheric parameter and Chemical Abundance Pipeline (Pérez et al. 2016), Self-consistent ab initio Fitting of Stellar Spectra (The Payne; Ting et al. 2019), Spectrophotometric Modeling of Stars in the Gaia Era (MINESweeper; Cargile et al. 2020), the LAMOST atmospheric parameter Pipeline for M-type stars (LASPM; Du et al. 2021), and a Bayesian code to infer stellar atmospheric parameters using spectral emulators (STEPARSYN; Tabernero et al. 2022). However, the aforementioned methods have certain limitations. For instance, the spectral emulators for atmospheric parameter determination often involves \chi^{2} optimization, a process that has always been extremely time consuming, especially for millions of spectra. Furthermore, while these methods perform well in predicting parameters for FGK-type stars, catalogues have generally struggled to provide reliable parameters for stars outside of the FGK regime, such as OBA and M stars. For the LAMOST survey, such a vast data set also includes O-M-type stars, but currently, LAMOST has not officially provided atmospheric parameters for O- and B-type stars, and issues still exist in the parameters of A- and M-type stars. Considering the above problems, we used a spectral emulator based on the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) Stellar Library (MaStar; Yan et al. 2019; Abdurro’uf et al. 2022) and the new proposed strategy of grouping optimization to estimate T_{\text{eff}}, log g, [Fe/H], and [\alpha/Fe] for O-M-type stars within the LAMOST low-resolution spectra. Our spectral emulator, integrating a principal component analysis (PCA; Abdi & Williams 2010; Jolliffe & Cadima 2016) and Gaussian process regression (GPR; Rasmussen & Williams 2005), produces spectra for specified T_{\text{eff}}, log g, [Fe/H], and [\alpha/Fe]. The grouping optimization strategy was employed to achieve a balance between efficiency and accuracy in solving for the minimum \chi^{2}. Experimental results show that the combination of the spectral emulator and grouping optimization strategy yields reliable atmospheric parameter predictions while enhancing the efficiency of the spectral-fitting method, making it suitable for large-scale surveys. The measurements of LAMOST low-resolution atmospheric parameters using this approach are viable for the subsequent establishment of an empirical spectral library for LAMOST. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We introduce methodology in Section 2, including motivation and workflow. Then, we describe the data sets used in this work in Section 3. We discuss the results and compare them to those in previous works in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section 5."

Using OH Main Line Masers","Circumstellar OH maser lines are useful for studying the dynamics of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) around evolved stars. This study aims to identify CSEs around cold stars bf, which exhibit deviations from the spherical expansion, by comparing the velocity ranges of the OH main lines (1665/1667 MHz) with those of the satellite line (1612 MHz), using a database of circumstellar OH maser sources. We performed this comparison for 377 circumstellar OH maser sources. In addition, using infrared two-color diagrams, we examined the evolutionary stages and infrared properties of objects showing velocity excess (velocity excess means the detection of the main lines outside the velocity range of the satellite line). A periodicity analysis of the WISE light curves was also carried out. As a result of the velocity range comparison, eight circumstellar OH maser sources were found to exhibit velocity excess. The infrared colors of these objects match those of post-AGB stars. Periodic variations were observed in the WISE light curves of five of these eight objects. The results suggest that examining velocity excess of the main lines relative to the satellite line is scientifically significant because mainline masers probe the CSE dynamics over a broader range of evolutionary stages compared to the 22.235 GHz H2O maser line. Additionally, during the post-AGB phase, the emission regions of the mainline and 22.235 GHz H2O masers may overlap in a CSE, whereas they originate from different regions during the AGB phase.","Maser lines are frequently detected in the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of evolved stars undergoing active mass loss, such as Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, post-AGB stars, and red supergiants (RSGs). Specifically, maser lines of OH, \rm H_{2}O, and SiO molecules are commonly found in the oxygen-rich CSEs of these stars, where the number of oxygen atoms exceeds that of carbon atoms. Recently, it has been suggested that these circumstellar masers may also be observed in red nova remnants (RNRs), which result from stellar mergers between two main-sequence stars or between a main-sequence star and an evolved low- or intermediate-mass star (Deguchi et al., 2005a; Ortiz-León et al., 2020). Observations of circumstellar maser lines provide valuable insights into the morphology and kinematics of the circumstellar molecular gas. Despite extensive observations of circumstellar maser sources since the late 1970s, efforts to compile the observed data into a comprehensive database have been relatively limited until recently. Early works, such as those by te Lintel Hekkert et al. (1989) and Benson et al. (1990), have diminished in scientific value over time, partly due to their limited scope and the lack of updates. Recently, Engels & Bunzel (2015) compiled and organized observational data on the three circumstellar OH maser lines (1612 MHz, 1665 MHz, and 1667 MHz) and released an online database111https://hsweb.hs.uni-hamburg.de/projects/maserdb//. This database has been updated from time-to-time since its initial release in 2015 and contains nearly up-to-date information as of 2024. The same group is also compiling a database of circumstellar \rm H_{2}O maser sources, with some of the collected data (excluding non-detections) available as an appendix in Fan et al. (2024). Fan et al. (2024) analyzed the database of circumstellar \rm H_{2}O and OH maser sources to identify water fountain (WF) candidates by comparing the velocity ranges of the 1612 MHz OH and 22.235 GHz \rm H_{2}O maser lines. A WF is a low- to intermediate-mass evolved star with a small-scale, high-velocity, highly collimated molecular jet at the center of the CSE (Imai et al., 2012). Evolved stars with low to intermediate mass undergo a transformation in the morphology of their CSE from spherical to non-spherical as they progress from the AGB to the planetary nebula (PN) phase. However, the physical processes driving this morphological evolution are not yet fully understood. WFs are considered as key objects for studying this evolution, as they represent a phase immediately following the onset of the morphological transition from spherical to non-spherical. WF is classically defined as a circumstellar 22.235 GHz H2O maser source, with a velocity range exceeding 100 km s-1. However, from an astrophysical perspective, WF describes an object where a bipolar molecular outflow has just begun to form near the center of a spherically symmetric, expanding envelope developed during the AGB phase. To identify such objects, Fan et al. (2024) established a selection criterion wherein the velocity range of the 22.235 GHz H2O maser exceeds that of the 1612 MHz OH maser line. In this paper, we refer to cases where the velocity range of a maser line surpasses that of the 1612 MHz OH maser line as a ”velocity excess.” WF candidates selected based on this H2O maser velocity excess may not strictly conform to the classical definition of WF. Rather, as Fan et al. (2024) discussed, these candidates may represent WFs at an earlier evolutionary stage than those traditionally classified as WFs. Fan et al. (2024) identified 11 sources based on the velocity excess of the 22.235 GHz H2O maser line. The selection criteria set by Fan et al. (2024) were designed to detect high-velocity gas components, such as bipolar jets, within the spherically expanding envelope formed during the AGB phase. However, the criteria proposed by Fan et al. (2024) may select not only WFs but also CSEs with kinematic components deviating from spherical expansion, such as the RNRs mentioned earlier. Whether the object is a WF, an RNR, or another type, CSEs with non-spherical kinematic components are considered to contain many astrophysically interesting features. For a subset of the sample, Fan et al. (2024) compared the velocity ranges of the OH satellite line (1612 MHz) with those of the OH main lines (1665 MHz and 1667 MHz). Interestingly, they found that in two sources, the velocity ranges of the OH main lines exceeded those of the OH satellite line (IRAS 18251–1048 and IRAS 22516+0838). In the case of these two sources, the 1665 MHz OH and/or 1667 MHz OH lines were detected outside the double peak of the 1612 MHz OH maser line (i.e., they find the velocity excess of the 1665/1667 MHz OH lines). In a spherically expanding CSE, the 1612 MHz OH maser line typically exhibits a double-peaked profile, where the velocity separation between the peaks is known to be twice the expansion velocity of the spherical CSE. Therefore, this result suggests (1) the presence of velocity components within the CSE that deviate from spherical expansion, and (2) that these irregular kinematic components can be detected in the 1665 MHz OH and/or 1667 MHz OH lines. Since the main objective of Fan et al. (2024) was to compare the velocity ranges of the 1612 MHz OH and 22.235 GHz \rm H_{2}O lines, the comparison between the OH satellite (1612 MHz) and main lines (1665 MHz and 1667 MHz) was limited to a small sample. In the present study, we performed a thorough comparison of the velocity ranges of the OH satellite and main lines using the latest version of the database of circumstellar OH maser sources (Engels & Bunzel, 2015). Our goal is to identify circumstellar OH maser sources where the velocity range of the OH main lines exceeds that of the OH satellite line. Additionally, we utilized catalogs of known AGB and post-AGB stars to establish evolutionary tracks on infrared two-color diagrams. We then investigated the infrared properties of the selected sources exhibiting kinematic irregularities in the OH maser lines by comparing them with known samples of AGB and post-AGB stars. For simplicity, we will refer to the 1612 MHz OH maser line as the satellite line and the 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz OH maser lines as the main lines. We will refer to the 22.235 GHz H2O maser line simply as the H2O maser line. As there are two main lines, the rest frequency is mentioned when it is necessary to distinguish between them."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08134v1,The EDGES measurement  an excess radio background during the cosmic dawn,"In 2018 the EDGES experiment claimed the first detection of the global cosmic 21cm signal, which featured an absorption trough centered around z\sim 17 with a depth of approximately -500mK. This amplitude is deeper than the standard prediction (in which the radio background is determined by the cosmic microwave background) by a factor of two and potentially hints at the existence of a radio background excess. While this result was obtained by fitting the data with a phenomenological flattened-Gaussian shape for the cosmological signal, here we develop a physical model for the inhomogeneous radio background sourced by the first galaxies hosting population III stars. Star formation in these galaxies is quenched at lower redshifts due to various feedback mechanisms, so they serve as a natural candidate for the excess radio background hinted by EDGES, without violating present day measurements by ARCADE2. We forward-model the EDGES sky temperature data, jointly sampling our physical model for the cosmic signal, a foreground model, and residual calibration errors. We compare the Bayesian evidences obtained by varying the complexity and prior ranges for the systematics. We find that the data is best explained by a model with seven log-polynomial foreground terms, and that it requires calibration residuals. Interestingly, the presence of a cosmic 21cm signal with a non-standard depth is decisively disfavored. This is contrary to previous EDGES analysis in the context of extra radio background models, serving as a caution against using a “pseudo-likelihood” built on a model (flattened Gaussian) that is different from the one being used for inference. We make our simulation code and associated emulator publicly-available.","By mapping out the first half of our observable Universe, the cosmological 21cm signal from neutral hydrogen promises to revolutionize astrophysics and cosmology. Experimental efforts to detect this signal fall into two categories. Interferometers like the Square Kilometre Array (SKA; e.g. Mellema et al. 2013), Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA; Abdurashidova et al. 2022), Low Frequency Array (LOFAR; van Haarlem et al. 2013) and Murchison Widefield Array (MWA; Tingay et al. 2013) are dedicated to measuring the spatial fluctuations of the 21 cm brightness temperature T_{21}. Alternatively, global experiments including EDGES (Bowman et al. 2018b), SARAS (Singh et al. 2018; Bevins et al. 2022), REACH (de Lera Acedo et al. 2022), MIST (Monsalve et al. 2024) and LEDA (Greenhill & Bernardi 2012) aim to detect the spatially-averaged (global) 21 cm signal \bar{T}_{21}, The first detection of the cosmic 21 cm signal was claimed by the EDGES experiment in 2018 (Bowman et al. 2018b, hereafter B18), which measured a flattened \bar{T}_{21} absorption profile centered around z\sim 17 with an amplitude of 500^{+500}_{-200}mK (at 99% credible interval). A subsequent Bayesian reanalysis of the entire signal chain by Murray et al. (2022) confirmed the presence of such a signal in the data. This signal is about twice as deep as the maximum amplitude allowed by standard models in which baryons cool at most adiabatically and the radio background is dominated by the cosmic microwave background (CMB). As has been pointed out in many previous studies, a cosmological origin for the EDGES signal necessitates either extra gas cooling, e.g. via interaction between dark matter (DM) and baryons (Barkana 2018; Muñoz & Loeb 2018; Berlin et al. 2018), early gas-CMB decoupling in early dark energy models (Hill & Baxter 2018), or an excess radio background component in addition to the CMB (Feng & Holder 2018; Ewall-Wice et al. 2018; Mirocha & Furlanetto 2019; Ewall-Wice et al. 2020; Reis et al. 2020). It is very challenging to perform accurate inference from the global 21cm signal. Astrophysical and terrestrial foregrounds are 4 to 6 orders of magnitude brighter than the cosmological signal (e.g. Pritchard & Loeb 2012; Hibbard et al. 2023) and unlike interferometers, global 21cm experiments cannot clean the signal by comparing different pointings and sightlines (e.g. Nasirudin et al. 2020). In addition to astrophysical foregrounds, other systematics such as the Earth’s ionosphere (e.g. Datta et al. 2016; Shen et al. 2021), antenna beam effects (e.g. Mahesh et al. 2021; Sims et al. 2023), and signal-chain defects (e.g. Monsalve et al. 2017; Murray et al. 2022) can further obscure the signal and potentially lead to false reconstructions (Tauscher et al. 2020; Hibbard et al. 2023). Therefore, the interpretation of the EDGES results requires detailed characterisation of these contaminants together with the cosmic signal, with all of the resulting parameters being constrained through Bayesian inference. The 21cm signal reported in B18 was obtained by fitting the EDGES sky temperature data with a flat-Gaussian \bar{T}_{21} profile and a 5-term polynomial foreground model. Subsequent analysis in Hills et al. 2018; Singh & Subrahmanyan 2019 showed that the best-fit profile found in B18 requires an un-physical foreground, and that the EDGES data can also be fit with multiple \bar{T}_{21} shapes that are different from those used in B18. Sims & Pober 2020 (hereafter SP20) extended these analyses by considering a set of models with various combinations of the cosmic signal, residual calibration systematics and foregrounds. After comparing the Bayesian evidence for a total of 128 models, SP20 found that models that are not strongly disfavored included a flattened Gaussian cosmic signal with a non-standard depth and sinusoidal calibration residuals. Subsequent data from the SARAS3 experiment disfavored the presence of an EDGES-like cosmic signal (Singh et al. 2022). It is somewhat surprising that many analyses reached different conclusions about the existence and/or depth of the cosmic 21cm profile in EDGES data. Ideally, any interpretation should use self-consistent forward models with physically-informed priors. The vast majority of radio excess and gas cooling analysis (see e.g. Ewall-Wice et al. 2018; Barkana 2018; Muñoz & Loeb 2018; Mirocha & Furlanetto 2019; Ewall-Wice et al. 2020; Reis et al. 2020) instead compute a ”pseudo likelihood” using only a summary of the data, typically the center and (or) width of the B18 profile. This approach is intrinsically problematic since the B18 profile was computed assuming a phenomenological ”flattened Gaussian” \bar{T}_{21} and therefore cannot be interpreted directly with a different (e.g. physical) model for the \bar{T}_{21}.111A CMB analogy to this common approach would be if one took the best fit EoR history from Planck obtained assuming a phenomenological tanh shape, \hat{x}_{\rm HII,tanh}(z), and then performed inference using a physical, galaxy-driven model for the EoR history, x_{\rm HII,gal}(z), but constructing a Gaussian likelihood around \hat{x}_{\rm HII,tanh}(z)-x_{\rm HII,gal}(z). To our knowledge, this has not been done in CMB analyses. Here we directly forward model the EDGES sky temperature data, comparing the Bayesian evidence for a range of foreground models and residual calibration systematics. Unlike the analytic and phenomenological models used in B18, SP20 and Murray et al. 2022, we build on the cosmological 21cmFAST simulation code (e.g. Mesinger et al. 2011; Murray et al. 2020), including an inhomogeneous, excess radio background sourced from the first, molecular-cooling galaxies that are hosted by \sim 10^{5}-10^{8}M_{\odot} halos. These primordial galaxies are expected to be dominated by metal-free, so-called population III (Pop III) stars and their remnants, which could have very different properties compared to later generations (e.g. Woosley et al. 2002; Heger et al. 2003). For simplicity, we refer to molecular-cooling galaxies as ”Pop III galaxies” in this work. Later generations of galaxies form out of Pop III galaxy seeds, and mainly reside in more massive dark matter halos (>10^{8}M_{\odot}) for which atomic cooling is efficient. Analogously to Pop III galaxies, here we will refer to atomic cooling galaxies as Pop II galaxies, as most of their stellar population is formed out of pre-enriched gas (e.g. Bromm & Larson 2004; Trenti 2010; Salvaterra et al. 2011). Previously it was shown in Mirocha & Furlanetto 2019 and Reis et al. 2020 that in order for Pop II galaxies to reproduce the amplitude of the B18 feature, the corresponding radio background would exceed present-day measurements from the Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics, and Diffuse Emission 2 (ARCADE2; Fixsen et al. 2011) by orders of magnitude. This tension was resolved in an ad-hoc manner by introducing a phenomenological redshift cut-off parameter, z_{\rm off} (see e.g. Mirocha & Furlanetto 2019; Reis et al. 2020; Sikder et al. 2023, 2024), below which galactic radio emission is quenched. In contrast, Pop III galaxies are susceptible to feedback from the Lyman-Werner (LW) background (e.g. Qin et al. 2020a; Muñoz et al. 2022) which eventually sterilizes star formation inside them. As a result, the radio emission from Pop III galaxies decays naturally once a LW background is established, making Pop III galaxies a natural candidate to explain EDGES while being consistent with ARCADE2 measurements. In this work, we determine whether the EDGES data prefers such a physical model for a high-redshift radio-background excess. We forward-model the global signal varying Pop III galaxy properties, foregrounds and systematics/calibration residuals. We vary the complexity of the foreground and systematics models, comparing their Bayesian evidences. We include complementary data from ARCADE2 and Planck. To speed up the inference, we train an emulator of summary observables in our model, providing it as a new option in the public 21cmEMU 222https://github.com/21cmfast/21cmEMU package (Breitman et al. 2023). The paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 reviews the EDGES observation, while Sec. 3 details our model for Pop III radio galaxy. We build some physical intuition about our model with an illustrative example in Sec. 4 and then discuss our model for foreground emission and systematics in Sec. 5. Our likelihoods and inference methodology are detailed in Secs. 6 and 7, respectively. Sec. 8 shows our results. Finally we present discussions and caveats in Sec. 9 and conclude in Sec. 10. We assume \Lambda{\rm CDM} cosmology with the relevant parameters set by Planck 2018 results (Aghanim et al. 2020): H_{0}=67.66\ {\rm kms^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}, \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.6903, \Omega_{{\rm m}}=0.3096, \Omega_{{\rm c}}=0.2607, \Omega_{{\rm b}}=0.0489, \ln(10^{10}A_{\rm s})=3.047, n_{\rm s}=0.967."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08120v1,Molecular Distributions and Abundances in the Binary-Shaped Outflow of V Hya,"Binaries are known to play a key role in the mass loss and dynamical environments of evolved stars. Stellar and sub-stellar companion interactions produce complex wind morphologies including rotating/expanding disks, bipolar outflows, and spiral wind patterns; however, the connection between these many structures and the gas phase chemistry they harbor is not well-constrained. To expand the sample of chemical inventories in interacting systems, we present a detailed spectroscopic case study of the binary C-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star V Hya. Using spatially resolved ALMA observations at Bands 3, 6 and 7, we characterize the rotational emission lines and distributions of molecules in its surrounding disk undergoing dynamical expansion (DUDE). We detect emission from over 15 molecules and isotopologues toward this source, and present resolved maps for the brightest tracers of carbonaceous chemistry (e.g. \ceCCH, \ceC4H, \ceHC5N, \ceHNC, \ceCH3CN). Employing LTE and non-LTE models of emission from the DUDE, we estimate the abundance distributions for optically thin species, and compare them with prototypical carbon-rich AGB envelopes. We find that the average abundances of detected species are within a factor of {\sim}5 from sources with similar mass-loss rates; however, the distribution of daughter species in V Hya is much more compact, with carbon chain species (\ceCCH, \ceC4H, \ceHC3N) appearing with abundances >10-7 even in the innermost sampled regions (200 au) of the disk.","The circumstellar envelopes of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are known for their rich molecular composition and their instrumental role in the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM). It is estimated that these evolved stars contribute {\sim}80% of recycled interstellar gas, {\sim}30% of newly formed dust grains, in addition to a significant fraction of aromatic molecules (Tielens et al., 2005; Zeichner et al., 2023). The type of enrichment is primarily dependent on the surface chemistry of the progenitor star, as circumstellar outflows typically exhibit either oxygen-rich (C/O<1) or carbon-rich (C/O>1) chemistry. In the traditional picture of circumstellar chemistry, gas phase molecules in AGB envelopes are produced in two stages, with parent species forming in the extended stellar atmosphere of the star. Then as they travel outward and the density decreases, kinetics and photochemistry dominate, producing a wide variety of daughter molecules (e.g. Höfner & Olofsson, 2018). For C-rich environments, circumstellar chemistry is primarily understood through observations of the nearby carbon star IRC+10216 and its rich chemistry comprising over 100 uniquely identified molecules (McGuire, 2022); however, the applicability of this example to all other sources is still largely unconstrained. Unnikrishnan et al. (2024) recently studied the chemical inventories of three carbon stars with comparable mass-loss rates to IRC+10216 (II Lup, V358 Lup, and AI Vol), finding molecular abundances consistent across sources, indicating that IRC+10216 is indeed a good prototype for this chemistry. A remaining question; however, is whether this molecular framework changes when moving to more dynamically complex stellar wind structures that we now know to be commonplace. Recently, the prevalence of binary interactions has greatly impacted our understanding of dynamical evolution in AGB and Red Supergiant (RSG) environments. The ATOMIUM111ALMA tracing the origins of molecules forming dust in oxygen-rich M-type stars survey revealed a vast array of AGB wind morphologies likely induced by stellar and substellar companions (Decin et al., 2020). These structures can be broadly categorized into two groups, depending on orbital characteristics of the system. Spirals structures are associated with high mass-loss rates and wide companions, and can be observed in objects such as CIT 6, AFGL 3068, and R Scl (Kim et al., 2015; Guerrero et al., 2020; Maercker et al., 2016). In contrast, equatorial density enhancements and disks are more prominent in short period systems, like \pi^{1} Gru and R Aqr (Chiu et al., 2006; Liimets et al., 2018). In addition to the dynamical shaping, stellar companions are believed to have an impact on the chemistry of their surrounding envelope. This was first found theoretically by Van de Sande & Millar (2022), who showed that embedded binaries can provide sufficient visible and UV flux to drive photochemistry at locations in the envelope where it is usually inefficient. Siebert et al. (2022) later invoked a solar-type binary companion to reproduce observed abundances of \ceHC3N in the inner layers of IRC+10216. Furthermore, Danilovich et al. (2024) recently found evidence of companion-driven chemistry imprinted in the outflow of the highly elliptical system W Aql. The full scope of binary-outflow chemical interactions are still not well-constrained, and given the range of physical structures produced in these environments, unbiased line surveys of objects at different stages of evolution are crucial to building up this picture. V Hya is a C-rich AGB star at a distance of 400 pc (Sahai et al., 2022) with a strongly-interacting, short-period stellar companion (P{\sim}17 yr, a{\sim}11 au Planquart et al., 2024). It displays a far-UV excess which could be associated with this companion or an accompanying accretion disk (Sahai et al., 2008). On much larger scales, V Hya is surrounded by a disk undergoing dynamical expansion (DUDE) comprising several concentric toroidal rings, in addition to episodic bipolar bullet-like ejections (Hirano et al., 2004; Sahai et al., 2009, 2016; Scibelli et al., 2019). The observed total mass-loss rate of these components is quite high (2.45\times 10^{-5} M☉ yr-1; Knapp et al., 1997)222Sum of mass-loss rates derived from three observed velocity components at 15, 45, and 200 km s-1, indicating it is a very evolved source nearing the end of the AGB. The equatorial structure and hints of bipolarity in V Hya suggest the beginnings of the much more dramatic morphologies that are common in proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe) (Olofsson et al., 2019; Sahai et al., 2017). The dense waists of these post-AGB objects have been shown as efficient sites of dust growth during this period of rapid stellar evolution (Sahai et al., 2006), so characterizing molecular processing in their nascent stages is relevant to understanding their overall chemical yields. V Hya is a unique transitory source that is well-poised to reveal new insights into chemistry in this important type of binary-induced geometry. In this paper, we present an interferometric spectral line study of this source using available ALMA data to constrain its gas phase molecular inventory. Using these observations we aim to characterize the dominant chemical processes throughout this unique source, and compare it with previous studies of more spherical C-rich AGB targets. In Section 2, we summarize the observations and data reduction. In Section 3, we present the spectra and detected molecular lines, as well as spatially resolved maps of key species.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08116v1,Jet Archaeology and Forecasting: Image Variability and Magnetic Field Configuration,"We investigate how magnetic field variations around accreting black holes on event horizon scales affect the morphology of magnetically-driven jet on larger scales. By performing radiative transfer calculations on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we find that temporal variation in the magnetic flux on the event horizon and the jet power are imprinted on the variability of jet width up to several hundred gravitational radii. When the magnetic flux around the black hole drops and then rises, the jet initially narrows or becomes truncated, then widens, creating a thin-thick pattern that propagates down the jet. This suggests that extended jet observations can provide a history record of horizon-scale magnetic field dynamics, and conversely, upcoming changes in the jet image can be predicted from direct observation of the magnetized accreting plasma near the black hole. Furthermore, the pattern of jet width variations shows acceleration up to the relativistic regime as it moves away from the black hole, aligning with plasma bulk motion. We also find in time-averaged images that both the bulk plasma motion and magnetic field configuration in the jet-launching region, which are sensitive to black hole spin, shape diverse features through relativistic beaming and aberration. Higher black hole spins result in more poloidal bulk motion and toroidal magnetic fields, leading to more symmetric jet images and linear polarization patterns. These results suggest a new method for testing the magnetically arrested disk model and the Blandford-Znajek process, and for determining the black hole spin through observations bridging horizon and jet-launching scales.","In recent years, very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration have achieved direct imaging of supermassive black holes (BH) in the centers of nearby galaxies on event horizon scales (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2019a, 2022; see also Lu et al., 2023). M87, one of the primary targets, has a well-studied jet that has now been imaged from scales of sub-mpc to \sim80 kpc (e.g., de Gasperin et al., 2012; Hada et al., 2016; Walker et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2023). Upgrades and extensions to the EHT via the next-generation EHT (ngEHT) project and Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) will achieve at least a resolution of 5 \muas (micro-arcseconds) at 230 GHz and a dynamic range close to 1000, from which movies connecting the inner accretion disk to the jet will be possible (Doeleman et al., 2023; Johnson et al., 2024). Thus, jet simulations providing detailed predictions at high-resolution and in the time domain are of timely importance. So far, polarized EHT images favor strongly magnetized Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) models over their more weakly magnetized Standard And Normal Evolution (SANE) counterparts, the latter of which tend to be more weakly polarized and less consistent with multi-wavelength constraints (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2021a, 2019b, 2024). In MAD models, the magnetic field advected along with the accreting plasma saturates and becomes dynamically important, leading to non-axisymmetric structures in the inflow and efficient launching of jets (Narayan et al., 2003; Igumenshchev et al., 2003). MADs also exhibit disruptive magnetic reconnection or “flux eruption events,” which offer an electron acceleration mechanism hypothesized to explain multi-wavelength polarized flares (e.g., Dexter et al., 2020; Ripperda et al., 2022; Chatterjee & Narayan, 2022; Najafi-Ziyazi et al., 2024). MAD models accelerate efficient relativistic jets powered by the spin-energy of the BH, tapped by magnetic fields threading the horizon (Blandford & Znajek, 1977; BZ process; see also Tchekhovskoy et al., 2011). It will be important to verify predictions of MAD models with observations in the jet launching region as well. Previous observational studies have explored variable features of parsec-scale jets after X- and gamma-ray flares (for example, light curve; Pushkarev et al., 2010; relativistic blobs; Jorstad et al., 2001, 2013; jet orientation; Rani et al., 2014; and jet base; Niinuma et al., 2015; Lisakov et al., 2017). These high-energy flares can be associated with eruptive events in the vicinity of the BH (Tavecchio et al., 2010; Rani et al., 2014; Broderick & Tchekhovskoy, 2015; see also Schinzel et al., 2012; Marscher, 2014 for another possibility of the flares taking place far from the BH). Most recently, The Event Horizon Telescope-Multi-wavelength science working group et al. (2024) reported changes in the position angle of the M87 jet orientation andthe bright spot on the M87* ring at the same time with a gamma-ray flare in 2018, though the emission origin of the flare and its relation to the jet orientation are uncertain. Polarization images can also be a strong tool to address the magnetically-driven jet mechanism and have attracted a large interest. An ordered linear polarization (LP) vector pattern has been detected around the photon ring (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2021b) and the extended jet (e.g., Walker et al., 2018), which implies the existence of a persistent magnetic field structure bridging these scales. In theoretical approaches, polarization images have been suggested as a tool for inferring black hole spin (Palumbo et al., 2020; Chael et al., 2023; Emami et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Ricarte et al., 2023b; Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2024), although interpreting these images can be challenging due to Faraday effects, particularly Faraday rotation. Studies have also investigated the Faraday effects on the polarization images around the BH (Mościbrodzka et al., 2017; Ricarte et al., 2020; Tsunetoe et al., 2022), as well as relativistic effects from accelerated plasma bulk motion (Laing, 1981; Lyutikov et al., 2005; Broderick & McKinney, 2010; Murphy et al., 2013). It has also been suggested that circular polarization (CP) images can shed new light on the jet mechanism (Tsunetoe et al., 2020, 2021; Ricarte et al., 2021; Mościbrodzka et al., 2021; Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2023; Joshi et al., 2024). On the scale of more extended jets, the effect of magnetic field helicity combined with viewing angle was examined in Laing (1981) and Murphy et al. (2013) using one-zone cylindrical jet models. Kramer & MacDonald (2021) calculated polarization images based on relativistic MHD jet models with different magnetic field configurations, obtaining a bimodal pattern of horizontal and vertical LP vectors to the jet (see also Pariev et al., 2003; Porth et al., 2011). Davelaar et al. (2023) also investigated the effect of waves on shearing flow surfaces on the LP features. Motivated by this previous activity and by upcoming observations, we examine the relationship between the horizon-scale dynamical variability in MAD simulations and the polarized morphology of the jet launching region in synthetic images. Narayan et al. (2022) surveyed the jet and disk morphology in MAD GRMHD simulations for a variety of BH spins and found that the prograde spin cases give wider jets up to 100~{}r_{\rm g} scale than the retrograde cases (see subsection 2.1 for detail). Here r_{\rm g}=GM_{\bullet}/c^{2}, G is the the gravitational constant, M_{\bullet} is the BH mass, and c is the speed of light. Chatterjee et al. (2023) also pointed out that the jet opening and tilt angles at 10~{}r_{\rm g} are correlated and anti-correlated with the normalized magnetic flux, respectively. Here, we focus on the transverse structure of the inner jet image for an M87-like system on a scale \lesssim 100~{}r_{\rm g} (\sim 0.003~{}{\rm pc}\sim 0.37~{}{\rm mas}; milli-arcseconds), which corresponds to \lesssim 300~{}r_{\rm g} if de-projected with the observer’s inclination angle of i=163\arcdeg (or 17\arcdeg). Since the plasma on these scales is being accelerated up to the relativistic regime, the jet morphology in the images is affected by relativistic beaming and aberration effects on the synchrotron radiation. With this in mind, we perform polarimetric general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations based on MAD GRMHD models, to obtain theoretical prediction of images and investigate the relationship between the plasma dynamics and observable image features. This paper is organized as follows. Our methodology is introduced in section 2, which consists of GRMHD simulations (subsection 2.1) and GRRT calculations (subsection 2.2). We describe our main results in section 3, regarding the variability of jet shape in subsections 3.1 and 3.2 and the averaged image features in subsections 3.3. Applications of our results are addressed in section 4, including an estimation of the jet acceleration profile in subsection 4.1, the variability of the jet width in 4.2, correlation between the jet power and width in 4.3, the spin-dependence of polarization images in 4.4, and comparison with observations and contribution of nonthermal electrons in 4.5. Finally, we present a summary and conclusions in section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08106v1,"Intranight optical monitoring of the rare quasar J0950+5128, the brightest known candidate for transition from radio-quiet to radio-loud state","We report a novel pilot project to characterise intra-night optical variability (INOV) of an extremely rare type of quasar, which has recently been caught in the act of transiting from a radio-quiet to radio-loud state, on a decadal time scale. Such rare transitions may signify a recurrence, or conceivably the first switch-on of jet activity in optically luminous quasars. The newly formed jet could well be jittery and unsteady, both in power and direction. The optically brightest among such radio-state transition candidates, the quasar J0950+5128 (z=0.2142), was monitored by us with dense sampling in the R-band, during 2020-21 in 6 sessions, each lasting > 4 hours. This is the first attempt to characterise the INOV properties associated with this recently discovered, extremely rarely observed phenomenon of quasar radio-state transition. The non-detection of INOV in any of the 6 sessions, down to the 1-2% level, amounts to a lack of evidence for a blazar-like optical activity, \sim 2 years after its transition to radio-loud state was found. The only INOV feature detected in J0950+5128 during our observational campaign was a \sim 0.15-mag spike lasting ¡ 6 minutes, seen at 13.97 UT on 18-March-2021. We also report the available optical light curves of this quasar from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, which indicate that it had experienced a phase of INOV activity around the time its transition to the radio-loud state was detected, however that phase did not sustain until the launch of our INOV campaign \sim 2 years later.","Optical monitoring of many individual quasars, radio-loud and radio-quiet, spanning several decades has revealed that large intensity variations ( ¿ 100%) are exclusive to the former category. Prominent examples in this category, showing large outbursts (on month-like time scales), include the blazars AO0235+164: Webb & Smith, 1989; OJ 287: Takalo, 1994; CTA102: Raiteri et al., 2017; 1ES 1927+654: Trakhtenbrot et al., 2019. Traditionally, this signature of strongly beamed jets of energetic particles has not been found associated with radio-quiet quasars (RQQs; e.g., Padovani, 2017), for which only a much milder optical variability is observed even on year-like time scales (e.g., MacLeod et al., 2012; Caplar et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018; Stone et al., 2022; Arévalo et al., 2023). The persistent dichotomy in the degree of variability has led to the common perception that among quasars, any transition from the radio-quiet to radio-loud state does not happen on human time scales, although this almost certainly takes place on time scales of \sim 10^{5-6} years (see, e.g., Reynolds & Begelman, 1997; Czerny et al., 2009; An & Baan, 2012). Such variability time-scales are also expected by extrapolating from the compact stellar binaries, powered by \sim 10M_{\odot} black holes, for which jet-driven large radio variability is often witnessed on hour/day-like time scales (Mirabel & Rodríguez, 1999). However, over the past few years, exceptions to this popular perception about quasars have begun to surface, based on reports of detection of (first-time) switching-on, or restarting, of powerful jet activity in a few quasars, marked by between 6 to 25 fold jump in radio flux at centimetre wavelengths within a time span of at most 15-20 years (Mooley et al., 2016; Kunert-Bajraszewska et al., 2020; Nyland et al., 2020; Wójtowicz et al., 2020; also, Bannister et al., 2011a; Bannister et al., 2011b). The link of this jump in radio emission to newborn jets has been reinforced by the observed Gigahertz-Peaked-Specrtum (GPS) type (evolving) radio spectrum associated with such state transition episodes, as reported in the discovery papers cited above. Indications of changes occurring on such short time scales had earlier come from the targeted Very Large Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) campaigns which revealed nascent radio jets in quasars, with kinematical ages as small as \sim 20 years (Owsianik et al., 1998; Owsianik & Conway, 1998; Gugliucci et al., 2005; Orienti & Dallacasa, 2021). The detection of such young jets has bolstered the prospects of understanding the nature of the trigger for jet activity in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), which sometimes succeeds in pulling them out of the radio-quiet state. Arguably, the best prospect of AGN hosting the earliest cycles of jet activity is to be found in radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert1 (NLS1) galaxies (Mathur, 2000). The existence of relativistic jets in such sources was indisputably established by their detection at gamma-rays (Abdo et al., 2009), supported by independent observations, such as detection of high-amplitude intra-night optical variability (INOV) in several radio-loud NLS1 galaxies (e.g., Liu et al., 2010; Paliya et al., 2013; Kshama et al., 2017; Gopal-Krishna & Wiita, 2018; Paliya, 2019; Ojha et al., 2021). A very striking related clue has come from the discovery of strong, recurrent flares at millimetre wavelengths, on day-like time scales, in several NLS1s which are essentially radio-quiet at centimetre wavelengths (Lähteenmäki et al., 2018)111The presence of relativistic jets in radio-quiet quasars, using millimetric observations, had earlier been inferred by Chini et al. (1989), using the IRAM telescope.. These flares represent jumps in millimetre flux densities by factors of up to 103 in a matter of just a few days! The discovery paper poses the question whether this violent behaviour is a manifestation of an early-stage of AGN activity and whether its source, possibly a jittery and intermittent relativistic jet (see, e.g., Czerny et al., 2009; Lalakos et al., 2022), is still confined within the Broad Line Region (BLR) region and, consequently, subject to free-free absorption, explaining the jet’s faintness at centimetre/metre wavelengths (e.g., Berton et al., 2020). This raises the possibility that a similarly violent activity on hour/day-like time scale might get triggered during the reported episodes of transition of quasars, from a radio-quiet to radio-loud state (see above). Here we attempt to test such a scenario by searching for strong intranight optical variability (INOV) which has now emerged as a reliable diagnostic of AGN activity driven by Doppler-boosted jet, including even the jets forming in low-mass AGN (e.g., Gopal-Krishna et al., 2023 and references therein). The target chosen for our INOV monitoring campaign is the quasar J0950+5128 which is the optically brightest known candidate for radio-quiet to radio-loud state transition (Nyland et al., 2020), out of the discovery of 26 such cases found by these authors to have undergone the radio state transition sometime during the last about two decades. Their radio emergence was unveiled during a comparison of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS, Lacy et al., 2020) epoch 1 observations (2017-2019) with the existing FIRST (Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm; 1993-2011) survey database (Becker et al., 1995). The peak frequencies of the observed GPS spectra of these transition candidates, which have been measured for 14 of them using the Very Large Array (VLA), seem consistent with the very young (radio) ages of these quasars (Nyland et al., 2020), as estimated using the radio size-peak frequency relation established for young AGN jets (O’Dea, 1998; Jeyakumar, 2016). As noted in Nyland et al. (2020), the z=0.2142 quasar J0950+5128 (J095036.75+512838.12), which is powered by a black hole with an estimated mass of 108 M_{\odot}, was not detected in the FIRST survey (hence < 0.44 mJy at 1.4 GHz) in April 1997. In April 2019, however, its flux density was found to have risen to 8.77 mJy at 3 GHz, corresponding to a radio luminosity of 3.7\times 10^{40} erg/s. From VLA observations, its angular size was found to be < 0.16 arcsec at 13.2 GHz (Nyland et al., 2020). The SDSS catalogue gives its r-magnitude as 17.35, making it suitable for intranight monitoring with the 1.3-metre optical telescope accessible to us for this pilot experiment. The details of our optical observations, together with the derived differential light curves (DLCs) for 6 sessions are presented in Sect. 2, followed by a brief discussion of the results in Sect. 4 and the conclusions summarised in Sect. 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08035v1,Simulating continuum-based redshift measurement in the  High Latitude Spectroscopy Survey,"We investigate the capability of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope’s (Roman) Wide-Field Instrument (WFI) G150 slitless grism to detect red, quiescent galaxies based on the current reference survey. We simulate dispersed images for Roman reference High-Latitude Spectroscopic Survey (HLSS) and analyze two-dimensional spectroscopic data using the grism Redshift and Line Analysis (Grizli) software. This study focus on assessing Roman grism’s capability for continuum-level redshift measurement for a redshift range of 0.5\leq z\leq 2.5. The redshift recovery is assessed by setting three requirements of: \sigma_{z}=\frac{\left|z-z_{\mathrm{true}}\right|}{1+z}\leq 0.01, signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) \geq 5 and the presence of a single dominant peak in redshift likelihood function. We find that, for quiescent galxaies, the reference HLSS can reach a redshift recovery completeness of \geq 50\% for F158 magnitude brighter than 20.2 mag. We also explore how different survey parameters, such as exposure time and the number of exposures, influence the accuracy and completeness of redshift recovery, providing insights that could optimize future survey strategies and enhance the scientific yield of the Roman in cosmological research.","Red, quiescent galaxies represent a fundamental component of the cosmic landscape, playing a pivotal role in the study of cosmological evolution and structure formation. These galaxies, characterized by their lack of significant star formation and their red colors due to older stellar populations, serve as important tracers of the mass assembly history of the universe (Slob et al., 2024; Choi et al., 2014; Beverage et al., 2024; Zhuang et al., 2023; Khullar et al., 2022; Marsan et al., 2022). Understanding the distribution and properties of red, quiescent galaxies across cosmic time provides insights into the mechanisms that drive galaxy evolution and the influence of environment on these processes. In cosmology, red, quiescent galaxies are often utilized as proxies for identifying high-density environments like galaxy clusters and groups. The presence of the 4000Å break in their spectra makes them ideal candidates for accurate redshift estimation. Due to their brightness and distinct spectral features, these galaxies are easily detectable over a wide range of redshifts, making them ideal probes for studying the large-scale structure of the universe, such as with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) (DESI Collaboration et al., 2024; Percival et al., 2007; Carnero Rosell et al., 2022; Eifler et al., 2021) and Galaxy Clustering (GC) (Padmanabhan et al., 2007; Pandey et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2024; Sailer et al., 2024; White et al., 2022). Based on the current reference survey design, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will conduct an infrared (IR) survey over a \sim2000 deg2 area as part of the High Latitude Wide Area Survey (HLWAS; Spergel et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2022) to enable weak lensing and clustering measurements. During its 5-year prime mission, Roman will conduct the HLWAS which includes an imaging component (High Latitude Image Survey; HLIS) and a spectroscopic component (High Latitude Spectroscopic Survey; HLSS). The HLSS has a slitless grism component. In particular, the Roman grism enables spectroscopy with resolution of 600 over wavelength range of \lambda=1-1.93\mu m, which is capable of probing red, quiescent galaxies at high redshift by capturing the 4000 Å break redshifted into the coverage of the grism. While the primary target of the Roman grism is emission line galaxies (ELGs), specifically those with H\alpha and [OIII] lines, which are critical for BAO and Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) measurements (Eifler et al., 2021), it is also worth noting that several previous studies (see, e.g., Ryan et al., 2007; Joshi et al., 2019; D’Eugenio et al., 2021) have shown that continuum-based redshifts derived from low-resolution grism spectroscopy and photometry based on 4000Å or Balmer breaks can also provide reasonably accurate redshift determinations (on the order of {\sim}1-2%). One of the earlier works by Gladders & Yee (2000) showed that a {\sim}10% redshift accuracy can be expected for galaxies in clusters in certain redshift ranges with just a color cut using two filters. Joshi et al. (2019) also showed that the expected number of red galaxies exhibiting a 4000Å break is comparable to ELGs with prominent emission lines, albeit with higher redshift uncertainty, allowing for the analysis of a much larger sample relative to a sample with just ELGs. Furthermore, previous studies have confirmed the presence of red, quiescent galaxies at high redshifts up to z\ {\approx}\ 4 with VANDELS survey (Carnall et al., 2019, 2020), the Hubble Space Telescope grism WFC3/G141 (Whitaker et al., 2013; D’Eugenio et al., 2021) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec spectroscopy (Nanayakkara et al., 2024; Carnall et al., 2024). Consequently, the Roman grism could potentially yield a substantial amount of information about red, quiescent galaxies at z>1 given its NIR coverage and wide survey area of 2000\deg^{2}. Depending on the sample size, this dataset could be used independently or combined with other samples to enhance analyses, such as those for BAO and galaxy clustering. Efforts have been make to assess the performance of the spectroscopic components of Roman. For example, Wang et al. (2022) simulated Roman grism images based on a proposed reference survey design, Joshi et al. (2022) simulated Roman P127 prism observations to quantify the efficiency of recovered Type Ia supernova redshifts as a function of exposure time, and Wold et al. (2023) simulated and proposed an observing strategy for the Roman grism deep fields to study high redshift Lyman-\alpha emitters. This paper primarily focuses on assessing the impact of exposure time on the redshift recovery efficiency of red galaxies with the Roman grism. We use simulated direct images for Roman HLIS from Troxel et al. (2023) as input to simulate and analyze two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy images through the Roman grism with the Grism Redshift and Line Analysis software, Grizli111https://github.com/gbrammer/grizli (Brammer, 2019). Our study specifically targets the redshift estimation of red, quiescent galaxies in these simulations. We estimate redshifts using two separate packages – Grizli and Bagpipes222https://bagpipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (Carnall et al., 2018, 2019). This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the simulation tool and inputs used to simulate Roman grism images. In Section 3, we provide an overview of Grizli’s contamination modeling and redshift fitting pipeline. Section 4 details our selection criteria for choosing red galaxies with accurate redshift estimations in our simulations. We present and discuss the results in Section 5. Finally, we summarize our findings."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07988v1,"Lecture notes for the 52 (March 2023) Saas-Fee Advanced School, Switzerland.","These are exciting times for studies of galaxy formation and the growth of structures. New observatories and advanced simulations are revolutionising our understanding of the cycling of matter into, through, and out of galaxies. This chapter first describes why baryons are essential for galaxy evolution, providing a key test of \Lambda-Cold Dark Matter cosmological model. In particular, we describe a basic framework to convert measurements of the gas properties observed in absorption spectra into global estimates of the condensed (stars and cold gas) matter mass densities. We then review our current understanding of the cycling of baryons from global to galactic scales, in the so-called circumgalactic medium. The final sections are dedicated to future prospects, identifying new techniques and up-coming facilities as well as key open questions. This chapter is complemented with a series of hands-on exercises which provide a practical guide to using publicly available hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Beyond providing a direct connection between new observations and advanced simulations, these exercises give the reader the necessary tools to make use of these theoretical models to address their own science questions. Ultimately, our increasingly accurate description of the circumgalactic medium reveals its crucial role in transforming the pristine early Universe into the rich and diverse Universe of the present day.","1 The Baryon Census While tremendously successful, the \Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (\Lambda-CDM) model of cosmology remains incomplete. Indeed, 95% of the expected matter-energy content is in a form which is currently unknown. The \Lambda-CDM model posits the need of an elusive matter component, coined dark matter, which together with the dark energy dominate the Universe’s matter-energy budget. Figure 1 provides a visual representation of this. Figure 1: A visual representation of the Universe’s matter-energy budget. Dark energy is an unknown form of energy which affects the largest scales of the Universe. The \Lambda-CDM model postulates the existence of an elusive matter component, dubbed dark matter, which together with the dark energy dominate the Universe’s component budget. Baryonic matter refers to the ordinary, non-dark matter, material. Importantly, only a minority of the baryonic matter can be probed by the observations of the light from stars within galaxies. A central tenet is that the vast majority (90%) of the normal matter is in the form of intergalactic gas. Another challenge comes from the formation of structure in the Universe which is based on a well accepted cosmological framework. In a nutshell, matter and radiation initially coupled in the hot, post big-bang plasma where matter was distributed evenly throughout the cosmos. Small primordial density fluctuations at the epoch of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) are amplified with cosmic time through gravitational instability. We currently have limited empirical information about this epoch dubbed ‘dark ages’. This is the period, however, at which the framework for the large-scale structures of the Universe begins to assemble. Dark matter produced the first cosmic web structures through collapse, while ordinary baryonic matter is able to gravitationally follow this structure. As fluctuations grow, they create a network of filaments of dark matter and an overdense gaseous medium. With only hydrogen and helium in atomic form and no metals yet, this epoch of structure formation gives rise to the first (Population III) stars which, to this date, remain challenging to observe. These stars are however important both because they likely produce the first ionising photons that would then reionise the Universe, but also because they pollute the pristine interstellar media with metals Welsh23 . Figure 2: Observations of light element abundances. These measurements, together with Big Bang nucleosynthesis, provide an estimate of baryonic matter density of \Omega_{\rm baryons}\approx 0.0490, in agreement with both Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies planck2016 and dispersion measures in Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) estimates Macquart20 . The total amount of baryons in the Universe is thus well-constrained Cooke24 . Galaxy formation continues through Dark Matter halos growth and merging; baryonic matter accretes through cosmic web filaments, and fuels star formation and galaxy formation to make the first objects already observable at z\sim10 Carniani24 . The gas is of prime interest since it will flow along the filaments and feed the formation of galaxies, groups and clusters. However, several physical processes affect the dynamics, thermodynamics and composition of the gas. First of all, filaments are heated by gravitational contraction and shocks Kang05 . Second, the ultraviolet background from young stars and quasars photoionises this gas and heats it Gnedin10 ; Hoeft06 . At the same time, cooling effects in the densest regions, radiate the thermal energy of the gas. Finally, supernovae-driven winds enrich and heat this gas in the neighbourhood of star-forming galaxies Cen06 . Both hydrodynamical cosmological simulations and observations indicate that the rate of star formation is to first order predicted by the amount of cold, dense gas available at any cosmic epoch (see Section 3.1). These results help us understand how efficiently (in terms of conversion of gas into stars) and where exactly stars form. 1.1 Why is Baryon Physics key? Figure 3: Left: Recently, estimates of Dispersion Measures (DM) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with known redshifts has resulted in a third independent estimate of \Omega_{\rm baryons} Macquart20 . Right: Such studies will flourish as more observations are accumulating fast with upcoming facilities including CHIME which leads to tens of FRBs detections a day Abdalla22 . Baryonic matter refers to the ordinary, non-dark matter, material. The total amount of baryons in the Universe has been quantified by three independent sets of observations, all of which converge to similar value of \Omega_{\rm baryons}\approx 0.0490. On one hand, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies planck2016 provides a measure of \Omega_{\rm baryons}. Additionally, observations light element abundances together with Big Bang nucleosynthesis cooke2018 ; Mossa20 ; Cooke24 lead to a measure of the baryon density (Figure 2). Indeed, the first synthesis of light elements (such as deuterium, helium and lithium) happened in the early Universe while heavier elements have been produced through stellar nucleosynthesis. Observations can be used to determine the primordial abundances of elements formed in the Big Bang, which provides a unique measure of the baryonic density of the Universe, \Omega_{\rm baryons}. Recently, Macquart20 estimated Dispersion Measures (DM) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with known redshifts resulting in a third independent estimate of \Omega_{\rm baryons} (Figure 3 left panel). Such studies will flourish as more observations are accumulating fast with upcoming facilities including CHIME which will lead to tens of FRB detections a day (Figure 3 right panel, Abdalla22 ). Importantly, only a minority of the baryonic matter can be probed by the observations of light in galaxies. The vast majority (90%) of the normal matter is in the form of gas as predicted by simulations in a typical phase diagram (Figure 4). This gas, notably the cold gas, provides the reservoir of fuel for forming stars and ultimately planets. A large reservoir of this gas still remains elusive and up to 20-50% of the baryons are thought to be hidden into the so-called Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) often referred to as the “missing baryons” Cen99 ; Dave01 ; Driver21 as illustrated in 5. Accompanying hands-on #1 provides a starter guide to access similar particle properties in the TNG simulations Nelson13 . It also proposes a number of exercises to naviguate the interface to the simulations for the reader to get familiar with the working framework. Figure 4: Simulated phase-diagram at redshift z=0. The figure displays the density distribution of simulated particles in a temperature-density parameter space. Star formation is labeled ”cond” for condensed material, the cold diffuse gas as ”diffuse”, the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium is refered to as WHIM, while hot gas in groups of galaxies and galaxy clusters are labeled ”hot”. The fractions of gas-mass within each region, whose boundaries are indicated with black lines, is provided on the plot. This figure evidences the large contribution of the so-called WHIM to the matter budget torrey19 . Figure 5: Current census of baryons. Low-redshift budget of the baryonic matter probed by observations. About 20% of baryons have not yet been located or most importantly, their physical properties have not been characterised. These are referred to as the “missing baryons” DeGraaff19 . The current \Lambda-CDM paradigm successfully describes cosmological evolution of the large-scale structures of the Universe, organised in galaxies, clusters, sheets, and filaments separated by voids. However, \Lambda-CDM over-predicts the amount of small-scale structures, including the number of dwarf galaxies, a problem referred to as the “missing satellites problem” Bullock10 ; Perivolaropoulos22 . The lack of observed small-scale structures may imply the existence of physical mechanisms which would suppress small-scale fluctuations in particular. The missing dwarf galaxies in cosmological simulations Bullock10 relates to the poorly resolved baryonic processes on the small-scales, including gas inflows and outflows. Furthermore, constraining the matter distribution in the Universe and its evolution with cosmic time from the next generation of galaxy surveys will rely on various type of measurements. Weak gravitational lensing of galaxies in particular offers a promising avenue by measuring per-cent-level distortions of galaxies’ ellipticities which are caused by bending of the path of photons due to the effects of gravity Mandelbaum18 ; Mellier24 . These distortions map the distribution of matter in the Universe at various epochs and thus set new constraints on the physical properties of dark energy, theories of gravity, as well as the nature of dark matter. VanDaalen11 showed that the distribution of matter, which an inherent input to weak lensing analyses, is significantly affected by baryonic effects. The major impact takes place at Mpc-scales, where the power is suppressed due to active galactic nuclei-driven gas ejection. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations make predictions of these physical processes at the relevant scales and their impact on the total matter power spectrum. Predictions vary vastly from one model to another, in part because the numerical methods differ but also because of the various implementation of baryonic (‘sub-grid’) processes (Figure 6). These effects have been major topic of research in recent years Semboloni11 ; Chisari18 ; Foreman20 ; Chisari18 ; Schneider15 ; Schneider19 ; Huang19 ; Debackere20 ; vanDaalen20 ; Amon22 ; Salcido23 ; Arico23 . Indeed, baryons are known to have effect on haloes: they compress the mass near the center, but suppress the density beyond the core which results in a reduction of the halo mass (and hence mass function) that becomes weaker towards higher masses Velliscig14 ; Cui14 ; Cusworth14 ; Bocquet16 ; HernandezAguayo23 . Currently, there is relatively little quantitative agreement among simulations regarding a robust description of the properties of gas flows, and specifically the implementation of feedback processes. Only detailed observations of star-forming and active galactic nuclei-driven winds (leading to measurements of velocity, gas phase, mass loading factor) will better constrain these complex physical processes. Observations of the baryonic matter are thus a unique means of tackling this degeneracy and providing new constraints on feedback models. Therefore, the modelled baryonic physics impact the properties of warm dark matter and thus the inference of cosmological parameters from weak lensing measurements from KIDS Janis19 , DES Abbott22 and the next generation of surveys such as LSST Ivezic19 , Euclid Amendola18 and Roman/WFIRST Spergel15 . Figure 6: Dark Matter power spectrum. The figure presents the ratio of the predictions from models including baryonic physics (labelled ”hydro”) to Dark Matter Only (labelled ”DMO”). The lines display various state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Both the sign and amplitude of the difference between these predictions is important, especially at large k-values, corresponding to small physical scales where baryonic physics dominate Huang19 . {trailer} Hands-on to analyzing cosmological galaxy formation simulations These hands-on sections walk through a “getting started” guide for analyzing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation – like IllustrisTNG. Additional documentation and further information is available at www.tng-project.org/data. The content is split into four sections, with a brief setup first. 1. A first plot from the Group Catalog 2. Galaxy population relations and integral properties 3. Observables: predicting gas absorption/emission 4. The baryon cycle: measuring mass flow rates [0] Setup First, we import the helper scripts for loading the simulation data: import illustris_python as il import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np [Hands-on #1] A first plot from the Group Catalogs Define the path for the data, i.e. choose the simulation we want to work with. Always start with a low resolution simulation for testing, as the size of data (i.e. time needed to load and plot) is smaller. Once you have a piece of code working, you can always change the path to a higher resolution simulation. basePath = ’sims.TNG/TNG100-3/output/’ We can then load fields from the z=0 group catalog. We specify the redshift by the snapshot number: snap_number = 99 We can load any field which is available (i.e. pre-computed) in the group catalogs. In particular, plot the relationship between star formation rate and stellar mass for galaxies. To do so, we will load both quantities, for all subhalos: • masses ”by type” (SubhaloMassInRadType), • star formation rates (SubhaloSFRinRad). Note: the ”InRad” suffix indicates that both measurements are considering only particles/cells within twice the stellar half mass radius, which is an OK first definition for the size of a galaxy. Other measurements of these same quantities, following other definitions, are also available. fields = [’SubhaloMassInRadType’,’SubhaloSFRinRad’] subhalos = il.groupcat.loadSubhalos(basePath, snap_number, fields=fields) Then we can inspect the result: subhalos.keys() dict_keys([’count’, ’SubhaloMassInRadType’, ’SubhaloSFRinRad’]) subhalos[’count’] 118820 subhalos[’SubhaloMassInRadType’].shape (118820, 6) Inspecting the return, we see it is a normal dictionary. The ”count” indicates that there are about 100k total subhalos (in TNG100-3, versus 4.4 million in TNG100-1). Each requested field is returned as a numpy array. We can now make a plot of star formation rate versus stellar mass. To do so, we need to select the values of interest from the catalog arrays, and be careful of physical unit conventions. (Always check the units and definition of fields before use). # select which particle type we are interested in mass_stars_code = subhalos[’SubhaloMassInRadType’][:,4] # careful of units! mass_stars_msun = mass_stars_code * 1e10 / 0.6774 sfr_msun_per_yr = subhalos[’SubhaloSFRinRad’] # plot fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.plot(mass_stars_msun, sfr_msun_per_yr, ’.’, ms=1.5) ax.set_xscale(’log’) ax.set_yscale(’log’) ax.set_xlabel(’Galaxy Stellar Mass [M$_\odot$]’) ax.set_ylabel(’Star Formation Rate [M$_\odot / yr$]’); Figure 7: Hands-on plot: the relationship between galaxy star formation rate and galaxy stellar mass, for the TNG100-3 simulation at z=0. Exercise * 1. Change the simulation above (e.g. to a higher resolution, or to a different TNG box), and remake the plot. Do you see any different features? What is your interpretation? Caution: are there any subhalos with ‘SFR == 0‘? They would have gotten lost due to the y-log axis. Find them, and include them on the plot. What is your interpretation of these subhalos? * 2. Quenched galaxies have largely stopped forming new stars. There are many definitions of quenched: one is that the specific star formation rate \rm{sSFR}=\rm{SFR}/M_{\star} is below a constant threshold value of 10^{-11}\rm{yr}^{-1} (at z=0). Compute and plot sSFR versus stellar mass for all galaxies. Add a horizontal line for this threshold. Then, measure the fraction of quenched galaxies as a function of mass (i.e. in N bins of stellar mass) and plot quenched fraction versus stellar mass. Does it make sense? 1.2 The Baryon Cycle Galaxies are not isolated islands. Their interactions with their environment profoundly influence their evolution. They form as gas cools and condenses at the centres of a population of massive halos growing by gravitational amplification of fluctuations in an initially near-uniform distribution of pre-existing dark matter. The canonical picture has galaxy growth being fed by inflows of gas from the intergalactic medium, IGM Dekel09 ; vandeVoort11 . Gas acquired through mergers or through accretion of IGM replenishes the fuel needed for star formation. These baryons from the cosmic web cool into a dense atomic then a molecular phase, which fuels star formation. These processes are collectively described as a self-regulation, where part of the gas is consumed in star formation while outflows eject some other quantity of gas from the system. Molecular gas is formed by complex small-scale physics including cloud collisions, dynamical/orbital features, or turbulence making the clouds become self-gravitating, and initiating star formation Gronke2017 ; gronke18 ; Gronke2022 . Another important component of these processes is the metal enrichment of the interstellar medium which in turns will affects the efficiency of star formation since not only do metals act as coolants but they also are fundamental to dust production by shielding molecules from dissociating radiation. Figure 8: The expected (black line) and observed (red line) galaxy luminosity function. The discrepancies in the low- and high-mass ends is related to Supernovae and Active Galactic Nuclei feedback, respectively Silk12 . The \Lambda-CDM cosmology also makes strong predictions on the halo mass function. Departures from these expectations with respect to the observed stellar mass function of galaxies are apparent at both the low and the high mass ends Silk12 . These deviations indicate a lower star formation efficiency in these two different mass regimes (Figure 8). To reconcile predictions from theory with observations, current simulations invoke feedback from various astrophysical processes at both mass scales. In low-mass galaxies, models include supernovae feedback to reproduce the observations while at high masses, feedback from an accreting super-massive black holes is required. The canonical picture is thus that once stars are formed, galaxies enrich the intergalactic medium with ionising photons and heavy elements formed in stars and supernovae, by driving galactic and active galactic nuclei-driven winds into the surrounding Pettini03 , some of which will fall back onto the galaxies in so-called galactic fountains Fraternali17 ; Bish19 . Gas flowing out of the galaxy (winds driven by supernovae or a super-massive black hole in the galaxy center) quenches star formation. Yet another important open question for galaxy formation models is to reproduce the low star formation efficiency observed in galaxies and dark matter halos. Figure 9: Illustration of intergalactic transfer. Hydrodynamical FIRE simulations predict the amount of baryonic material acquired through fresh accretion (purple), wind recycling (blue) or transfer from another haloe (green) as a function of redshift anglesalcazar17 . From a theoretical point of view, the difficulty is related to the various scales involved: simulating the large cosmological scales together with the pc-scale typical of interstellar physics poses an major dynamical scale computing challenge Crain23 . Recently, advances in numerical methods and computing capabilities have enabled extraordinary progress in the simulation of structure formation. Accompanying chapter by Jeremy Blaizot covers most of the fundamental processes implemented in current state-of-the-art simulations. It is a remarkable achievement that the overall physical properties (density and temperature) of the gas (specially HI) in these models reproduce observations of the absorbers column densities (i.e. the number of atoms along the line-of-sight) and line widths Fumagalli2011 ; Rahmati2014 ; gaikwad2017 . However, simulating the multiphase interstellar medium still remain challenging even in “zoom-in” simulations even with modern powerful computers. To overcome this challenge, it is necessary to make use of sub-grid modules to model unresolved physical processes, such as winds from dying stars, and supernovae teyssier2019 ; Maio22 ; Butsky24 . Only by implementing the most realistic physics will simulations be able to interpret contemporary observations. Important questions still to answer include which objects and media contribute to the global quantities. The question remains of the relation between the intergalactic gas relation and the interstellar medium of galaxies, including small-scale cold clumps and eventually molecular gas in the ISM of galaxies. Reaching a full understanding of the cycling of baryons between HI, H2 and the ionised phase of the gas requires even more advanced simulations. Hands-on #2 provides an opportunity to look at the gas properties in TNG simulations. A description of galaxy evolution thus requires to depict fully the ‘baryon cycle’, i.e., how material cycles through different phases (hot, warm and cold) and locations from outside galaxies into the interstellar medium and back Tumlinson17 ; FaucherGiguere23 . This baryon cycle is instrumental to the fueling and the regulation of star formation through and accretion and outflowing processes. The availability of the gas reservoir drives the instantaneous star formation rate and therefore directly governs the growth of galaxies and super massive black holes. More globally, the temporal and spatial evolution of material describes these processes of motion and transformation of the baryons Walter2020 ; Tacconi2020 ; PerouxHowk20 . The inflows and outflows exchange gas, metals, and angular momentum between the galaxy and its atmosphere. A detailed probe of baryons exchanges is of paramount importance for understanding these processes (Figures 9). Since gas, stars, and metals are intimately connected, gas flows affect the history of star formation and chemical enrichment in galaxies. Understanding this cosmic baryon cycle is crucial for understanding galaxy evolution. A comprehensive model of structure formation must thus consider our Universe as one large, complex ecosystem in which galaxies, stars and ultimately planets can form on different scales. 1.3 The Circumgalactic Medium In this context, the enriched circumgalactic gas, or CGM, surrounding galaxies provides the most direct probe of inflows and winds, which are driven by either stars, supernovae, active galactic nuclei and/or cosmic rays. Ultimately, we would like to measure the mass moves in these processes and how this evolves with time as well as obtain a description on how material enriched in metals, dust and energy eventually cycles back onto the galaxy. New observations and modern simulations reveal that the large, diffuse gas reservoir of the CGM is both multi-scale and multi-phase FaucherGiguere23 . Recently, it has been suggested the cloudlets of cold gas could be entrained in hotter medium those providing a theoretical framework for the recent observational results Gronke2022 . Cold CGM gas also plays a role in modulating halo cooling, act as a reservoir for star formation, and thus affects the galactic feedback processes. The CGM therefore has become a central component of studies of galaxy evolution and there structure formation. Over the past decade, new observations have revolutionised the study of the circumgalactic gas surrounding galaxies Tumlinson11 ; Borthakur13 ; Werk14 ; Heckman17 ; Lehner18 ; Muzahid18 ; Prochaska19 ; Chen2020 ; Peroux2020 . These studies show that the CGM is multiphase (with cold, warm, and hot gas) and makes up a large fraction of the baryon and metal budget. More recently, some works focused on the material closer to the galaxy (i.e. <0.5 Rvir), referring to it as the inner CGM. The CGM is increasingly recognised for its significant role in driving the evolution of galaxies. Hydrodynamical simulations (e.g., IllustrisTNG naiman18 ; pillepich18b ; nelson18a ; marinacci18 ; springel18 , EAGLE crain15 ; schaye2015 ; mcalpine2016 , SIMBA dave16 , FIRE FaucherGiguere16 ) also show the complexity of the CGM. A large fraction of the CGM seems to be bound to the galaxy and may have circulated multiple times through the galaxy (Figures 9). Recently, several groups have implemented different solutions to improve the spatial resolution in the lower density CGM of hydrodynamical simulations and to systematically vary the properties of simulated halos. An increasing number of physical processes, such as galactic winds and jets are being incorporated, essential to increase the realism of the simulations. Cosmic rays, turbulence, and magnetic fields likely also impact CGM physics significantly pakmor17 ; vandeVoort2021 ; Ramesh2023 . Full radiation hydrodynamics simulations in large boxes are also now becoming feasible, providing insight into the role that radiation and thermal pressure play in regulating the hydrogen and helium reionization processes and the structure of the Lyman-\alpha forest. Finally, efficient emulators that utilise GPU acceleration or machine learning techniques are now being developed for sampling the large parameter space relevant for cosmological analyses VillaescusaNavarro21 ; Appleby23 ; Gebek23 . {trailer} Hands-on to analyzing cosmological galaxy formation simulations [Hands-on #2] Galaxy population relations and integral properties When a physical quantity that you are interested in is already in the group catalogs (or can be computed from quantities in the catalogs), this is a good starting point. We consider a ”galaxy gas fraction” defined as f_{\rm gas}=M_{\rm gas}/(M_{\rm gas}+M_{\star}). For a quick look, we load the first 5 subhalos of TNG100-1 at z=0, and print this gas fraction. basePath = ’sims.TNG/TNG100-1/output/’ snap = 99 for i in range(5): sub = il.groupcat.loadSingle(basePath, snap, subhaloID=i) gas_mass = sub[’SubhaloMassInHalfRadType’][0] # units? stars_mass = sub[’SubhaloMassInHalfRadType’][4] # units? fgas = gas_mass / (gas_mass + stars_mass) print(i, fgas) 0 0.097318634 1 0.0105384765 2 0.014834739 3 0.0027430148 4 0.0047753155 Q: Within what radius (or ”aperture”) is this gas fraction computed? Q: Why is the first f_{\rm gas}\sim 10\%, but the other four are \lesssim 1\%? Exercise Make a scatterplot of the gas fraction of galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass: use ‘loadSubhalos()‘. Overplot a line representing a running mean (or median). What is your interpretation of the typical behavior with mass? Exercise What if we were interested in the ”halo gas fraction” f_{\rm gas}=(M_{\rm gas}/M_{\rm total}) instead? This would tell us about the gaseous content of the CGM, rather than of the galaxy itself. What aperture/definition would you want to use? What field from the group catalogs would be most appropriate? Make a scatterplot of halo gas fraction as a function of (i) galaxy stellar mass, (ii) total halo mass. Exercise Until now, we have been plotting all subhalos in the group catalog – that is, both ”centrals” and ”satellites”, where a satellite is another haloe within the Virial radius of the central. It is always a good idea to consider centrals and satellites separately. Look at the list of halo fields, and subhalo fields, in the group catalog. Which fields provide the links between the two? (There are ”links” in both directions). 1. Create a three lists of subhalo indices (or ”IDs”): (a) all subhalos, (b) central subhalos only, and (c) satellite subhalos only. 2. Print out the list of central subhalo IDs. What do the gaps represent? 3. Plot the ”satellite fraction” of subhalos as a function of mass. 4. Repeat the gas fraction plot from above, (over)plotting centrals and satellites separately. What is your interpretation? Exercise (Challenge) We have not yet seen the “merger trees”. We can explore how we follow a subhalo through time, and see how it evolves. We will use the ‘SubLink‘ merger tree. 1. Look at the documentation for the il.sublink.loadTree() function. 2. Consider TNG100-1 at z=0. Select all central subhalos whose **parent halo** has 11.5<M_{\rm 200c}/\rm{M}_{\odot}<11.6. How many are there? 3. For the first N=10 of these, load the ”main progenitor branch” (MPB) of each. (You should do this in a loop.) 4. Make a plot of gas fraction versus time (i.e. snapshot number, or redshift if possible), overplotting all N halos. Label each, in the legend, with the halo ID. 5. Add the median relation, taking the median across the N halos, as a solid black line. What is your interpretation?"
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07977v1,What drives the H content of central galaxies - A comparison between hydrodynamic simulations and observations using Random Forest,"We investigate the driving mechanisms for the Hi gas content in star-forming central galaxies at low redshift, by examining the Hi-to-stelalr mass ratio (M_{\rm HI}/M_{\ast}) in both the state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, IllustrisTNG (TNG) and EAGLE, and the xGASS sample. We quantify the correlations of M_{\rm HI}/M_{\ast} with a variety of galaxy properties using the random forest regression technique, and we make comparisons between the two simulations, as well as between the simulations and xGASS. Gas-phase metallicity is found to be most important in both simulations, but is ranked mildly for xGASS, suggesting that metals and gas driven by feedback effects in real galaxies is not as tightly coupled as in the simulations. Beyond that, the accretion rate of supermassive black holes is the most important feature in TNG, while specific star formation rate is the top ranked in EAGLE. This result can be understood from the fact that the Hi gas is regulated mainly by thermal-mode AGN feedback in TNG and by stellar feedback in EAGLE. Although neither simulation can fully reproduce the feature importance obtained for real galaxies in the xGASS, EAGLE performs better than TNG in the sense that the observationally top-ranked property, u-r, is also highly ranked in EAGLE. This result implies that stellar feedback plays a more dominant role than AGN feedback in driving the Hi gas content of low-redshift galaxies.","In current models, galaxies form at the center of dark matter halos through cooling and condensation of gas (White & Rees, 1978; Mo et al., 2010). Theoretically, gas-related processes in/around galaxies have been extensively studied in the past decade with the help of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, such as Horizon-AGN (Dubois et al., 2012), Magneticum111http://www.magneticum.org/simulations.html, EAGLE (Crain et al., 2015; Schaye et al., 2015), FIRE (Hopkins, 2015; Hopkins et al., 2014), Illustris (Vogelsberger et al., 2014a, b; Sijacki et al., 2015; Genel et al., 2014), IllustrisTNG (Springel et al., 2018; Naiman et al., 2018; Marinacci et al., 2018; Nelson et al., 2018; Pillepich et al., 2018), and SIMBA (Davé et al., 2019). In particular, many efforts have been made to investigate atomic hydrogen (Hi), the dominant component of cold gas. These simulations are usually able to reproduce the abundance of galaxies as a function of the Hi mass and the Hi size-mass relation in the local Universe (e.g. Bahé et al., 2016; Crain et al., 2017; Diemer et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2022). However, the simulations have also shown that the Hi content of a galaxy can be regulated by a variety of processes, including consumption by star formation (Springel & Hernquist, 2003; Schaye & Dalla Vecchia, 2008; Hopkins et al., 2014), heating or outflows by stellar feedback (Pillepich et al., 2018; Dalla Vecchia & Schaye, 2012; Hopkins et al., 2014) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback (Booth & Schaye, 2009; Dubois et al., 2012; Weinberger et al., 2017), and tidal or ram-pressure stripping by surrounding hot gas and companion galaxies (Marasco et al., 2016; Stevens et al., 2019; Watts et al., 2020). Different simulations use different mechanisms to reproduce the observations of Hi gas, and it is unclear which mechanisms drive the Hi mass and distribution in real galaxies. For instance, using EMP-pathfinder (Reina-Campos et al., 2022) and FIREbox (Feldmann et al., 2023), Gensior et al. (2024) showed that different subgrid physics can result in consistent galaxy-wide Hi properties, but the small-scale properties are very different, with the rotational asymmetry of the Hi discs has the strongest dependence on the physical processes implemented. On the observational side, large Hi surveys accomplished in the past two decades, such as Hi Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS; Meyer et al., 2004) and Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey (ALFALFA; Giovanelli et al., 2005), have greatly advanced our understanding of Hi gas properties in local galaxies. These include the abundance of Hi-rich galaxies as quantified by the Hi mass function (HIMF; Zwaan et al. 2005; Martin et al. 2010; Jones et al. 2018), the dependence of galaxy clustering on Hi mass (Meyer et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2012; Papastergis et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2017), the scaling relations of Hi mass fraction with various galaxy properties (Kannappan, 2004; Zhang et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2012; Catinella et al., 2010; Obreschkow et al., 2016; Catinella et al., 2018; Zu, 2020; Li et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2024), and the Hi-to-halo mass relation for both central galaxies and all the galaxies in dark matter halos (Hess & Wilcots, 2013; Barnes & Haehnelt, 2014; Guo et al., 2017; Paul et al., 2018; Villaescusa-Navarro et al., 2018; Obuljen et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020; Chauhan et al., 2020; Calette et al., 2021; Chauhan et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Rhee et al., 2023; Saraf et al., 2024). Furthermore, the Hi scaling relations provide an economic but reliable way to estimate the Hi mass fraction for optically-selected galaxy samples that are much deeper and larger than the existing Hi surveys. This allows the abundance and clustering of Hi-selected galaxies to be measured more accurately and over larger dynamical ranges of galaxy properties. For instance, by applying an improved estimator to the galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al., 2000), Li et al. (2022) obtained the first estimates of the conditional Hi mass functions (CHIMFs), that is, HIMFs for galaxies hosted by dark matter halos of given mass. The observations of Hi should in principle provide useful constraints on the subgrid physics implemented in hydrodynamic simulations. For instance, Davé et al. (2020) found that SIMBA well reproduces the HIMF at z=0, but overestimates the Hi fraction of massive galaxies, implying too strong a jet-mode AGN feedback which plays a major role in regulating the Hi gas content in this simulation. For IllustrisTNG, the Hi mass of central galaxies is found to have no or weak correlation with star formation rate (SFR; Ma et al., 2022), in contrast to the tight correlation between Hi mass fraction and SFR in real galaxies. In Li et al. (2022), the comparison of the Hi-to-halo mass relation between observations and simulations show that both Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulations significantly overpredict the Hi mass for both the central galaxy and all the galaxies as a whole at fixed halo mass. Due to the complex subgrid physics in the simulations, as mentioned above, it is not immediately clear what causes the agreement and disagreement between simulations and observations. In this work, we adopt the random forest algorithm (Breiman, 2001) to investigate the driving processes for the Hi gas content in IllustrisTNG (hereafter TNG) and EAGLE. Both TNG and EAGLE are state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, but they implement very different feedback models, thus allowing a comparison of the effects of different feedback processes on the Hi contents of galaxies. Random forest is a widely-used machine learning algorithm that is able to efficiently identify the most important feature with respect to the target from a large parameter space (e.g. Bluck et al., 2022, 2023; Baker et al., 2023; Ellison et al., 2024; Goubert et al., 2024; Jing & Li, 2024; Li & Li, 2024). We consider galaxy properties that are previously found to be correlated with Hi mass fraction (e.g., specific SFR, color, stellar mass, stellar surface density, gas metallicity), as well as other properties that are potential tracers of important gas-related processes (e.g., black hole mass and accretion rate). We then compare the importance pattern of the properties in simulated galaxies with that identified in the same way from the observed galaxies in the xGASS survey, aiming to find out the driving mechanisms for the Hi mass fraction in low-redshift galaxies. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we first perform the random forest analysis for the two simulations. In section 3 we then perform the same analysis for the xGASS galaxy sample and make comparisons between the simulations and the observational results. Finally, we summarize our work in section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07875v1,From Dark Matter Minihalos to Large-Scale Radiative Feedback: A Self-Consistent 3D Simulation of the First Stars and Galaxies using Neural Networks,"A key obstacle to accurate models of the first stars and galaxies is the vast range of distance scales that must be considered. While star formation occurs on sub-parsec scales within dark matter (DM) minihalos, it is influenced by large-scale baryon-dark matter streaming velocities (v_{\rm bc}) and Lyman-Werner (LW) radiative feedback which vary significantly on scales of \sim100 Mpc. We present a novel approach to this issue in which we utilize artificial neural networks (NNs) to emulate the Population III (PopIII) and Population II (PopII) star formation histories of many small-scale cells given by a more complex semi-analytic framework based on DM halo merger trees. Within each simulation cell, the NN takes a set of input parameters that depend on the surrounding large-scale environment, such as the cosmic overdensity, \delta(\vec{x}), and v_{\rm bc} of the cell, then outputs the resulting star formation far more efficiently than is possible with the semi-analytic model. This rapid emulation allows us to self-consistently determine the LW background intensity on \sim100 Mpc scales, while simultaneously including the detailed merger histories (and corresponding star formation histories) of the low-mass minihalos that host the first stars. Comparing with the full semi-analytic framework utilizing DM halo merger trees, our NN emulators yield star formation histories with redshift-averaged errors of \sim10.2% and \sim9.2% for PopII and PopIII, respectively. When compared to a simpler sub-grid star formation prescription reliant on halo mass function integration, we find that the diversity of halo merger histories in our simulation leads to enhanced spatial fluctuations, an earlier transition from PopIII to PopII dominated star formation, and more scatter in star formation histories overall.","The initial era of star and galaxy formation in the Universe is crucial to our understanding of cosmic evolution. Beginning \sim100 Myr after the Big Bang, the first stars are predicted to have formed within dark matter (DM) “minihalos” with masses below the atomic cooling limit of hydrogen (i.e. M_{\rm vir}\simeq 10^{5}-10^{6} \rm M_{\odot}). The primordial gas clouds within these halos radiated energy via \rm{H_{2}} molecular transitions, which limited gas cloud fragmentation as these transitions could not cool the gas as efficiently as metals. Simulations predict that this resulted in much larger characteristic stellar masses [M_{*}=10-1000 \rm M_{\odot}, e.g., 1, 2, 3] than what is observed in the local universe [see 4, for a recent review]. These Population III (PopIII) stars lived relatively short lives of a few Myr [5] and critically initiated the processes of cosmic reionization and metal enrichment [e.g. 6, 7, 8]. Since they form in small numbers and at high cosmic redshifts [9], PopIII stars have eluded direct observations thus far. While observations by JWST have started hinting at possible PopIII sources [e.g. 10, 11, 12], many previous works have attempted to constrain the properties of first stars using indirect observations. For example, studies in “stellar archaeology"" examine local extremely metal-poor stars to place lower limits on the PopIII initial mass function [e.g. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. The optical depth of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation due to electron scattering has similarly been used to place upper limits on the efficiency of PopIII star formation [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Further, line-intensity mapping of the 1640 Å He II recombination line has been proposed as a method to constrain PopIII stellar properties and calibrate models of star formation [26, 27]. Other studies have focused on the observability of PopIII pair-instability supernovae [28, 29] and PopIII gamma-ray bursts [30, 31, 32] to constrain their properties. Lastly, the cosmological 21-cm signal is sensitive to the star formation rate density (SFRD) and three-dimensional (3D) clustering of the first stars and galaxies [see 33, for a detailed review]. This is true for both global observations such as EDGES [34] and LEDA [35], as well as those aiming to measure 3D spatial fluctuations such as HERA [36] and SKA [37]. Theoretical predictions are necessary to guide and interpret these observations. One of the largest hurdles in accurately modelling the first stars is the vast range of distance scales that must be considered [for detailed reviews on simulations of the first stars and galaxies, see 38, 39]. While the process of star formation occurs on distance scales of parsecs (e.g., the virial radius of a \sim 10^{5}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}} halo at z=40 is \sim 40 pc), relative baryon-DM streaming velocities (v_{\rm bc}) fluctuate significantly on 100 Mpc scales [40, 41] and can significantly hinder star formation as matter advects out of the shallow gravitational potential wells of the DM halos [42, 43, 44]. Radiative feedback from star formation can similarly affect cosmological volumes as ultraviolet (UV) radiation within the Lyman-Werner (LW) band ({E_{\rm LW}} = 11.2–13.6 eV) may freely stream up to \sim100 Mpc before cosmological expansion redshifts the photons into a Lyman series line and it is absorbed [45, 46]. This feedback may shine on to other DM halos, dissociating \rm{H_{2}} molecules within them and further suppressing PopIII star formation [45, 47, 48, 49, 46]. To accurately model early star and galaxy formation then, one must simultaneously capture the star formation occurring on small spatial scales as well as the large-scale v_{\rm bc} and radiative feedback. In an effort to address this challenge, many works have analytically calculated the formation and large-scale distribution of the first stars to make predictions of observables and constrain their properties [e.g. 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]. For example, several works have implemented the method of analytic halo mass function integration as a means of rapidly determining star formation in a given volume of space [e.g. 26, 24, 55]. This method, however, requires fine-tuned parameters, such as the halo mass ranges over which one integrates to yield accurate SFRD evolutions when compared with more sophisticated calculations [56, henceforth CF24]. Further, this method can only predict statistically-averaged star formation for a given halo mass function at a given time, ignoring any previous star formation, radiation, gas heating and ejection, etc. that are required to accurately model the spatial fluctuations of star formation in non-global scenarios. Semi-analytic models (SAMs) are another class of models that introduce more complex astrophysics on top of analytic frameworks to more accurately predict star and galaxy formation [e.g. 57, 58, 59, 60]. These typically implement DM halo merger trees to serve as the scaffolding for star and galaxy formation, and can include processes like self-consistent LW feedback [49, 61, 62], the inclusion of relative streaming velocities [44], and models for more complex halo physics induced by mergers, metal enrichment, and radiation [e.g. 18, 63, 64]. These SAMs, along with simpler analytic models, may be used within large 3D semi-numeric models to simulate the star formation within a subregion of the overall volume with the goal of reproducing observables that require spatial fluctuations and correlation [e.g. 65, 66, 67, 68, 69]. Such semi-numeric models therefore more accurately predict the 3D distribution of high-redshift star formation and are typically used to both study the effects of the first stars on large-scale observables and constrain their properties [70, 71, 72, 73, 74]. Note, semi-numeric models like the one presented in this work are distinguished from SAMs by including small-scale resolution elements in which an assumed sub-grid prescription dictates star formation. Such semi-numeric models, however, are often limited by computational resources and finite spatial resolution, meaning they typically cannot resolve the DM minihalos in which early star formation occurs while simultaneously capturing the large-scale evolution of the volume. Recently, Magg et al. (2022) [75] elevated this sub-grid technique by implementing the semi-analytic framework A-SLOTH [76] to characterize the transition redshift between PopIII and PopII star formation in terms of cosmic overdensity, \delta(\vec{x}), then showed how the 21-cm signal changes with transition redshift. The authors utilized the A-SLOTH SAM to simulate star formation in N-body merger trees for a range of critical temperature thresholds and recovery times between the first PopIII supernova and the onset of PopII star formation. The results of these realizations were then used to populate cells of their 21-cm signal model with star formation based on the cell overdensities. While this represents perhaps the best effort to simultaneously account for both large and small distance scales in the literature to date, the authors did not self-consistently account for the effects of LW radiation and v_{\rm bc} in their star formation model, only incorporating them into their 21-cm signal calculation. Here we present a new semi-numerical framework that self-consistently predicts the 3D distribution of PopIII and PopII star formation within a representative large-scale volume of the early universe. Our framework is the first to self-consistently compute large-scale effects, such as 3D spatial fluctuations in LW background intensity, while simultaneously capturing realistic DM halo merger trees that resolve the hosts of the first stars. We achieve this by developing many neural network emulators which reproduce the star formation results of a more computationally demanding SAM. Once trained, these neural networks rapidly and accurately emulate the star formation within a small-scale cell of our simulation volume while taking into account the larger scale environment of the cell (e.g., the specific LW intensity observed in that cell from the rest of the large-scale volume). Machine learning techniques such as neural networks have recently been implemented in various fields of astrophysical research to efficiently explore large and complex datasets. For example, they have been utilized to emulate the distribution of galaxy halo masses and velocities [77], the 3D clustering of galaxies [78], the connection between galaxy formation and the DM halos which host them [79, 80], overall structure formation [81], gravitational lensing [82], and even the cosmic 21-cm signal to both constrain its parameters for future observations [83, 84] and identify the type of radio background present within it [85]. Recognizing their potential, we implemented machine learning techniques in the semi-numeric framework presented here to rapidly populate sub-grid regions in our simulation with star formation. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the physical processes and parameters included in our simulation framework, and illustrate the neural net training process. In Section 3 we discuss the results of our model, and place them into context with other simulations. Finally, we summarize our results in Section 4 and discuss planned future work with this new large-scale model. Unless otherwise stated, all distance scales are in comoving units and all baryon-DM streaming velocities are those found at Recombination. Also note that the {J_{\rm LW}(z)} values referred to in this work have units of J_{\rm 21}=10^{-21}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}\ cm^{-2}\ Hz^{-1}\ sr^{-1}. Finally, we assume a \LambdaCDM cosmology throughout, consistent with [86], adopting the following parameter values: \Omega_{\rm m}=0.32, \Omega_{\rm\Lambda}=0.68, \Omega_{\rm b}=0.049, h=0.67."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07847v1,Broad-Line Region Characterization in Dozens of Active Galactic Nuclei Using Small-Aperture Telescopes,"We present the results of a nearly decade-long photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) survey of the H\alpha emission line in nearby (0.01\lesssim~{}z~{}\lesssim 0.05) Seyfert-Galaxies using small (15\,\mathrm{cm}-40\,\mathrm{cm}) telescopes. Broad-band filters were used to trace the continuum emission, while narrow-band filters tracked the H\alpha-line signal. We introduce a new PRM formalism to determine the time delay between continuum and line emission using combinations of auto- and cross-correlation functions. We obtain robust delays for 33/80 objects, allowing us to estimate the broad-line region (BLR) size. Additionally, we measure multi-epoch delays for 6 objects whose scatter per source is smaller than the scatter in the BLR size-luminosity relation. Our study enhances the existing H\alpha size-luminosity relation by adding high-quality results for 31 objects, whose nuclear luminosities were estimated using the flux-variation gradient method, resulting in a scatter of 0.26 dex within our sample. The scatter reduces to 0.17 dex when the 6 lowest luminosity sources are discarded, which is comparable to that found for the H\beta line. Single-epoch spectra enable us to estimate black hole masses using the H\alpha line and derive mass accretion rates from the iron-blend feature adjacent to H\beta. A similar trend, as previously reported for the H\beta line, is implied whereby highly accreting objects tend to lie below the size-luminosity relation of the general population. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of small telescopes in conducting high-fidelity PRM campaigns of prominent emission lines in bright active galactic nuclei.","Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most luminous sources in the universe (Padovani et al., 2017), and mark a phase in the lifetime of galaxies, where their central supermassive black holes (SMBH) are rapidly growing by the accretion of material from their immediate environs (Soltan, 1982; Farrah et al., 2022). Therefore, AGN provide a means by which the cosmic SMBH census may be quantified out to high redshifts, and SMBH-galaxy co-evolution may be traced (Kormendy & Ho, 2013). This has profound implications for understanding SMBH growth in the general context of structure formation in the universe, as well as for gravitational-wave signals in the NANOGrav and LISA era (Agazie et al., 2023; Amaro-Seoane et al., 2022). SMBH mass estimations in AGN are based on two observables: the size of the broad line region, r_{\mathrm{BLR}}, and a measure of the velocity dispersion of the lines, \sigma_{\mathrm{BLR}}. Assuming that the latter is a proxy for the virial speed at the location of the line-emitting gas, then up to (often loosely constrained) geometrical factors, the SMBH mass may be estimated as, M_{\mathrm{SMBH}}\sim\sigma_{\mathrm{BLR}}^{2}r_{\mathrm{BLR}}/G, where G is Newton’s gravitational constant (Peterson & Wandel, 2000). While \sigma_{\mathrm{BLR}} may be estimated from the mean or the root-mean-square (RMS) spectrum of the target, r_{\mathrm{BLR}} is too small to be spatially resolved in all but for a few cases and particular emission lines (e.g., Gravity Collaboration et al., 2018), and reverberation mapping is the main means by which the BLR size is assessed (Bentz et al., 2013). Reverberation mapping (RM), as applies to AGN, is a technique in which light echoes are used to place constraints on the geometrical attributes of the BLR (Cackett et al., 2021, and references therein). This is supported by the fact that the BLR is photoionized by the AGN continuum emission, and line emission therefore responds to continuum fluctuations. In its simplest form, RM is used to measure the size of the BLR by quantifying the time-delay (the first moment of the transfer function), t_{\mathrm{BLR}}, between line and continuum emission. This timescale is interpreted as the light crossing time across the BLR since radiative reprocessing time-scales are comparatively very short due to the high gas densities involved, and since en-route photon diffusion is negligible at the implied optical depths (Peterson, 1993). Therefore, r_{\mathrm{BLR}}=ct_{\mathrm{BLR}}, where c is the speed of light. Meaningful time-delay measurements between line and continuum emission are available for \sim 10^{2} sources and are mostly associated with the H\beta line (Peterson et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2023), which is easily observable from the ground, and for which the host-galaxy contamination may be mitigated using the adjacent [OIII] \lambda 5007 line (van Groningen & Wanders, 1992). These revealed an intriguing relation between the size of the BLR and the source optical luminosity, L_{\mathrm{opt}}, which is consistent with r_{\mathrm{BLR}}\propto L_{\mathrm{opt}}^{1/2} (Bentz et al., 2013). This relation forms the basis for current prescriptions for estimating SMBH masses also in sources for which RM results are unavailable, thereby leading to the current cosmic SMBH census (Vestergaard, 2004; Vestergaard & Osmer, 2009; Kelly & Merloni, 2012). Additionally, radius-luminosity relationships have also been established for continuum wavebands beyond the optical, such as X-rays (Greene et al., 2010) and infrared (Landt et al., 2011). It has been further proposed that the size-luminosity relation may be used as a standard ruler for cosmology (Watson et al., 2011; Martínez-Aldama et al., 2019; Panda & Marziani, 2023, and references therein). There are, however, several limitations to the aforementioned use of quasars for cosmology and the SMBH census: 1) there is non-negligible scatter in the size-luminosity relation which is further exacerbated when attempting to cross-calibrate the relations for different sets of lines (Coatman et al., 2016), 2) different AGN sub-types may be characterized by different size-luminosity relations (Du et al., 2016b), 3) local size-luminosity relations for low-luminosity sources are extrapolated to much more luminous targets and at high redshifts, where they may not hold, at least not without further corrections (e.g., Dalla Bontà et al., 2020, who considered corrections due to the Eddington ratio). Interestingly, RM campaigns of individual sources, which undergo long-term luminosity variations, show an intrinsic size-luminosity relation for their BLR, whose slope may be different than the extrinsic (multi-source) relation, and shedding light on the physical origin of the BLR (Lu et al., 2016). Therefore, increasing the sample size and diversity of AGN with good RM data, with repeated campaigns for individual sources, is crucial for properly assessing the SMBH census, and uncovering AGN physics. To perform RM and obtain line-to-continuum time-delays, high-cadence spectroscopic observations are often employed whereby spectroscopic decomposition is used to separate line and continuum signals at each epoch, and multiple epochs are used to form their respective light curves (Kaspi et al., 2000). The need for high-cadence spectroscopic data means that RM is a challenging technique to implement, especially for faint targets, as telescope time is scarce. This shortcoming of RM motivated several groups to propose photometric RM (PRM) as a means to achieve high-quality RM using smaller telescopes for which telescope time is more abundant (Haas et al., 2011; Chelouche & Daniel, 2012). Specifically, both narrowband (NB) and broadband photometric RM versions have been proposed and implemented for a handful of sources, as well as statistically for numerous sources using general-purpose survey data (Pozo Nuñez et al., 2023; Panda et al., 2024a). The typical implementation of PRM requires monitoring in two bands111Single-band versions of PRM have been proposed, which rely on the statistical properties of quasar continuum variability (Zu et al., 2016), one of which is used as a proxy for the time-varying ionizing continuum, and the other includes in addition to the ionizing continuum also the contribution of an emission line (Czerny et al., 2023). To constrain the line-to-continuum time-delay one may use the slew of statistical tools available for spectroscopic RM if the pure line light-curve may be extracted based on prior knowledge of the relative contribution of the emission line to the band (Haas et al., 2011). Often, however, all photometric bands contain a finite contribution of emission lines to their signal, and the contribution of the varying component of the emission line to the line-rich band is poorly constrained. In such cases, other statistical measures may be used to simultaneously constrain both the line-to-continuum time-delay and the relative contribution of the line to the band (Chelouche & Zucker, 2013; Zu et al., 2016, but see Chelouche & Daniel 2012 for the case of broadband data). Here we present the results of PRM campaigns on 80 AGN targeting the H\alpha line, which is significantly brighter than H\beta and lies in a spectral range relatively free of iron-emission contamination. The campaigns were performed between 2010 and 2018. Each campaign typically lasts 5-6 months, and 12 AGN have been monitored in 2-3 campaigns. Section 2 describes the sample selection, the available observations, and the light-curves extraction and their characteristics. In Section 3 we outline the methods used: the correlation formalism used for PRM time lag determination, the host-galaxy subtraction, and black hole mass estimation. Results for the AGN luminosities, H\alpha BLR sizes, BH masses as well as size-luminosity relation for the sample are given in Section 4. We discuss the implications of our results for AGN physics and provide a summary in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07736v1,Multiphase Gas Nature in the Sub-parsec Region of the Active Galactic Nuclei. III. Eddington Ratio Dependence on the Structures of Dusty and Dust-free Outflows,"We investigated the influence of the Eddington ratio on sub-parsec-scale outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) masses of 10^{7}M_{\odot} using two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. When the range of Eddington ratio, \gamma_{\rm Edd}>10^{-3} , the radiation force exceeds the gas pressure, leading to stronger outflows and larger dust sublimation radius. Although the sub-parsec-scale outflows is a time-dependence phenomena, our simulations demonstrated that the radial distributions can be well explained by the steady solutions of the spherically symmetric stellar winds. The dynamic structure of sub-parsec-scale outflows is influenced by the dust sublimation radius and the critical radii determined by the dynamical equilibrium condition. Although significantly affecting the outflow velocity, the Eddington ratio exerts minimal effects on temperature and number density distribution. Furthermore, our analytical solutions highlight the importance of the dust sublimation scale as a crucial determinant of terminal velocity and column density in dusty outflows. Through comparisons of our numerical model with the obscuring fraction observed in nearby AGNs, we revealed insights into the Eddington ratio dependence and the tendency towards the large obscuring fraction of the dusty and dust-free gases. The analytical solutions are expected to facilitate an understanding of the dynamical structure and radiation structures along the line of sight and their viewing angles from observations of ionized outflows.","The unified picture of active galactic nuclei (AGN) provides a framework for understanding the obscuration of gas and dust interacting with AGN radiation, represented as the column density of a dust torus located outside a broad-line region (BLR) surrounding a supermassive black hole (SMBH) (Antonucci, 1993; Urry & Padovani, 1995). The AGN luminosity is determined by the gas supply onto a SMBH. However, as the mass accretion rate may be affected by AGN outflows, it is essential to investigate the physical process of AGN outflows to evaluate the realistic growth rate of SMBHs (e.g., Silk & Rees, 1998; Faucher-Giguère & Quataert, 2012; King & Pounds, 2015; Nomura et al., 2020). Recent multi-wavelength observations highlight that AGN outflows represent complex environments with multiphase gases, e.g. ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), warm absorbers (WAs), ionized, atomic, and molecular outflows (see, Harrison et al. 2018; Combes 2021). In the nearby Seyfert Circinus galaxy, Izumi et al. (2023) revealed the multiphase nature of outflows and inflows from ten-parsec to sub-parsec scales using the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA). In addition, the infrared interferometry observations have clarified the dust thermal radiation elongating to the polar region (Hönig et al., 2012; Kishimoto et al., 2022; Lyu & Rieke, 2022). Observational studies have investigated that the parameter determining AGN activity is the Eddington ratio \gamma_{\textrm{Edd}}, which is the bolometric luminosity L_{\textrm{bol}} divided by the Eddington luminosity L_{\textrm{Edd}} proportional to the SMBH mass M_{\textrm{SMBH}}, \gamma_{\textrm{Edd}}=\frac{L_{\textrm{bol}}}{L_{\textrm{Edd}}}\propto\frac{L_% {\textrm{bol}}}{M_{\textrm{SMBH}}}. (1) In contrast to the cold dust in the torus, the dust in the polar region indicates high temperatures \gtrsim 1000 K (Hönig et al., 2013; Tristram et al., 2014). The Infrared (IR) luminosity from this thermal emission correlates with the X-ray luminosity (García-Bernete et al., 2017, 2022). Additionally, there have been discussions based on the dependence of Eddington ratio and hydrogen column density (Asmus, 2019; Alonso-Herrero et al., 2021; Yamada et al., 2023). The polar dust is spatially associated with ionized outflow, forming horn-like structures (Asmus et al., 2016; Stalevski et al., 2023). The outflowing gas exhibits peak velocities >100 km s-1 and number densities of approximately 10^{3} cm-3, which are related with the AGN luminosity (Fiore et al., 2017; Davies et al., 2020; Musiimenta et al., 2023). Understanding the central region of the horn, that is the sub-parsec scale, is crucial for the origin of formation mechanism. The gas and dust in observed AGNs is characterized by obscuring fraction f_{\rm obs} 111 The fraction of gas covering or obscuration is often expressed as covering fraction, covering factor, or similar terms. These generally relate to partial absorption along the line of sight or the absorption/emission of gas covering a certain spherical surface. The factors introduced in AGN observations to adjust luminosity involve uncertainties related to the gas distribution (see in detail, Netzer, 2015). . Ricci et al. (2013) clarified the X-ray obscuring fraction, f_{\mathrm{obs,X}}, by examining the anti-correlation between the Fe K\alpha equivalent width with luminosity, known as the X-ray Baldwin effect (Iwasawa & Taniguchi, 1993). f_{\mathrm{obs,X}} represents the obscured region of the torus according to the unified model. On the other hand, the assumption that the dusty torus re-emits a portion of the AGN luminosity in the IR allows for the conversion of the dust obscuring fraction, f_{\mathrm{obs,IR}} (Maiolino et al., 2007; Treister et al., 2008). Recent studies have reported a higher f_{\rm obs,X} (e.g., Ueda et al., 2014; Aird et al., 2015; Buchner et al., 2015) compared to f_{\rm obs,IR} (e.g., Maiolino et al., 2007; Treister et al., 2008; Lusso et al., 2013; Netzer et al., 2016; Zhuang et al., 2018), which is discussed by Tanimoto et al. (2020); Ogawa et al. (2021); Esparza-Arredondo et al. (2021). f_{\rm obs,IR} captures only dusty gas, whereas f_{\rm obs,X} contains additional dust-free gas. The difference between f_{\rm obs,IR} and f_{\rm obs,X} suggests that the inner part of the dusty torus is more widely obscured by dust-free gas, which is destroyed by dust sublimation (Davies et al., 2015; Burtscher et al., 2016; Ichikawa et al., 2019; Mizukoshi et al., 2022, 2024). These are dependent on the Eddington ratio, with a tendency for smaller obscuring fraction with high Eddington ratio (Toba et al., 2021; Ananna et al., 2022). Ricci et al. (2017, 2023); Vijarnwannaluk et al. (2024) discussed that this trend implied gas being blown out by radiative feedback. In this paper, we define the obscuring fraction f_{\mathrm{obs}} based on geometry. This is the fraction of a hemisphere (2\pi) covered by an angle \theta from the disk mid-plane. The interpretation of observed f_{\mathrm{obs}} in relation to gas distribution is discussed in (Elitzur, 2012; Nenkova et al., 2008; Stalevski et al., 2016). The importance of radiation-driven dusty outflow is demonstrated by hydrodynamic simulations (e.g., Roth et al., 2012; Wada, 2012, 2015; Namekata & Umemura, 2016; Chan & Krolik, 2017; Naddaf et al., 2021; Soliman & Hopkins, 2023). Notably, Wada (2012, 2015) revealed a fountain mechanism wherein the multiphase gas blew up from the disk within a few parsecs, subsequently falling back to the disk plane at a scale where the cooling became effective. Their dynamic model at the parsec scale successfully explained the spectral lines of the outflowing atomic/molecular gases (Izumi et al., 2018, 2023) and the polar dust emission (Schartmann et al., 2014; Wada et al., 2016). Considering steady winds from scales smaller than the their spatial resolution (\sim 0.1 pc), Williamson et al. (2019, 2020) showed that the dynamical structure of dusty outflows varied with the Eddington ratio and radiation anisotropy. To explore the origin of the dusty outflow at \gamma_{\rm Edd}=0.1, by spatially resolving the dust sublimation scale, Kudoh et al. (2023) (Paper I) investigated the time variability in the shape of outflowing shells and dust sublimation radii. The timescale of variability within a few decades can impact X-ray polarization (Tanimoto et al., 2023) and ionized emission lines (Wada et al., 2023, Paper II). Moreover, the dust sublimation region was filled with dense, dust-free gas owing to the destruction of dusty gas flowing out from the disk. The sub-parsec-scale outflow plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of dust-free and dusty gases, contributing to the obscured structure covering the central nuclei. In this paper, we studied the dependence of the Eddington ratio on sub-pc-scale radiation feedback and its wind structure through the numerical simulations based on Paper I. We aimed to establish an analytical model of the Eddington ratio based on the simulations results. We answer the following questions, as explained by the radiative feedback and its dynamics: (1) How does the radiation feedback to the sub-parsec-scale gas depend on the Eddington ratio?; (2) What dynamics govern the radial distribution of the dynamical outflow?; (3) What is the value of Eddington ratio at which radiation feedback is activated on the sub-parsec scale?; (4) How does the dynamical dusty outflow explain the obscuring fraction of IR and X-ray observations? This paper is organized as follows. In §2, we describe the solving equations and physical models common to our simulations in §§2.1 and the models of AGN luminous sources parameterized by the Eddington ratio in §§2.2. We present the numerical results of the radiation-driven outflow and the time-averaged radial profile according to the Eddington ratio in §3. We establish a dynamic model that reproduces the time-averaged outflow velocity by analytical solutions in §4. §§5.1 discusses the application of observed outflow velocity using the analytical solutions. We discuss the column density for dusty and dust-free gases in §§5.2, and its f_{\rm obs} compared to the IR and X-ray observations in §§5.3. In addition, §§5.4 and §§5.5 rough out the ionization parameter related to X-ray winds and driving forces classification. Finally, §6 summarizes our findings related to the dynamical dusty outflow dependence on the Eddington ratio. Figure 1: (a) Models of the input AGN SEDs.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07695v1,GA-NIFS: ISM properties and metal enrichment in a merger-driven starburst during the Epoch of Reionisation probed with JWST and ALMA,"We present deep JWST/NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) and ALMA [C ii]\textlambda158\mum observations of COS-3018, a star-forming galaxy at z\sim6.85, as part of the GA-NIFS programme. Both G395H (R\sim 2700) and PRISM (R\sim 100) NIRSpec observations revealed that COS-3018 is comprised of three separate components detected in [O iii]\textlambda5007, which we dub as Main, North and East, with stellar masses of 109.4±0.1, 109.2±0.07, 107.7±0.15 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}. We detect [O iii]\textlambda\textlambda5007,4959, [O ii]\textlambda\textlambda3727,3729 and multiple Balmer lines in all three components together with [O iii]\textlambda4363 in the Main and North components. This allows us to measure an ISM temperature of T_{\text{e}} = 1.27\pm 0.07\times 10^{4} and T_{\text{e}} = 1.6\pm 0.14\times 10^{4} K with densities of n_{e} = 1250\pm250 and n_{e} = 700\pm200 cm-3, respectively. These deep observations allow us to measure an average metallicity of 12+log(O/H)=7.9–8.2 for the three components with the Te-method. We do not find any significant evidence of metallicity gradients between the components. Furthermore, we also detect [N ii]\textlambda6585, one of the highest redshift detections of this emission line. We find that in a small, metal-poor clump 0.2″ west of the North component, N/O is elevated compared to other regions, indicating that nitrogen enrichment originates from smaller substructures, possibly proto-globular clusters. [O iii]\textlambda5007 kinematics show that this system is merging, which is probably driving the ongoing, luminous starburst.","With the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we are now able to observe rest-frame optical and UV emission features, and hence probe the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, up to redshift \sim 14 (Arribas et al., 2023; Cameron et al., 2023a; Curtis-Lake et al., 2023; Harikane et al., 2023; Larson et al., 2023; Isobe et al., 2023b; Hsiao et al., 2023; Robertson et al., 2023; Abdurro’uf et al., 2024; Carniani et al., 2024; Harikane et al., 2024a; Sanders et al., 2024; Tacchella et al., 2023, 2024; Vikaeus et al., 2024). Before the launch of JWST, the main avenue to study the ISM properties of galaxies at the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR; z>6) was through [C ii]\textlambda158\mum and [O iii]\textlambda88\mum emission lines and dust continuum observed with mm/sub-mm facilities (mainly ALMA). These observations revealed the early emergence of rotating discs (e.g. Smit et al., 2018; Neeleman et al., 2020; Rizzo et al., 2020; Fraternali et al., 2021; Lelli et al., 2021; Rizzo et al., 2021; Parlanti et al., 2023a; Rowland et al., 2024) and a fast production of dust (e.g. Laporte et al., 2017; Witstok et al., 2022; Bouwens et al., 2021). However, the ISM studies were severely limited by the lack of access to rest-frame optical emission lines as well as the limited detectability of FIR lines by ALMA.JWST has demonstrated its ability to spatially resolve the ISM at very high-z, opening the opportunity to study not only the global properties but also the internal structure of early cosmic systems (e.g. Arribas et al., 2023; Decarli et al., 2024; D’Eugenio et al., 2023a; Jones et al., 2024; Lamperti et al., 2024; Rodríguez Del Pino et al., 2024; Übler et al., 2024b). With its unmatched capabilities, NIRSpec (near infra-red spectrograph) on board JWST has enabled rapid progress in the physical properties of galaxies at z>3 when it comes to their abundance (Pérez-González et al., 2023; Harikane et al., 2024b; Robertson et al., 2024; McLeod et al., 2024), detection of active galactic nuclei (AGN, e.g. Furtak et al. 2023; Greene et al. 2023; Harikane et al. 2023; Kocevski et al. 2023; Maiolino et al. 2023a, b; Matthee et al. 2023; Scholtz et al. 2023b; Perna et al. 2023a; Onoue et al. 2023; Übler et al. 2023, 2024a, 2024b), bursty star-formation histories (SFHs) (e.g. Dressler et al., 2023; Endsley et al., 2023; Looser et al., 2023; Tacchella et al., 2022; Clarke et al., 2024), discovery of compact galaxies with intense starbursts and/or nuclear activity enshrouded by significant amounts of warm dust (Akins et al., 2024; Casey et al., 2024; Pérez-González et al., 2024b) and ISM conditions (e.g. Sanders et al., 2023; Cameron et al., 2023a; Reddy et al., 2023; Calabro et al., 2024). JWST observations of high redshift galaxies have revealed metal-poor galaxies with intense star formation, releasing large amounts of ionising radiation resulting in high ionisation parameters (Hirschmann et al., 2022; Curti et al., 2024b, 2023a; Tacchella et al., 2023; Trump et al., 2023; Simmonds et al., 2024). Furthermore, the access to deep observations of rest-frame optical and UV emission lines allows astronomers to investigate the abundances of different elements, revealing, in some cases, unexpected ionisation and chemical enrichment patterns (e.g. Bunker et al., 2023; Maiolino et al., 2023a; Cameron et al., 2023c; Isobe et al., 2023a; Cameron et al., 2023b; Topping et al., 2024; D’Eugenio et al., 2023b; Schaerer et al., 2024a; Ji et al., 2024a, c). JWST/NIRSpec has also allowed for significant progress in galaxy kinematics, as we now have access to optical emission lines at z>3.5 (Nelson et al., 2023; Übler et al., 2024b; Jones et al., 2024; Lamperti et al., 2024; Rodríguez Del Pino et al., 2024; de Graaff et al., 2024), allowing for a comparison of ionised and cold gas kinematics at high redshift (Parlanti et al., 2023b; Lamperti et al., 2024). In this paper, we present new observations of COS-3018 from the Galaxy Assembly with NIRSpec Integral Field Spectroscopy (GA-NIFS) Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) programme (e.g. Arribas et al. 2023; Marshall et al. 2023; Perna et al. 2023b; Übler et al. 2023; Ji et al. 2024b; D’Eugenio et al. 2023a; Jones et al. 2024; Lamperti et al. 2024; Rodríguez Del Pino et al. 2024; Pérez-González et al. 2024a; Übler et al. 2024a, b). This survey aims to investigate the spatially resolved stellar populations, ISM, outflow and kinematics properties of 55 quasars, AGN and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the redshift range of z\sim 2-11 with NIRSpec IFU, utilising both the PRISM, medium and high spectral resolution observations. In this work, we present spatially resolved gas and stellar populations of COS-3018 using new JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) high-resolution grating (R \sim 2700) and low-resolution prism (R \sim 100) observations as well as JWST/NIRCam imaging. COS-3018, a star-forming galaxy at z=6.85, was first discovered by Smit et al. (2014) by identifying objects with large equivalent width (EW) of [O iii]\textlambda\textlambda5007,4959 + H\textbeta based on HST and Spitzer/IRAC photometry (EW{}_{\rm rest}>1200~{}\AA). COS-3018 has been intensively studied using both ground-based near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and ALMA. Laporte et al. (2017) used VLT/X-shooter (Vernet et al., 2011) to detect C iii]\textlambda\textlambda1907,1909 emission, without any detection of Ly\textalpha or higher-ionisation lines like He ii\textlambda1640 and C iv\textlambda\textlambda1548,1551. ALMA observations of [C ii]\textlambda158\mum emission lines revealed a velocity gradient in the system, suggesting an established cold rotating disc at these early epochs (Smit et al., 2018), later confirmed by Parlanti et al. (2023b) as a turbulent disk with high-velocity dispersion. Vallini et al. (2020) studied the ISM conditions in COS-3018 using C iii]\textlambda\textlambda1907,1909, [C ii]\textlambda158\mum and [O iii]\textlambda88\mum observations, inferring a high metallicity of \sim 0.4 Z⊙ and an ISM density of \sim 500 cm-3. Witstok et al. (2022) further analysed the ALMA dust continuum and integrated emission line properties to constrain the dust temperature of \sim30-40 K, resulting in a high dust mass of 2-26\times 10^{7} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}. This dust mass measurement implies a dust-to-stellar mass ratio of 5 per cent, challenging theoretical models to create this much dust by such a high redshift. COS-3018 was observed by the PRIMER programme covering the target with NIR imaging with JWST/NIRCam instrument. Harikane et al. (2024a) showed the COS-3018 is composed of multiple UV clumps with a total stellar mass estimated at \sim 10^{9.6} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}. The paper is structured as follows. In § 2 we present the JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam and ALMA observations, as well as data reduction of each of the datasets. In § 3 we describe the detailed analysis of each of the observations. In § 4, we present and discuss our findings and in § 5 we summarise the results of this work. Throughout this work, we adopt a flat \LambdaCDM cosmology: H0: 67.4 km s-1 Mpc-1, \Omega_{\mathrm{m}} = 0.315, and \Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.685 (Planck Collaboration et al., 2020)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07676v1,Non-parametric identification of single-lined binary candidates in young clusters using single-epoch spectroscopy,"Aims. Binarity plays a crucial role in star formation and evolution. Consequently, identifying binary stars is essential to deepen our understanding of these processes. We propose a method to investigate the observed radial velocity distribution of massive stars in young clusters with the goal of identifying binary systems.Methods. We reconstruct the radial velocity distribution using a three-layers hierarchical Bayesian non-parametric approach: non-parametric methods are data-driven models able to infer arbitrary probability densities under minimal mathematical assumptions. When applying our statistical framework, it is possible to identify variable stars and binary systems because these deviate significantly from the expected intrinsic Gaussian distribution for radial velocities.Results. We test our method with the massive star forming region within the giant HII region M17. We are able to confidently identify binaries and variable stars with as little as single-epoch observations. The distinction between variable and binary stars improves significantly when introducing additional epochs.","In the last decades, it has become clear that multiplicity is a fundamental aspect of stellar formation and evolution, especially towards higher masses (see Offner et al. 2023, and references therein). Massive stars are preferentially observed in binary systems, close enough to interact with their companions during their lifetime. The latter is shown by observations of Milky Way clusters (Sana et al. 2012, 2013; Dunstall et al. 2015; Moe & Di Stefano 2015; Barbá et al. 2017; Moe & Di Stefano 2017; Banyard et al. 2022) as well as in the LMC (Almeida et al. 2017; Villaseñor et al. 2021). The presence of close companions affects all stages of the stellar life, from the pre-main sequence phase (Li et al. 2024) to the end-of-life explosions, potentially introducing new physics during the stellar life (e.g. Schneider et al. 2019; Frost et al. 2024) and affecting the properties and orbital evolution of double-compact objects, which may eventually become the progenitors of gravitational wave sources (Blaauw 1991; Zinnecker & Yorke 2007; Langer 2012; de Mink et al. 2013; Tan et al. 2014). Due to the proximity of the stars in close binary systems, these systems are usually not possible to be resolved spatially. Therefore, the best way of identifying them is in velocity space via spectroscopic measurements. Close binaries are detected through periodic Doppler shifts of the photospheric lines in their spectra (e.g., Sana et al. 2013; Dunstall et al. 2015; Kobulnicky et al. 2014). Spectroscopic binaries detected through multi epoch spectroscopy are usually divided in two categories, SB1 and SB2. SB2 refers to double-lined spectroscopic binaries, in which both components are visible in the spectra, whereas SB1 refers to single-line spectroscopic binaries with only one component of the system is visible in the spectrum. The binary nature of the system is determined via radial velocity shifts. Several surveys aimed at identifying massive binary stars have been carried out both in the Milky Way and in lower metallicity environments such as the LMC and SMC (e.g., Sana et al. 2013; Dunstall et al. 2015; Kobulnicky et al. 2014; Almeida et al. 2017; Villaseñor et al. 2021). The minimum number of epochs covered by such surveys is typically three, with the second epoch a few days after the first one and the third a few months after. This allows to efficiently detect binaries with periods up to 10 days as well as those with periods up to 6 months. However, three epochs are usually not sufficient if one wants to get accurate orbital solutions: some surveys extent to tens of epochs per object (e.g. Sana et al. 2013). An indirect method to estimate the amount of close binaries in a cluster was proposed by Sana et al. (2017) and Ramírez-Tannus et al. (2021). In these studies, the authors measured the radial velocity dispersion (\sigma_{\mathrm{1D}}) of single epoch observations, which in low density clusters is strongly dominated by the orbital properties of the binary population. The multiplicity properties of a cluster can be quantified by comparing the measured \sigma_{\mathrm{1D}} value with that resulting from Monte Carlo population synthesis, where each parent population is characterised by different underlying multiplicity properties. This method has the advantage of allowing to get an idea of the underlying multiplicity properties of a cluster with a single epoch observation, reducing considerably the observing time with respect to a multi epoch approach. However, there are several underlying multiplicity properties that have an effect on the \sigma_{\mathrm{1D}} of a cluster and those cannot be individually determined based on the \sigma_{\mathrm{1D}} only. For example, Sana et al. (2017) and Ramírez-Tannus et al. (2021) show that the low \sigma_{\mathrm{1D}} measured for the young cluster M17 can either be explained either by a low f_{\mathrm{bin}} or by a large P_{\mathrm{cutoff}} with respect to other, slightly older Galactic clusters. In order to determine which of the two scenarios causes the low \sigma_{\mathrm{1D}} observed it is necessary to determine the actual f_{\mathrm{bin}} of the cluster. In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on a Bayesian non-parametric method to efficiently identify binary candidates through single epoch spectroscopy. Non-parametric methods are powerful tools to infer probability distributions without being committal to any specific functional form and, in a certain sense, let the data speak for themselves. The name ‘non-parametric methods’ might be misleading: in fact, these models have an infinite number of parameters that can be used to accommodate arbitrary probability densities without the need for any fine-tuning. Such flexibility comes with the cost that it is not possible to give a direct physical interpretation of the inferred parameters, thus any interpretation of the reconstructed features of the distribution must be done a posteriori. The framework presented in this work, being applicable to single-epoch observations, can reduce considerably the observing time required in comparison to the multi epoch approach, the flexibility of non-parametric methods will allow us to account both for outliers (such as stars in binary systems with limited epochs) and deviations from the expected Gaussian shape of the underlying distribution. Most importantly, this flexible characterisation of the radial velocity distribution allows us to identify the systems that are worth following up with multi-epoch spectroscopy, opening for a further optimisation of the available observing time usage. The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we present the statistical framework that allows us to detect binary stars based on single epoch spectroscopy. Section 3 presents the application of this framework to a set of simulated observations to assess its applicability, whereas in Section 4 we apply it to a set of observations within the massive star forming region M17 and compare our binary identification to that of Ramírez-Tannus et al. (2024), who identified binary stars based on multi-epoch spectroscopy. In Section 5 we discuss and conclude this work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07605v1,"Measures of luminous and dark matter
in galaxies across time","Dark matter is one of the pillars of the current standard model of structure formation: it is assumed to constitute most of the matter in the Universe. However, it can so far only be probed indirectly through its gravitational effects, and its nature remains elusive. In this focus meeting, we discussed different methods used to estimate galaxies’ visible and dark matter masses in the nearby and distant Universe. We reviewed successes of the standard model relying on cold dark matter, confronted observations with simulations, and highlighted inconsistencies between the two. We discussed how robust mass measurements can help plan, perform, and refine particle dark matter searches. We further exchanged about alternatives to cold dark matter, such as warm, self-interacting, and fuzzy dark matter, as well as modified gravity. Finally, we discussed prospects and strategies that could be implemented to reveal the nature of this crucial component of the Universe.","1 Rationale In 1933, Fritz Zwicky used the Doppler velocities and luminosities of galaxies in the Coma cluster to estimate the total mass [Zwicky1933, (Zwicky 1933)]. He reported an enormous discrepancy between, respectively, the gravitating and luminous masses of the system. This study raised the question of a ‘missing mass’ and coined the term ‘dark matter’. Although the discrepancy was overestimated, still a factor of six remains today. In the late 1970s and beginning 1980s, extended rotation curves showed that the rotation velocity of disc galaxies does not decrease beyond their visible domain ([Rubin1970, Rubin et al. 1970], [Rubin1980, 1980], [Bosma1978, Bosma 1978], [vanAlbada1985, van Albada et al. 1985]). That is, the enclosed gravitating mass increases as a function of radius, suggesting that galaxies are surrounded by a dark matter halo which extends much further than their visible matter. Theoretical models of structure formation [White1978, Peebles1982, (e.g., White & Rees 1978, Peebles 1982)], which were gradually refined over the years thanks to observations of the Universe on large scales, have in parallel also revealed the need for such a non-baryonic and cold matter component, making it one of the main pillars of the current cosmological model (e.g. [Cirelli2024, Cirelli, Strumia & Zupan 2024], and references therein). The last 50 years saw the obtention of a large number of detailed observations of galaxies, clusters and the cosmic web across the electromagnetic spectrum. These observations enabled to measure velocities of gas and stars in galaxies to trace the gravitating mass, and luminosities to infer the visible mass, along with maps of the distribution and chemistry of gas and stars. At the same time, the increase in computing resources and techniques has enabled astrophysicists and cosmologists to simulate the Universe from large to small scales, to construct detailed dynamical models of galaxies, and to compare both these simulations and models to observations in a statistically robust way (e.g. [Wechsler2018, Wechsler & Tinker 2018], [Angulo, Angulo & Hahn 2022]). All this has led to the current consensus that, without dark matter, it would be impossible to explain a plethora of phenomena such as the amplitude of baryonic acoustic oscillations, the formation and evolution of cosmological structures, and the motion of stars and gas on galactic scales. However, the a priori most obvious particle candidates [Porter2011, (e.g., Porter, Johnson & Graham 2011)] have not yet been detected by non-gravitational means, and there might be observational hints for departure from the cold and collisionless dark matter paradigm on subgalactic scales [Bullock2017, (e.g. Bullock & Boylan-Kolchin 2017)], opening the ground for alternative theories of gravity. In parallel, many exotic candidates have been proposed for the nature of dark matter, from ultra-light axions to massive compact objects like primordial black holes. The current era of precision astrophysics and cosmology provides us with an enormous amount of quality data that was impossible to obtain in the past. For example, spectroscopic surveys with JWST and ALMA can resolve the hot and cold gas kinematics of galaxies up to the peak of cosmic dawn; upcoming gamma-ray facilities such as CTA, in combination with the Fermi-LAT in orbit, will put to the test various dark matter particle models; new generation radio telescopes like MeerKAT and SKA will allow the study of neutral hydrogen up to higher redshifts. Are we sufficiently prepared to interpret these data? Do we have the models to robustly measure and disentangle the distribution of luminous and dark matter, and the simulations to accurately mimic galaxy-scale baryonic processes and their impact on the total mass distribution? Is there something lacking in the overall efforts? How do we improve as a community, and what should be the main focus for the next five years? At the IAU General Assembly 2024 in Cape Town, South Africa, the Focus Meeting ‘Measures of Luminous and Dark Matter in Galaxies Across Time’ drew the attention on galaxy mass estimates and their importance to understand the interplay between baryonic and dark matter and help unravel the nature of dark matter. We notably aimed at contributing to answer the following questions: (1) How consistent are galaxy mass measurements based on different tracers? (2) How robust are galaxy mass measurements against modelling assumptions and degeneracies? (3) How accurate are state-of-the-art cosmological simulations reproducing current galaxy mass measurements across scales and cosmic time? (4) Are dark matter halo properties the result of baryonic feedback, or are they due to the nature of dark matter itself? (5) What are the missing observations to understand the nature of dark matter? (6) What is the impact of having accurate mass measurements on current dark matter particle constraints, and how will this help us to strategically plan (and succeed with) future dark matter searches? (7) Do we need alternative theories of dark matter? If yes, how capable are they in representing galaxy mass measurements across scales and cosmic time? To address these questions, the proposed program contained six sessions, covering the following topics: (1) Observed distribution of dark matter. In this session, we planned to discuss the robustness of galaxy masses estimated using various tracers in local and high-redshift Universe, such as stellar and gas kinematics from galaxies (spirals, ellipticals, dwarfs, dwarf spheroidal, satellites), galaxy clusters, gravitational lensing, globular clusters, planetary nebulae, tidal-tails. We wanted to delve into the dynamical mass modelling techniques of the different tracers, and to address the following questions: How consistent are galaxy mass measurements based on different tracers? How robust are galaxy mass measurements against modelling assumptions and degeneracies? What are the missing observations to understand the nature of dark matter? (2) Successes of the cold dark matter paradigm. In this session, we planned to validate and connect the mass measurements of various tracers with cosmological simulations within the standard model of cosmology. This session also aimed to address the interplay between baryons and dark matter, to discuss open questions related to galaxy mass assembly and dark matter halo evolution, and to highlight the successes of the cold dark matter paradigm. We notably planned to address the following questions: How accurate are cold dark matter cosmological simulations in reproducing the current galaxy mass measurements across scales and cosmic time? To what extent are dark matter halo properties at galactic scales driven by baryonic processes or the nature of dark matter itself? (3) Challenges of the cold dark matter paradigm. In this session, we planned to continue the previous session focussing on the regimes where the standard model of cosmology faces difficulties in describing observations. We notably planned to address the following questions: What are the challenges of the cold dark matter paradigm at galactic and extra-galactic scales? Are these challenges due to technological limitations, or does the theory need to be refined or revised? (4) Constraining dark matter particle candidates with galactic observations. In this session, we wanted to show the role of robust mass measurements of galaxies in planning, performing and refining particle dark matter searches. We notably wanted to discuss the competence of existing and upcoming gamma-ray facilities (such as CTA and Fermi-LAT) and how they plan to test dark matter particle models. With this session, we planned to address the following questions: What is the impact of having accurate mass measurements on current dark matter particle constraints, and how will this help us to plan (and succeed with) future dark matter searches? What is the potential of current and future gamma-ray telescopes to test dark matter particle models with galactic observations? (5) Alternatives to cold dark matter particles. Given the status of the mass discrepancy problem in galaxies, efforts of dark matter searches, and the limitation of the cold dark matter paradigm, we planned to discuss the scope and success of alternative theories to cold dark matter such as warm, self-interacting, and fuzzy dark matter, and modified theories of gravity. In particular, we planned to discuss the following questions: How accurate are other dark matter cosmological simulations in reproducing the current galaxy mass measurements across scales and cosmic time? Do we need an alternative to dark matter, such as modified gravity? If yes, can it justify the observables of structure formation and Big-bang nucleosynthesis at all scales? (6) Future dark matter studies. In this session, we planned to discuss the strategies for upcoming facilities: the designs of instruments that are needed to disentangle the various mass components in the inner region of galaxies across the electromagnetic spectrum and cosmic time, and the sensitivity and design of future experiments needed for dark matter searches. Furthermore, we wanted to discuss the optimal use of archival data in predicting and/or revealing the nature of dark matter, including big data management and machine learning. We notably planned to address the following questions: Which kind of experiments are needed to understand the nature of dark matter? How can we use archival data to better understand the mass discrepancy problem and improve the current state of dynamical models? Can machine learning help strengthen dark matter constraints?"
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07525v2,The Dependence of Dark Matter Halo Properties on the Morphology of Their Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing,"Xu & Jing (2022) reported a monotonic relationship between host halo mass (M_{h}) and the morphology of massive central galaxies, characterized by the Sérsic index (n), at fixed stellar mass, suggesting that morphology could serve as a good secondary proxy for halo mass. Since their results were derived using the indirect abundance matching method, we further investigate the connection between halo properties and central galaxy morphology using weak gravitational lensing. We apply galaxy-galaxy lensing to measure the excess surface density around CMASS central galaxies with stellar masses in the range of 11.3<\log M_{*}/{\rm M_{\odot}}<11.7, using the HSC shear catalog processed through the Fourier_Quad pipeline. By dividing the sample based on n, we confirm a positive correlation between n and M_{h}, and observe a possible evidence of the positive correlation of n and halo concentration. After accounting for color, we find that neither color nor morphology alone can determine halo mass, suggesting that a combination of both may serve as a better secondary proxy. In comparison to hydrodynamic simulations, we find that TNG300 produce much weaker correlations between M_{h} and n. Furthermore, disabling jet-mode active galactic nuclei feedback in SIMBA simulations results in the disappearance of the positive n-M_{h} relationship, suggesting that the star formation history influenced by black holes may be a contributing factor.","In the \LambdaCDM cosmological model, the large-scale structure of the universe is shaped by the gravitational influence of dark matter, such as halos, filaments and voids. These dark matter halos subsequently act as “seeds” for galaxy formation. Dark matter, a substance that has not yet been directly observed, constitute the major mass of the universe, whereas stars are the luminous objects we can observe. The Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation (SHMR) reveals the intimate connection between the stellar mass of galaxies and the mass of dark matter halos, indicating the link between galaxy formation and the evolution of dark matter halos. It is generally believed that massive dark matter halos host more massive galaxies. Therefore, by utilizing SHMR, we can assign galaxy masses to halos in N-body simulations, or infer halo mass from stellar mass. This allows for a deeper understanding of the evolutionary history of galaxies, and their coevolution with dark matter halos. Although SHMR provides critical insights into the connection between galaxies and halos, it also exhibits significant scatter (Cooper et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2023; Zentner et al., 2014; Zu et al., 2021, 2022), primarily due to the influence of other galaxy properties such as size, color, and morphology. For instance, some studies find that halos of blue (star-forming) galaxies are less massive than those of red (quenched/passive) galaxies with the same stellar mass (Rodríguez-Puebla et al., 2015; Mandelbaum et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Xu & Jing, 2022). Conversely, other studies (Tinker et al., 2013; Moster et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2019) report the opposite conclusion. The morphology of galaxies is also found to correlate with halo mass. Galaxy morphology is typically described by the Sérsic profile (Sérsic, 1963), which characterizes the brightness, size, and the morphology of a galaxy. The Sérsic profile is modeled as: I(r)=I_{e}{\rm exp}\bigg{\{}-b_{n}\bigg{[}\bigg{(}\frac{R}{R_{e}}\bigg{)}^{% \frac{1}{n}}-1\bigg{]}\bigg{\}}, (1) where b_{n} is defined through \gamma(2n;b_{n})=\Gamma(2n), \Gamma and \gamma are the Gamma function and the lower incomplete Gamma function, respectively. I_{e} is the surface brightness at the half-light radius R_{e}. The Sérsic index n quantifies the curvature of the galaxy’s luminosity profile, with higher values indicating more concentrated core of light distributions. In this work, we focus on the relation between halo masses and the morphology of galaxies, characterized by the Sérsic index (n). Studies from Sonnenfeld et al. (2019) utilize lensing data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC) to study the relationship between halo mass and stellar mass, galaxy size, and Sérsic index in the CMASS sample. They find no significant correlation between halo mass and size or Sérsic index at a fixed stellar mass. However, Taylor et al. (2020) find that for galaxies with a stellar mass of around 10^{10.5}{\rm M_{\odot}}, the Sérsic index and effective radius are the best indicators of host halo mass, while showing weaker correlations with star formation rate or color. Applying the Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC; Xu et al., 2022) method, Xu & Jing (2022) find that more compact, red, and larger galaxies tend to be located in more massive halos. But their method of estimating halo mass relies on abundance matching, which assumes a one-to-one correspondence between stellar mass and the satellite distribution of the host halo. Therefore, the relationship between galaxy morphology and halo mass remains unclear, and the physical origin influencing the SHMR also remains an open question. Weak gravitational lensing can serve as a crucial probe to the total mass of dark matter halos and the matter distribution, which distorts background galaxy images around massive objects, known as shear. Galaxy-galaxy lensing, in particular, can directly measure the average density profile of halos around galaxies or galaxy clusters, thus reflecting the halo mass. In this work, we utilize the lensing data from the third public data release of HSC to further analyze and discuss the dependence of the host halo mass on the morphology of massive central galaxies with stellar masses in the range of 11.3<{\rm log}(M_{*}/{\rm M_{\odot}})<11.7. We introduce our galaxy sample and shear catalog in Section 2, and describe our lensing measurement methods in Section 3. In Section 4, we analyze the measured lensing signals and the corresponding dependence on central galaxy morphologies and the properties of the galaxy clusters. Subsequently, in Section 5, we explore the underlying physical origins using the SIMBA and TNG simulations. Finally, we summarize our findings in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07492v1,Combining neural networks with galaxy light subtraction for discovering strong lenses in the HSC SSP,"Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses are valuable objects for a variety of astrophysical and cosmological applications. Strong lensing galaxies are rare, so efficient search methods, such as convolutional neural networks, are often used on large imaging datasets. In this work, we apply a new technique to improve the performance of supervised neural networks by subtracting the central (lensing) galaxy light from both the training and test datasets. We use multiband imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP) as our training and test datasets. By subtracting the lensing galaxy light, we increase the contrast of the lensed source compared to the original imaging data. We also apply the light subtraction to non-lenses in order to compare them to the light-subtracted lenses. Residual features resulting from poor light subtraction can adversely affect the performance of networks trained on the subtracted images alone. We find that combining the light-subtracted images with the original gri-band images for training and classification can overcome this and improve the overall classification accuracy. We find the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve can be improved to 0.841 using the combination of the fiducial images and light-subtracted images, compared to 0.808 for the fiducial imaging dataset alone. This may be a promising technique for improving future lens searches using CNNs.","Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses are valuable objects for a variety of astrophysical and cosmological applications, including studies of the mass structure of galaxies (e.g., [Koopmans et al. (2006), Sonnenfeld et al. (2013), Shajib et al. (2021)]), the properties of dark matter (e.g., [More et al. (2009), Vegetti et al. (2014), Hezaveh et al. (2016), Nierenberg et al. (2017), Gilman et al. (2020)]), resolved studies of distant sources at high resolution (e.g., [Rybak et al. (2015), Cañameras et al. (2017)]), and the measurement of cosmological parameters (e.g., [Refsdal (1964), Wong et al. (2020), Birrer et al. (2020)]). However, strong lensing galaxies are rare, requiring a chance alignment of a foreground galaxy (the “lens"", often a massive elliptical galaxy) with a bright background object (the “source"", often a star-forming galaxy or a quasar). As a result, the best datasets for discovering strong lenses are deep, wide-field, multiband imaging surveys that cover a large area of the sky. For example, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; e.g., [Bolton et al. (2006)]), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS; e.g., [Li et al. (2021), He et al. (2020), Petrillo et al. (2017)]) and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP; e.g., [Sonnenfeld et al. (2018), Sonnenfeld et al. (2020), Chan et al. (2020), Chan et al. (2024), Wong et al. (2022)]) provide such datasets, sometimes with supplementary spectroscopic data that can aid lens searches. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST; [Ivezić et al. (2019)]) will eventually cover a majority of the sky to unprecedented depths. Therefore, efficient methods are needed to search for strong lenses in these large datasets, such as arc-finding algorithms (e.g., [More et al. (2012)]), citizen science searches (e.g., [More et al. (2016), Sonnenfeld et al. (2020)]), and machine learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs can process imaging data efficiently and identify characteristic patterns. CNNs have been proven to be able to classify strong lensing objects with reasonable accuracy in multiband imaging data (e.g., [Jacobs et al. (2017), Jacobs et al. (2019), Petrillo et al. (2019), Huang et al. (2020), Li et al. (2020)]), substantially reducing the number of lens candidates that need to be visually inspected to verify them. The main challenge in identifying galaxy-scale gravitational lenses is distinguishing the multiple lensed images from the foreground galaxy light, as the image separation tends to be comparable to the atmospheric seeing, particularly for lenses with small Einstein radius. Using multiband data is helpful, as the sources tend to be blue star-forming galaxies while the lenses tend to be red elliptical galaxies, but faint sources can still be challenging for CNNs to identify. One way to increase the contrast between the lens galaxy and the lensed images is to subtract the lens galaxy light from the images. The RINGFINDER algorithm (Gavazzi et al., 2014) used lens light subtraction, which helped to detect many small angular separation lenses that were missed by citizen scientists who were not able to view such subtracted images (see Figure 7 of More et al. (2016)). A subsequent citizen science search by Sonnenfeld et al. (2020) used the YattaLens software (Sonnenfeld et al., 2018) to subtract the central galaxy light, which helped to improve the discovery of these lenses, demonstrating the effectiveness of light subtraction for this purpose. In this work, we attempt to improve the performance of lens-finding CNNs by subtracting the central galaxy light from both the training and test datasets of our networks using YattaLens to highlight the light from the lensed source compared to the original imaging data. A similar technique was tried by Canameras et al. (2023), who used difference images between multiband observations as a proxy for lens light subtraction. We use a more sophisticated method to subtract the central galaxy light, but compare our results qualitatively to those of Canameras et al. (2023). Such light subtraction has generally not been applied to CNN-based lens searches in the past, but may be important for upcoming ground-based surveys (e.g., LSST). We also apply the subtraction to non-lenses in order to make the conditions the same, as we expect an ideal light subtraction to leave no residual features since there is no background source. Therefore, our neural networks can more easily find the characteristics of the source galaxy and classify strong lensing objects correctly. We use multiband imaging from the Wide layer of the HSC SSP as our training and test data. The HSC SSP is an ideal dataset for discovering strong lenses due to its depth and area, and many galaxy-scale strong lenses have already been discovered as part of the Survey of Gravitationally lensed Objects in HSC Imaging (SuGOHI111https://www-utap.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ oguri/sugohi/; Sonnenfeld et al. (2018); Wong et al. (2018, 2022); Chan et al. (2024)) project. Several studies, including some working with the public HSC SSP data, have made use of neural networks to discover lens candidates in this dataset (Cañameras et al., 2021; Shu et al., 2022; Andika et al., 2023; Jaelani et al., 2023; Schuldt et al., 2024). We construct three datasets consisting of the same objects for training: the fiducial HSC gri-band imaging dataset, the dataset with light subtraction applied, and the combination of the two. We first optimize our CNN for the fiducial dataset, train it on the other two datasets, and compare the performance of each model. Then, we build new models optimized for each dataset and compare their performance in order to determine whether the light subtraction is able to improve the ability of CNNs to identify strong lenses. This paper is organized as follows. We describe the data used in this study and our galaxy light subtraction procedure in Section 2. We describe our neural network design and architecture in Section 3. We present the performance of our networks when applying our light subtraction procedure and evaluate the characteristics of correctly and incorrectly classified objects in Section 4. We summarize our conclusions and discuss potential future work in Section 5. Throughout this paper, all magnitudes given are on the AB system."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07458v1,Size Growth on Short Timescales of Star-Forming Galaxies: Insights from Size Variation with Rest-Frame Wavelength with JADES,"We investigate size variation with rest-frame wavelength for star-forming galaxies based on the second JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey data release. Star-forming galaxies are typically smaller at longer wavelength from UV-to-NIR at z<3.5, especially for more massive galaxies, indicating the inside-out assembly with in-situ star formation if ignoring dust attenuation. The size variation with wavelength shows strong dependence on stellar mass, and shows little or no dependence on redshift, specific star formation rate and galaxy environment. This suggests that the size growth of star-forming galaxies is a self-regulated process primarily governed by stellar mass. We model size as a function of both mass and redshift simultaneously, obtaining R_{\rm e}\propto M_{*}^{0.23}(1+z)^{-1.04} at a wavelength of 0.45 {\mu\mathrm{m}}, and R_{\rm e}\propto M_{*}^{0.20}(1+z)^{-1.08} at 1.0 {\mu\mathrm{m}}. Based on this size evolution and the star formation main sequence from the literature, we obtain the locus of typical size growth for individual galaxies of different masses on the mass-size plane. The moving trend of galaxies on the mass-size plane, which indicates the slopes of their locus, strongly correlates with the size ratio between 0.45 {\mu\mathrm{m}} and 1.0 {\mu\mathrm{m}}, supporting the idea that the size variation with wavelength provides important information on size growth of galaxies on short timescales.","1 introduction Understanding the relationship between mass and size in galaxies, particularly in the context of quiescent and star-forming galaxies, is crucial for unraveling the complexities of galaxy evolution (e.g. Shen et al., 2003; van der Wel et al., 2014). The evolution of galaxy size with cosmic time offers insights into their assembly history and the interplay with their dark matter halos. Numerous studies have delved into the complexities of the mass-size relation, revealing intriguing patterns and correlations across different galaxy populations (e.g. Shen et al., 2003; van der Wel et al., 2014; Mowla et al., 2019b; Dimauro et al., 2019; Nedkova et al., 2021; Ferguson et al., 2004; Trujillo et al., 2006; Buitrago et al., 2008; Carollo et al., 2013; Ono et al., 2013; Lange et al., 2015; Faisst et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2021; Ormerod et al., 2024; Ward et al., 2024). Early studies by Shen et al. (2003), based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al., 2000) data, highlighted the distinct dependencies between size and stellar mass in early and late-type galaxies. Late-type galaxies, characterized by ongoing star formation and prominent spiral arms, tend to exhibit larger sizes compared to early-type galaxies at a given mass, which are typically more spheroidal and feature older stellar populations. Instead of separating galaxies by their morphological type, later studies of mass-size relation tend to divide the galaxies according to their star formation activities: star-forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies (van der Wel et al., 2014). Quiescent galaxies tend to be spheroidal in structure and show smaller half-light radii compared to star-forming galaxies of similar mass and redshift (van der Wel et al., 2014; Mowla et al., 2019b). This size difference is thought to be influenced by both “nurture,” such as post-quenching fading of stellar populations (Tacchella et al., 2015, 2016; Carollo et al., 2016; Lilly & Carollo, 2016), and “nature,” possibly reflecting different formation processes for spheroids and disks (Fang et al., 2013; Barro et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018a). On the other hand, star-forming galaxies exhibit a different trajectory on the mass-size plane. Their evolution, particularly in terms of size, is intricately linked to ongoing star formation processes and gas accretion from their circumgalactic medium. Studies have shown a correlation between stellar mass, effective radius, and the quenching process, especially for galaxies with stellar masses above a certain threshold (van der Wel et al., 2009; Fang et al., 2013; Omand et al., 2014; Barro et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2020). This suggests a nuanced interplay between internal mechanisms (e.g., stellar feedback, active galactic nuclei feedback) and environmental factors in driving the growth of galaxies and quenching (Peng et al., 2010; Morishita et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018b; Wang & Lilly, 2020). Benefits from advancements in observational capabilities, large surveys such as the 3D-HST survey (Brammer et al., 2012) and HST/WFC3 imaging from CANDELS (Grogin et al., 2011; Koekemoer et al., 2011), have allowed for a deeper understanding of galaxy evolution (Mowla et al., 2019b; Nedkova et al., 2021; Ward et al., 2024). van der Wel et al. (2014) investigated galaxies at z<3 and indicated that star-forming galaxies have a mass-size relation with R_{\mathrm{eff}}\propto M_{*}^{0.21}, and quiescent galaxies exhibit a much steeper relation with R_{\mathrm{eff}}\propto M_{*}^{0.75}. In addition, the size of star-forming galaxies decreases with redshift following R_{\mathrm{eff}}\propto(1+z)^{-0.75}, and the sizes of quiescent galaxies exhibit a much faster evolution following R_{\mathrm{eff}}\propto(1+z)^{-1.48}. Different from star-forming galaxies that can grow their sizes inside-out by in-situ star formation in the disks (Wang et al., 2019; Wang & Lilly, 2023; Du et al., 2024), quiescent galaxies have increased by a factor of \sim3-5 in size since redshift of 2 via different mechanisms such as gas-poor minor mergers (Toft et al., 2007; Franx et al., 2008). Studies of galaxy size often face challenges due to redshift limitations and wavelength considerations. The HST is restricted to observing the rest-frame V band up to redshift of 2, while alternative measurements in the rest-frame ultraviolet have produced different results compared to optical studies (Oesch et al., 2010; Mosleh et al., 2012; Ono et al., 2013; Shibuya et al., 2015; Holwerda et al., 2015). This is because galaxies show different sizes for different wavelengths (e.g. Vulcani et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2022; Suess et al., 2022; Costantin et al., 2023; Ormerod et al., 2024). Therefore, consistent wavelength measurements are crucial for accurate size assessments. Fortunately, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has significantly improved our capabilities, extending observations in the rest-frame V band up to redshift of 7 with its NIRCam instrument, enhancing our understanding of galaxy sizes across cosmic epochs. It provides us a new window to learn about the size evolution of galaxies at near-infrared wavelength. Based on the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Survey (CEERS; Finkelstein et al., 2022, 2023; Bagley et al., 2023), Ward et al. (2024) and Ormerod et al. (2024) reviewed the mass-size relation of galaxies with considering the above effect, and obtained consistent results with many previous works at similar wavelengths. With deep multi-band NIRCam images in GOODS-South from JADES, Ji et al. (2024) explored the size evolution of a sample of 161 quiescent galaxies, at three different rest-frame wavelengths from UV-to-NIR. All of these authors found that galaxies typically show larger size at shorter wavelength to a non-negligible extent, across the full range of wavelengths considered. In this work, utilizing the second data release of JADES (Eisenstein et al., 2023a), we aim to answer questions about how sizes vary with rest-frame wavelength of star-forming galaxies, and what controls the size variations. If ignoring the dust attenuation, the size variation with wavelength can reflect the distribution of newly formed stars with respect to older stellar populations. We aim to understand the distribution of stellar populations in galaxies with diverse physical properties. This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we briefly introduce the data we used and the sample selection. In Section 3, we show the size variation with rest-frame wavelength, and explore the dependence on galaxy properties. We construct a 2-dimensional fitting of size-mass-redshift relation for star-forming galaxies at two given wavelengths, 0.45 {\mu\mathrm{m}} and 1.0 {\mu\mathrm{m}}, obtaining consistent results with previous works. In Section 3.3.2, we dedicate to explore the evolution locus of individual galaxies on the mass-size plan, and discuss the potential connection with size variation with wavelength. We summarize our result in Section 4. In this paper, we assume concordance flat \mathrm{\Lambda CDM} cosmology with \Omega_{m}=0.308, \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.691, H_{0}=67.74 \mathrm{km\cdot s^{-1}\cdot Mpc^{-1}} (Planck Collaboration et al., 2016)."

The LVDB includes positional, structural, kinematic, chemical, and dynamical parameters for dwarf galaxies and star clusters. I discuss the motivation, structure, construction, and future expansion plans of the LVDB. I highlight catalogs on faint and compact ambiguous Milky Way systems, new Milky Way globular clusters and candidates, and globular clusters in nearby dwarf galaxies. The LVDB is complete for known dwarf galaxies within \sim 3\leavevmode\nobreak\ {\rm Mpc} and current efforts are underway to expand the database to resolved star systems in the Local Volume. I present publicly available examples and use cases of the LVDB focused on the census and population-level properties of the Local Group and discuss some theoretical avenues. The next decade will be an exciting era for near-field cosmology with many upcoming surveys and facilities, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Euclid mission, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, that will both discover new dwarf galaxies and star clusters in the Local Volume and characterize known dwarf galaxies and star clusters in more detail than ever before. The LVDB will be continually updated and is built to support and enable future dwarf galaxy and star cluster research in this data-rich era. The LVDB catalogs and package are publicly available as a GitHub repository, local_volume_database, and community use and contributions via GitHub are encouraged.","Dwarf galaxies are the most abundant type of galaxy in the universe. The lowest mass dwarf galaxies are among the most chemically pristine and dark matter dominated galaxies known and they are relics from the early universe (e.g., Tolstoy et al., 2009; Frebel & Norris, 2015; Simon, 2019; Battaglia & Nipoti, 2022). They are important probes of galaxy formation, reionization, and stellar feedback on the smallest scales (e.g., Simon, 2019; Collins & Read, 2022). Only in the Local Group and Local Volume are the lowest mass dwarf galaxies observable and resolved into stars. Over the past twenty years, the number of low mass dwarf galaxies and stellar systems in the Milky Way (MW), Local Group, and Local Volume has increased exponentially and pushed to fainter and fainter systems (e.g., McConnachie, 2012; Müller et al., 2017; Simon, 2019; Mutlu-Pakdil et al., 2024). Excitingly, the next generation of upcoming wide-field photometric surveys, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Euclid mission, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, are on the cusp of starting and they are expected to discover a plethora of new dwarf galaxies (e.g., Hargis et al., 2014; Mutlu-Pakdil et al., 2021). Given the upcoming surveys, an updated census of both the Local Group and Local Volume will assist and enable research into near-field cosmology and nearby dwarf galaxies. In particular, the nearby dwarf galaxies are important cosmological probes to assess the many small-scale issues with our current \Lambda cold dark matter (\LambdaCDM) model (e.g., Bullock & Boylan-Kolchin, 2017) and to uncover the nature of dark matter (e.g., Buckley & Peter, 2018; Tulin & Yu, 2018; Strigari, 2018; Nadler et al., 2021; McDaniel et al., 2024). Almost forgotten, there are a number of faint stellar systems in the MW with sizes and luminosities that overlap with the both the faint globular cluster population and faint dwarf galaxy population without a clear classification into their nature (e.g., Cerny et al., 2023a; Smith et al., 2024). There is a renewed interest in these ambiguous systems as some may be the faintest and smallest galaxies (e.g., Manwadkar & Kravtsov, 2022), primordial star clusters (Simon et al., 2024), and/or their remnants (e.g., Errani et al., 2024b). Classifying new satellites has been a difficult and time-consuming problem in the MW and classification will only get more difficult with the upcoming surveys. As such, an up-to-date census with the fundamental parameters of known stars clusters will be key to interpret new discoveries. Here I introduce the Local Volume Database (LVDB), a catalog of nearby dwarf galaxies and star clusters resolved into individual stars. Section 2 lays out the LVDB with subsections on the scope and purpose (§ 2.1), the content, structure, and construction (§ 2.2), how to contribute (§ 2.3), and citations (§ 2.4). Section 3 presents a series of examples and use cases of the LVDB highlighting the content of the LVDB and population level properties of nearby galaxies and star clusters.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07393v1,Monitoring of DDO68 ’Northern Ring’ SF regions during years 2016–2023,"DDO68 is a star-forming (SF) dwarf galaxy residing in a nearby void. Its gas metallicity is among the lowest known in the local Universe, with parameter 12+log(O/H) in the range of 6.96–7.3 dex. Six of its SF regions are located in or near the so-called ’Northern Ring’, in which the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images reveal many luminous young stars. We present for these SF regions (Knots) the results of optical monitoring in 35 epochs during the years 2016–2023. The data was acquired with the 6m (BTA) and the 1m telescopes of the Special Astrophysical Observatory and the 2.5m telescope of the MSU Caucasian Mountain Observatory. We complement the above results with the archive data from 10 other telescopes for 11 epochs during the years 1988–2013 and with 3 our BTA observations between 2005 and 2015. Our goal is to search for variability of these Knots and to relate it to the probable light variations of their brightest stars. One of them, DDO68-V1 (in Knot 3), was identified in 2008 with a luminous blue variable (LBV) star, born in the lowest metallicity environments. For Knot 3, variations of its integrated light in the previous epochs reached \sim0.8 mag. In the period since 2016, the amplitude of variations of Knot 3 reached \sim0.3 mag. For the rest Knots, due to the lower amplitudes, the manifestation of variability is less pronounced. We examine the presence of variability via the criterion \chi^{2} and the Robust Median Statistics and discuss the robustness of the detected variations. The variability is detected according to the both criteria in the lightcurves of all Knots with the \chi^{2} confidence level of \alpha = 0.0005. The peak-to-peak amplitudes of variations are \sim0.09, \sim0.13, \sim0.11, \sim0.08 and \sim0.16 mag for Knots 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The amplitudes of the related variations of the brightest supergiants in these regions can reach of \sim3.0 mag.","1 INTRODUCTION Massive stars (conditionally, of 8 to 100 and more M⊙) are very important element of several interrelated directions in astrophysics, from star formation and its feedback, galaxy formation and evolution to cosmological issues related to reionisation of the intergalactic medium. Due to their short life timescale, the massive stars in the Galaxy have metallicities close to the current gas metallicity, that is close to Z\simZ⊙. There are several tasks related to the study of massive stars in the context of the diverse metallicity. In particular, the understanding of properties of massive stars with very low Z of \lesssimZ⊙/30 is crucial for studying and modelling of galaxy formation and evolution at the epoch of dawn of the Universe. The need to check the modern models of massive very low-Z stars on the real objects assumes the search for and study such objects in the outer galaxies. The gas metallicity in the nearby Universe was found to vary in the range of (\sim0.02–3) Z⊙. Due to the well-known relation between mass (or luminosity) and gas metallicity in late-type galaxies, the lowest metallicity massive stars are expected to form currently in dwarf galaxies. According to the statistical relation between the gas metallicity and galaxy luminosity for late-type galaxies within the Local Volume (LV) (Berg et al., 2012), dwarf galaxies with the gas metallicity (and hence, that of young massive stars) of Z \lesssim Z⊙/30 (eXtremely Metal-Poor, hereafter, XMP) should be rather faint, with M{}_{\rm B}\gtrsim –9 mag. Such faint dwarfs and their massive stars are accessible only at the distances of the LV and its environs. The nearest dwarf with that low metallicity, Leo P (Skillman et al., 2013), possesses the only Hii region, excited by one O7-8 V star. It was recently studied by Telford et al. (2023). To substantially advance in the studying of massive stars at such extremely low Z (including the massive stars in the evolved stages), one needs XMP galaxies with many massive stars within the LV (Garcia et al., 2021). According to our spectral study of void galaxies (Pustilnik et al., 2016, 2020, 2021, 2024), the XMP dwarfs favour the void environment. Moreover, for a given luminosity, they show substantially reduced gas metallicities. And visa versa, for their extremely low metallicities, they appear substantially more luminous than one would expect from the reference relation of Berg et al. (2012), derived for galaxies in the denser environment. Therefore, statistically, the probability to find multiple massive stars in void XMP dwarfs is higher than for the similar dwarfs outside voids. Luminous blue variable (LBV) stars are thought to represent a relatively short transient and rather unstable stage of massive star evolution from the main sequence hydrogen burning O-stars to the core-helium burning Wolf-Raye (WR) stars (Humphreys & Davidson, 1994). During this stage, massive stars lose the substantial mass via the powerful wind and in a series of ’normal’ eruptions with the typical timescales of a few years per event. Besides, some evidence appeared that LBVs can also be the direct precoursors of supernova Type II explosions (e.g., Petrov, Vink, Gräfener, 2006, and references therein). The nature of variable massive star winds is better understood for the solar and subsolar metallicities, for which the wind power scales with metallicity Z, indicating the dominant role of radiation pressure to ions of metals (e.g. Vink, 2022). Extrapolation of such wind mechanism to very low metallicities assumes no WR stars in the most metal poor starburst. However, the detection of WR population in the most metal-poor BCGs (e.g. Guseva et al., 2000)) evidence that other mechanisms may operate for massive star winds at the very low metallicities. Moreover, for the most dramatic events known as LBV ’giant eruptions’, the radiation pressure mechanism may be not suitable (e.g. Smith & Owocki, 2006). Hence, the study of individual very low-Z massive stars can be crucial for the choice of their most reliable models. The understanding of processes in very metal-poor LBVs is especially suitable since due to their highly non-stationary mass loss, their properties should be more sensitive to the model assumptions. The recent studies of massive stars with metallicities as low as Z = Z⊙/10 in Sextans A (Lorenzo et al., 2022; Schootemeijer et al., 2022), and Z = Z⊙/20 in Leo A (Gull et al., 2022), represent the important steps in understanding the properties of the low-metallicity massive stars. However, the search for opportunities to study massive stars at even lower Z, say at Z⊙/50 – Z⊙/40, still remains highly challenging. The number of individual very massive stars in galaxies with the extremely low metallicity (Z \lesssim Z⊙/30, corresponding to the host SF regions with the gas oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) \lesssim 7.2 dex) is very limited in the local Universe. Even more so it relates to such low-Z massive stars at the advanced evolutionary stages. They, first of all, include a number of WR stars and red supergiants (RSGs) in the prototype XMP dwarf IZw18 (e.g Izotov et al., 1997; Legrand et al., 1997; Hirschauer et al., 2024) at D \sim16 Mpc. Another important object is the dwarf XMP galaxy DDO68 at D = 12.75 Mpc (\mu = 30.53 mag) (Makarov et al., 2017; Cannon et al., 2014), as derived via the TRGB method. In this galaxy, the lowest metallicity LBV star was discovered (also known as DDO68-V1) (Pustilnik et al., 2008; Izotov & Thuan, 2009) along with many identified individual supergiants (Pustilnik et al., 2017). The Lynx-Cancer void galaxy DDO68 (UGC5340, VV542) is known as a peculiar morphology, the almost record-low metallicity (average 12+log(O/H)=7.14) dIrr with several prominent young star-forming (SF) regions. Most of these SF regions are found at the periphery, mainly in the ’Northern ring’ and the ’Southern tail’ (Pustilnik et al., 2005; Izotov & Thuan, 2007). These SF regions, named Knots in Pustilnik et al. (2005), look in fact as young OB associations hosting tens massive stars, with the typical linear sizes of several tens pc. The only exception is the compact Knot 5, which shows properties of a young globular cluster with the age of about 20 Myr. See the HST image of Knots 1–6 in Fig. 1. Annibali et al. (2019) found the range of metallicities in DDO68, from 12+log(O/H) \sim7.3 dex near the center of the main body, down to \sim7.0 dex in the southernmost SF region. The importance of this XMP dwarf in the context of the future study of the lowest metallicity massive stars was first emphasised about 20 years ago by Kniazev, Pustilnik (2006). Thanks to good luck, the unique Luminous Blue Variable star (LBV) was discovered in the repeat observations of DDO68, in one of the most metal-poor SF regions in the local Universe (Pustilnik et al., 2008; Izotov & Thuan, 2009). The issue of the extremely metal-poor massive star evolution and death remains one of the clues for understanding of galaxy formation and evolution for the time of \lesssim1 Gyr since the Big Bang (e.g., Barkana & Loeb, 2001; Eldridge, Stanway, 2022). This is especially actual in the epoch of active observational exploration of galaxies for the time of 0.5 – 1 Gyr since the Big Bang with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The great majority of these remote objects are star-forming galaxies. They display a wide range of metallicities, including the lowest values, found in the local Universe (e.g. Maseda et al., 2023). While the state-of-art stellar evolution models, including those with the fast rotation, have substantially advanced during the last decade (e.g. Szecsi et al, 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Sanyal et al., 2017; Martins, Palacios, 2021, and references therein) the direct comparison of the model predictions with properties of real extremely metal-poor massive stars is still absent. The main reason is the lack of such stars in the local Universe which would be accessible for sufficiently detailed studies. One needs to wait for the qualitative progress, expected for the upcoming extremely large next generation optical telescopes. As a preliminary step for these future studies, the search for such rare massive stars and examination of their available properties, such as variability, appears valuable and necessary. As explained above, the main goal of the monitoring of the DDO68 ’Northern Ring’ region is an attempt to examine the possible peculiarities in the light curve of the extremely metal-poor LBV DDO68-V1. However, the images used for this task, cover the five other SF regions (Knots), in which the HST data allow us to separate many other massive stars. In particular, the list of the 50 brightest stars (supergiants with MV \leq –6.0 mag) in these Knots was presented in Pustilnik et al. (2017). Their sufficiently large-amplitude variability can, in principle, be detected via variations of the integral light of their host SF regions. The mentioned above SF regions, excluding Knot 5, are rather young, as follows from their large values of the equivalent widths of the emission H\beta (Pustilnik et al., 2005). With the range of EW(H\beta) = 47 – 250 Å, the respective ages of the instantaneous star-bursts correspond to the range of 3–7 Myr (Leitherer et al., 1999). So that one can expect the population of massive OB stars at various evolutionary stages still alive. Their non-stationary stellar wind activity can manifest as a substantial light variability. In this paper we present the most updated lightcurve for Knot 3, containing the most metal-poor LBV star DDO68-V1. The data will be used in the forthcoming paper, examining the LBV light variations after its so-called ’giant eruption’ in 2010–2013 years. More emphasis in the paper is given to the ’by-product’ – monitoring the light variations in the rest Knots. We present at the first time the magnitudes and lightcurves of Knots 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 and examine them for the possible signs of variability using the well-known \chi2 criterion and the so-called RoMS (Robust Median Statistics, Rose, Hintz (2007); Burdanov et al. (2014)). The lay-out of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we present all the used observational data and briefly describe their reduction. In Sect. 3 the main results of data processing and analysis are presented. Sect. 4 describes arrays of photometric serieses for all Knots and their check for possible variability. Sect. 5 is devoted to discussion of new results, their comparison with the previous data and understanding them in a wider context. In Sect. 6 we summarise the new results and draw the main conclusions. The adopted linear scale is 62 pc in 1 arcsec.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07350v2,Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds II. Properties of Critical Cores,"A fraction of the dense cores within a turbulent molecular cloud will eventually collapse, leading to star formation. Identifying the physical criteria for cores to become unstable, and analyzing critical core properties, thus constitutes a necessary step toward the complete theory of star formation. Here we quantify the characteristics of an ensemble of “critical cores” on the verge of collapse. This critical epoch was identified in a companion paper, which followed the dynamical evolution of prestellar cores in numerical simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating clouds. We find that radial profiles of density and turbulent velocity dispersion in individual critical cores are consistent with our new model for turbulent equilibrium spheres (TESs). While a global linewidth–size relation exists for a cloud with given size and Mach number, the turbulent scaling relations around each core exhibit significant variations, locally regulating the critical density for a core to become unstable. As a result, there is no single density threshold for collapse; instead, cores collapse at a range of densities determined by the local sonic scale and gravitational potential environment, with a distribution expected for TESs with a limited range of turbulent velocity dispersion. The critical cores in our simulations are mostly transonic; we do not find either purely thermal or highly turbulent cores. We find that the core mass function (CMF) of critical cores peaks around the characteristic mass scale associated with the large-scale cloud properties. We highlight the importance of constructing the CMF at the critical time instead of sink particle mass functions, and derive the resolution requirements to unambiguously identify the peak of the CMF.","Dense cores are transient structures within turbulent giant molecular clouds, with their properties continuously changing in space and time (see Bergin & Tafalla, 2007; di Francesco et al., 2007; McKee & Ostriker, 2007; André et al., 2014; Offner et al., 2014; Padoan et al., 2014, for related reviews). While the physical properties of prestellar cores — which ultimately collapse, leading to star formation — are of great interest, it has not been clear exactly what the criterion is for a given core to become unstable and therefore unambiguously “prestellar.” In observational surveys, the simplest working definition for prestellar candidates is cores that appear gravitationally bound, based on estimates of their internal energy, although more detailed criteria have also been applied (e.g. Andre et al., 2000; Könyves et al., 2015). However, simulations that trace the evolution of dense structures show that many stochastically cycle through different phases (due to their turbulent environment), rather than following a single evolutionary sequence, and in particular cores with “prestellar” characteristics sometimes subsequently disperse (Offner et al., 2022). Notwithstanding the ambiguities in recognizing prestellar cores, their very nature — objects that will collapse to form a star or stellar system in the near future — provides at least two physically meaningful common reference points in time shared across all cores: (1) The time when they initiate gravitational runaway (hereafter “critical time”) and (2) the instant they complete it by forming a nascent protostar at the center (“collapse time”). While these milestones would be essentially impossible to pinpoint in observations, they can be identified on an individual core basis within numerical simulations of gravo-turbulent fragmentation. The second of the two above events is easier to pick out in simulations, since this is when runaway collapse leads to a \rho\propto r^{-2} singular density profile (Larson, 1969; Penston, 1969).111Strictly speaking, it is only at the center of this power-law profile that a protostar-disk system begins to grow. In particular, in numerical simulations where collapsing centers are replaced with sink particles, the collapse time of each core can be identified as the moment when a sink particle is created. For example, Gong & Ostriker (2015), Padoan et al. (2020), and Pelkonen et al. (2021) used the closest snapshot to the creation time of each sink particle to define their “progenitor core” as a gravitationally bound region around the site where the sink is created. By measuring the core mass at each core’s collapse time, Gong & Ostriker (2015) demonstrated that the core mass function (CMF) has a well-defined peak which converges with increasing numerical resolution. Pelkonen et al. (2021), taking a slightly different approach, varied the resolution for the clumpfind algorithm rather than the underlying simulation resolution, and also found convergence in the CMF at the time of collapse. In the majority of numerical studies of gravo-turbulent fragmentation, however, it is not the CMF at a characteristic epoch for each core or sink’s evolution that is measured, but instead the sink particle mass function (SMF) at an arbitrarily selected time common to all particles (e.g., Haugbølle et al., 2018; Lee & Hennebelle, 2018; Guszejnov et al., 2020). The resulting SMF has not shown numerically converging behavior, unlike the CMF based on individual collapse times (see, however, Haugbølle et al., 2018; Pelkonen et al., 2021). As we shall discuss, the reason for the difference between CMF convergence and SMF non-convergence likely relates to fragmentation in late stages of evolution. But in any case, in order to test theories of turbulent fragmentation that are the basis for models of the initial mass function (e.g., Padoan & Nordlund, 2002; Hennebelle & Chabrier, 2008; Hopkins, 2012), it is necessary to construct the CMF itself at characteristic epochs of evolution. While the collapse time provides a convenient reference point and can be easily identified in numerical simulations, it is the critical time that is most relevant for the point of comparison to theories. Collins et al. (2024), by analyzing the collapse histories of simulated cores via tracer particles, found that there exists a characteristic epoch after which mass is rapidly delivered to the core center, raising the core density in a runaway fashion. Based on this observation they defined a proxy for the critical time (termed “singularity time” in their work) by choosing a threshold on the density time derivative. They found that, as each core approaches its critical time, the radial density profiles of cores develop a characteristic core–envelope structure while the mean radial and tangential velocities exhibit a common behavior of increasing in magnitude with increasing radius. The identification of this characteristic epoch reveals a common physical process occurring in an ensemble of cores that is otherwise blurred by evolution. However, the question of what determines this critical time still remains to be answered. Related to the critical time is a common narrative for the evolution of prestellar cores, where certain critical conditions trigger gravitational runaway (McKee & Ostriker 2007; André et al. 2014; Offner et al. 2014; Padoan et al. 2014). Among others, the Bonnor-Ebert (BE) sphere and its stability property (Ebert, 1955; Bonnor, 1956; Ebert, 1957) have often been used as a theoretical tool for determining critical conditions (e.g., Krumholz & McKee, 2005; Padoan & Nordlund, 2011). However, the applicability of the BE model to cores within turbulent molecular clouds is limited, because (1) real cores exist as a part of a turbulent continuum unlike an isolated BE sphere truncated by “external pressure,” and (2) the model does not account for internal turbulent velocities expected for cores forming within a turbulent cloud. In a series of papers, we have begun a comprehensive analysis of prestellar core evolution to address the limitations pertaining to the BE model and to answer the question of exactly what triggers the onset of collapse. In Moon & Ostriker (2024a, hereafter Paper I), we developed a new theoretical model for equilibrium spherically-symmetric cores supported by both thermal and turbulent pressure, with the solutions obtained by directly solving the time-steady, angle-averaged equations of hydrodynamics. A distinguishing feature of the resulting family of solutions, which we term the turbulent equilibrium sphere (TES), is that the turbulent pressure naturally arises from a power-law velocity structure function rather than from a phenomenological equation of state. The TES model also enjoys a useful behavior of reducing to the BE model in the limit of vanishing turbulent velocities. Paper I found that, similar to the case for BE spheres, solutions can be classified as stable or unstable to radial perturbations. For a given set of turbulence parameters and central density, cores exceeding a certain critical size are unstable. The radius, mass, and center-to-edge density contrast of critical TESs all increase with increasing turbulent velocity dispersion (or equivalently, decreasing sonic scale). This implies that a nascent core forming in a highly turbulent region would initially be in the stable, subcritical regime. Based on the stability properties of TESs and from a general consideration of tidal gravitational fields in core-forming regions, Paper I proposed an evolutionary scenario for “successful” prestellar cores formed by converging turbulent flows. In this scenario, nascent cores evolve in the direction of increasing density (as mass is added) and decreasing turbulence (as dissipation progresses). When converging flows are strong enough or turbulence sufficiently dissipates, the critical radius r_{\mathrm{crit}} moves inside the “tidal radius” r_{\mathrm{tidal}} set by the landscape of the gravitational potential, and a core becomes unstable and collapses. Otherwise, it remains stable and is eventually dispersed by turbulence (see Figure 11 of Paper I for a schematic illustration for this scenario). To test this scenario and identify the critical conditions for collapse, in Moon & Ostriker (2024b) (hereafter Paper II) we conducted and carefully analyzed a suite of numerical simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating clouds. Paper II presents results from a comprehensive analysis of each core’s dynamical evolution from its formation, through the onset of collapse, to the point when the central density blows up, signaling the beginning of the protostellar phase. By measuring radial forces acting within the cores over time, Paper II directly identified the critical time when the net radial force becomes negative, instigating runaway collapse. We found good agreement between the empirically identified critical time and the epoch when a core is predicted to be unstable according to the TES model, thus providing an answer as to what determines the critical time. In this paper, we analyze the simulation results of Paper II at the critical time of each core to investigate the physical properties of prestellar cores at the onset of collapse. We shall show that the cores defined at their respective critical time (referred to as “critical cores” throughout this work) are mostly transonic in terms of their internal turbulence (turbulent Mach number \sim 0.5\text{--}1.5), with their structure overall consistent with the TES model. We shall also show that the local turbulent scaling relations within each core exhibit significant variations above and below the average linewidth–size relation for the entire cloud, with higher density in more turbulent critical cores. As a result, there is a wide range of critical densities for collapse, rather than a single threshold density. We shall also present statistical distributions of core masses, sizes, densities, durations of different evolutionary stages, and accretion rates. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define key physical quantities related to our TES model and numerical simulations. In Section 3, we first (Section 3.1) present the radial density and velocity dispersion profiles of critical cores and compare them with the TES models. We then (Section 3.2) show that the locally constructed linewidth–size relations exhibit significant variations around the mean relation, causing cores to become unstable at a wide range of densities (Section 3.3). We also present probability distributions of various physical quantities measured for critical cores, including the CMF (Section 3.4). Section 4 presents the evolution of the mass inflow rates and, by using them, characterizes evolutionary timescales at each stage. We discuss implications of our results in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07349v2,Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds I. Numerical Modeling and Evolution to Collapse,"A fundamental issue in star formation is understanding the precise mechanisms leading to the formation of prestellar cores, and their subsequent gravitationally unstable evolution. To address this question, we carefully construct a suite of turbulent, self-gravitating numerical simulations, and analyze the development and collapse of individual prestellar cores. We show that the numerical requirements for resolving the sonic scale and internal structure of anticipated cores are essentially the same in self-gravitating clouds, calling for the number of cells per dimension to increase quadratically with the cloud’s Mach number. In our simulations, we follow evolution of individual cores by tracking the region around each gravitational potential minimum over time. Evolution in nascent cores is towards increasing density and decreasing turbulence, and there is a wide range of critical density for initiating collapse. At given spatial scale the turbulence level also varies widely, and tends to be correlated with density. By directly measuring the radial forces acting within cores, we identify a distinct transition to a state of gravitational runaway. We use our new theory for turbulent equilibrium spheres to predict the onset of each core’s collapse. Instability is expected when the critical radius becomes smaller than the tidal radius; we find good agreement with the simulations. Interestingly, the imbalance between gravity and opposing forces is only \sim 20\% during core collapse, meaning that this is a quasi-equilibrium rather than a free-fall process. For most of their evolution, cores exhibit both subsonic contraction and transonic turbulence inherited from core-building flows; supersonic radial velocities accelerated by gravity only appear near the end of the collapse.","Stars form in the coldest and densest regions of giant molecular clouds, systems that are pervaded by supersonic turbulence (e.g. André et al., 2014; Heyer & Dame, 2015). The turbulent velocity field in GMCs creates structures at a range of scales (from negative divergences), while also dispersing structures (from positive divergences and shear) and contributing to support against gravity (e.g. McKee & Ostriker, 2007; Hennebelle & Falgarone, 2012). The perturbations in density are organized by the velocity field into spatially correlated, hierarchical structures, which are sometimes characterized by the density power spectrum (Kim & Ryu, 2005; Kritsuk et al., 2007; Konstandin et al., 2016). If the density power spectrum approximately follows a power law, the structures in configuration space are expected to display some degree of self-similarity, often motivating fractal descriptions of density structures (Stutzki et al., 1998; Thiesset & Federrath, 2023). When the gas density is so high that the self-gravity starts to affect the dynamics, however, self-similarity is no longer expected. Observations of nearby molecular clouds indicate that in the dense regions where self-gravity is clearly important and stars form, the gas is organized into roughly spherical, compact (\lesssim 0.1\,\mathrm{pc}), centrally-concentrated objects called dense (starless) cores (see Bergin & Tafalla, 2007; di Francesco et al., 2007, for dedicated reviews on dense cores). Cores’ radial density profiles are characterized by a flat central plateau and outer envelope approximately following \rho\propto r^{-2}, suggestive of gravitational stratification where self-gravity is roughly balanced by pressure gradients. The widths of observed molecular emission lines are somewhat (but not much) broader than the thermal value, indicating that motions within dense cores exhibit subsonic or transonic turbulence (e.g., Goodman et al., 1998; Choudhury et al., 2021). The turbulence within cores presumably is a legacy of their turbulent formation environments. Observed statistics suggest that dense cores are likely transient objects that live no more than a few free-fall times (see below), and their mass distributions have a similar shape to the initial mass function (IMF) but shifted toward higher masses by a factor 2\text{--}3 (see André et al., 2014, and references therein). It is generally understood that dense cores form in regions where turbulent flows happen to locally converge, and under certain conditions undergo runaway gravitational collapse to form a single star or a multiple system (McKee & Ostriker, 2007; André et al., 2014; Offner et al., 2014; Padoan et al., 2014). To investigate this process in a highly idealized setup, Gong & Ostriker (2009) performed spherically symmetric simulations for supersonic converging flows at a range of Mach number, to study how cores form and evolve in dense post-shock regions. As mass is added, cores in those simulations initially evolve in a quasi-equilibrium fashion with increasing density stratification, until the onset of outside-in collapse dramatically (and rapidly) increases the central density. In less idealized three-dimensional simulations focused on post-shock regions in converging, turbulent flows, a similar transition from core building to rapid internal collapse was identified (Gong & Ostriker, 2015). Recently, Collins et al. (2024, see also ) utilized tracer particles to analyze evolution of individual cores self-consistently formed in three-dimensional simulations of self-gravitating isothermal turbulence. They found that cores are formed by converging flows that sweep up low-density gas and then undergo gravitational collapse once the density becomes moderately high and internal turbulent motions decay to transonic or slightly supersonic level. Although the details differ, a common theme in characterizing evolution of simulated cores is that there exists a critical stage at which a core transitions to a state of runaway gravitational collapse (e.g., from the core building to the core collapse stage in Gong & Ostriker (2009); from the hardening to the singularity stage as described in Collins et al. (2024); the first step of the inertial-inflow scenario of Padoan et al. (2020)). A flip side of this is the possible existence of failed cores that do not satisfy the physical conditions associated with the critical stage and disperse back into the interstellar medium (ISM) (e.g., Vázquez-Semadeni et al., 2005; Smullen et al., 2020; Offner et al., 2022). While the transition from core building to collapse stages has been identified in simulations, it has not been explained physically exactly what triggers the onset of collapse. Traditionally, the Bonnor-Ebert (BE) sphere (Bonnor, 1956; Ebert, 1955, 1957) has been regarded as the most relevant theoretical model for distinguishing critical conditions: spherical isothermal equilibria exist for all radii, but beyond a certain radius the equilibrium is unstable and collapse would be expected. However, the BE solution assumes a completely isolated spherical equilibrium supported entirely by thermal pressure, while in contrast real cores (1) are affected by internal velocity structure as they form from the supersonically turbulent ISM, and (2) do not exist in isolation but are surrounded and gravitationally affected by neighboring structures. To address the first of the above limitations, in Moon & Ostriker (2024a) (hereafter Paper I) we developed a new theoretical model of quasi-equilibrium isothermal spheres supported by both thermal and turbulent pressure, with solutions obtained by directly solving the time-steady, angle-averaged equations of hydrodynamics. A salient feature of this model, termed the turbulent equilibrium sphere (TES), is that the turbulent pressure naturally arises from a power-law velocity structure function (see Section 2) rather than from a phenomenological equation of state. The BE solutions are recovered in the limit of vanishing turbulent velocity dispersion. Paper I found that, for a radially stratified TES solution, there exists a critical radius r_{\mathrm{crit}} at which the equilibrium becomes unstable to radial perturbations111Alternatively, for a given confining pressure at the edge, there exists a maximum mass above which no equilibrium solution exists., and that r_{\mathrm{crit}} increases with the strength of the turbulence for a given density. One of the main conclusions of Paper I is that a quasi-equilibrium core will collapse when its maximum radius exceeds r_{\mathrm{crit}}. However, it is not obvious what determines the “maximum radius” of a real core in a real cloud, or if an outer radius exists at all. In an approximately isothermal medium such as a GMC, a core does not possess a well-defined boundary, but instead continuously blends into the surrounding gas. This might seem to imply that no core can remain stable because every core extends indefinitely beyond r_{\mathrm{crit}}. In reality, however, a core is generally surrounded by neighboring structures, such that there is an effective maximum radius beyond which the core cannot be considered an isolated object from the point of view of the gravitational potential. In order to identify the critical conditions for collapse that fully take into account the hierarchical structure in which cores live, and include the effects of the velocity field, careful analyses of numerical simulations are needed. In this paper, we present results from investigations of dynamical evolution of individual cores forming in a suite of three-dimensional numerical simulations of self-gravitating isothermal turbulence. Thus, the present work takes on the second of the limitations of the traditional BE stability analysis mentioned above, armed with the TES solutions of Paper I. In a companion paper (Moon & Ostriker 2024b; hereafter Paper II), we will present detailed properties of the critical cores (defined at the onset of collapse) and compare their structure with the TES model. Another important observational and theoretical issue concerns the dynamical status of prestellar cores as they evolve to reach a high degree of central concentration. At one extreme, prestellar cores are viewed as quasi-static objects slowly evolving under magnetic support to reach the singular isothermal profile, which then undergoes near-pressureless collapse with a rarefaction wave propagating outward from the innermost region (Shu, 1977). The other extreme is to treat the pressureless free-fall stage as beginning from a state with a flat density profile near the center, rather than a power law (Whitworth & Ward-Thompson, 2001; Myers, 2005). The pressure-modified “outside-in” dynamical collapse models (Larson, 1969; Penston, 1969; Hunter, 1977; Foster & Chevalier, 1993) lie somewhere in between these two extremes, often viewed as being qualitatively more similar to the latter. The measured infall speeds of starless cores based on the “blue asymmetry” in the molecular line profiles are too fast and spatially extended to be explained by quasi-static contraction driven by ambipolar diffusion (Lee et al., 1999, 2001). Observed inflows are sometimes considered too slow for dynamical collapse (Campbell et al., 2016), although in fact supersonic speeds only appear toward the end of the collapse (e.g., Foster & Chevalier, 1993; Myers, 2005). Alternatively, observed infall motions may simply reflect the initial momentum of converging, core-building flows (e.g., Lee et al. 2001; Gong & Ostriker 2009; Padoan et al. 2020; Collins et al. 2024) rather than representing gravitational collapse (see also Chen et al., 2020, for discussion of filament-forming flows). Direct number counting of prestellar cores relative to young stellar objects indicates that the core collapse typically takes 2\text{--}5 times the free-fall time (Ward-Thompson et al., 2007; Könyves et al., 2015), consistent with neither free-fall nor quasi-static contraction. Directly measuring the forces acting on simulated cores as a function of time is helpful to quantitatively characterize the dynamics of the collapse process. Measurements of this kind are part of the analysis we present in this paper, leading to the new physical concept of “quasi-equilibrium collapse.” The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly summarize selected content from Paper I that will be referenced throughout this work. In Section 3, we outline the hydrodynamic equations we solve and describe numerical methods and resolution requirements. We also describe our algorithm for tracking cores through successive snapshots in our simulations. Section 4 presents our main results; we describe the overall time evolution of our models, analyze dynamical evolution of individual cores, and identify the critical conditions for collapse. We discuss implications of our results in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07312v1,Disk kinematics at high redshift: ’s extension to 3D modeling and comparison with different approaches,"Spatially-resolved emission line kinematics are invaluable to investigating fundamental galaxy properties and have become increasingly accessible for galaxies at z \gtrsim 0.5 through sensitive near-infrared imaging spectroscopy and millimeter interferometry. Kinematic modeling is at the core of the analysis and interpretation of such data sets, which at high-z present challenges due to lower signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and resolution compared to data of local galaxies. We present and test the 3D fitting functionality of DysmalPy, examining how well it recovers intrinsic disk rotation velocity and velocity dispersion, using a large suite of axisymmetric models, covering a range of galaxy properties and observational parameters typical of z \sim 1-3 star-forming galaxies. We also compare DysmalPy’s recovery performance to that of two other commonly used codes, GalPak3D and 3DBarolo, which we use in turn to create additional sets of models to benchmark DysmalPy. Over the ranges of S/N, resolution, mass, and velocity dispersion explored, the rotation velocity is accurately recovered by all tools. The velocity dispersion is recovered well at high S/N, but the impact of methodology differences is more apparent. In particular, template differences for parametric tools and S/N sensitivity for the non-parametric tool can lead to differences up to a factor of 2. Our tests highlight and the importance of deep, high-resolution data and the need for careful consideration of: (1) the choice of priors (parametric approaches), (2) the masking (all approaches) and, more generally, evaluating the suitability of each approach to the specific data at hand. This paper accompanies the public release of DysmalPy.","Spatially-resolved kinematics provide fundamental insights into the nature, dynamical state, and mass assembly history of galaxies. Thanks to ever more powerful near-infrared/optical integral field unit (IFU) spectrographs on 4–8 m-class telescopes and millimeter interferometers (Bacon et al., 1995; Weitzel et al., 1996; Eisenhauer et al., 2003; Larkin et al., 2006; Sharples et al., 2013), kinematics have become a widespread tool in galaxy evolution studies at redshifts z > 0.5 (Glazebrook, 2013; Förster Schreiber & Wuyts, 2020). IFU studies, mainly targeting the H{\alpha} rest-optical line, comprise the most comprehensive census of resolved kinematics of massive star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at z \sim1-3. These surveys cover well the “main sequence” (MS) of SFGs in stellar mass M_{\star} vs. star formation rate SFR, which dominates the population and cosmic star formation (e.g., Rodighiero et al., 2011; Sargent et al., 2012; Madau & Dickinson, 2014). Resolved millimeter interferometric observations focused primarily on CO lines at z \lesssim 4 and on the bright [C II] \lambda158µm far-infrared line at z \gtrsim 4 in modest samples are now available for dynamical studies of the cold neutral gas. With its NIRSpec instrument in IFU mode, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), has recently opened up the way to resolved H{\alpha} kinematics mapping at z \gtrsim 3. Such observations provide the most direct approach to probe the potential well and the physical processes that shape galaxies over time, including gas accretion, non-circular motions, galaxy interactions, mass and angular momentum transfer, and feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this context, the gas velocity dispersion \sigma_{0} and rotational-to-dispersion support v_{\rm rot}/\sigma_{0} constitute important measures of disk structure and settling across cosmic time. Despite increasing observational efforts, results remain mixed on the amount, evolution, and origin of gas dispersion and dynamical support of distant disks. Part of the differences may be attributed to sample selection and tracer choices. A number of studies over the past couple of decades found increasing disk dispersions and decreasing v_{\rm rot}/\sigma_{0} towards higher redshift for samples probing mainly massive (stellar masses M_{\star} \gtrsim 10^{10}\rm M_{\odot}) MS SFGs out to z \sim 3, trends that have been interpreted in the framework of marginally unstable gas-rich disks given the increasing molecular gas fraction at earlier time (see reviews by Tacconi et al., 2020; Förster Schreiber & Wuyts, 2020, and references therein). Other studies reported dynamically fairly cold, regular disk rotation including among infrared-luminous dusty SFGs and at z \gtrsim 4, either unlensed or strongly gravitationally lensed (e.g., Hodge et al., 2012; Sharda et al., 2019; Fraternali et al., 2021; Lelli et al., 2021; Rizzo et al., 2021, 2022; Tsukui & Iguchi, 2021). At any given redshift, the scatter in \sigma_{0} and v_{\rm rot}/\sigma_{0} is substantial, even among the best data sets of MS SFGs (e.g., Übler et al., 2019). Although part of the spread in v_{\rm rot}/\sigma_{0} at fixed redshift appears to be explained by a trend with galaxy stellar mass, it is less clear for \sigma_{0} (e.g. Kassin et al., 2012; Wisnioski et al., 2015; Simons et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2018; Parlanti et al., 2023; Rowland et al., 2024). Furthermore, there is a potentially inherent difference between the gas kinematics traced by warm ionized gas and colder atomic and molecular gas. Larger samples with high-resolution, high S/N data of multiple tracers for the same galaxies will be essential to establish whether, and how much, kinematic properties depend on the interstellar medium (ISM) phase (contrast Liu et al., 2023; Parlanti et al., 2023, 2024; Rizzo et al., 2023, with Übler et al. 2018; Genzel et al. 2023). Compounding the sample and tracer differences described above, the observational picture is further complicated by the use of various modeling approaches among studies. In some cases this has even led to discrepant results from the same data sets (e.g., compare Tadaki et al. 2018, 2020 to Sharda et al. 2019; Roman-Oliveira et al. 2023; see also Lelli et al. 2023). Because kinematics modeling serves as the foundation for linking observables to physical properties, tools should ideally rely on full spatial and velocity forward modeling that accounts for the appreciable beam-smearing in high-redshift data and the limited S/N due to cosmological surface brightness dimming. Several packages have been developed to this aim, including the parametric modeling codes Dysmal/DysmalPy (e.g., Davies et al., 2004a, b, 2011; Cresci et al., 2009; Wuyts et al., 2016; Lang et al., 2017; Price et al., 2021), GalPak3D (Bouché et al., 2015, 2022), and the non-parametric modeling code 3DBarolo (Di Teodoro & Fraternali, 2015)111Other 3D-fitting tools exist, such as TiRiFiC (Józsa et al., 2007; Kamphuis et al., 2015), KinMS (Davis et al., 2013, 2017), GPU-accelerated GBKFIT (Bekiaris et al., 2016), BLOBBY3D (Varidel et al., 2019), and qubefit (Neeleman et al., 2021).. Parametric models are built around analytic descriptions of the mass distribution and/or the rotation and dispersion velocities (e.g., Courteau, 1997), making them inherently less sensitive to S/N than non-parametric models. Moreover, parametric modeling that starts from mass models enables an immediate characterization of the mass profile and quantifies the amount of gas involved in out- or in-flowing motions. On the other hand, non-parametric models have the advantage of more flexibility in a system’s description, which may deviate from common functional forms due to non-axisymmetric features and kinematic perturbations (e.g., Rogstad et al., 1974; Begeman, 1989; Sancisi, 2004). Each code has its strengths and has been internally benchmarked against observations of local galaxies, mock analytical models, and/or numerical simulations. All these tools, however, share a common advantage: they operate in full 3D space to generate models, thereby accounting for beam smearing and projection effects in the best possible way. In this work, we expand on Price et al. (2021) by testing the DysmalPy’s performance in fitting in 3D, accompanied by the first public release of the code222Available at https://www.mpe.mpg.de/resources/IR/DYSMALPY/index.html. We additionally benchmarked DysmalPy against two widely-used modeling tools: the parametric GalPak3D and the non-parametric 3DBarolo. For this purpose, we employ an extensive set of synthetic galaxies with known input properties subjected to various realistic observational conditions. The mock galaxies consist of intentionally simple axisymmetric disk models but with an empirically motivated range of properties. The systematic inter-comparison expands on the validation tests for the individual codes presented by Price et al. (2021, see also ) for DysmalPy, Bouché et al. (2015) for GalPak3D, and Di Teodoro & Fraternali (2015) for 3DBarolo. We use modeling setups as consistently as possible between the tools and discuss the impact of our adopted choices vs. recommended or widely used ones when they differ. We focus on fits performed in 3D for IFU and interferometric observations. GalPak3D was designed to only fit in 3D, while 3DBarolo could also fit a 2D velocity field through its 2DFIT task. DysmalPy has mainly been applied to fit data in 1D or 2D (e.g., major axis kinematic profiles, moment maps), but by its 3D model construction was easily adapted to fit data cubes (Price et al., 2021). The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we summarize the relevant features of the three fitting codes and describe the main setups employed in our analysis. In Sec. 3, we describe the construction of the baseline mock data cubes used in this study. In Sec. 4, we compare the fitting results between the codes with the baseline setups and mock data sets and explore more deeply the impact of parametrization and treatment of S/N. In Sec. 5, we discuss the potential implications in studies of high-z kinematics. In Sec. 6, we summarize our findings. Throughout, we assume a \Lambda-dominated cosmology with H_{0}=70~{}{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}, \Omega_{\rm m}=0.3, and \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7. For this cosmology, 1″ corresponds to 8.37 kpc at z = 2.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07305v2,: Image-based photometric redshifts for AGN,"Context. Computing reliable photometric redshifts (photo-z) for active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a challenging task, primarily due to the complex interplay between the unresolved relative emissions associated with the supermassive black hole and its host galaxy. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting methods, while effective for galaxies and AGN in pencil-beam surveys, face limitations in wide or all-sky surveys with fewer bands available, lacking the ability to accurately capture the AGN contribution to the SED, hindering reliable redshift estimation. This limitation is affecting the many 10s of millions of AGN detected in existing datasets, e.g., those AGN clearly singled out and identified by SRG/eROSITA.Aims. Our goal is to enhance photometric redshift performance for AGN in all-sky surveys while simultaneously simplifying the approach by avoiding the need to merge multiple data sets. Instead, we employ readily available data products from the 10th Data Release of the Imaging Legacy Survey for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, which covers ¿ 20,000 deg2 of extragalactic sky with deep imaging and catalog-based photometry in the grizW1-W4 bands. We fully utilize the spatial flux distribution in the vicinity of each source to produce reliable photo-z.Methods. We introduce PICZL, a machine-learning algorithm leveraging an ensemble of convolutional neural networks. Utilizing a cross-channel approach, the algorithm integrates distinct SED features from images with those obtained from catalog-level data. Full probability distributions are achieved via the integration of Gaussian mixture models.Results. On a validation sample of 8098 AGN, PICZL achieves an accuracy \sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}} of 4.5% with an outlier fraction \eta of 5.6%. These results significantly outperform previous attempts to compute accurate photo-z for AGN using machine learning. We highlight that the model’s performance depends on many variables, predominantly the depth of the data and associated photometric error. A thorough evaluation of these dependencies is presented in the paper.Conclusions. Our streamlined methodology maintains consistent performance across the entire survey area, when accounting for differing data quality. The same approach can be adopted for future deep photometric surveys such as LSST and Euclid, showcasing its potential for wide-scale realization. With this paper, we release updated photo-z (including errors) for the XMM-SERVS W-CDF-S, ELAIS-S1 and LSS fields.","In recent decades, our understanding of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and their role in galaxy and cosmic evolution has significantly advanced. These luminous celestial powerhouses are thought to be fueled by the accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located at the centers of galaxies, exerting intense energetic radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from radio to \gamma-rays (Padovani et al., 2017). The close correlation observed between the mass of the central SMBH, whether active or inactive and the properties of its host galaxy’s bulge — such as the galaxy’s mass and velocity dispersion (e.g., Gebhardt et al., 2000; Ferrarese & Merritt, 2000) — suggests a co-evolutionary relationship between galaxies and their central engines (Kormendy & Ho, 2013; Heckman & Best, 2014). Ongoing research focuses on understanding scaling relations, the evolution of SMBHs within galaxies, and the interconnected rates of star formation (SFR) and black hole accretion (BHAR) over cosmic time (e.g., Madau & Dickinson, 2014). To further explore and address these unresolved topics requires diverse AGN samples with reliable redshifts to determine BH demographics and constrain models of galaxy evolution. For all these studies, redshift is an indispensable quantity, with spectroscopic redshifts (spec-z) remaining the preferred estimates for determining precise cosmic distances (Hoyle, 2016). However, while multi-objects spectrographs, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V; York et al., 2000; Kollmeier et al., 2019), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI; DESI-Collaboration et al., 2016), the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS; Tamura et al., 2016) or the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST; De Jong et al., 2019), are set to provide a drastic rise in the number of observed sources over the next several years, we are currently in the situation in which millions of AGN have been detected all-sky by various surveys (e.g., by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission (WISE; Wright et al., 2010), and the extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA; Merloni et al., 2012; Predehl et al., 2021), with only the brightest sources having been observed spectroscopically (Dahlen et al., 2013). The growing disparity between photometric and spectroscopic observations will only widen with upcoming surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST; Ivezic et al., 2019) and Euclid (Collaboration et al., 2024), covering unprecedented areas and depths (Newman & Gruen, 2022). Thus for the bulk of AGN, we must make use of multiband photometry and rely on photometric redshifts (photo-z). First implemented by Baum (1957) for inactive galaxies, these low-precision redshift estimates utilize photometric observations to effectively obtain a sparsely sampled spectral energy distribution (SED), trading precision for scalability. They encompass an array of techniques assuming color-redshift evolution (Connolly et al., 1995; Steidel et al., 1996; Illingworth, 1999; Bell et al., 2004), including template-based approaches (e.g., Bolzonella et al., 2000; Ilbert et al., 2006; Salvato et al., 2008; Beck et al., 2017), where redshifted models built on theoretical or empirical SEDs are fitted to observed multi-band photometry. Although a limited number of available bands can introduce uncertainties (see review by Salvato et al., 2018), photo-z methods offer an efficient way to estimate distances for all sources in an imaging survey, yielding highly accurate estimates with as few as three bands for passive galaxies (Benitez, 2000; Abdalla et al., 2011; Arnouts & Ilbert, 2011; Brescia et al., 2014; Desprez et al., 2020). By contrast, reliable photo-z for AGN have historically required highly homogenized photometry across ¿20 filters, which was only achievable in pencil-beam surveys (Salvato et al., 2011). As such, this level of detail continues to be unfeasible for wide-area surveys. However, with the 10th data release of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (LS10, Dey et al., 2019), we now have a broad-sky survey that, while lacking NIR coverage, includes a few optical bands supplemented by mid-IR WISE data. This allows us to explore the possibility of generating reliable photo-z for AGN over the full sky, despite having fewer filters compared to the densely sampled pencil-beam surveys. SED fitting applied to a broad population of AGN remains particularly challenging due to the uncertainty and difficulty of disentangling the relative contributions of the nucleus and respective host to a given band (e.g., Luo et al., 2010; Salvato et al., 2011; Brescia et al., 2019). Since the accretion properties of SMBHs, often characterized as the bolometric luminosity divided by the Eddington limit, or the Eddington ratio, significantly influence the SED of AGN, the intense power-law continuum radiation can either partly (host-dominated) or entirely (quasar-dominated), outshine the respective host, hiding key spectral features that lead to redshift degeneracies (Pierce et al., 2010; Pović et al., 2012; Bettoni et al., 2015). Consequently, selecting a limited number of templates can be insufficient for correct redshift determination, while increasing the number of templates raises the degeneracy (see discussion in Salvato et al., 2011; Ananna et al., 2017). In this regime of accounting for AGN contributions to galaxy photo-z, one potential approach involves modeling objects as a combination of quasar and galaxy templates (eg., Cardamone et al., 2010), performed with EAZY (Brammer et al., 2008). In addition, surveys typically estimate fluxes with models that do not account for a mixed contribution from AGN and host galaxy. Ultimately, AGN are also intrinsically variable sources on the timescales explored by the previously mentioned surveys leading to incongruent photometry acquired across different epochs. In contrast to template-fitting methods, more recent approaches have shifted towards the use of empirical Machine Learning (ML) models, performing regression or classification, to tackle photo-z applied predominantly to inactive galaxies (Collister & Lahav, 2004; Laurino et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013; Hoyle, 2016; D’Isanto & Polsterer, 2018; Brescia et al., 2019; Eriksen et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021). Provided with a very large and complete spec-z sample, ML architectures manipulate photometric input features to minimize the divergence between spectroscopic and ML-derived redshifts. Over the years, a plethora of ML architectures, including decision trees (Breiman, 2001; Carliles et al., 2010; Li et al., 2022), Gaussian processes (Almosallam et al., 2016) and K-nearest neighbours (Zhang et al., 2013; Luken et al., 2019) have been employed, yielding accurate point predictions and, more interestingly, full probability density functions (PDFs) (Kind & Brunner, 2013; Cavuoti et al., 2016; Rau et al., 2015; Sadeh et al., 2016). The latter grants access to the prediction uncertainty, as otherwise naturally provided by template-fitting approaches, relevant for studies dealing with, e.g. luminosity functions (Aird et al., 2010; Buchner et al., 2015; Georgakakis et al., 2015). However, the limited availability of a sizable training sample of AGN has resulted in only a few attempts to compute photo-z for mostly nucleus-dominated objects with ML-based methods (Mountrichas et al., 2017; Fotopoulou & Paltani, 2018; Ruiz et al., 2018; Meshcheryakov et al., 2018; Brescia et al., 2019; Nishizawa et al., 2020). More recently, the conventional approach of manually selecting photometric features for ML has been replaced by bright, well-resolved galaxies at low redshift (Hoyle, 2016; Pasquet et al., 2018; Campagne, 2020; Hayat et al., 2021). In this regime, integrating galaxy images into deep neural networks inherently captures essential details like flux, morphology, and other features that would typically be extracted from catalogs based on predefined assumptions, leading to a more comprehensive redshift estimation process. This approach is particularly advantageous for addressing current limitations faced by photo-z methods for AGN, as it leverages model-independent fluxes and redshift indicative features, including surface brightness profiles (Stabenau et al., 2008; Jones & Singal, 2017; Gomes et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2021, 2023). Unlike creating a single SED from total flux measurements, projects employing images with independent pixel-by-pixel SEDs at identical redshift have demonstrated increased photo-z constraining power, alleviating previous empirical approaches by decreasing the fraction of outliers (Henghes et al., 2022; Schuldt et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2022; Dey et al., 2022a; Newman & Gruen, 2022). Here, we introduce PICZL (Photometrically Inferred CNN redshift(Z) Likelihoods), an enhanced approach to photo-z estimation that builds upon (CircleZ by Saxena et al., 2024). While the authors demonstrated that redshift degeneracies encountered for AGN, typical in cases of limited photometry, can be broken by integrating aperture photometry alongside traditional total/model fluxes and colors, PICZL instead computes photo-z PDFs for AGN directly from homogenized flux band cutouts by leveraging the more detailed spatial light profile. All inputs are obtained utilizing LS10 exclusively. Similar to Saxena et al. (2024), PICZL can produce reliable photo-z PDFs for all Legacy-detected sources associated with an AGN. However, the model can, in principle, be applied to other extragalactic sources (e.g, inactive galaxies, Götzenberger et al. in prep.) granted that a dedicated training sample is used. We employ an ensemble of the same ML algorithm, notably convolutional neural networks (CNNs), known for their proficiency in learning intricate patterns, as outlined by (Lecun et al., 1998a). Specifically designed for image analysis, CNNs excel at identifying and extracting relevant predictive features directly from images, thereby reducing computational overhead compared to fully connected architectures. Harnessing this more extensive pool of information, these models surpass alternative models based on condensed feature-based input sets. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the AGN training sample down-selection. Sect. 3 focuses on the photometric data products available within LS10. Sect. 4 details the photometric data preprocessing, followed by Sect. 5, which outlines the model pipeline. Sect. 6 presents and quantifies the redshift results, while Sect. 7 evaluates the photo-z released for the XMM-SERVS (Chen et al., 2018; Ni et al., 2021) fields. Sect. 8 outlines current limitations and discusses how we can achieve further improvements. Sect. 9 explores implications for future surveys, concluding with a summary. In this paper, unless stated differently, we express magnitudes in the AB system and adopt a \LambdaCDM cosmology with H_{0}=69.8 km s-1 Mpc-1, \Omega_{\text{m}}=0.28 and \Lambda=0.72."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07291v1,Spectroscopic Confirmation of A Massive Protocluster with Two Substructures at \mathbf{z\simeq 3.1},"We present the results of a Keck and NOEMA spectroscopic survey of 507 galaxies, where we confirm the presence of two massive overdensities at z=3.090-3.110 and z=3.133-3.155 in the neighborhood of the GOODS-N, each with over a dozen spectroscopically confirmed members. We find that both of these have galaxy overdensities of NIR-detected galaxies of \delta_{\rm gal,obs}=6-9 within corrected volumes of (6-7)\times 10^{3}~{}{\rm cMpc}^{3}. We estimate the properties of the z=0 descendants of these overdensities using a spherical collapse model and find that both should virialize by z\simeq 0.5-0.8, with total masses of M_{\rm tot}\simeq(6-7)\times 10^{14}~{}{\rm M}_{\sun}. The same spherical collapse calculations, as well as a clustering-of-clusters statistical analysis, suggest a >80% likelihood that the two overdensities will collapse into a single cluster with M_{\rm tot}=(1.0-1.5)\times 10^{15}\,M_{\sun} by z\sim 0.1-0.4. The z=3.14 substructure contains a core of four bright dusty star-forming galaxies with \Sigma{\rm SFR}=2700\pm 700~{}{\rm M}_{\sun}~{}{\rm yr}^{-1} in a volume of only 280 cMpc3.","Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe and have a pronounced influence on the evolution of galaxies contained within them. For decades, we have known that galaxies within denser environments, like groups and clusters, tend to be redder, more elliptical, and have lower star formation rates (SFRs) than field galaxies at similar redshifts (e.g., Balogh et al., 1998; Muzzin et al., 2009). This transition toward a “red and dead” galaxy population in dense environments has been shown to be the combined result both of secular feedback and environmental quenching. At z\gtrsim 1, however, this SFR-density relation is inverted, with galaxies in denser environments being much more actively star-forming than those in co-eval field environments (Elbaz et al., 2007; Cooper et al., 2008; Brodwin et al., 2013). This is believed to be at least in part due to time evolution: at early times, the most massive haloes accumulated gas faster in their deeper gravitational potential wells. This accumulation of gas allowed for an earlier onset of star formation, leading to increased SFRs at high redshifts. However, these overdense environments also quenched earlier, due to the relatively early onset of stellar, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and environmental feedback, resulting in the red and dead population in galaxy clusters today. Understanding this population of protoclusters, the progenitors of today’s galaxy clusters, is therefore essential to understand the buildup of mass in the Universe overall. While large numbers of galaxy clusters have been discovered in wide-field, homogenous surveys out to z\sim 1.5 (e.g., Bleem et al., 2015; Balogh et al., 2021), far fewer z\gtrsim 2 protoclusters have been confirmed, with largely heterogenous selection (e.g., Casey, 2016; Alberts & Noble, 2022, and references therein). Unlike nearby clusters, which can be identified by high concentrations of red galaxies (e.g., Muzzin et al., 2009), or thermal X-rays (e.g., Cruddace et al., 2002; Stanford et al., 2006), or Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect signatures (e.g., Bleem et al., 2015) of the hot intracluster medium, protoclusters are not yet virialized (Chiang et al., 2013; Muldrew et al., 2015; Overzier, 2016) and have bluer, more highly star-forming galaxies than the field. Protoclusters are therefore identified by the detection of large numbers of star-forming galaxies on \sim10 cMpc scales (e.g., Overzier, 2016, and references therein), with the gold standard being large numbers of spectroscopic detections in a window of \Delta z\approx 0.02-0.03 (e.g., Casey et al., 2015; Cucciati et al., 2018; Polletta et al., 2021). Due to the expense of spectroscopic observations at the highest redshifts, many z\gtrsim 3 protoclusters have only a few—or even a single—spectroscopically confirmed galaxy (e.g., Wang et al., 2021), making it impossible to assess accurately their overdensities or kinematics, and thereby their masses. To date, there have only been a handful of z\gtrsim 3 protoclusters with \gtrsim10 spectroscopically confirmed members (e.g., Steidel et al., 1998; Miller et al., 2018; Long et al., 2020). Enlarging this sample is therefore critical to understanding the evolution of overdense environments in the first 2 Gyr of the Universe. Deep and unbiased spectroscopic surveys, like those conducted on nearby clusters, are generally too expensive to complete over large volumes at the high redshifts of protoclusters. Instead of using blank-field surveys, many protoclusters are identified by surveying the areas around rare, massive galaxies, such as dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; e.g., Casey, 2016) or AGNs (e.g., Ivison et al., 2000). Some protoclusters contain multiple DSFGs with individual SFRs \gtrsim 100~{}{\rm M}_{\sun}~{}{\rm yr}^{-1} within volumes of only a few hundred cMpc3 (e.g., Miller et al., 2018; Long et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). These protocluster “cores” are the most densely star-forming extended structures in the Universe. Using 2 mm and 3 mm linescans with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA), Jones et al. (2021) obtained CO spectroscopic redshifts (speczs) of three ultra-bright (S_{\rm 850\mu m}\geq 11 mJy) DSFGs at the very edge of the SCUBA-2 coverage of the GOODS-N. Two of the three were at z\sim 3.14 (red squares in Figure 1) and separated by only 2.7^{\prime}, or 5.0 cMpc at z=3.14. Jones et al. (2021) surmised that these DSFGs may trace a massively star-forming protocluster at this redshift. However, due to their rarity, DSFGs are very biased tracers of mass (Miller et al., 2015). Thus, confirming and characterizing a protocluster requires additional spectroscopic observations of other candidate protocluster members. In this work, we present our spectroscopic surveys of galaxies near the z\sim 3.14 DSFGs from Jones et al. (2021). In Section 2, we describe our NOEMA observations of a further three SCUBA-2 sources (Section 2.1), as well as our Keck/LRIS and Keck/MOSFIRE observations of “normal” star-forming galaxies (Section 2.2). In Section 3, we present the results of these observations, including the detection of two z\sim 3.1 structures. In Section 4, we calculate the overdensities of these two structures and show that they will likely reach z=0 masses of M_{\rm tot}\gtrsim 5\times 10^{14}~{}{\rm M}_{\sun}. In Section 5, we discuss the likely future of these overdensities and show that they are likely to combine to form a single cluster by z=0, and in Section 6, we note the existence of a dust-rich protocluster core in the z=3.14 substructure. Finally, we summarize our work in Section 7. We assume a concordance flat \LambdaCDM cosmology with H_{0}=70~{}{\rm km~{}s^{-1}~{}Mpc^{-1}}, \Omega_{\rm m,0}=0.3, and \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7 throughout this work. All magnitudes are in the AB magnitude system."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07283v1,Chemo-dynamics of the stellar component of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy I: observed properties,"Aims. Recently, both the presence of multiple stellar chemo-kinematic components and rotation in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy have been put into question. Therefore, we re-examine the chemo-kinematic properties of this galaxy making use of the best spectroscopic data-set available containing both line-of-sight velocities and metallicities of individual stars.Methods. We carry out a detailed, quantitative analysis on the recent spectroscopic data-set from Tolstoy et al. (2023) that contains high precision velocities and metallicities for 1339 members of Sculptor. In particular, we assess whether Sculptor is best represented by a single stellar population with a negative metallicity gradient or by the super-position of two or more components with different mean metallicity, spatial distribution and kinematic properties. For this analysis, we also include the incompleteness of the spectroscopic data-set.Results. We find that Sculptor is better described by a two-populations model than by a single-population model with a metallicity gradient. Moreover, given the assumptions of the current modeling, we find evidence of a third population, composed of few stars, that is more extended and metal-poor than the two other populations. This very metal-poor group of stars shows a shift of \sim15 km s-1 in its average l.o.s. velocity (v_{los}) with respect to the rest of the galaxy. We discuss several possible origins for this new population, finding a minor merger as the most likely one. We also find a v_{los} gradient of 4.0{}^{+1.5}_{-1.5} km s-1 deg-1 but its statistical evidence is inconclusive and, moreover, its detection is partially driven by the group of stars with off-set velocities.","The characterization of the internal kinematic properties of the stellar component of galaxies is an important step for unraveling the processes that have shaped their evolution; it is also propaedeutic to the application of dynamical modeling techniques aimed at inferring the galaxy’s mass distribution. In the Local Group (LG) we have the possibility of carrying out this type of characterization in detail, on a star-by-star basis, for a large sample of dwarf galaxies, reaching down to a regime in stellar mass that is otherwise inaccessible to current facilities. This regime is particularly interesting as it is where the galaxies with the largest dynamical mass-to-light ratios are found (Mateo, 1998; Walker & Peñarrubia, 2011; Simon, 2019; Battaglia & Nipoti, 2022, and references therein), making them very valuable probes to test cosmological models. For LG galaxies, we can also rely on a wealth of additional, detailed information, such as the stars’ chemistry and relative ages, which allow exploring whether there are causal links between observed properties (e.g. does the rotational versus velocity dispersion support has an impact on the age and metallicity gradients? Do bursts of star formation leave an imprint on the chemo-kinematic properties of the stellar component?). In addition, the impact of environmental effects can be assessed at the level of the individual dwarf galaxies, at least to some extent. For example, from the 3D distance from the large LG spirals, it is possible to identify what dwarf galaxies might have had a negligible level of interaction with these much more massive systems. In particular for Milky Way (MW) satellites, the availability of accurate and precise systemic proper motions derived from Gaia and HST has opened the door to the possibility of relating their observed properties to their orbital history (Sohn et al., 2017; Li et al., 2021; Pace et al., 2022; Battaglia et al., 2022); even though uncertainties in both the satellites’ systemic motions and in the mass distribution of the Milky, and how it is assembled over time, imply that such considerations are most robust for the last one or two pericentric passages (e.g. D’Souza & Bell, 2022; Vasiliev, 2024; Santistevan et al., 2024). The direction and amplitude of velocity gradients, combined with the information on the galaxy’s orbit, can give several useful indications of a galaxy’s past life. As the result of various observing campaigns from multiple groups (e.g. Tolstoy et al., 2004; Walker et al., 2008), it has become clear that the stellar component of LG dwarf galaxies is mainly supported by random motions (see e.g. Wheeler et al., 2017, who find that the measured ratio between ordered and random motions, V/\sigma<1 for 3/4 of the sample). This is also true for systems that are unlikely to have ever interacted with the large LG spirals, or that might have had experienced one pericentric passage around the MW or M31 at most (Taibi et al., 2018, 2022). Such findings disfavour, or at least call for a revision of, those models that were suggesting that the pressure-supported dwarf spheroidal galaxies form from tidally-stirred, rotationally supported dwarf galaxies (e.g. Mayer et al., 2001, 2006; Kazantzidis et al., 2011). On the other hand, the presence of rotation along the minor-axis (prolate rotation) has been unveiled in And II (Ho et al., 2012) and Phoenix (Kacharov et al., 2017) and linked to merger events (Lokas et al., 2014; Cardona-Barrero et al., 2021). In other systems, velocity gradients aligning with the projection of the orbital path on the sky are revealing of tidal stripping (e.g. AntliaII, TucanaIII) (Mutlu-Pakdil et al., 2018; Torrealba et al., 2019); and relations have been made between the velocity gradients’ amplitude and orbital phase (e.g. approaching vs leaving pericenter Martínez-García et al., 2023). However, robustly measuring velocity gradients of just a few km/s/kpc entails a significant challenge, depending on factors such as the spatial coverage, velocity uncertainties and sample sizes. Therefore, they are worth revisiting as new data-sets become available, in particular at a time when more precise determinations of the systemic proper motions allow to correct for ”perspective” gradients (e.g. Kaplinghat & Strigari, 2008; Walker et al., 2008). Another main outcome of the spectroscopic campaigns has been the finding that the stellar component of several LG dwarf galaxies can be described as the superposition of at least two components with different metallicity, spatial distribution and kinematics (dubbed ¨chemo-kinematic components¨ or ”multiple chemo-dynamic populations”, e.g. Tolstoy et al., 2004; Battaglia et al., 2006; Walker & Peñarrubia, 2011; Fabrizio et al., 2016; Kordopatis et al., 2016; Pace et al., 2020). This has been possible through the combined analysis of line-of-sight velocities and metallicities (or indicators of relative metallicity) for large samples of individual stars. Trying to understand whether these are indeed separate populations can give handles on formation scenarios. For example, multiple populations can form from early mergers (that would puff up a pre-existing old and metal-poor stellar component), followed by later gas accretion, which would form the more metal-rich component (e.g. Benítez-Llambay et al., 2016). Or, possibly, these components could be due to star formation bursts, or anyway prominent phases of star formation at given times, rather than a more continuous star formation activity that would favor the formation of metallicity gradients (Revaz & Jablonka, 2018; Mercado et al., 2021). From a dynamical modeling perspective, the importance of multiple chemo-kinematic populations lies in the fact that they can be used to place tighter constraints on the DM halo density distribution (e.g. Battaglia et al., 2008a; Walker & Peñarrubia, 2011; Amorisco & Evans, 2012; Zhu et al., 2016; Strigari et al., 2017) by relieving the well-known mass-anisotropy-(stellar density) degeneracy (Binney & Mamon, 1982). The Sculptor dSph, found at an heliocentric distance of 83.9 \pm 1.5 kpc (Martínez-Vázquez et al., 2015), was the first LG dwarf galaxy in which the presence of multiple chemo-kinematic components was unveiled (Tolstoy et al., 2004) and used as independent tracers of the galaxy’s gravitational potential (Battaglia et al., 2008a). The rationale for considering these as separate components came mainly from the presence of a well-defined blue- and red-horizontal branch in the color-magnitude diagram of this galaxy, which also exhibited a distinct spatial distribution. Additionally, Schwarzschild modeling of this galaxy naturally led to the identification of two peaks in the energy-angular momentum space, directly related to the two previously known populations (Breddels & Helmi, 2014), giving support to the hypothesis of two distinct stellar components. Dynamical modeling using individually both Sculptor’s chemo-kinematic components typically has resulted in a preference for a cored DM halo density distribution (Battaglia et al., 2008a; Walker & Peñarrubia, 2011; Amorisco & Evans, 2012; Zhu et al., 2016; Strigari et al., 2018), while single component modeling results are more diverse, finding both cores in some cases and cusps in others (Breddels et al., 2013; Read et al., 2019; Pascale et al., 2019; Kaplinghat et al., 2019; Pascale, 2020). Battaglia et al. (2008a) also found a l.o.s. velocity gradient of 7.6{}^{+3.0}_{-2.2} km s-1 deg-1 along the projected major axis. Nonetheless, the evidence for a significant velocity gradient in this galaxy has weakened, both in studies that have used Gaia DR1+HST or Gaia eDR3 systemic proper motions to correct the earlier spectroscopic samples for perspective velocity gradients (e.g. Massari et al., 2018; Martínez-García et al., 2021) as well as in new larger data-sets with improved, Gaia-aided memberships (Tolstoy et al., 2023). Additionally, in the initial analysis of Tolstoy et al. (2023) the two previous chemo-kinematic components are no longer as easily identifiable as in earlier studies; while on the other hand, the most distinct kinematics is detected for stars with [Fe/H]<-2.5, whose average velocity is shifted of a few km/s from that of the rest of the stars. Our goal is to perform a comprehensive and quantitative chemo-dynamical analysis of the stellar populations in Sculptor, using the new data-set of Tolstoy et al. (2023) and considering simultaneously the information on the stars’s spatial location, l.o.s. velocity and metallicity. We aim to untangle whether Sculptor is better described by a single population with a negative metallicity gradient or whether it is composed of distinct stellar components, and to revisit the presence of a possible v_{los} gradient. The results of this analysis will inform future dynamical modeling (Arroyo-Polonio et al. in prep). In Sec. 2 we will briefly describe the main characteristics of the data-set used. In Sec. 3 we characterize Sculptor’s stellar populations. In Sec. 4, we present the results of the search for l.o.s. velocity gradients. In Sec. 5 we discuss the implications and possible explanations of our results in the context of all the findings in the literature. Finally, in Sec. 6 we summarize our the work, extract the main conclusions, and discuss future prospects."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07282v1,The Impact of Star Formation and Feedback Recipes on the Stellar Mass and Interstellar Medium of High-Redshift Galaxies,"We introduce MEGATRON, a new galaxy formation model for cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of high-redshift galaxies. The model accounts for the non-equilibrium chemistry and heating/cooling processes of \geq 80 atoms, ions, and molecules, coupled to on-the-fly radiation transfer. We apply the model in a cosmological setting to the formation of a {10}^{9}\text{\,}\mathrm{M_{\odot}} halo at z=6, and run 25 realizations at pc-scale resolution, varying numerous parameters associated with our state-of-the-art star formation, stellar feedback, and chemical enrichment models. We show that the overall budget of feedback energy is the key parameter that controls star formation regulation at high redshift, with other numerical parameters (e.g. supernova clustering, star formation conditions) having a more limited impact. As a similar feedback model has been shown to produce realistic z=0 galaxies, our work demonstrates that calibration at z=0 does not guarantee strong regulation of star formation at high-redshift. Interestingly, we find that subgrid model variations that have little impact on the final z=6 stellar mass can lead to substantial changes on the observable properties of high-redshift galaxies. For example, different star formation models based on, e.g. density thresholds or turbulence inspired criteria, lead to fundamentally distinct nebular emission line ratios across the interstellar medium (ISM). These results highlight the ISM as an important resource for constraining models of star formation, feedback, and galaxy formation in the JWST era, where emission line measurements for >1,000 high-redshift galaxies are now available.","The launch of JWST (Gardner et al., 2006, 2023) has ushered in a new era for high-redshift galaxy formation. The spectroscopic redshift barrier set by HST at z\sim 11 (Oesch et al., 2016) has been far surpassed (e.g. Curtis-Lake et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Carniani et al., 2024), while emission lines that provide detailed insight into the ISM have been detected to z>12 (Zavala et al., 2024; Castellano et al., 2024). This new data immediately challenged conventional understanding of galaxy formation in the early Universe. For example, numerous high-redshift galaxy surveys with JWST have reported the detection of an overabundance of bright galaxies at z\gtrsim 9 compared to earlier constraints from Hubble and most theoretical models (e.g. Finkelstein et al., 2023b; Harikane et al., 2024; Leung et al., 2023; Chemerynska et al., 2023, although c.f. Willott et al. 2023). Likewise, massive quiescent galaxies at z\sim 3-5 appear to form at exceptionally early epochs (e.g. de Graaff et al., 2024; Glazebrook et al., 2024). Many early galaxies exhibit chemical abundance patterns that have never been seen in the gas-phase (e.g. Cameron et al., 2023a; Senchyna et al., 2024; Isobe et al., 2023b; Topping et al., 2024b), which may indicate exotic enrichment channels, e.g. from supermassive stars (e.g. Charbonnel et al., 2023; Marques-Chaves et al., 2024). Moreover the ISM gas temperatures in early galaxies may be at odds with standard heating mechanisms (e.g. Katz et al., 2023c; Laseter et al., 2024). From a kinematics perspective, there may be more dynamically cold disks with high V/\sigma at high redshift than predicted by many simulations (e.g. Pillepich et al., 2019; Kohandel et al., 2024). Finally, some of the high-redshift JWST spectra appear to require exotic stellar populations or a top-heavy stellar initial mass function (e.g. Cameron et al., 2023b; Katz et al., 2024). These new anomalies supplement a previous set of inconsistencies between simulations and observations that arose from HST/ALMA data including the presence of high-redshift Balmer breaks (Hashimoto et al., 2018), extremely high [O III] 88 \mum/[C II] 158 \mum ratios (Harikane et al., 2020), or very extended cold gas haloes (Fujimoto et al., 2020). Understanding the physical mechanisms responsible for the discrepancies between simulations and observations remains a key theoretical challenge. Prior to JWST, numerous numerical simulations of the early Universe such as AURORA (Pawlik et al., 2017), CoDa (Ocvirk et al., 2020), CROC (Gnedin, 2014), FIRE (Ma et al., 2018), FLARES (Lovell et al., 2021), OBELISK (Trebitsch et al., 2021), RENAISSANCE (O’Shea et al., 2015), SPHINX (Rosdahl et al., 2018), and THESAN (Kannan et al., 2022) were very successful in reproducing observational data such as the UV luminosity function, despite fundamental differences in resolution (spatial and mass), subgrid models for star formation, feedback, and metal enrichment, and included physics such as radiative transfer, non-equilibrium cooling, and dust. This demonstrates that the constraining power of the UV luminosity function is rather limited. Part of the reason why UV luminosity has poor constraining power is that it is generally only sensitive to the younger stellar populations in the galaxy (e.g. Kennicutt & Evans, 2012) rather than the full star formation history. For this reason, the inferred stellar mass-halo mass relation (e.g. Moster, Naab & White, 2018; Behroozi et al., 2019) has been a common benchmark. However, neither stellar mass nor halo mass are directly observable quantities and no pre-JWST simulation reliably predicted the stellar mass function in the interval z\sim 4-9 (Weibel et al., 2024). Stellar mass in particular has order of magnitude uncertainties depending on choice of prior of star formation history (Narayanan et al., 2024) and this manifests in studies that observe galaxies with similar redshifts and fluxes predicting vastly different stellar masses (Katz et al., 2023b). Convergence also has not yet been reached in studies comparing spatially resolved and integrated stellar masses (Giménez-Arteaga et al., 2023, 2024). Most importantly, the models used to infer the stellar mass-halo mass relation are inconsistent with the new high-redshift JWST data (Finkelstein et al., 2023b). Because JWST can see much redder than HST, rather than using inferred stellar masses, constraints on the older stellar populations are available via photometry (and/or spectra), if they can be forward modeled. In addition to observing older stellar populations at longer wavelengths, another advantage of JWST is the ability to probe into the ISM of early galaxies (e.g. Cameron et al., 2023c; Sanders et al., 2023). These studies have demonstrated that the nebular conditions in the early Universe are vastly different compared to those in local galaxies. Comparing simulations with the observed ISM conditions at high redshift via rest-frame UV and optical emission lines represents a new opportunity to test the physics present in numerical simulations. However, among the larger-scale simulation suites, only a few projects such as FIRE, SPHINX, and RENAISSANCE have the resolution to begin to probe the ISM (at the cost of modeling either a smaller volume, fewer galaxies, or stopping the simulation at high-redshift). Such simulations often use more simplistic models than what is considered the state-of-the-art in the ISM simulation community (Kim et al., 2023). Simulations with detailed ISM models are often limited to either isolated or small high-redshift dwarf galaxies (e.g. Safranek-Shrader, Milosavljević & Bromm, 2014a; Hu et al., 2016; Steinwandel et al., 2020; Hislop et al., 2022; Katz et al., 2022; Deng et al., 2024b), which limits the possible comparison between the models and JWST observations. Moreover, much of the detailed information from JWST comes in the form of emission lines from both primordial species (e.g. H\alpha, H\beta, He II \lambda1640) and metals (e.g. [O III] \lambda5007, [O II] \lambda\lambda3727, [C III] \lambda\lambda1908), many of which are not self-consistently predicted by the current generation of simulations. Predicting emission lines (and more generally the full spectra of galaxies) requires knowing the detailed properties of the radiation field and thermodynamics of both ionized and neutral gas. Cosmological radiation hydrodynamics codes often include non-equilibrium chemistry for primordial species (e.g. Pawlik & Schaye, 2008; Rosdahl et al., 2013; Gnedin, 2014), but few include non-equilibrium metal chemistry, the effects of which have recently been shown to be important (e.g. Richings et al., 2022; Katz et al., 2022). Resolving the detailed structure of the H II regions is also crucial (e.g. Jin, Kewley & Sutherland, 2022) and this remains well beyond the capabilities of current simulations of full galaxies. Nevertheless, in order to take advantage of the most recent JWST data as a means of both understanding the physics that governs our own Universe and for constraining theoretical models of galaxy formation, detailed galaxy-scale models of the ISM are required to forward-model the observations. For this reason, in this work we adopt the RAMSES-RTZ code (Katz, 2022) to distill the physics from numerics of early galaxy formation. RAMSES-RTZ is unique among galaxy formation codes as it not only solves for gravity, hydrodynamics, radiation transfer, and primordial chemistry, but it can also follow the non-equilibrium chemistry of metals, fully coupled to the radiative transfer, which is the key component for predicting emission lines. We develop a new, state-of-the-art galaxy formation model and systematically test how modifications to sub-grid parameters, feedback physics, and resolution, impact the stellar mass growth and the ISM of a single high-redshift dwarf galaxy. We demonstrate how the ISM, in particular observable emission line ratios, exhibit strong sensitivity to subtle changes in subgrid recipes and feedback, and thus represent a new means of constraining models of galaxy formation."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07281v4,The Milky Way accretion history compared to cosmological simulations,"Galactic halos are known to grow hierarchically, inside out. This implies a correlation between the infall lookback time of satellites and their binding energy. Cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between the infall lookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, with a small scatter. Gaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf satellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic energies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites and those of the galaxies that were previously accreted by the Milky Way. This can be compared to cosmological simulations for the first time. The relation of the infall lookback time versus binding energy we found in a cosmological simulation matches that for the early accretion events when the simulated total Milky Way mass within 21 kpc was rescaled to 2 \times\ 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}. This agrees well with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from the rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear outliers to this rescaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In other words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to Sgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them were accreted much later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also found that the subhalo systems in some cosmological simulations are too dynamically hot when they are compared to identified Milky Way substructures. This leads to an overestimated impact of satellites on the Galaxy rotation curve.","In the hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation, structures grow inside out (Gott, 1975). This means that newcomers have lower binding energies than satellites that entered a main galaxy host at early epochs. Because of the host mass growth, first-comers are naturally most strongly bound (Rocha et al., 2012; Boylan-Kolchin et al., 2013). Cosmological simulations recovered a tight linear correlation between the lookback infall time and the logarithm of the binding energy, showing an evolution of more than 1 dex, and with a scatter of only 0.13 dex (Rocha et al., 2012). The slope of this correlation is consistent with the slope estimated for the Milky Way (MW) accretion history. Assuming the MW mass model from Eilers et al. (2019, total mass of 8.3\times 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}), Hammer et al. (2023, see their Fig. 6) determined this relation for the MW. The authors accounted for globular clusters (GCs) associated with the bulge, Kraken, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), and Sgr infall and adopted the associations made by Malhan et al. (2022) and Kruijssen et al. (2020). According to the latter study, these events occurred 12.5\pm0.5, 11.5\pm0.5, 9\pm1, and 5\pm1 Gyr ago, respectively. The relation between their lookback infall time and the logarithm of their binding energy was found to be linear, which agrees with cosmological simulations. The relation was used by Hammer et al. (2023) to infer that the binding energies of MW dwarf galaxies are far lower than the binding energy of GSE GCs (by a factor of 6 on average). This prevented them from having been accreted \sim 9 Gyr ago. Extrapolating the relation from bulge to Sgr GCs toward the dwarf energy regime, Hammer et al. (2023) concluded that most dwarf infall lookback times should be shorter than 3 Gyr. The relation could also constrain the MW mass, because the more massive a galaxy, the deeper its potential well. This allows it to capture satellites with lower binding energies (e.g., Leo I could be bound if the MW were very massive; Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2013). Recent Gaia measurements of the MW rotation curve (RC) provided 8.3\times 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} (Eilers et al., 2019) and 2.06^{+0.24}_{-0.13}\times 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} (Jiao et al., 2023) for an adopted Navarro et al. (1997, Navarro, Frenk & White, hereafter NFW) and Einasto (1965, see also ) mass profile, respectively. However, the NFW mass profile is too shallow in the disk outskirts, and it is rejected at 3\sigma level by RC measurements from the 3rd Gaia data release (hereafter Gaia DR3), which also revealed a decline beyond 19 kpc that is consistent with Keplerian expectations (Wang et al., 2023; Jiao et al., 2023; Ou et al., 2024). The consideration of the MW gravitational potential as being almost equivalent to a point mass111The best-fit Einasto index found by Jiao et al. (2023) is consistent with a Gaussian cutoff of the dark matter density profile. beyond 19 kpc has profoundly impacted the cosmological community, for whom the MW halo-limiting radius was generally assumed to range from 150 to 300 kpc. However, the MW is not entirely axisymmetric or in dynamical equilibrium, as is assumed when resolving the Jeans equation to derive the rotation curve. In particular, the disk shows many substructures, including ridges, warps, and flares, in particular, in its outer range, with different upward or inward velocities, and a significant difference in the stellar rotational velocity above and below the disk (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2021, and references therein). Recently, Koop et al. (2024) suggested that the MW disk is so perturbed by passages of satellites that its rotation curve cannot be used to predict its mass. However, the regularity of the MW rotation curve until \sim19 kpc suggests that nonequilibrium mechanisms are not sufficiently strong to perturb its dynamics significantly, although they could be a serious concern beyond this radius. The goal of this paper is to verify which MW mass can be consistent with the relation between lookback infall time and the binding energy of satellites after we compare the mass to the masses obtained in cosmological simulations. Furthermore, we assess the accretion epoch of dwarf galaxies, and we verify whether satellites may impact the disk stability when they pass near the disk. Section 2 tests the accretion history of the MW, including that of dwarf galaxies, and compares it to the history determined from high-resolution cosmological simulations. Section 3 discusses the pertinence of cosmological simulations for a retrieval of the MW properties and its accretion history, and for identifying whether satellites may have affected its disk dynamics. We then summarize our main conclusions. In this paper, R_{\rm 200c} is the virial radius for which the enclosed DM mass, dubbed M_{\rm 200c}, corresponds to an overdensity of 200 times the critical density. The total mass includes M_{\rm 200c}, to which we added the baryonic component, in a similar way as Eilers et al. (2019). The orbital energies correspond to the addition of the kinetic energy provided by Gaia proper motions and radial velocities with the potential energy of the considered mass distribution. To calculate the potential, we followed Rocha et al. (2012), who assumed that the DM-halo potential rises to zero at 1 Mpc. We therefore assumed that the DM potential associated with a given virial mass M_{\rm 200c} must reach zero at the rescaled radius of 1\,(M_{\rm 200c}/1.4\times 10^{12})^{1/3}\,\rm Mpc, where 1.4 \times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} is the DM-halo mass M_{\rm 200c} of Rocha et al.222The M_{\rm 200c} value was converted from the Rocha et al. (2012) M_{\rm 200m}=1.9\times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}, which corresponds to an overdensity of 200 times the mass density.. The total mass (or potential) is the sum over the DM and the bulge and disk components. As an example, detailed equations are given in Appendix A for an NFW DM-halo component. Figure 1: Relation between the infall lookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, for which black dots represent the subhalos that are associated with the Rocha et al. (2012) simulation, the solid line represents the best fit, and the dashed lines show its one \sigma scatter. The binding energies of dwarf galaxies (blue triangles) and of GCs associated with MW events (red dots with corresponding labels in magenta) are calculated using the observed kinetic energy together with the potential of the main halo. The blue triangles indicate the location of dwarf galaxies with a very good accuracy (<0.1 dex) in binding energy, and for which we adopted the predicted dwarf infall time of Barmentloo & Cautun (2023). Top panel: Relation as derived from the Rocha et al. (2012) dark-matter-only simulations. Bottom panel: Same as the top panel, but we added a baryonic mass (6.2\times\ 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) after a slight rescaling of the dark matter halo mass from 1.4 \times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} to 1.34 \times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} (see Appendix A). In the bottom right corner of the panel, the numbers indicate the predicted time for GCs associated with the bulge, GSE, and Sgr when they are inserted into the halo potential, as well as the probability that they lie in the distribution of simulated subhalos."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07280v1,The Variability Structure Function of the Highest-Luminosity Quasars on Short Timescales,"The stochastic photometric variability of quasars is known to follow a random-walk phenomenology on emission timescales of months to years. Some high-cadence restframe optical monitoring in the past has hinted at a suppression of variability amplitudes on shorter timescales of a few days or weeks, opening the question of what drives the suppression and how it might scale with quasar properties. Here, we study a few thousand of the highest-luminosity quasars in the sky, mostly in the luminosity range of L_{\rm bol}=[46.4,47.3] and redshift range of z=[0.7,2.4]. We use a dataset from the NASA/ATLAS facility with nightly cadence, weather permitting, which has been used before to quantify strong regularity in longer-term restframe-UV variability. As we focus on a careful treatment of short timescales across the sample, we find that a linear function is sufficient to describe the UV variability structure function. Although the result can not rule out the existence of breaks in some groups completely, a simpler model is usually favoured under this circumstance. In conclusion, the data is consistent with a single-slope random walk across restframe timescales of \Delta t=[10,250] days.","In the last two decades, the field of quasar variability has made tremendous progress due to the availability of large time domain surveys (e.g. Morganson et al., 2014; Caplar et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Suberlak et al., 2021). These data sets are hoped to reveal correlations between variability behaviour and physical quasar properties to reveal the underlying physics behind the variability of quasar accretion discs (e.g. Ulrich et al., 1997; Peterson, 2001; Padovani et al., 2017; Cackett et al., 2021). The variability could be caused by the turbulence that is driven by magneto rotational instability (MRI; Balbus & Hawley, 1991), and in addition the disc will respond to variable heating from the X-ray corona near the inner disc, an effect known as reprocessing or lamppost effect (e.g. Clavel et al., 1992; Shappee et al., 2014; Hernández Santisteban et al., 2020; Cackett et al., 2021). A common technique to study quasar variability in the UV/optical domain is structure function (SF; Hughes et al., 1992) analysis: this is suitable for analysing observed light curves (LC) with non-uniform sampling, which is often a natural consequence of weather and other constraints on observing. The variability SF of an LC shows how observed brightness changes on average as a function of time interval. The detailed mathematical background of SF analysis is described very well by Kozłowski (2016). If the brightness change of the quasar is truly stochastic, i.e., there is no correlation of a present change with any of the past changes, the behaviour can be described as the random walk (RW). According to the random walk model, the power-law slope of the SF is expected to be 0.5 (Kelly et al., 2009), indicating the source of variability is caused by disc instability (Takeuchi et al., 1995; Kawaguchi et al., 1998). This 0.5 slope is confirmed by observations (e.g. Rengstorf et al., 2006; Caplar et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2023) on timescales \gtrapprox100 days. Likewise, studies that expressed the variability as a power spectral densities (PSD) show a slope of -2 in the PSD, which is mathematically equivalent to a slope of 0.5 in the SF (e.g. Giveon et al., 1999; Kelly et al., 2009). However, Mushotzky et al. (2011) found the slope on timescales of a few days seems to be significantly steeper than 0.5, indicating the existence of a break. Several studies that cover a broad range of timescales have found breaks on short timescales (e.g. Edelson et al., 2014; Kelly et al., 2014; Simm et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2018; Stone et al., 2022), motivating attempts to explain this feature in the structure function (e.g. Sun et al., 2020; Tachibana et al., 2020) or to model quasar LCs including this effect (e.g. Kelly et al., 2014; Kasliwal et al., 2017; Moreno et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2022). However, other studies that also probe short timescales find no evidence of breaks (e.g. Morganson et al., 2014; Caplar et al., 2017), casting doubt on whether there is any slope change or not. The damped random walk (DRW; Kelly et al., 2009) model predicts that the variability at the timescales longer than the random walk regime becomes uncorrelated with the timescale, producing a flatten slope 0 in SF. The breaking timescale indicating this turnover is often referred to as characteristic timescale or de-correlation timescale. To clarify, we focus on the break shorter than this break in this work. Previously, we have used the NASA/Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS; Tonry et al., 2018) survey to study the quasar variability, as it has proven to be one of few very rich data sets. Tang et al. (2023, hereafter Paper I) performed the SF analysis on optical ATLAS LCs of \sim 5\,000 brightest quasars and showed that the random-walk relation is universal in variability amplitude when time is expressed in units of orbital or thermal timescale of the emitting portion of the accretion disc, seemingly independent of physical parameters that are not encapsulated in the disc time scales. This has emphasized the similarity between quasar accretion discs and pointed to evidence that MRI may be related to the root cause of the variability. While that work has shown breaks on short timescales, its analysis was focused on the longer-term random walk. In this work, we aim to deepen our analysis of the short time scales of the same light curves from NASA/ATLAS. In Section 2, we provide a description of the sample and data. We outline the method employed to calculate and fit the SF in Section 3 and show the result in Section 4. Throughout our analysis, we adopt a flat \LambdaCDM cosmology with \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7 and H_{0}=70 km s-1 Mpc-1. Additionally, we use Vega magnitudes for data from Gaia and AB magnitudes for data from NASA/ATLAS and for absolute magnitude estimates."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07301v1,The impact of the cosmological constant on past and future star formation,"We present an extended analytic model for cosmic star formation, with the aim of investigating the impact of cosmological parameters on the star formation history within the \LambdaCDM paradigm. Constructing an ensemble of flat \LambdaCDM models where the cosmological constant varies between \Lambda=0 and 10^{5} times the observed value, \Lambda_{\rm obs}, we find that the fraction of cosmic baryons that are converted into stars over the entire history of the universe peaks at \sim 27% for 0.01\lesssim\Lambda/\Lambda_{\rm obs}\lesssim 1. We explain, from first principles, that the decline of this asymptotic star-formation efficiency for lower and higher values of \Lambda is driven respectively by the astrophysics of star formation, and by the suppression of cosmic structure formation. However, the asymptotic efficiency declines slowly as \Lambda increases, falling below 5% only for \Lambda>100\,\Lambda_{\rm obs}. Making the minimal assumption that the probability of generating observers is proportional to this efficiency, and following Weinberg in adopting a flat prior on \Lambda, the median posterior value of \Lambda is 539\,\Lambda_{\rm obs}. Furthermore, the probability of observing \Lambda\leq\Lambda_{\rm obs} is only 0.5\%. Although this work has not considered recollapsing models with \Lambda<0, the indication is thus that \Lambda_{\rm obs} appears to be unreasonably small compared to the predictions of the simplest multiverse ensemble. This poses a challenge for anthropic reasoning as a viable explanation for cosmic coincidences and the apparent fine-tuning of the universe: either the approach is invalid, or more parameters than \Lambda alone must vary within the ensemble.","Galaxies are the most obvious tracers of large-scale structure in the universe, and understanding how they emerge and evolve throughout cosmic history has been a longstanding goal of cosmology and astrophysics. The \LambdaCDM paradigm approaches this via the gravitational collapse of dark matter haloes from an initial quasi-homogeneous universe. This process is well understood, thanks to early analytical models of halo assembly (Lacey & Cole, 1993), which were subsequently validated numerically with full N-body simulations (Springel et al., 2005; Klypin et al., 2011; Angulo et al., 2012; Fosalba et al., 2015). However, many of the detailed baryonic processes that govern the build up of galaxies, such as gas accretion, star formation and outflows, are not yet fully understood. A successful theory of galaxy formation needs to account for these processes in order to predict the main observed properties of galaxies. In particular, reproducing the observed efficiency of star formation, both locally within individual galaxies and globally over a cosmologically representative volume, constitutes a crucial test for any model of galaxy formation (see the review by Madau & Dickinson, 2014). In this paper, we consider predictions for this efficiency, and how it depends on cosmological parameters, specifically the cosmological constant. Early fully analytic models of star formation were based on simple prescriptions for the cooling time for the gas within galaxies and the typical time scale for converting it into stars (e.g. Hernquist & Springel, 2003), while following the growth of structures with well established analytical forms for the halo mass function (Press & Schechter, 1974; Sheth & Tormen, 1999, 2002). However, these insightful models neglected more sophisticated mechanisms such as feedback processes driven by stars or active galactic nuclei (AGN). With a slightly different approach, White & Frenk (1991) implemented the effect of sub-galactic physics through a series of approximate formulae, while keeping the treatment of structure formation nearly analytical. This seminal work set the stage for a sequence of refinements of the modelling (e.g. Kauffmann et al., 1993; Cole et al., 1994; Guiderdoni et al., 1998; Kauffmann et al., 1999; Cole et al., 2000). Further extensions included the assembly of the central black hole, which enabled a description of the co-evolution of galaxies and quasars (e.g. Kauffmann & Haehnelt, 2000; Somerville et al., 2008; Henriques et al., 2015; Lacey et al., 2016). Other semi-analytical techniques followed the formation of dark matter haloes in full N-body simulations, coupled with analytical recipes for the baryonic physics (e.g. Croton et al., 2006; Henriques et al., 2020). Full hydrodynamical simulations incorporate several physical processes into the modelling and follow the evolution of baryons and dark matter from first principles. Several cosmological simulations (e.g. Schaye et al., 2010; Dubois et al., 2014; Hopkins et al., 2014; Vogelsberger et al., 2014; Lukić et al., 2015; Schaye et al., 2015; Davé et al., 2016; McCarthy et al., 2017; Pillepich et al., 2018; Davé et al., 2019), often based on different numerical approaches (Springel et al., 2005, 2001a; Almgren et al., 2013; Bryan et al., 2014; Hopkins, 2015; Springel et al., 2021), generally managed to reproduce a plethora of observations to a satisfactory level of accuracy. However, feedback processes are implemented via various different numerical ‘subgrid’ prescriptions, whose parameters are tuned to reproduce certain observations. It is therefore important to ask if the predictions of these calculations are robust, or whether they are fine-tuned to our universe and have a high sensitivity to model parameters. While a substantial body of literature has focused on the effect on star formation history of varying the subgrid parameters (see the review by Somerville & Davé, 2015), the impact of changing the cosmological parameters has historically received less attention. This may partially reflect the tremendous progress in constraining the parameters of the \LambdaCDM paradigm (e.g. Planck Collaboration et al. 2020; but see also Verde et al. 2019 for a discussion on recent tensions). But studying the predictions of hydrodynamical simulations regarding the star formation history in counter-factual cosmological models would constitute an interesting ‘stress-test’ of our understanding of galaxy formation. There is also a more fundamental reason to explore this question. Although the \LambdaCDM model is highly successful in many ways, it has theoretical issues that are hard to ignore (see e.g. the review by Bull et al., 2016). While the cosmological constant \Lambda is required to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe, there is no consensus on its physical meaning. If \Lambda is a manifestation of the energy of the quantum vacuum, then one can estimate its value by integrating over the zero-point energy of all possible modes. Adopting a cutoff energy E_{\rm v} yields a vacuum density of E_{\rm v}^{4} in natural units; but the observed \Lambda requires a cutoff at rather low energies, E_{\rm v}\sim 1\,{\rm meV}, in gross conflict with the scale of new physics at perhaps 10 TeV or above (Martin, 2012). This common calculation is in fact deeply flawed, as it is non-relativistic and yields the wrong vacuum equation of state (Koksma & Prokopec, 2011): a more sophisticated calculation yields a vacuum density of order M^{4}, in terms of the particle mass. But since particles exist with M near to the TeV scale (0.17 TeV for the top quark), the discrepancy in the estimated \Lambda is much the same as in the naive approach. For a more detailed discussion of this ‘cosmological constant problem’ see e.g.Weinberg (2000a) or Abel et al. (2002). Many attempts have been made to move beyond the idea of \Lambda representing a simple vacuum density, and to hypothesise some more general ‘dark energy’ contributing to an effective \Lambda that may vary with time. Ratra & Peebles (1988) proposed that a dynamical scalar field could cause the accelerating expansion of the universe. While the scalar field proposed by Ratra & Peebles (1988) was not motivated by fundamental physics, later models tried to connect it to extensions of the standard model of particle physics. In practice, the kinetic or potential terms of the Lagrangian of the scalar field depend on some fundamental mass scale (e.g. Zlatev et al., 1999; Armendariz-Picon et al., 2001). An alternative view is that the cosmic acceleration in fact shows the need for some modified theory of gravity (see e.g. Joyce et al., 2016). Other approaches include mechanisms that prevent vacuum energy from gravitating (Kaloper & Padilla, 2014). However, all these models effectively move the problem of the value of the \Lambda to the fine-tuning of some other parameter of the theory, such as the mass scale associated with the scalar field (see e.g. Amendola & Tsujikawa, 2010). There is also a more radical position asserting that the debate on the physical nature of the cosmological constant is moot, and that \Lambda is simply a fundamental constant emerging within the theory of General Relativity (Bianchi & Rovelli, 2010). Regardless of the physical interpretation of the cosmological constant, the oddly small non-null value of \Lambda gives rise to a number of coincidences that cry out for an explanation. Perhaps the most well-known of these is that the universe became \Lambda-dominated at z\approx 0.39, near to the formation time of the Sun. We therefore appear to live near the unique era when \Lambda transitions from being negligible to dominating the universe: this is the ‘why-now problem’ (Velten et al., 2014). A further time coincidence is that recombination occurred at the same time of baryon-radiation equality. In addition, Lombriser & Smer-Barreto (2017) pointed out that the equality between \Lambda and radiation occurs around the midpoint of cosmic reionisation. All these timescale puzzles are in principle distinct from the cosmological constant problem described earlier (but see also the discussion in Lombriser, 2023). A possible explanation for the ‘why now’ problem was suggested by Weinberg (1987). He noted that if the cosmological constant had been much larger than observed, the accelerating expansion of the universe would have set in at earlier times, freezing out the growth of structure before galaxy-scale haloes had been able to form. Thus the star formation in galaxies that is necessary for the creation of observers would not occur if \Lambda was substantially larger than the observed value. Such an argument is an example of anthropic reasoning (Carter, 1974), which effectively considers the existence of observers (such as ourselves) as a ‘data point’ and explores the implications for the cosmological parameters conditional on this information. To make this Bayesian argument (probability of \Lambda given that it is observed), we need there to be some physical mechanism that allows \Lambda to vary. It is also common to invoke a multiverse: an ensemble of different universes. The probability calculus is the same whether or not the members of the ensemble actually exist, or merely have the potential to do so. But the idea of a concrete multiverse underlying Weinberg’s argument was given stronger motivation by the theory of inflation. Here, a multiverse of causally disconnected ‘bubble universes’ arises in models of stochastic inflation where inflation proceeds eternally (Vilenkin, 1983; Linde, 1986; Guth, 2007; Freivogel, 2011). All causally disconnected bubbles evolve as independent universes, each characterised by a different set of constants, including \Lambda. The advantage of this picture is that for a sufficiently large ensemble there are guaranteed to exist universes suitable for the formation of structure. Thus, that would explain the existence of our universe, no matter how atypical it is within the ensemble. Anthropic arguments often encounter significant resistance, with many physicists arguing that efforts should be focused on finding solutions to cosmological puzzles from first principles (e.g. Kane et al., 2002). And of course such efforts should always be pursued. But we can note that anthropic approaches pervade other fields of astronomy, without generating controversy. A prime example is the concept of circumstellar ‘habitable zone’, which is defined based on the conditions that can sustain life on a planet (see e.g. Kasting et al., 1993). Of course, unlike with exoplanets, there is only one universe that can actually be observed (although see Aguirre & Kozaczuk, 2013; Wainwright et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2016). As such, anthropic arguments cannot be tested in the Galilean sense ingrained in the scientific method. But they can still be tested, since we can in principle predict the probability distribution of observed values of cosmological parameters over the ensemble. This prediction can be compared with the single ‘data point’ of our universe, and a sufficiently large deviation from the average serves to rule out the model on which the prediction was based. After the initial formulation given by Weinberg (1987), investigations of the anthropic approach became progressively more refined. Weinberg (1989) extended his argument by noting that observer selection does not require \Lambda to be exactly zero, and thus a small non-zero (in principle even negative) value of \Lambda would be anthropically predicted. A critical element of this argument is the idea that the prior distribution of \Lambda should be flat because \Lambda=0 is not a special point, and therefore any continuous prior must be treatable as a constant in a narrow range near zero. Efstathiou (1995) revisited the argument by making more detailed estimates of the abundance of galaxies in universes with \Lambda\geq 0, subject to the constraint that the observed temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is equal to 2.73\,\rm K. He concluded that anthropic arguments may explain a value of \Lambda close to the one that is observed. Later works allowed for more than one cosmological parameter to vary. Garriga et al. (1999) considered simultaneous variations of \Lambda and the density contrast at the time of recombination. Peacock (2007) explored anthropic arguments treating both the CMB temperature and \Lambda as free parameters, and further allowing \Lambda to assume negative values. Bousso & Leichenauer (2010) also considered the variation of multiple cosmological parameters, as well as negative values of \Lambda. In their work, the generation of observers is tied to the global efficiency of star formation in the different members of the multiverse ensemble. The star formation history is predicted with a semi-analytic model, under the assumption that the astrophysics of star formation does not vary throughout the multiverse (Bousso & Leichenauer, 2009). Other semi-analytic work by Sudoh et al. (2017) showed that incorporating the astrophysics of galaxy formation in anthropic reasoning can affect the range of the anthropically favoured values of \Lambda by almost an order of magnitude. More recently, progress in numerical power has enabled the testing of anthropic reasoning with full hydrodynamical simulations, exploring the simulated past and future star formation history for a wide range of \Lambda (Barnes et al. 2018; Salcido et al. 2018; Oh et al. 2022). While such simulations include several astrophysical processes (albeit in an approximate parameterised form), it is hard to probe a wide parameter space, or to explore the far future of the universe (beyond \sim 100 Gyr cosmic time), without a massive commitment of computational resources. Analytic models of star formation therefore represent an attractive complementary approach, as they are not subject to the same limitations as hydrodynamical simulations. While inevitably simplified in terms of astrophysics, they are an efficient technique that can offer a more intuitive picture of the evolution of star formation (e.g. Rasera & Teyssier, 2006; Davé et al., 2012; Sharma & Theuns, 2019; Salcido et al., 2020; Fukugita & Kawasaki, 2022). Recently, Sorini & Peacock (2021) generalised the Hernquist & Springel (2003) model of cosmic star formation such that it can be applied to arbitrarily large times. In this work, we further adapt the Sorini & Peacock (2021) formalism to explore the impact of different values of \Lambda on past and future star formation. The main result of our study will be that values of \Lambda in the range 0.01\lesssim\Lambda/\Lambda_{\rm obs}\lesssim\Lambda_{\rm obs} maximise the global efficiency of star formation. However, the interesting question is how effectively star formation is truncated by large values of \Lambda. If this suppression is not effective until \Lambda is vastly beyond the observed value, then Weinberg’s flat prior will mean that the observed universe risks being an implausibly rare outlier. The main aim of this paper is to quantify just how unusual our universe is in this respect. This manuscript is organised as follows. In § 2 we give an overview of the formalism in Sorini & Peacock (2021), and improve it by introducing extra features. In § 3 we explain how we adapt it to \LambdaCDM models with arbitrary non-negative values of \Lambda and discuss the impact of changing the cosmological constant on the halo mass function and on the efficiency of star formation within haloes. In § 4 we present our predictions for the long-term efficiency of star formation for different values of \Lambda. In § 5 we discuss the implications of our results for anthropic reasoning. We mainly focus on the cosmological constant problem, but also marginally consider the why-now problem. We also compare our results with previous literature on the subject and discuss the limitations of our model. Finally, in § 6 we summarise the main conclusions of our work and discuss the future developments of our line of research. Throughout this work, unless otherwise indicated, units of distance are understood to be proper units. Co-moving units are designated with a ‘c’ prefix (e.g. ckpc, cMpc)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07290v1,The formation of multiples in small- subclusters,"We explore the relative percentages of binary systems and higher-order multiples that are formed by pure stellar dynamics, within a small subcluster of N stars. The subcluster is intended to represent the fragmentation products of a single isolated core, after most of the residual gas of the natal core has dispersed. Initially the stars have random positions, and masses drawn from a log-normal distribution. For low-mass cores spawning multiple systems with Sun-like primaries, the best fit to the observed percentages of singles, binaries, triples and higher-order systems is obtained if a typical core spawns on average between N= 4.3 and 5.2 stars, specifically a distribution of N with mean \mu_{{}_{N}}\sim 4.8 and standard deviation \sigma_{{}_{N}}\sim 2.4. This fit is obtained when \sim 50\% of the subcluster’s internal kinetic energy is invested in ordered rotation and \sim 50\% in isotropic Maxwellian velocities. There is little dependence on other factors, for example mass segregation or the rotation law. Whilst such high values of N are at variance with the lower values often quoted (i.e. N\!=\!1\;{\rm or}\;2), very similar values (N\!=\!4.3\pm 0.4 and N\!=\!4.5\pm 1.9) have been derived previously by completely independent routes, and seem inescapable when the observed distribution of multiplicities is taken into account.","Most field stars more massive than the Sun are not single (Whitworth & Lomax, 2015; Offner et al., 2023). They exist in multiple systems, i.e. gravitationally bound groups in which the individual stars are on more-or-less constant and stable orbits about one another. The most common multiple systems are binaries: two stars orbiting their mutual centre of mass on elliptical orbits. However, there is an increasing recognition that there are also many higher-order multiple systems in the field (and even more in regions of recent star formation , Chen et al. 2013). Stable, long-lived triple systems comprise two stars in a relatively close binary system with a third star on a significantly wider orbit about the binary. Quadruple systems come in two variants: ‘2+2’ quadruples comprise two relatively close binary systems on a wide orbit about one another; and ‘planetary’ quadruples comprise a triple system (as define above) with a fourth star on an even wider orbit about the triple. The highest-order multiples known are septuples. An example of a septuple is 65 UMa (11551+4629), in which a central binary is orbited not only by three companions on planetary orbits, but a distant binary pair as well (see Tokovinin 2021). A young subcluster comprising N stars may evolve into {\cal A}_{{}_{N}} possible end states, where {\cal A}_{{}_{N}} increases rapidly with N. For N\leq 10: \displaystyle\ {\cal A}_{{}_{N}}\!\! \displaystyle\!\!\!=\!\! \displaystyle\!\!\sum_{n=2}^{N}\!\left\{1+\sum_{n^{\prime}=2}^{n}\!\left\{% \vphantom{\sum_{n^{\prime\prime}=2}^{n^{\prime}-1}}\!\left\lfloor\frac{N\!-\!n% }{n^{\prime}}\right\rfloor\,+\,H(N\!-\!(n+n^{\prime}+2))\;\;\right.\right. (1) \displaystyle\!\!\hskip 85.35826pt\left.\left.\sum_{n^{\prime\prime}=2}^{n^{% \prime}-1}\left\lfloor\frac{N-(n+n^{\prime})}{n^{\prime\prime}}\right\rfloor% \right\}\right\}. Here \left\lfloor\;\right\rfloor is the floor operator, and H is the Heaviside function. Thus a subcluster with N=7 members can evolve into {\cal A}_{{}_{7}}=14 different end states, as enumerated in Section 3.1. A derivation and explanation of Equation 1 is given in Appendix A. 1.1 Observational perspective Recent advances in observational technology and capability have lead to the discovery of additional members in known star systems, and thereby greatly increased the inventory of higher-order multiples in the solar neighbourhood. When Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) studied the multiplicity of solar-type stars in a 22-pc sample, they found that only 5% hosted triple or higher order systems. For a 25-pc sample, Raghavan et al. (2010) found this percentage to be 13%, and it increased to 17% when Tokovinin (2021) and Hirsch et al. (2021) studied the sample in 2021. The Tokovinin (2021) statistics for nearby systems with solar-type primaries, in the field (hereafter the T21 sample), are \displaystyle\rm{S:B:T:Q^{+}} \displaystyle= \displaystyle 54:29:12:5\,. (2) Here S is the percentage of single stars, B the percentage of binaries, T the percentage of triples, and Q+ the percentage of quadruples plus higher-order systems (i.e. quintuples, sextuples and septuples). Thus, in this sample, the fraction of stars that are single is \displaystyle f_{{}_{\rm S}} \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{\rm S}{\rm S+2B+3T+4Q^{+}}\;\;\,\simeq\;\;\,32.1\%\,; (3) the fraction of stars that is in binaries is \displaystyle f_{{}_{\rm B}} \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{\rm 2B}{\rm S+2B+3T+4Q^{+}}\;\;\,\simeq\,\;\;34.6\%\,; (4) and the fraction that is in triples or higher order systems is \displaystyle f_{{}_{\rm T^{+}}} \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{\rm 3T+4Q^{+}}{\rm S+2B+3T+4Q^{+}}\;\;\,\simeq\,\;\;33.3\%\,. (5) These percentages should be qualified with two caveats. First, we have assumed that all the systems contributing to Q+ are quadruples. If account were taken of the systems that are quintuples, sextuples and septuples, f_{{}_{\rm T^{+}}} would increase slightly, at the expense of f_{{}_{\rm S}} and f_{{}_{\rm B}}. Second, although these percentages are uncertain, due to selection effects and observational bias, the expectation must be that in the future they will shift towards higher-orders, as additional members of existing systems are discovered. This will reduce f_{{}_{\rm S}}, and probably increase both f_{{}_{\rm B}} and f_{{}_{\rm T^{+}}}. Moreover, we should also note that, by construction, the stars in the T21 sample have masses M\lesssim{\rm M}_{{}_{\odot}}. Samples with higher-mass primaries tend to have even higher multiplicities than the T21 sample. For example, in the survey by Sana (2017) essentially all of the high-mass stars are members of higher-order systems. The systems we are considering here are presumed to be the product of low-mass cores of the sort that define the peak of the core mass function and are observed in nearby low-mass star formation regions. We should also be mindful that the multiplicities of stellar systems depend on their age. Reipurth & Zinnecker (1993) show that young populations tend to have higher multiplicities than their older counterparts. Indeed, multiplicity begins to decline even in the protostellar phase. Chen et al. 2013 show that the average multiplicity decreases as one progresses from Class 0, through Class I, to Class II protostars. 1.2 Theoretical perspective We shall assume that usually an observed multiple system with a solar-mass primary has formed from a single prestellar core. There are then two main mechanisms involved: (i) dynamical core collapse and fragmentation; and (ii) disk fragmentation. These two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, rather they tend to be sequential. 111We note that in the higher-mass cores that form more massive stars a third mechanism needs to be considered. These higher-mass cores are often fed by filamentary accretion streams that are sufficiently massive to form multiple systems by filament fragmentation. These multiples systems then fall into the monolithic cluster that is forming in the central hub, where they interact with other stars and systems. This is not the scenario we are considering here. In the standard paradigm for star formation, molecular clouds are highly turbulent, and in some regions the turbulence produces convergent flows of sufficient strength to produce self-gravitating sheets, filaments and cores. Unless it is rapidly dispersed by tidal forces or shear, a self-gravitating core collapses. And, unless it is very spherically symmetric and non-rotating, it is likely to fragment dynamically to produce a small subcluster of stars (e.g. Cha & Whitworth, 2003; Goodwin et al., 2004a; Fisher, 2004; Hennebelle et al., 2004; Goodwin et al., 2004a, b; Hubber & Whitworth, 2005; Stamatellos et al., 2007; Offner et al., 2010; Walch et al., 2012; Lomax et al., 2014, 2015a, 2015b, 2016; Rohde et al., 2021; Whitworth et al., 2024). This is ‘dynamical core collapse and fragmentation’. The resulting stars are usually attended by accretion discs, comprising material that has too much specific angular momentum to fall directly onto the central star. If such an accretion disc becomes sufficiently massive, extended and cold, it fragments to produce a secondary star or stars, in orbit around the primary (e.g. Adams et al., 1989; Chapman et al., 1992; Bonnell & Bate, 1994; Turner et al., 1995; Whitworth et al., 1995; Bhattal et al., 1998; Boffin et al., 1998; Watkins et al., 1998a, b; Stamatellos et al., 2007; Stamatellos & Whitworth, 2008, 2009a; Walch et al., 2009; Stamatellos & Whitworth, 2009b; Thies et al., 2010; Walch et al., 2010; Kratter et al., 2010; Stamatellos et al., 2011, 2012; Lomax et al., 2015a, b; Whitworth & Lomax, 2016; Di G. Sigalotti et al., 2023). This is ‘disc fragmentation’. Together, these mechanisms have been shown to produce young multiple systems of as many as seven stars (Lomax et al., 2016). 1.3 Previous related theoretical studies McDonald & Clarke (1993) have introduced the concept of dynamical biasing, which is the tendency for the more massive stars in a small-N subcluster to form a binary, and for the less massive ones to be ejected, thereby making the binary more tightly bound. In a second paper, McDonald & Clarke (1995) show that, if the stars in a small-N subcluster are attended by discs, the increased dissipation during close encounters reduces the effectiveness of dynamical biasing – i.e. the lower-mass stars have a better chance of ending up in a binary. It also increases the tendency to produce higher-order multiples. Kuruwita & Haugbølle (2023) have shown that the drag from the gas of the natal cloud can drive the inspiral of forming stars, bringing binaries closer together. This would harden them against dissolution and increase the proportion of higher-order multiples. Sterzik & Durisen (1998) have explored multiplicity in a cold, non-rotating, spherical distribution of N= 3, 4, or 5 stars. The stars have masses drawn from a Miller-Scalo distribution, and are evolved for 1000 crossing times, using an N-body code. At the end the multiplicities are \displaystyle\begin{array}[]{lcll}\rm{S:B:T}&=&47:47:6,&\rm{for}\;\,N=3;\\ \rm{S:B:T:Q}&=&63:29:6:1,&\rm{for}\;\,N=4;\\ \rm{S:B:T:Q^{+}}&=&70:19:9:1,&\rm{for}\;\,N=5.\\ \end{array} (9) Thus, increasing N increases the percentage of singles and reduces the percentage of binaries. Holman et al. (2013) have shown using purely statistical arguments that, if the shape of the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) is inherited from the shape of the prestellar Core Mass Function (CMF), then the observed increase in binary frequency with primary mass (e.g. Offner et al., 2023) requires that a prestellar core must typically spawn a subcluster of 4 to 5 stars. 1.4 Overview and plan In this work we extend the study of Sterzik & Durisen (1998) to larger numbers of stars, and to more general initial conditions. Although circumstellar discs and disc fragmentation are likely to be important, particularly for forming lower mass stars and close orbits, we limit consideration here to subclusters formed purely by dynamical core collapse and fragmentation, and neglect discs. Consequently our numerical experiments start with single discless stars, and all multiple systems are formed subsequently by energy-conserving gravitational interactions between point masses. The role of discs will be explored in a later paper. In Section 2 we describe our model for a small-N subcluster, and the procedures used to follow its evolution and to identify the resulting multiple systems. In Section 3 we analyse the results, and by comparing them with observations derive the best-fit parameters for a subcluster. In Section 4 we summarise the main conclusions. In Appendix A we derive Equation 1, and in Appendix B we show how the results can be re-scaled to represent subclusters of different initial mass and/or linear extent. In Table 1 we list the parameters used in this paper.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07289v1,Cosmography from accurate mass modeling of the lens group SDSS J0100+1818: five sources at three different redshifts,"Systems where multiple sources at different redshifts are strongly lensed by the same deflector allow one to directly investigate the evolution of the angular diameter distances as a function of redshift, and thus to learn about the geometry of the Universe. We present measurements of the values of the total matter density, \Omega_{\rm m}, and of the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, through a detailed strong lensing analysis of SDSS J0100+1818, a group-scale system at z=0.581 with five lensed sources, from z=1.698 to 4.95. We take advantage of new spectroscopic data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope to securely measure the redshift of 65 sources, including the five multiply imaged background sources (lensed into a total of 18 multiple images) and 19 galaxies on the deflector plane, all employed to build robust strong lensing models with the software GLEE. The total mass distribution of the deflector is described in a relatively simple way, and includes an extended halo, the brightest group galaxy (BGG) with a measured stellar velocity dispersion of (380.5\pm 4.4)\,$\mathrm{k}\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and fainter members. We measure \Omega_{\rm m}=0.14^{+0.16}_{-0.09} in a flat \Lambda cold dark matter (CDM) model, and \Omega_{\rm m}=0.19^{+0.17}_{-0.10} and w=-1.27_{-0.48}^{+0.43} in a flat wCDM model. Given the presence of different sources angularly close in projection, we quantify through a multi-plane approach their impact on the inferred values of the cosmological parameters. We obtain consistent median values, with uncertainties for only \Omega_{\rm m} increasing by approximately a factor of 1.5. Thanks to the remarkably wide radial interval where the multiple images are observed, ranging from 15 to 77 kpc from the BGG, we accurately measure the total mass profile and infer the stellar over total mass profile of the deflector. They result in a total mass of (1.55\pm 0.01)\times 10^{13} M⊙ within 50 kpc and a stellar over total mass profile decreasing from 45.6^{+8.7}_{-8.3}\% at the BGG effective radius to (6.6\pm 1.1)\% at R\approx 77 kpc. Our results confirm that SDSS J0100+1818 is one of the most massive (lens) galaxies known at intermediate redshift and one of the most distant candidate fossil systems. We also show that group-scale systems that act as lenses for \geq 3 background sources at different redshifts enable to estimate the values of the cosmological parameters \Omega_{\rm m} and w with an accuracy that is competitive with that obtained from lens galaxy clusters.","In the currently accepted \Lambda cold dark matter (CDM) scenario, the Universe is almost flat and expanding, and the expansion is accelerating (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999). The Universe is composed of baryons and dark matter (DM) for \approx 30\% (\Omega_{\rm m}\approx 0.3), and the cosmic acceleration is due to the remaining \approx 70\% (\Omega_{\Lambda}\approx 0.7), represented by the so-called dark energy. Our understanding of dark energy is very poor. We believe that it exerts a negative pressure, and it has an equation of state with w\approx-1, where w is defined as the ratio between pressure and energy density, p/\rho c^{2}. The \LambdaCDM model successfully describes the Universe at large scales (\gtrsim 1 Mpc), but presents difficulties in explaining some properties related to the formation of structures at smaller scales, like the sub-halo structures in galaxy clusters (Grillo et al. 2015; Meneghetti et al. 2020) and the value of the inner slope of DM halos (e.g., Gnedin et al. 2004; Newman et al. 2013a, b; Martizzi et al. 2012). Moreover, in extended cosmological models, currently available data cannot accurately measure the values of \Omega_{\rm m} and \Omega_{\Lambda}, and different models can be reconciled with the observations (e.g., Motta et al. 2021). This motivates the continuous investigation and testing of the \LambdaCDM model, through new projects and observations. In this context, the use of different and independent cosmological probes is crucial, as they are subject to different systematics and degeneracies. Thus, they can offer valuable help in investigating the current tensions in cosmology (Verde et al. 2019; Moresco et al. 2022). Strong gravitational lensing is an extremely powerful tool for extragalactic and cosmological studies (e.g., Bartelmann 2010; Treu 2010). Among the many applications, such as characterizing the total and DM mass distributions of clusters of galaxies (Acebron et al. 2022; Bergamini et al. 2023a; Granata et al. 2023) and galaxies (Vegetti et al. 2012; Schuldt et al. 2019; Ballard et al. 2024) acting as lenses, gravitational lensing can be used to probe the geometry of the Universe. Beside being particularly effective in measuring the value of the current expansion rate of the Universe (the Hubble constant, H_{0}) through the observations of multiply lensed variable sources, such as quasars or supernovae, both on galaxy and cluster scales (e.g., Refsdal 1964; Suyu et al. 2017; Grillo et al. 2018; Birrer et al. 2019; Grillo et al. 2020; Wong et al. 2020; Rusu et al. 2020; Shajib et al. 2023; Grillo et al. 2024), it also allows one to measure the values of \Omega_{\rm m}, w, and \Omega_{\rm k} (the latter parametrizing the curvature of the Universe, \Omega_{\rm k}=0 in a flat geometry), when kinematic data for lens galaxies are available (e.g., Grillo et al. 2008; Cao et al. 2012) or in systems where two or more sources are multiply imaged by the same deflector (Tu et al. 2009; Collett & Auger 2014; Tanaka et al. 2016; Smith & Collett 2021, and with clusters of galaxies). Massive clusters of galaxies can produce tens to hundreds of multiple images from several background sources and in the last decade they have been employed to measure the values of \Omega_{\rm m}, \Omega_{\Lambda}, w, and \Omega_{\rm k} (e.g., Jullo et al. 2010; Caminha et al. 2016, 2022; Grillo et al. 2024), also thanks to the advent of very deep Integral Field Spectroscopic (IFS) observations, that represent the most effective way to spectroscopically confirm and discover lensed sources. For instance, the number of spectroscopically confirmed multiple images lensed by the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 has increased, in less than 10 years, from 10 sources observed in 30 multiple images (Grillo et al. 2015) to 88 sources lensed into 237 multiple images (Bergamini et al. 2023b). Unfortunately, the total mass distribution of clusters of galaxies is usually very complex, and this requires several mass components to properly model it, whose parameters may be degenerate with the cosmological ones. On the other hand, galaxy-scale systems are in general easier to model and the lens can often be described with an effective single total mass profile, but the limited number of background sources makes them prone to be affected by the mass-sheet degeneracy (Schneider 2014). Galaxy or group-scale systems with a larger number (\geq 3) of lensed background sources might represent the best compromise between these two regimes to learn about the geometry of the Universe. They allow one to measure the values of \Omega_{\rm m} and w, independently of that of H_{0}, but only a few of these systems are known to date and are suitable for cosmological studies (e.g., Smith & Collett 2021). Their analysis, even individually, can offer competitive estimates of the cosmological parameter values, and will pave the way to the exploitation of a larger number of systems of this kind, that are foreseen to be discovered with Euclid and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory - Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) (Collett & Auger 2014; Li et al. 2024). In this paper, we extend the study published in Bolamperti et al. (2023) (hereafter, B23) on SDSS J010049.18+181827.7 (hereafter, SDSS J0100+1818), a strong lensing system (Fig. 1) included in the Cambridge And Sloan Survey Of Wide ARcs in the skY (CASSOWARY) survey (Belokurov et al. 2009; Stark et al. 2013) as a candidate fossil system at z=0.581 (Johnson et al. 2018b). In our previous work, we developed a strong lensing model of the system from the observed positions of the four multiple images of sources A and B (spectroscopically confirmed) and of the two multiple images of source C (with its redshift as a free parameter), and from the extended surface brightness distributions of the multiple images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. We employed the best-fit models to measure the cumulative total mass profile of the deflector, disentangle the DM and baryonic mass distributions, and to reconstruct the background sources. Now, we leverage on new data taken with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large telescope (VLT). These IFS observations allow us to measure the redshift of source C, discover two additional strongly lensed objects (E and F), spectroscopically confirm the group members in the MUSE field of view, and measure the stellar velocity dispersion profile of the brightest galaxy. We develop enhanced strong lensing models by including this information, that also allow us to measure the posterior probability distributions of the cosmological parameters \Omega_{\rm m} and w. Figure 1: HST F160W image of the SDSS J0100+1818 strong lensing system studied in this work. Letters label multiple images of the same background source. E and F do not show continuum in the HST image and the orange and brown crosses mark the position of their Ly\alpha emission line peaks, as detected with MUSE. The grey dashed circle represents an aperture of 50 kpc, the approximate average Einstein radius of the system. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we summarize the currently available data for SDSS J0100+1818, focusing on the MUSE data reduction and spectra extraction. In Section 3, we describe the SDSS J0100+1818 system, characterizing the multiply imaged sources A, B, C, E, and F (excluding D that is not a secure system), the deflector with its velocity dispersion profile, and the group members. In Section 4, we describe the enhanced strong lensing models developed and the relative results. In Section 5, we show the strong lensing models with variable values of the cosmological parameters \Omega_{\rm m} and w. We discuss the results in Section 6, and draw conclusions in Section 7. Unless differently specified, and in Section 5, throughout this work we assume H_{0}=70\,$\mathrm{k}\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{M}\mathrm{p}\mathrm{% c}^{-1}$, \Omega_{\rm m}=0.3 and \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7. In this model, 1 arcsec corresponds to a linear size of 6.585 kpc at the deflector redshift of z=0.581. All magnitudes are given in the AB system (Oke 1974) and are measured in the HST F160W filter, unless differently specified."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07108v1,Time-dependent metal ionization and the persistence of collisionally excited emission lines in the diffuse ionized gas of star forming galaxies,"We extend our time-dependent hydrogen ionization simulations of diffuse ionized gas to include metals important for collisional cooling and diagnostic emission lines. The combination of heating from supernovae and time-dependent collisional and photoionization from midplane OB stars produces emission line intensities (and emission line ratios) that follow the trends observed in the Milky Way and other edge-on galaxies. The long recombination times in low density gas result in persistent large volumes of ions with high ionization potentials, such as O iii and Ne iii. In particular, the vertically extended layers of Ne iii in our time-dependent simulations result in [Ne III] 15\mum/[Ne II] 12\mum emission line ratios in agreement with observations of the edge-on galaxy NGC 891. Simulations adopting ionization equilibrium do not allow for the persistence of ions with high ionization states and therefore cannot reproduce the observed emission lines from low density gas at high altitudes.","The diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in galaxies, a pervasive component of the interstellar medium (ISM), has been an active area of research interest following its initial detection in the Milky Way by Hoyle & Ellis (1963) and subsequent confirmation through \rm{H}\alpha observations (Reynolds et al., 1973). Extensive surveys have mapped the Milky Way and other galaxies in \rm{H}\alpha and collisionally excited emission lines, unveiling the characteristics of the DIG including its scaleheight, temperature, and ionization state (Haffner et al. (2003); Gaensler et al. (2008); Hill et al. (2008); Krishnarao et al. (2017)). A critical aspect for understanding the DIG involves identifying the mechanisms supporting and ionizing this gas at high altitudes, with many studies indicating the central role of supernovae and ionizing photons in driving galactic turbulence and outflows (de Avillez & Breitschwerdt (2005); Joung et al. (2009); Hill et al. (2012)). Massive O and B stars, with their substantial ionizing luminosity, are believed to be significant contributors to the ionization of the DIG (Reynolds (1990); Miller & Cox (1993); Dove & Shull (1994)). A possible additional source of ionization, particularly relevant at higher altitudes, is photoionization from hot low mass evolved stars (HOLMES). These stars, while less luminous than OB stars, are more numerous, exist at higher scale heights, and may contribute significantly to the DIG’s ionization state (Byler et al. (2019); Rand et al. (2011); Flores-Fajardo et al. (2011); Vandenbroucke & Wood (2019)). However, recent theoretical investigations adopting ionization equilibrium reveal that the support and structure of the DIG cannot be solely attributed to ionizing photons. For instance, Vandenbroucke & Wood (2019) showed that photoionization alone is insufficient to dynamically maintain the DIG densities observed. Similarly, in the simulations presented by Kado-Fong et al. (2020) the DIG layer displayed large fluctuations in density and scaleheight, and in general was simulated to have densities and scaleheights which are lower than observed in the Milky Way. In our preceding work, McCallum et al. (2024), we made progress towards understanding the ionization state of low density gas in the ISM. One of our key contributions was the development and application of a time-dependent ionization calculation. This approach marked a departure from our previous simulations that adopted ionization equilibrium, revealing the dynamic nature of ionization processes in the low density DIG where recombination times can be millions of years and often longer than the lifetimes of OB stars. We demonstrated that the low-density DIG is not in ionization equilibrium, but subject to fluctuations driven by the lifetimes of ionising sources and collisional ionization in gas heated by supernovae. These insights help to explain the ionization and spatial extent of DIG in the Milky Way and other galaxies. The success of our new simulations in producing the inferred density and scaleheight of DIG in the Milky Way provides a foundation for the work of this paper. By extending our time-dependent ionization calculations of hydrogen to a wider range of astrophysical metals, we will refine our understanding of the ionization and dynamics in the DIG. A persistent challenge in simulations of the DIG has been the production of the observed trends in emission line ratios such as [N II]/H\alpha, [S II]/H\alpha, [O III]/H\alpha, [Ne III]/[Ne II]. General trends are that the emission line ratios increase towards higher altitudes (lower density gas) in the Milky Way and other galaxies (Haffner et al. (1999); Rand et al. (2008); Jones et al. (2017); Levy et al. (2019)). Despite numerous efforts, radiation-hydrodynamic (rad-hydro) simulations have yet to self-consistently capture the observed trends. The most advanced rad-hydro simulations of the vertically extended ISM to date include those of the SILCC project (Walch et al. (2015); Rathjen et al. (2021); Rathjen et al. (2023)) and TIGRESS-NCR (Kim et al., 2023). While these simulations capture great detail on the dynamics of the ISM, star formation and feedback mechanisms, the ionization states of most metals are not tracked explicitly due to the added computational expense in otherwise highly detailed simulations. Because of this, calculation of emission line intensities can only be done through post-processing techniques which neglect the possibility that much of the high altitude gas may be out out of ionization equilibrium. Emission line intensities and their ratios are sensitive indicators of the ionization and thermal state of the gas, varying with altitude due to changes in density, temperature, and ionizing radiation fields. However, the assumption of ionization equilibrium may oversimplify these dynamic environments, where the availability of ionizing photons can vary faster than the gas is able to respond. As demonstrated by McCallum et al. (2024), regions where the recombination timescales are longer than the time-variability (or lifetimes) of the ionizing sources is where the equilibrium assumption becomes particularly problematic. The failure to self-consistently replicate the observed emission line trends suggests that we may be missing key aspects of the ionization processes in these regions. This work aims to address this gap by incorporating time-dependent metal ionization calculations, providing a more accurate representation of the ionization states. By doing so, we find insights into the mechanisms governing the ionization state of gas at various altitudes."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07084v1,"Revealing hidden structures in the Zone of Avoidance – a blind MeerKAT \textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}  Survey of the Vela Supercluster","We conducted the MeerKAT Vela Supercluster survey, named Vela-\textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}, to bridge the gap between the Vela SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (Vela-SMGPS, -2^{\circ}\leq b\leq 1^{\circ}), and optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the Vela Supercluster (hereafter Vela-OPT/NIR) at |b|\gtrsim 7^{\circ}. Covering coordinates from 263^{\circ}\leq\ell\leq 284^{\circ} and 1^{\circ}\leq b\leq 6.2^{\circ} above, and -6.7^{\circ}\leq b\leq-2^{\circ} below the Galactic Plane (GP), we sampled 667 fields spread across an area of {\sim}\rm 242~{}deg^{2}. With a beam size of {\sim}$$\times$$, Vela-\textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I} achieved a sensitivity of \langle\rm rms\rangle=0.74 \rm mJy\,beam^{-1} at 44.3 \rm km\,s^{-1} velocity resolution over {\sim}67 hours of observations. We cataloged 719 galaxies, with only 211 (29%) previously documented in the literature, primarily through the HIZOA, 2MASX, and WISE databases. Among these known galaxies, only 66 had optical spectroscopic redshift information. We found marginal differences of less than one channel resolution for all galaxies in common between HIZOA and Vela-SMGPS, and a mean difference of 70\pm 15 \rm km\,s^{-1} between optical and \textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I} velocities. Combining data from Vela-SMGPS, Vela-\textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}, and Vela-OPT/NIR confirmed the connection of the Hydra/Antlia filament across the GP and revealed a previously unknown diagonal wall at a heliocentric velocity range of 6500-8000 \rm km\,s^{-1}. Vela-\textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I} reinforces the connection between the first wall at 18500-20000 \rm km\,s^{-1} and the inner ZOA. The second wall seems to traverse the GP at 270^{\circ}\leq\ell\leq 279^{\circ}, where it appears that both walls intersect, jointly covering the velocity range 18500-21500 \rm km\,s^{-1}.","The recently discovered Vela Supercluster (hereafter VSCL) is of particular interest among the large-scale structures (LSS) bisected by the ZOA because of its close alignment with the apex of the residual bulk flow, which is expected to originate from distances beyond cz\geq 16000 \rm km\,s^{-1} (Springob et al., 2016; Scrimgeour et al., 2016), and even outside 20000 \rm km\,s^{-1} (200\,h^{-1} Mpc, Carrick et al. 2015; Boubel et al. 2024). As part of a wide-area campaign aiming to explore LSS along the entire 360∘ circle of the ZOA and learn more about the overall bulk flow, Kraan-Korteweg et al. 2017 (KK2017) pursued spectroscopic observations encompassing the region that contains the VSCL. The {\sim}4200 new redshifts revealed it as an extended massive overdensity with multibranching filaments (Einasto et al., 2011a). Its mass excess was estimated to contribute to {\sim}50 \rm km\,s^{-1} to the motion of the Local Group (LG). However, optical (OPT) and near-infrared (NIR) data provide hardly any data that allow the detailed mapping of its overdensity and surmised walls because of dust obscuration and high star density at latitudes below |b|<5^{\circ}. However, independent analyses using kinematic models have hinted at the presence of the dense core of VSCL deep within the ZOA (Sorce et al., 2017; Courtois et al., 2019). The results of a first extensive exploration of the VSCL using \textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I} data from the Vela-SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane survey (Vela-SMGPS) has proven to be highly successful (Rajohnson et al., 2024). The survey spans a region of 90 deg2 along a 3∘ latitude strip centered on \ell\sim 275^{\circ}. In total, 843 heavily obscured galaxies were identified. Following that project, we conducted a blind systematic interferometric survey referred to as the MeerKAT Vela Supercluster survey or Vela-\textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I} that will close the gap between Vela-SMGPS and OPT and NIR spectroscopic surveys. It covers an area of 263^{\circ}\leq\ell\leq 284^{\circ},|b|\lesssim 6.7^{\circ}, with its 667 pointings distributed both above and below the GP. The large survey area of {\sim}242\rm~{}deg^{2} aims to achieve the following three main objectives: (i) To cover the area that bridges the gap between Vela-SMGPS (Rajohnson et al., 2024), and ancillary data in the more transparent surroundings at latitudes |b|\gtrsim 7^{\circ}, where data availability is less scarce. These OPT and NIR data include published data from KK2017 (AAOmega+2dF+SALT), along with additional redshift data provided by OPTOPUS and 6dF in the Hydra/Antlia region that remain unpublished (Kraan-Korteweg, priv. comm). These data will henceforth be referred to as the Vela-OPT/NIR dataset. (ii) To combine the results obtained from Vela-\textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I} with those from Vela-SMGPS, encompassing various structures out to 25000 \rm km\,s^{-1}, to get a better census of the missing part of the VSCL walls at higher latitudes of the ZOA and to obtain an improved view of the extent of the VSCL and its morphology. (iii) In addition, the Vela-\textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I} will provide insight into nearby structures that were previously incompletely mapped or unknown. The paper is organized as follows. We present the observing strategy of Vela-\textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I} in Section 2. Section 3 delves into the techniques and steps employed for \textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I} data processing, such as data reduction, mosaic generation, and source identification. The results are presented in Section 4, accompanied by an assessment of the reliability of the extracted \textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I} galaxies and a comparison of properties with cross-matched data from other surveys, both \textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I} or multi-wavelength data. In Section 5, we explore the alignment of the newly discovered galaxies with known LSS and analyze the identified structures in combination with the Vela-SMGPS detections and galaxies adjacent to the Vela-\textrm{H}\,\scriptstyle\mathrm{I} survey region. A comprehensive summary of our findings is then provided in Section 6. Throughout this work, all velocities are in the heliocentric optical convention (V_{\rm hel}=cz). We adopt a standard cosmological model with H{}_{0}=70 \rm km\,s^{-1} Mpc-1, \Omega{\rm m}=0.3, and \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07080v1,Machine Learning Approach for Estimating Magnetic Field Strength in Galaxy Clusters from Synchrotron Emission,"Magnetic fields play a crucial role in various astrophysical processes within the intracluster medium, including heat conduction, cosmic ray acceleration, and the generation of synchrotron radiation. However, measuring magnetic field strength is typically challenging due to the limited availability of Faraday Rotation Measure sources. To address the challenge, we propose a novel method that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) alongside synchrotron emission observations to estimate magnetic field strengths in galaxy clusters. Our CNN model is trained on either Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence simulations or MHD galaxy cluster simulations, which incorporate complex dynamics such as cluster mergers and sloshing motions. The results demonstrate that CNNs can effectively estimate magnetic field strengths with median uncertainties of approximately 0.22\muG, 0.01\muG, and 0.1\muG for \beta=100, 200, and 500 conditions, respectively. Additionally, we have confirmed that our CNN model remains robust against noise and variations in viewing angles with sufficient training, ensuring reliable performance under a wide range of observational conditions. We compare the CNN approach with the traditional magnetic field strength estimates method that assumes equipartition between cosmic ray electron energy and magnetic field energy. Unlike the equipartition method, this CNN approach does not rely on the equipartition assumption, offering a new perspective for comparing traditional estimates and enhancing our understanding of cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms.","Magnetic fields play a pivotal role across a vast range of astrophysical scales, influencing phenomena from micro-scale cosmic ray transport and acceleration (Jokipii, 1966; Bell, 1978a; Yan & Lazarian, 2002; Bell, 2004; Bykov et al., 2012; Caprioli & Spitkovsky, 2014; Bonafede et al., 2014; Xu & Lazarian, 2022; Xu, 2022; Hu et al., 2022b), small-scale star formation (Mestel, 1965; Mac Low & Klessen, 2004; McKee & Ostriker, 2007; Lazarian et al., 2012; Federrath & Klessen, 2012; Burkhart & Mocz, 2019; Hu et al., 2021; Alina et al., 2022; Hu & Lazarian, 2023), to large-scale galaxy cluster evolution (Carilli & Taylor, 2002; Govoni & Feretti, 2004; Brunetti & Jones, 2014; Stuardi et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2024b). However, despite its significance, studying magnetic fields, particularly in the Intracluster Medium (ICM), remains notoriously challenging. Synchrotron emission and polarization serve as key diagnostic tools for estimating the equipartition magnetic field strength and for determining the magnetic field’s orientation within the plane-of-the-sky (POS), respectively (Rybicki & Lightman, 1986; Condon, 1992; Chevalier & Luo, 1994; Arshakian et al., 2009; Planck Collaboration et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019a; Hu et al., 2022a). These studies have significantly advanced our understanding, indicating that the typical magnetic field strength in the ICM is at the microgauss (\muG) level, with magnetic field correlations extending from a few kpc to hundreds of kpc (Govoni & Feretti, 2004; Beck & Krause, 2005; Brunetti & Jones, 2014; Stuardi et al., 2021). However, the assumption of equipartition between cosmic ray electrons and magnetic fields is poorly justified (Beck & Krause, 2005), and the utility of polarized synchrotron emission is often limited by depolarization effects. These include Faraday depolarization, which results from the presence of thermal electrons and turbulent magnetic fields along the line-of-sight (LOS), and beam depolarization, which arises from a randomized magnetic field distribution within the POS. Such depolarization challenges the use of this method in extensive cluster regions, such as radio halos (Govoni & Feretti, 2004; Stuardi et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2024b). On the other hand, the Faraday Rotation Measure (RM), derived from the rotation of a polarized source’s angle with wavelength, provides insights into the LOS magnetic field, weighted by the thermal electron density (Murgia et al., 2004; Melrose, 2010; Brentjens & De Bruyn, 2005). Nevertheless, this technique is often limited by the scarcity of radiation sources with well-defined properties, complicating detailed studies (Andrecut et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2020). Most astrophysical fluids are both magnetized and turbulent. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is anisotropic (Goldreich & Sridhar, 1995; Lazarian & Vishniac, 1999) and this induces the statistical anisotropy of the synchrotron emission (Lazarian & Pogosyan, 2012). The elongation direction can be used to probe the POS magnetic field orientation. Hu & Lazarian (2024a, b) further noticed that this anisotropy not only reflects the POS magnetic field but is also affected by the projection effect along the LOS, and the medium’s level of magnetization, defined as M_{A}^{-1}. Here M_{A}=\delta v_{\rm inj}\sqrt{4\pi\rho}/B is the Alfvén Mach number, with \delta v_{\rm inj} being turbulence injection velocity, \rho mass density, and B magnetic field strength. Hu & Lazarian (2024a) introduced the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs; LeCun et al. 1998) to extract the observed anisotropy in synchrotron emissions and thereby facilitate the measurement of 3D magnetic fields. In this paper, we aim to extend the CNN approach to estimate magnetic field strength using synchrotron emission. Hu & Lazarian (2024a) primarily retrieved the medium’s magnetization rather than its magnetic field strength. Schmaltz et al. (2024) extend the CNN approach to estimate the kinetic energy of turbulence, characterized by the sonic Mach number M_{s}=\delta v_{\rm inj}/c_{s}, where c_{s} is the sound speed. The product M_{A}^{-1}M_{s} thus gives the ratio of magnetic field energy and thermal kinetic energy. It suggests that the two Mach numbers contain information on magnetic field strength (Lazarian et al., 2022, 2024). Therefore, we aim to develop a CNN model to extract the strength information directly. Importantly, this approach does not assume equipartition between cosmic ray electrons and magnetic fields, allowing for a comparison with traditional equipartition estimates and providing insights into the cosmic ray acceleration mechanism. On the other side, the training of CNNs in Hu & Lazarian (2024a) was based on simulations of MHD turbulence and did not include complexities like cluster mergers, sloshing motions, or cooling and heating dynamics found in galaxy clusters, which could affect the validity of their model under realistic cluster conditions. In this work, we train the CNN model with either MHD turbulence simulations or numerical MHD galaxy cluster simulations from the Galaxy Cluster Merger Catalog (ZuHone et al., 2011, 2018). These cluster simulations feature three different initial plasma compressibilities (\beta=100,200,500) and include a dark matter subcluster passing near the center of a main cool-core cluster, mimicking systems like Perseus and Abell 2029. This paper is structured as follows: in § 2 we discuss the theoretical consideration that the morphology of synchrotron emission observation contains information on magnetic field strength. In § 3, we detail the MHD turbulence and galaxy cluster simulations, as well as the mock synchrotron observation, utilized in our study. § 4 briefly revisits the architecture of our CNNs and our training strategies. In § 5, we present the results derived from our numerical testing, offering insights into the efficacy and accuracy of the CNN model. § 6 delves into discussions surrounding the uncertainties and prospects of employing CNNs for observational analysis. We conclude with a summary of our findings in § 7."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07014v1,MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) XII. Rationale and design of a  survey of the cool circum-galactic medium with MUSE and UVES: The MEGAFLOW Survey,"We present the design, rationale, properties and catalogs of the MusE Gas FLOw and Wind survey (MEGAFLOW), a survey of the cool gaseous halos of z\simeq 1.0 galaxies using low-ionization Mg ii absorption systems. The survey consists of 22 quasar fields selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) having multiple (\geq 3) strong Mg ii absorption lines over the redshift range 0.3<z<1.5. Each quasar was observed with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) and the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES), for a total of 85 hr and 63 hr, respectively. The UVES data resulted in 127 Mg ii absorption lines over 0.25<z<1.6, with a median rest-frame equivalent width (REW) 3\sigma limit of \approx 0.05 Å. The MUSE data resulted in \sim2400 galaxies of which 1403 with redshift confidence ZCONF>1, i.e. more than 60 galaxies per arcmin2. They were identified using a dual detection algorithm based on both continuum and emission line objects. The achieved [O ii] 50% completeness is 3.7{}^{+0.8}_{-0.6}\times 10^{-18}erg s-1 cm-2 (corresponding to SFR>0.01 M⊙ yr-1 at z=1) using realistic mock [O ii] emitters and the 50% completeness is m_{F775W}\approx 26 AB magnitudes for continuum sources. We find that (i) the fraction of [O ii] emitting galaxies which have no continuum is \sim 15%; (ii) the success rate in identifying at least one galaxy within 500 km s-1 and 100 kpc is \approx 90% for Mg ii absorptions with \hbox{$W_{\rm r}^{2796}$}\gtrsim 0.5 Å ; (iii) the mean number of galaxies per Mg ii absorption is 2.9\pm 1.6 within the MUSE field-of-view; (iv) of the 80 Mg ii systems at 0.3<z<1.5, 40 (20) have 1 (2) galaxies within 100 kpc, respectively; (v) all but two host galaxies have stellar masses M_{\star}>10^{9} M⊙, and star-formation rates >1 M⊙ yr-1.","The circum-galactic medium (CGM) is the complex interface between the inter galactic medium and the galaxies themselves. Traditionally, the CGM describes the gas surrounding galaxies outside their disks or interstellar medium and inside their virial radii (Tumlinson et al., 2017). The CGM is the interface between the continuous fresh source of fuel coming from the IGM and star-formation driven outflows, often referred to as the baryon cycle (Péroux & Howk, 2020). As a result, the CGM ought to retain the kinematical (and/or enrichment) signatures of these processes. A significant amount of effort has been devoted to the study of galaxies close to QSO sight-lines to study the interplay between outflows and accretion. The idea of such a medium goes back to the detection of cold gas clouds toward stars at high Galactic latitudes (Spitzer, 1956). Soon after the discovery of the first quasars, Bahcall & Spitzer (1969) proposed that most of the absorption lines observed in QSO spectra were caused by gas in extended halos of normal galaxies. The most commonly used metal absorption in quasar spectra is the magnesium (Mg ii) \lambda\lambda 2796,2803 doublet, which is known to trace ‘cool’ (T\sim 10^{4} K) photo-ionized gas in and around galaxies since Bergeron & Boissé (1991); Bergeron et al. (1992); Bergeron et al. (1994); Steidel (1993) and Steidel et al. (1994). In the vicinity of galaxies, Mg ii absorptions are expected to occur in sightlines probing either outflows (as in Nestor et al., 2011) or accreting gas in extended gaseous disks (Fumagalli et al., 2011; Pichon et al., 2011; Kimm et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2013; DeFelippis et al., 2021). Strong Mg ii absorptions, with REW \hbox{$W_{\rm r}^{2796}$}>1 Å can also occur in groups (e.g. Kacprzak et al., 2010; Gauthier, 2013; Bielby et al., 2017) and weak Mg ii absorptions (\hbox{$W_{\rm r}^{2796}$}<0.1 Å) in the outskirts of clusters (e.g. Mishra & Muzahid, 2022). Thanks to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York et al., 2000), the detection of tens of thousands of Mg ii absorbers with \hbox{$W_{\rm r}^{2796}$}\gtrsim 0.5 Å (e.g. Nestor et al., 2005; Zhu & Ménard, 2013) have enabled statistical analyses (e.g. Bouché et al., 2006; Lundgren et al., 2009; Gauthier et al., 2009). As noted in Nestor et al. (2005) and subsequently , the REW W_{\rm r}^{2796} distribution is a double exponential, where the transition occurs at around \hbox{$W_{\rm r}^{2796}$}\simeq 0.5 Å indicating a transition between strong and weak Mg ii systems possibly related to different physical mechanisms. This is supported by the different redshift evolution of strong and weak Mg ii systems (Nestor et al., 2005). But, connecting the kinematics of the gas in/ouflow processes to the kinematics of the host galaxy requires one to be able to identify the host efficiently. The advent of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE Bacon et al., 2010) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) has revolutionised the study of the CGM thanks to its exquisite sensitivity and its field of view (FOV). As a result, a number of MUSE-based CGM surveys have been developed over the past few years such as QSAGE (Bielby et al., 2019), MUSEQuBES (Muzahid et al., 2020), CUBES (Chen et al., 2020), MAGG Lofthouse et al. (2020), and MUSE-ALMA (Péroux et al., 2019). This paper describes the rationale, design and properties of the MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) survey, a Mg ii-selected survey around 22 QSO fields. This paper is part of a series of 12 papers (Schroetter et al., 2016, 2019, 2021, 2024; Zabl et al., 2019, 2020, 2021; Wendt et al., 2021; Freundlich et al., 2021; Langan et al., 2023; Cherrey et al., 2024, 2025) and is organized as follows. In section § 2, we present the survey design and rationale. For each of the 22 quasar fields, we have MUSE observations (from 2 to 11hr) and obtained high-quality UVES spectra, as discussed in section 3. In § 4, we present the methods used to generate the catalogs of Mg ii absorbers and galaxies. In § 5, we describe the physical properties of the galaxies. In § 6, we present the main properties of the host galaxies. In § 7, we compare our sample to others. Conclusions are described in § 8. Throughout, we use a \Lambda cold dark matter (\LambdaCDM) model with \Omega_{M}=0.307, \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.693 and H_{0}=67 km s-1 Mpc-1 (‘Planck 2015’ Planck Collaboration et al., 2016). At the typical redshift of our survey z=1, 1^{\prime\prime} corresponds to 8.23 kpc. All magnitudes are in the AB system."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06993v1,WALLABY Pilot Survey: Gas-Rich Galaxy Scaling Relations from Marginally-Resolved Kinematic Models,"We present the first set of galaxy scaling relations derived from kinematic models of the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) pilot phase observations. Combining the results of the first and second pilot data releases, there are 236 available kinematic models. We develop a framework for robustly measuring H i disk structural properties from these kinematic models; applicable to the full WALLABY survey. Utilizing this framework, we obtained the H i size, a measure of the rotational velocity, and angular momentum for 148 galaxies. These comprise the largest sample of galaxy properties from an untargetted, uniformly observed and modelled H i survey to date. We study the neutral atomic Hydrogen (H i) size-mass, size-velocity, mass-velocity, and angular momentum-mass scaling relations. We calculate the slope, intercept, and scatter for these scaling relations and find that they are similar to those obtained from other H i surveys. We also obtain stellar masses for 92 of the 148 robustly measured galaxies using multiband photometry through the Dark Energy Sky Instrument Legacy Imaging Survey Data Release-10 images. We use a subset of 61 of these galaxies that have consistent optical and kinematic inclinations to examine the stellar and baryonic Tully Fisher relations, the gas fraction-disk stability and gas fraction-baryonic mass relations. These measurements and relations demonstrate the unprecedented resource that WALLABY will represent for resolved galaxy scaling relations in H i.","Galaxies present a wide spectrum of morphologies, sizes, and compositions (Hubble, 1926; de Vaucouleurs, 1959; Buta, 2013). Despite this diversity, galaxies show remarkable similarity in their underlying physical properties, as evidenced by the many observed scaling relations showing correlations between various galaxy properties, such as size, mass, and rotation velocity in disk galaxies. Such scaling relations point to physical laws governing galaxy formation and evolution. Given their importance, galaxy scaling relations have been studied in detail for many years (Faber & Jackson, 1976; Tully & Fisher, 1977; Fall & Efstathiou, 1980; Broeils & Rhee, 1997; Courteau et al., 2007; Hall et al., 2012; Kormendy & Ho, 2013; Stone et al., 2021; Arora et al., 2023, to name a few). There are many different scaling relations for disk galaxies, covering many different wavelengths. They include the various Tully Fisher Relations (TFR; Tully & Fisher 1977; McGaugh et al. 2000; Verheijen 2001; Hall et al. 2012; Lelli et al. 2016; Papastergis et al. 2016; Ponomareva et al. 2017; Lelli et al. 2019; Bradford et al. 2016; McQuinn et al. 2022; Arora et al. 2023), the H i size-mass relation (Broeils & Rhee, 1997; Verheijen, 2001; Swaters et al., 2002; Noordermeer et al., 2005; Begum et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2013), the size-velocity relation (Courteau et al., 2007; Dutton et al., 2007; Avila-Reese et al., 2008; Saintonge & Spekkens, 2011; Ouellette et al., 2017; Lapi et al., 2018; Meurer et al., 2018; Stone et al., 2021; Arora et al., 2023), the specific angular momentum-mass relation (Fall & Efstathiou, 1980; Romanowsky & Fall, 2012; Obreschkow & Glazebrook, 2014; Murugeshan et al., 2020; Kurapati et al., 2021; Mancera Piña et al., 2021a; Elson et al., 2023; Sorgho et al., 2024), and more (see Table 6 from Stone et al., 2021, for a summary of optical scaling relations). These different relations have provided a great deal of insight into galaxy structure and evolution. Measuring their slope and intercept constrains the relation between various physical parameters, while the scatter often highlights other processes that affect a galaxy. Measuring scaling relations requires high quality observations with well understood uncertainties. It also requires sufficiently large sample sizes to obtain statistically meaningful measurements. Ideally, these galaxies would come from a single survey with a known selection function. This enables straightforward extractions of physical relations as well as quantitative comparisons between the survey and simulations. However, it is also possible to combine observations from various surveys together to obtain a large enough sample for the science being investigated. But combining different surveys introduces additional complications to the analysis due to differing systematics in the combined sample. In H i this challenge is heightened due to the low resolution. Most scaling relations, such as the size-mass relation (Wang et al., 2016), require resolved observations, but the large H i surveys that have observed the H i content of the largest number of galaxies (Meyer et al., 2004; Giovanelli et al., 2005; Haynes et al., 2018), are single dish observations that do not resolve most of their detections. However, the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY; Koribalski et al. 2020) on the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) is changing this situation. WALLABY is an untargetted, nearly all-Southern sky H i survey that will detect \sim 2\times 10^{5} galaxies of which \sim 10^{4} will be resolved by 2-3+ resolution elements. This large sample makes WALLABY the premier survey to study the population-wide statistics of gaseous scaling relations. WALLABY observations are underway with the first pilot data release (PDR1; Westmeier et al. 2022) already public; containing \sim 600 galaxies and \sim 110 kinematic models (Deg et al., 2022). A second pilot data release (PDR2; Murugeshan et al. 2024) will contain an additional \sim 1800 galaxies and \sim 130 kinematic models. Taken together, the WALLABY pilot data releases (PDR) already have produced sample of 236 uniformly observed resolved galaxies. These have all been kinematically modelled using the WALLABY Kinematic Analysis Proto-Pipeline (WKAPP; Deg et al. 2022). Already, the WALLABY kinematic models are well suited to the study of scaling relations as they comprise the largest sample of untargetted, uniformly observed and analyzed H i disks available to date. However, this sample still poses unique challenges for scaling relation studies as the majority of the models are for marginally to moderately resolved galaxies. Extracting H i disk structural properties like the disk size with robust measures of the uncertainty from marginally resolved galaxies is not trivial. This work develops the framework for extracting robust H i disk structural properties and uncertainties from kinematic models of marginally resolved galaxies. It lays out a scalable approach that can be applied to the full WALLABY survey. Using the combined WALLABY PDR1 and PDR2 set of kinematic models (hereafter PDR), we obtain measures of the H i disk size, rotation velocity, and angular momentum. We combine them with H i mass measurements to construct the size-mass, size-velocity, mass-velocity, and angular momentum-mass relations. We also obtain stellar mass measurements allowing for the construction of the stellar TFR (sTFR), baryonic TFR (bTFR), the gas fraction-disk stability, and the gas fraction-baryonic mass relations. This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2, we present the details of the WALLABY observations and our methodology for calculating the galaxy properties. Then Sec. 3 examines scaling relations that depend only on the H i derived galaxy properties. Sec. 4 examines the sTFR and bTFR. And Sec. 5 examines the gas fraction-disk stability, and the gas fraction-baryonic mass relations. Finally Sec. 6 presents our discussion and conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06937v1,Investigating Differences in the Palomar-Green Blazar Population Using Polarization,"We present polarization images with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in A and B-array configurations at 6 GHz of 7 radio-loud (RL) quasars and 8 BL Lac objects belonging to the Palomar-Green (PG) ‘blazar’ sample. This completes our arcsecond-scale polarization study of an optically-selected volume-limited blazar sample comprising 16 radio-loud quasars and 8 BL Lac objects. Using the VLA, we identify kpc-scale polarization in the cores and jets/lobes of all the blazars, with fractional polarization varying from around 0.8\pm 0.3% to 37\pm 6%. The kpc-scale jets in PG RL quasars are typically aligned along their parsec-scale jets and show apparent magnetic fields parallel to jet directions in their jets/cores and magnetic field compression in their hotspots. The quasars show evidence of interaction with their environment as well as restarted AGN activity through morphology, polarization and spectral indices. These quasi-periodic jet modulations and restarted activity may be indicative of an unstable accretion disk undergoing transition. We find that the polarization characteristics of the BL Lacs are consistent with their jets being reoriented multiple times, with no correlation between their core apparent magnetic field orientations and pc-scale jet directions. We find that the low synchrotron peaked BL Lacs show polarization and radio morphology features typical of ‘strong’ jet sources as defined by Meyer et al. (2011) for the ‘blazar envelope scenario’, which posits a division based on jet profiles and velocity gradients rather than total jet power.","Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are highly energetic phenomena produced by the central supermassive black hole of a galaxy devouring the inflowing gas and dust (Rees, 1984; Rawlings & Saunders, 1991). This spiraling debris forms a rotating accretion disk that emits intense radiation due to frictional heating (Lynden-Bell, 1969; Bardeen, 1970). A fraction of these AGN also expel relativistic jets of synchrotron-emitting plasma orthogonal to the accretion disks and are bright at radio frequencies (Blandford & Rees, 1974). Radio-loud (RL) AGN have strong, large-scale jets and are defined as having their 5 GHz radio flux density at least 10 times greater than their optical B-band flux densities (Kellermann et al., 1989). These jets have the potential to significantly influence their host galaxy and surrounding environment, as they heat the intracluster medium (McNamara & Nulsen, 2007; Chang et al., 2012) and modulate star formation rates (Cattaneo et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2019). There are many observational sub-classifications of RL AGN and most can be explained through differences in viewing angles and beaming (Rees, 1966; Readhead et al., 1978). However, some delineations are independent of orientation. One such dichotomy is based on the appearance of two distinctive radio jet morphologies - Fanaroff and Riley type I and II (Fanaroff & Riley, 1974). The FRI jets are fainter, diffuse plumes whereas the FRII jets are brighter, highly collimated, and produce terminal hot spots when they impact the ambient medium (Blandford & Rees, 1974; Mingo et al., 2019). The underlying cause of the FR dichotomy continues to be a subject of much debate as is its initial correlation with the extended radio luminosity and subsequently jet power (Blackman & Lebedev, 2022). Potential explanations can be broadly categorized into intrinsic factors relating to differences in jet kinetic power arising from differences in black hole spins (Baum et al., 1995; Meier, 1999), accretion modes (Best & Heckman, 2012; Hardcastle, 2018), jet formation mechanisms (Blandford & Znajek, 1977; Blandford & Payne, 1982), or jet profile and particle compositions (Scheuer, 1974; Laing & Bridle, 2002; Croston et al., 2018) and extrinsic factors relating to jet-medium interaction such as jet decollimation due to turbulence-induced plasma flow instabilities (Bicknell, 1984; Laing & Bridle, 2002) and stellar mass loading (Komissarov, 1994; Wykes et al., 2015) or the fast deceleration of an initially supersonic jet due to interaction with a denser ambient medium (Biretta et al., 1995; Hardcastle et al., 2003). As per the radio-loud unification scheme (Urry & Padovani, 1995), RL quasars are the pole-on counterparts of FRII radio galaxies, and BL Lac objects are the pole-on counterparts of FRI radio galaxies. Collectively referred to as blazars, their jets are at small angles to our line-of-sight. Blazars were originally differentiated based on their optical spectra. BL Lacs have weak optical line emission compared to quasars, which are characterized by stronger optical line emission (equivalent widths >5Å; Stickel et al., 1991; Stocke et al., 1991). Given their high beaming and strong variability and no evidence of differences in beaming among the two classes, the BL Lacs are thought to be at similar angles to the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) (Ghisellini et al., 1993; Gabuzda et al., 2000). The steep spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs) and FSRQs both display broad (velocity widths \geq 1000 km s-1) emission lines in their optical/UV spectra. Given that the half-opening angle of the dusty obscuring tori is \leq 50\arcdeg (Simpson et al., 1996), their jets are assumed to be inclined at angles \leq 50\arcdeg to our lines of sight. The SSRQ and FSRQ are therefore progressively more aligned versions of FR II galaxies (Barthel, 1989). BL Lacs are also characterized by systematically lower apparent jet speeds compared to FSRQs at parsec scales (Ghisellini et al., 1993; Gabuzda et al., 2000; Kellermann et al., 2004) which given their similar orientations suggests a difference in the actual intrinsic velocities of relativistic bulk motion. With polarimetric Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations, differences in the apparent magnetic (B-) fields among the parsec-scale jets of the two blazar classes have been found (Gabuzda et al., 1992; Cawthorne et al., 1993). BL Lacs tend to have their parsec-scale electric vector position angle (EVPA) parallel to the jet direction whereas RL quasars tend to show a perpendicular relative orientation (Lister & Homan, 2005; Lister et al., 2013). The inferred B-field structures are perpendicular to the EVPAs for optically thin 111The optical thickness required to change the inference of B-field direction is considered to be \tau\sim 7 (Cawthorne & Hughes, 2013; Wardle, 2018) emission (Pacholczyk, 1970), so this would mean that the BL Lacs show a predominance of jet B fields orthogonal to the jet direction while quasars primarily show jet B fields along the jet direction. One explanation for such a B-field structure could be the tightness or looseness of the helical magnetic fields in BL Lacs and quasars respectively (e.g., Gabuzda, 2015). Blazars are also subcategorized based on their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) into high-, intermediate-, and low-spectrally peaked based on the position of their synchrotron peak frequency (Abdo et al., 2010; Padovani & Giommi, 2015). Contradicting the notion of the FR dichotomy, several studies have found a broad continuum in parameters such as synchrotron peak frequencies and spectral indices (Giommi & Padovani, 1994; Sambruna et al., 1996). Notably, Fossati et al. (1998) found an anti-correlation between the luminosity and frequency of the synchrotron peak. This anti-correlation, now referred to as the ‘blazar sequence’, implies that the total jet power is the only parameter informing the spectral type and broadband SED characteristics of an AGN. Later studies by Ghisellini et al. (2017) found the sequence to exist for the BL Lac objects but not for the quasars, which was interpreted as a sequence of radiative cooling due to the presence of the broad line region (BLR) and the dusty torus in the case of quasars. More recent work by Meyer et al. (2011) and Keenan et al. (2021) have given rise to the ‘blazar envelope’ picture. Under this scenario, a range of progressively misaligned but intrinsically different ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ jets are hosted by sources with inefficient accretion and low-excitation spectral lines or efficient accretion and high-excitation spectral lines, respectively. The FRII radio galaxies and quasars have ’strong’ jets and so do low-synchrotron-peaked (LSP) BL Lacs whereas FRI radio galaxies and high-synchrotron-peaked (HSP) BL Lacs have ’weak’ jets with intermediate-synchrotron-peaked (ISP) BL Lacs coming from a mixed population. Low to moderately high jet power is generated by either type of jet but extreme high-power jets are exclusively ’strong’ jet sources. Given that high- and low-excitation radio galaxies both exhibit FRI and FRII morphologies (Best & Heckman, 2012; Mingo et al., 2022) and the fact that hybrid morphology sources exist, it implies that the environment may play a larger role in determining the radio morphology. Beaming and light travel time differences between the two lobes may also cause an intrinsically FRII source to look like a hybrid source (Kharb et al., 2015; Gopal-Krishna et al., 1996; Harwood et al., 2020; Ghosh et al., 2023). Given the complexity of these classifications and their interrelated nature, we aimed to disentangle the base causes of these differences in jet profiles. Since FRI jets decelerate and de-collimate on kpc-scales (Bicknell, 1994; Laing & Bridle, 2002) and magnetic fields play a critical role in bulk acceleration and jet propagation (Meier et al., 2001; Hawley et al., 2015), kpc-scale radio polarimetric observations form an important means of investigating the differences in jet characteristics. Blazars with their higher total and polarized flux densities, form ideal candidates to investigate both the FR dichotomy as well as the blazar divide. With this in mind, we set out to investigate the differences in blazars using kpc-scale polarization with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). Our objective was to investigate whether the differences in polarization among the blazar subclasses at the parsec-scale persist till the kiloparsec scale. We also aim to increase the number of high-sensitivity kpc-scale images of BL Lacs, which are currently in short supply compared to quasars (Giroletti et al., 2006). This paper is a continuation of our study of the Palomar-Green (PG) sample (Green et al., 1986) of blazars (Baghel et al., 2023, 2024). Results from uGMRT Band-4 (650 MHz) data for the PG BL Lac objects were presented in Baghel et al. (2024), while VLA C-band (6 GHz) B-array data for nine out of 16 quasars was presented in Baghel et al. (2023). In this paper, we present the VLA polarization images for the remaining RL quasars and all BL Lac objects (see Table 1) to study the kpc-scale B-field structures of the entire PG ‘blazar’ sample. The sample selection is discussed briefly in Section 2. The radio data reduction and calibration and imaging details are presented in Section 3. Our observational results are discussed in Section 4 along with a brief discussion on existing literature on the sources. In Section 5 we present the global correlations for the entire PG ‘blazar’ sample. Section 6 discusses our findings, and Section 7 provides our conclusions. Throughout this paper we have adopted a \LambdaCDM cosmology with \mathrm{H_{0}=73~{}km~{}s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}, \mathrm{\Omega_{m}=0.3} and \mathrm{\Omega_{v}=0.7} and used flat \LambdaCDM subroutine of astropy.cosmology subpackage (Astropy Collaboration et al., 2013, 2018). The spectral index \alpha is defined such that flux density at frequency \nu, S_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\alpha}."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06813v1,A spatially-resolved spectral analysis of giant radio galaxies with MeerKAT,"In this study we report spatially resolved, wideband spectral properties of three giant radio galaxies (GRGs) in the COSMOS field: MGTC J095959.63+024608.6 , MGTC J100016.84+015133.0 and MGTC J100022.85+031520.4. One such galaxy MGTC J100022.85+031520.4 is reported here for the first time with a projected linear size of 1.29 Mpc at a redshift of 0.1034. Unlike the other two, it is associated with a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), making it one of the few GRGs known to inhabit cluster environments. We examine the spectral age distributions of the three GRGs using new MeerKAT UHF-band (544-1088 MHz) observations, and L-band (900-1670 MHz) data from the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey. We test two different models of spectral ageing, the Jaffe-Perola and Tribble models, using the Broadband Radio Astronomy Tools (brats) software which we find agree well with each other. We estimate the Tribble spectral age for MGTC J095959.63+024608.6 as 68 Myr, MGTC J100016.84+015133.0 as 47 Myr and MGTC J100022.85+031520.4 as 67 Myr. We find significant disagreements between these spectral age estimates and the estimates of the dynamical ages of these GRGs, modelled in cluster and group environments. Our results highlight the need for additional processes which are not accounted for in either the dynamic age or spectral age estimations.","Giant radio galaxies (GRGs) display jets and lobes of sychrotron-emitting plasma that extend greater than 700 kpc in projected linear length, representing the most extended population of radio galaxies (Willis et al. 1974; Schoenmakers et al. 2000; Dabhade et al. 2023). Their extensive relativistic jets and lobes may play an important role in the evolution of their host galaxy and surrounding environment via ‘jet-mode’ active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback (Bower et al., 2006; Croton et al., 2006; Fabian, 2012; Heckman & Best, 2014). In this mode of feedback, the AGN plasma jets travel through the inter-stellar medium (ISM), disturbing and heating the surrounding gas. This is thought to prevent gas cooling and stop accretion onto the super massive black hole (SMBH), halting its growth. In GRGs, since the jets are so large, this process extends further into the intergalactic and intercluster medium (IGM and ICM). Thus, GRGs could be ideal probes of the impact of AGN activity on the IGM and may provide insight into the nature of the environment itself. (Safouris et al., 2008, 2009; Malarecki et al., 2013, 2015) The reason for the really large sizes of GRGs is still uncertain. An early suggestion was made by Mack et al. (1998) that the extended size of GRGs is due to the under-densities found within the IGM where the speed of the plasma is not as eroded by interactions with intervening matter. However, recent studies have reported that between 4-10% of identified GRGs reside within high-density cluster environments (Dabhade et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Simonte et al., 2024). Another potential explanation for the occurrence of GRGs is that these galaxies contain abnormally powerful AGN engines which allow the jets to expand to large scales in short amounts of time (Gopal-Krishna et al., 1989). Counter to this, Komberg & Pashchenko (2009) and Hardcastle et al. (2019) found no evidence of the massive linear size of GRGs being due to particularly powerful central engines. A more likely scenario then is that GRGs represent the oldest AGN systems, where the radio jets have had enough time to evolve and grow (Subrahmanyan et al., 1996). This scenario was previously thought to be implausible because the extrapolated number densities of GRGs as of 2021 were too low; only \sim820 had been identified compared to the hundreds of thousands of reported normal radio sources (Dabhade et al., 2020). However, recent work (e.g., Delhaize et al. 2021; Simonte et al. 2024; Oei et al. 2023; Mostert et al. 2024) suggests that the actual GRG sky density is significantly higher than indicated by previous studies. These works suggest that the surface brightness sensitivity of telescopes was actually the limiting factor, since these giants are often faint and diffuse. According to Simonte et al. (2024), who performed a large-scale study of the radio, optical, and infrared properties of GRGs compared to regular radio galaxies, age is the main factor determining a radio galaxy’s length. Given enough time for the galaxy to evolve, the other main factors in the late-stage size of a radio galaxy are the jet power, the host galaxy mass, and the large-scale environment. If GRGs do represent the oldest AGN systems, then studying their extended structure is crucial to understanding the evolution of galaxies, their interactions, and their effect on the IGM. This is now becoming feasible, with the number of identified GRGs increasing dramatically in the last couple of years. The most notable of these is due to the second data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LOTSS-DR2, Shimwell et al. 2022) and the work of Mostert et al. (2024), increasing the total number of identified GRGs in the literature to \sim 12000. Complementary to LOFAR, which operates at \sim144 MHz, the MeerKAT radio interferometer in South Africa (Jonas & MeerKAT Team, 2016) is an excellent instrument for the study of GRGs at higher frequencies (\sim 1 GHz). This is due to its excellent point source sensitivity, similar resolution capabilities, and excellent uv coverage. It can currently observe in three different bands: the UHF (544-1088 MHz) and L (856-1670 MHz) bands, as well as the newly commissioned S (1750-3500 MHz) band. One of the Large Survey Projects underway with MeerKAT is the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey (Jarvis et al., 2016). MIGHTEE is a sensitive galaxy evolution survey over 20 deg2, targeting the fields CDFS, ELAIS-S1, XMM-LSS and COSMOS in the L and S bands. L-band continuum maps of part of the XMM-LSS and COSMOS field have already been released to the public as part of the Early Science data release (ES) (Heywood et al., 2022). These maps are confusion limited at a rms value of \sim 4.5 \muJy beam-1 . Two GRGs MGTC J095959.63+024608.6 (hereafter GRG1) and MGTC J100016.84+015133.0 (hereafter GRG2) were discovered in the MIGHTEE-COSMOS field in the ES data release and presented by Delhaize et al. (2021). If we wish to probe the physical processes underlying GRGs and their impact on the surrounding environment, we need to measure the timescales or ‘ages’ involved. One way to do this is by examining the radio continuum spectrum of the GRGs to determine their spectral ages. In general, the optically thin radio spectrum can be described by a power law S_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-\alpha} where the slope \alpha is the spectral index. The spectral index of the radiation is dependent on the source of the radiation, the environment, the physical processes involved and the timescales over which they occur. At frequencies close to \sim1 GHz, the continuum emission is affected by synchrotron losses (Harwood et al., 2013), inverse Compton scattering (Blundell et al., 1999) and adiabatic losses (Blundell & Rawlings, 2000), though the effects of adiabatic losses are not well constrained. If the spectrum is taken to be dominated by synchrotron emission processes, then the lifetime t of an electron is inversely proportional to its energy and the perpendicular component of the magnetic field, i.e. t\propto(EB_{\perp}^{2})^{-1}. Thus, higher-energy electrons will lose their energy at a faster rate, which results in a ‘steeper’ spectrum in regions of older plasma (e.g. Blundell & Rawlings 2000; Harwood et al. 2015) . This allows an estimate of the spectral ages of the plasma, where age is defined as the time since the plasma was last injected with newly accelerated particles. Creating a spatially resolved spectral age map of a source allows us to see in detail the dynamics and evolution of the source and how it has interacted with the environment over time. For normal sized radio galaxies, previous studies have found that \alpha steepens with increased linear size and that, except at high frequencies, the rest frame spectral indices have a stronger dependence on luminosity than redshift (Blundell et al., 1999; Dabhade et al., 2020). The spectral index is expected to steepen in the lobes away from the hotspot as electrons are accelerated at the jet termination shock. This trend is expected to extend to GRGs. Confirmation of this is an important aspect of this work, which serves as a pilot study for the spectral analysis of a larger sample of GRGs in MIGHTEE. In this work, we combine MIGHTEE L-band data with new MeerKAT UHF-band observations to investigate the activity and history of the diffuse emission in the jets of the MIGHTEE COSMOS GRGs via the use of spectral age models. Furthermore, a newly identified third GRG found within the UHF COSMOS region is also examined. In section 2 we discuss the data processing of the multi-band data and in sections 3 and 4.1 we discuss our analysis of our results. The conclusions of the analysis are summarized in section 5. Throughout this paper, we assume a \LambdaCDM cosmology of H_{0} = 67.8 km s-1Mpc-1, \Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.692 and \Omega_{M} = 0.308 (Planck Collaboration et al., 2016)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06795v1,Dwarf Galaxies in the MATLAS Survey: The satellite system of NGC 474 under scrutiny with MUSE,"A recent study of the distribution of dwarf galaxies in the MATLAS sample in galaxy groups revealed an excess of flattened satellite structures, reminiscent of the co-rotating planes of dwarf galaxies discovered in the local Universe. If confirmed, this lends credence to the plane-of-satellite problem and further challenges the standard model of hierarchical structure formation. However, with only photometric data and no confirmation of the satellite membership, the study could not address the plane-of-satellite problem in full detail. Here we present spectroscopic follow-up observations of one of the most promising planes-of-satellites candidates in the MATLAS survey, the satellite system of NGC 474. Employing MUSE at the VLT and full spectrum fitting, we studied 13 dwarf galaxy candidates and confirmed nine to be members of the field around NGC 474. Measuring the stellar populations of all observed galaxies, we find that the MATLAS dwarfs have lower metallicities than the Local Group dwarfs at given luminosity. Two dwarf galaxies may form a pair of satellites based on their close projection and common velocity. Within the virial radius, we do not find a significant plane-of-satellites, however, there is a sub-population of six dwarf galaxies which seem to be anti-correlated in phase-space. Due to the low number of dwarf galaxies, this signal may arise by chance. With over 2000 dwarf galaxy candidates found in the MATLAS survey, this remains an intriguing data set to study the plane-of-satellites problem in a statistical fashion once more follow-up observations have been conducted.","The arrangement and movement patterns of dwarf galaxies surrounding both the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy have ignited a continuous debate regarding their compatibility with the prevailing \Lambda+Cold Dark Matter (\LambdaCDM) standard cosmological model (e.g., Kroupa et al., 2005; Libeskind et al., 2007; Pawlowski & Kroupa, 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Ibata et al., 2014b; Gillet et al., 2015; Cautun et al., 2015a, b; Buck et al., 2016; Fernando et al., 2017; Pawlowski, 2021; Sales et al., 2022; Santos-Santos et al., 2023; Sato & Chiba, 2024; Gámez-Marín et al., 2024). Numerous studies over five decades (e.g., Lynden-Bell 1976; McConnachie & Irwin 2006; Koch & Grebel 2006; Metz et al. 2008; Pawlowski et al. 2012; Ibata et al. 2013; Conn et al. 2013; Sohn et al. 2020; Taibi et al. 2024; Júlio et al. 2024) have explored these observations, with a particular focus on the satellite systems’ structure and kinematics. Today, this debate has been dubbed the plane-of-satellites problem, and in short describes that the dwarf galaxies are arranged in thin, planar-like structures, in which they seem to co-orbit around their host galaxies (see Pawlowski 2018, 2021 for reviews). This is in stark contrast to the more pressure supported halos found in cosmological simulations. Satellite systems are pivotal tests of \LambdaCDM, as their dynamics are primarily governed by gravitational forces on scales of hundreds of kiloparsecs, mostly unaffected by internal baryonic processes (Pawlowski, 2018; Müller et al., 2018a). Consequently, numerous research teams have extended their investigations beyond the Local Group, exploring analogous structures. Beyond the Local Group, claims of flattened distributions have been proposed around several giant galaxies (Chiboucas et al., 2013; Müller et al., 2017, 2018b, 2024; Martínez-Delgado et al., 2021; Paudel et al., 2021; Crosby et al., 2023; Mutlu-Pakdil et al., 2024; Karachentsev & Kroupa, 2024; Pawlowski et al., 2024). The best studied of these is the lenticular galaxy Cen A and its satellite system, which exhibits a statistically significant correlation in phase-space (Tully et al., 2015; Müller et al., 2016, 2018a, 2019, 2021b; Kanehisa et al., 2023). Intriguingly, these flattened structures often align with the local cosmic web, suggesting a potential common formation scenario for such configurations (Libeskind et al., 2015, 2019; Müller et al., 2024). While many surveys target individual galaxies, the Mass Assembly of early-Type GaLAxies with their fine Structures (MATLAS, Duc et al. 2015; Bílek et al. 2020) survey observed a total of 180 early type galaxies in the nearby universe employing MegaCam at CFHT to a limiting surface brightness magnitude of \approx28.5 mag/arcsec2. Over 2000 dwarf galaxies were discovered surrounding these giants (Habas et al., 2020; Poulain et al., 2021), enabling the statistical analysis of their satellite systems. From a subsample of 119 satellite systems, Heesters et al. (2021) identified a statistically significant population of 31 flattened dwarf structures, based on their on-sky positions. This analysis, however, could not take into account any velocity trend, because the necessary observations were not available at the time. It is a time consuming task to get spectroscopy of the mostly quiescent dwarf galaxies, needing 8m class telescopes and long exposures (e.g., Danieli et al., 2019; Müller et al., 2020; Heesters et al., 2023; Ferré-Mateu et al., 2023), and to complete a full dwarf satellite system requires hours of dedicated observations. A further issue in the analysis of the MATLAS fields was that most of the dwarf galaxy candidates did not have a confirmed membership status, meaning that the measurement of the flattening was based on the assumption that all candidates were satellites of the central galaxy. This may not be the case, as Heesters et al. (2023) showed that only 75% of a subsample of 56 MATLAS dwarf galaxy candidates were confirmed to be actual members of their putative hosts through follow-up observations. This implies that the identified flattened structures in Heesters et al. (2021) can have spurious members and the observed satellite distribution may change depending of membership confirmation/rejection. In this paper, we present the first follow-up observation of an almost complete satellite system in the MATLAS survey, around the iconic NGC 474 galaxy, employing the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument mounted at the Very Large Telescope in Chile. We analyze the dwarfs by full spectrum fitting, which yields velocities, stellar metallicities and ages, and discuss the phase-space distribution of the satellite system in detail."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06698v1,Discovery of a Unique Close Quasar-DSFG Pair Linked by a [C II] Bridge at z=5.63,"We report the discovery of a unique quasar-dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) system at z=5.63, consisting of the bright quasar J1133+1603 (M_{\rm UV}=-27.42) and its compact, dust-obscured companion, J1133c. ALMA observations reveal a prominent [C II] bridge connecting the quasar and DSFG, indicating ongoing interaction at a projected separation of 1.8″ (\sim10 proper kpc). J1133c exhibits unusually bright and broad [C II] emission (L_{\rm[CII]}>10^{43}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}, \rm FWHM>500\,\rm km\,s^{-1}), with a [C II] luminosity five times that of the quasar, suggesting intense star formation or potential AGN activity. The inferred star formation rate from [C II] is approximately 10^{3}M_{\odot}\rm yr^{-1}. The remarkable properties of this pair strongly suggest that galaxy interactions may simultaneously trigger both starburst and quasar activity, driving rapid evolution in the early universe.","Mergers are considered significant triggers of quasar activity and star formation, with up to 50% of luminous high-redshift quasars linked to major mergers (e.g., Di Matteo et al., 2005; Hopkins et al., 2006; Decarli et al., 2017). High-redshift quasar-dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG), quasar-quasar, and quasar-submillimeter galaxy (SMG) pairs (e.g., Lee et al., 2019; Izumi et al., 2024; Decarli et al., 2019) are rare but essential for studying galaxy-quasar co-evolution during the reionization epoch. Such systems typically reside in dense environments where interactions profoundly impact both star formation and black hole growth, as seen in SMGs and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) (e.g., Alexander et al., 2005, 2008; Umehata et al., 2015). The [C II] 158\mum line can trace star formation and gas dynamics, offering insights into interstellar medium properties of AGNs and star-forming galaxies (e.g., Stacey et al., 1991; Lagache et al., 2018). The quasar-DSFG pair reported here, connected by a [C II] bridge, provides a unique opportunity to explore the effects of such interactions on the growth of massive galaxies. Similar [C II] bridges have been noted in other high-redshift systems, indicating active gas flows between interacting galaxies (e.g., Ginolfi et al., 2020; Umehata et al., 2021). This work uses the Planck18 cosmology (Planck Collaboration et al., 2020) for luminosity calculations."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06594v1,Power Spectra of JWST images of Local Galaxies: Searching for Disk Thickness,"JWST/MIRI images have been used to study the Fourier transform power spectra (PS) of two spiral galaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 5236, and two dwarfs, NGC 4449 and NGC 5068, at distances ranging from 4 to 10 Mpc. The PS slopes on scales larger than 200 pc range from -0.6 at 21\mum to -1.2 at 5.6\mum, suggesting a scaling of region luminosity with size as a power law with index ranging from 2.6 to 3.2, respectively. This result is consistent with the size-luminosity relation of star-forming regions found elsewhere, but extending here to larger scales. There is no evidence for a kink or steepening of the PS at some transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional turbulence on the scale of the disk thickness. This lack of a kink could be from large positional variations in the PS depending on two opposite effects: local bright sources that make the slope shallower and exponential galaxy profiles that make the slope steeper. The sources could also be confined to a layer of molecular clouds that is thinner than the HI or cool dust layers where PS kinks have been observed before. If the star formation layers observed in the near-infrared here are too thin, then the PS kink could be hidden in the broad tail of the JWST point spread function.","The power spectrum (PS) of interstellar gas emission reveals the relative importance of structures and their luminosities over a wide range of scales, as measured by the Fourier transform wavenumber, k, which is the inverse of length. An important signature originally observed in the LMC (Elmegreen et al., 2001; Block et al., 2010), M33 (Combes et al., 2012), and the dwarf galaxy NGC 1058 (Dutta et al., 2009a) is the transition from two to three dimensions at wavenumbers exceeding the inverse disk thickness. Numerical simulations confirm this signature (Padoan et al., 2001; Bournaud et al., 2010; Combes et al., 2012), which is shown schematically in Figure 1. With such a signature in the power spectrum, the thicknesses of face-on galaxies can be inferred and mapped, as recently demonstrated for the LMC (Szotkowski et al., 2019). Thickness can be important, for example, in converting gas surface density into volume density for determination of the local gas free-fall time (Bacchini et al., 2020), or for correcting an observed rotation curve for radial pressure gradients in order to assess the distribution and amount of dark matter (Verbeke et al., 2017). Figure 1: Schematic of the PS of a galaxy disk with a shallow slope at small wavenumber k, from 2D turbulence, representing large scales, and a larger slope at large k from 3D turbulence. The dip at high k from the point spread function is also shown. Equations 2 and 3 in Koch et al. (2020) were used. The explanation for the change in PS slope at the size scale of the disk thickness was illustrated in Bournaud et al. (2010) and Fensch et al. (2023) as the result of three components of turbulent velocity producing structure on small scales and two components of velocity producing structure on large scales. Turbulent energy is also dispersed into a larger volume of phase space in 3D than in 2D, making the energy cascade steeper in 3D. To see the disk thickness in a PS, the spatial resolution of the galaxy has to exceed the disk thickness by an order of magnitude or more. Then the slope of the steeper PS at high k can be distinguished from the slope of the shallower PS at low k. The ratio of the galaxy size to the thickness should also exceed a factor of \sim 10, so there is another order of magnitude at small k, i.e., on lengths larger than the thickness. These two constraints are somewhat incompatible for a given angular resolution, because galaxies close enough to resolve for the first constraint tend to be dwarfs, which are also typically too thick (van den Bergh, 1988) to satisfy the second constraint. A third requirement to see disk thickness in a PS is that the emission should come from sources that are related to correlated motions such as interstellar turbulence, and not thermal motions as in warm or hot gas. Random stellar motions should not show the disk thickness in a PS. Thus the PS of light from old stars would not have a kink at the disk thickness, but the PS of star-forming regions traced by young stars could have it because of the turbulent structure of the gas that forms these stars. Thickness signatures in the PS of spiral galaxies observed at high resolution in the B-band are an example (Elmegreen et al., 2003a, b). On the other hand, there were no significant kinks in the PS of 9 dwarfs studied at V band by Willett et al. (2005), presumably because these galaxies are relatively thick on the line of sight. The H\alpha images in Willett et al. (2005) had power-law PS with slopes that decreased from near-zero (characteristic of noise) to the same negative values as the V-band images, which was -1.4\pm 0.3 for one-dimensional scans, as the H\alpha filling factor increased from \sim 0 to \sim 1 with the star formation rate. Here we investigate the PS of JWST images of dust emission from nearby galaxies at 5.6\mum to 21\mum wavelength. We use data on NGC 628, NGC 4449, and NGC 5236 from the “Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers” (FEAST) survey, and additional data for NGC 628 and a nearby galaxy, NGC 5068, from the PHANGS-JWST survey (GO 2107, Lee et al., 2023). These galaxies have the potential to satisfy all three of the above requirements to measure the disk thickness because of the high angular resolution of JWST and the small distances. However, problems can arise if the broad wings of the Point Spread Function (PSF) blend with the thickness scale, or if the closest galaxies are intrinsically thick. Two of our galaxies were studied before. Dutta et al. (2008) measured the 2D PS of HI emission from NGC 628, finding a continuous slope of -1.6\pm 0.2 from 8 kpc to 800 pc – too large to observe a possible thickness effect at \sim 200 pc. Also, Nandakumar & Dutta (2020) measured the HI column density PS and velocity PS in NGC 5236, obtaining a continuous slope of -1.23\pm 0.06 for the column density structure from 11 kpc to 300 pc. The PS has also been determined for several other galaxies at various wavelengths. In the first galaxy-scale measurement, Stanimirović et al. (1999) observed HI emission from the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and found a continuous 2D PS with a slope of -3.04\pm 0.02 in narrow velocity intervals over spatial scales from 30 pc to 4 kpc (see also Pingel et al., 2022). The slope steepens with increasing velocity width, allowing a separation of the PS for velocity and density (Lazarian & Pogosyan, 2000; Dutta, 2015). The density alone had a PS slope of -3.3\pm 0.01 from the integrated velocity map (Stanimirović & Lazarian, 2001), which is about the same as that obtained from a dust column density map of the SMC (Stanimirović et al., 2000). In the Magellanic bridge, Muller et al. (2004) measured a power-law PS in the southwest region over scales from 29 pc to 2 kpc, finding a slope equal to -3.02\pm 0.14 for narrow velocity channels and steepening to -3.4 for the full velocity width. The northern region of the Magellanic bridge has a shallower slope. In the dwarf DDO 210, Begum et al. (2006) found a 2D HI PS slope of -2.75\pm 0.45 from 80 pc to 500 pc. They suggested that the similarity of this slope to the slopes in the LMC, SMC and Milky Way implies that interstellar structure is independent of the star formation rate. Dutta et al. (2009b) also reported the 2D HI PS for seven dwarfs and one spiral, obtaining slopes ranging from -1.5 in And IV, NGC 628, UGC 4459, and GR 8 to -2.6 in DDO 210 and NGC 3741. They interpreted the shallow slopes as the result of 2D turbulence in galaxies where the thickness could not be resolved and the steep slopes as the result of 3D turbulence everywhere for intrinsically thick galaxies. They noted that the shallow slope correlates with the star formation rate per unit area, with larger rates corresponding to steeper slopes. Such a correlation between star formation rate and slope was also noted for various regions around the LMC by Szotkowski et al. (2019), who suggested that star formation feedback destroys small scale structure in HI. Zhang et al. (2012) determined 2D PS of HI for 24 dwarf irregular galaxies over single velocity channels and over the integrated velocities. The length scales typically ranged between several hundred pc and several kpc but in some cases were smaller. There were no kinks suggesting thickness for these galaxies, but the larger galaxies systematically had shallower slopes, as if they were everywhere thin on the line of sight compared to the smaller galaxies, which could be thicker. The division between these cases occurred at a star formation rate of 10^{-2.1}\;M_{\odot} yr-1 and an absolute magnitude of M_{B}=-14.5 mag. The slopes also varied from a constant value at large velocity widths to shallower values at narrow velocity widths, which suggested relatively more small-scale structure beyond the limit of velocity resolution resulting from cool neutral gas, particularly in the inner galactic regions. Zhang et al. (2012) noted that although the slopes depended on absolute SFR as a result of galaxy size, they were independent of the average SFR surface density, which led them to suggest that non-stellar power sources drive the implied turbulence. A similar conclusion was reached by Nestingen-Palm et al. (2017) for the SMC. Spiral galaxies have also had PS measurements in HI, but usually without the resolution necessary to see a feature from disk thickness. Dutta et al. (2010) calculated the HI PS for NGC 4254, finding a slope of -1.7 on scales ranging from 1.7 kpc to 8.4 kpc. They suggested NGC 4254 is a harassed galaxy, and noted that the PS slope in the outer parts, -2.0\pm 0.3, is steeper than in the inner parts, -1.5\pm 0.2. Dutta et al. (2013a) measured the HI PS slopes for 18 spiral galaxies over scales ranging from several hundred pc to 16 kpc; the PS were power laws with slopes of around -1.3, which they concluded was from 2D turbulence. Dutta et al. (2013b) then showed how to convert the amplitude of the PS to the HI mass fraction. More recently, Nandakumar & Dutta (2023) measured a PS slope of -0.96\pm 0.05 for HI column density and -1.81\pm 0.07 for velocity in NGC 6946. They suggested a driving scale larger than 6 kpc, with magnetic processes contributing to solenoidal motions and gravitational processes contributing to compressive motions. The PS kink as a tracer of disk thickness has been questioned by Koch et al. (2020), who looked at FIR emission maps and dust surface densities maps of the LMC, SMC, M31 and M33. The most important test was for the LMC because the SMC has no kink in HI and the spatial resolutions for M31 and M33 were comparable to their expected thicknesses. For the LMC, Koch et al. (2020) suggest the PS is a continuous power law outside of the 30 Dor region, and the kink in the whole galaxy PS comes from 30 Dor. Szotkowski et al. (2019) map the PS slopes over the LMC and also get a steeper PS near 30 Dor, but they also find PS kinks elsewhere in the LMC. In summary, the previous observations rarely detected a disk thickness from two components of the PS. Usually the PS had one continuous power law from scales of multiple kpc down to the resolution limit, which was typically larger than the expected thickness of several hundred pc. The continuous power law still gave important information, however, confirming expectations from 2D turbulence theory and pointing to very large driving scales at the lowest wavenumbers. This implied there are large-scale energy sources and continuous energy cascades or structural hierarchies below that."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06474v1,CO(1–0) imaging reveals 10-kiloparsec molecular gas reservoirs around star-forming galaxies at high redshift,"Massive, intensely star-forming galaxies at high redshift require a supply of molecular gas from their gas reservoirs, replenished by infall from the surrounding circumgalactic medium, to sustain their immense star-formation rates. However, our knowledge of the extent and morphology of their cold-gas reservoirs is still in its infancy. We present the results of stacking 80 hours of JVLA observations of CO(1–0) emission – which traces the cold molecular gas – in 19 z=2.0-4.5 dusty, star-forming galaxies from the AS2VLA survey. The visibility-plane stack reveals extended emission with a half-light radius of 3.8\pm 0.5 kpc, 2–3\times more extended than the dust-obscured star formation and 1.4\pm 0.2\times more extended than the stellar emission. Similarly, stacking the [C i](1–0) observations for a subsample of our galaxies yields sizes consistent with CO(1–0). The CO(1–0) size is comparable to the [C ii] halos detected around high-redshift star-forming galaxies. The bulk (up to 80%) of molecular gas resides outside the star-forming region; only a small part of their molecular gas reservoir directly contributes to their current star formation. Photon-dissociation region modelling indicates that the extended CO(1–0) emission arises from clumpy, dense clouds rather than smooth, diffuse gas.","The majority of star formation beyond redshift z\approx 1 took place in massive, dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs111Also know as sub-millimetre galaxies – SMGs.) with star-formation rates (SFRs) of a few 100 – 1000 M⊙ yr-1 (e.g., Magnelli et al. 2011; Dudzevičiūtė et al. 2020; Zavala et al. 2021). While some DSFGs are starbursts triggered by major mergers, many appear to be relatively isolated (Gillman et al., 2024; Hodge et al., 2024). The immense SFRs of these isolated galaxies need to be fed by a continuous supply of cold gas from their extended gas reservoirs and the surrounding circumgalactic medium (CGM, e.g., Tumlinson et al. 2017; Faucher-Giguère & Oh 2023) and by minor mergers with gas-rich satellites (e.g., Narayanan et al. 2015). In local galaxies, cold, molecular gas is primarily traced by the CO(1–0) rotational line, which has an excitation temperature of just 5.5 K and critical density of 2\times 10^{3} cm-3. At high redshift, studies of molecular gas have mostly focused on higher-excitation CO rotational emission lines (see, e.g., Hodge & da Cunha 2020; Tacconi et al. 2020; Walter et al. 2020). However, the mid/high-excitation CO emission lines arise from the denser, warmer gas, and are known to be much more compact than the ground-state CO(1–0) transition (e.g., Leroy et al. 2009; Ivison et al. 2011; Emonts et al. 2016), making them unsuitable for tracing cold, diffuse gas. In contrast to the higher-excitation CO lines, studies of the ground-state CO(1–0) line have been scarce and largely focused on the few brightest galaxies. This is because of the low intrinsic brightness of the CO(1–0) line, a large collecting area and long integrating times are required for achieving the necessary signal-to-noise ratio. The CO(1–0) emission in a number of high-redshift galaxies has been observed by the Green Bank Telescope (e.g., Hainline et al. 2006; Swinbank et al. 2010; Frayer et al. 2011; Harris et al. 2012; Harrington et al. 2021). However, these spatially unresolved observations do not provide any information about the source size. Early Karl. G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) studies of CO(1–0) emission in bright high-redshift DSFGs (e.g., Ivison et al. 2010, 2011; Riechers et al. 2011b; Thomson et al. 2012) reported half-light radii ranging from a few kpc to \approx25 kpc (J02399-0136, Thomson et al. 2012), often showing multiple CO(1–0) components. However, some of these results have been challenged by deeper observations: for example, Frias Castillo et al. (2022) showed that the supposedly extended CO(1–0) reservoir with high-velocity wings in the z\approx 3.4 galaxy J13120 (Riechers et al., 2011a) is likely an artefact of low signal-to-noise of the original data. To summarise, the sizes of CO(1–0) reservoirs reported by these early studies might be biased towards the brightest (i.e., most extreme) sources, and suffer from low S/N. More recently, apparently very extended molecular gas reservoirs have been reported in high-density environments of early protoclusters, such as the Spiderweb (z\approx 2.2, Emonts et al. 2016) which shows a CO(1–0) reservoirs with a half-light radius of R_{1/2}\approx 30 kpc CO(1–0), the \approx 40-kpc CO(4–3) emission around the z\approx 3.4 star-forming galaxy from Ginolfi et al. (2017), or the claimed super-extended, \approx200 kpc CO(3–2) emission around a z=2.2 quasar cid_346 (Cicone et al. 2021, but c.f. non-detection in deeper data by Jones et al. 2023). Further evidence for extended gas around high-redshift DSFGs comes from Atacama Large (Sub)Millimetre Array (ALMA) observations of the [C ii] 158-\mum line. Extended [C ii] “halos” have been observed around high-redshift DSFGs (e.g., Gullberg et al. 2018; Rybak et al. 2019, 2020) as well as the less massive star-forming galaxies (e.g., Fujimoto et al. 2019, 2020; Ginolfi et al. 2020), sometimes on scales as large as 50 kpc. The nature of the [C ii] halos is still contested: these could be either low-mass satellite galaxies, outflows from the central galaxy (e.g., Pizzati et al. 2020, 2023) or incoming streams of cold, molecular gas. In particular, interpreting the [C ii] observation is difficult: the [C ii] 158-\mum emission arises from all gas phases (molecular – H2, atomic – H0, and ionised – H+), rather than just the molecular phase. The ground-state CO(1–0) emission line remains the most robust probe of diffuse molecular gas. In the recent years, there have been systematic surveys of CO(1–0) in high-redshift DSFGs using JVLA (Frias Castillo et al., 2023; Stanley et al., 2023). These have yielded tentative evidence for extended CO(1–0) emission: Frias Castillo et al. (2023) found that the CO(1–0) extracted from moment-0 maps increases with the aperture size out to radii of \approx5"" (40 kpc). Similarly, using \approx1""-resolution JVLA imaging of 14 galaxies from the z-GAL survey (Cox et al., 2023), Stanley et al. (2023) found CO(1–0) reservoirs of up to 25 kpc across. However, it is unclear how many of their sources are magnified by gravitational lensing, making the interpretation of the measured source sizes difficult. In this Paper, we report results of stacking 80 hours of CO(1–0) observations from the recently completed AS2VLA222AS2VLA = ALMA, SCUBA-2, VLA. survey (Frias Castillo et al., 2023). Specifically, by using JVLA in the most compact D-array, we combined high surface-brightness sensitivity with ability to recover extended emission. This setup makes them ideally suited for studying potentially very extended, low surface-brightness reservoirs around DSFGs. We identify extended CO(1–0) reservoirs with a scale radius of \approx4 kpc, indicating that in high-redshift galaxies, the molecular gas extends well beyond the dust and (potentially) stellar emission. The CO(1–0)/[C ii] and dust continuum surface brightness ratios in these reservoirs are consistent with in-situ star-formation, indicating that the extended CO(1–0) and [C ii] halos are a natural extension of the galaxy’s gas reservoirs, rather than residuals of galactic outflows. Throughout this paper we assume a standard flat \LambdaCDM cosmology with H_{0} = 67.8 km s-1 Mpc-1, \Omega_{\mathrm{M}} = 0.310 and \Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.690 (Planck Collaboration et al., 2016). Figure 1: Stacked CO(1–0) image-plane and uv-plane data for 19 sources with robust CO(1–0) detections. For the image-plane stack, the contours are drawn at \pm(2,4,6...)\sigma; the white ellipses indicate the mean FWHM beam size. The uv-plane data are integrated over \pm1 FWHM velocity range, radially binned with a step of 5 k\lambda. For CO(1–0), the exponential model with R_{\mathrm{1/2}}=0.49\pm 0.07"" (3.8\pm0.5 kpc at our median z=3.1) is strongly preferred by the evidence."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06421v1,"MOCCA-III: Effects of pristine gas accretion and cluster migration on globular cluster evolution, global parameters and multiple stellar populations","Using the mocca code, we study the evolution of globular clusters with multiple stellar populations. For this purpose, the mocca code has been significantly extended to take into account the formation of an enriched population of stars from re-accreted gas with a time delay after the formation of the pristine population of stars. The possibility of cluster migration in the host galaxy and the fact that the pristine population can be described by a model, not in virial equilibrium are also taken into account. Gas re-accretion and cluster migration have a decisive impact on the observational parameters of clusters and the ratio of the number of objects between the pristine and enriched populations. The obtained results, together with observational data, suggest a speculative scenario that makes it possible to explain observational data, the correlation between the mass of the cluster and the ratio of the pristine to the enriched populations, and the observational fact that for some globular clusters, the pristine population is more concentrated than the enriched one. In this scenario, it is important to take into account the environment in which the cluster lives, the conditions in the galaxy when it formed, and the fact that a significant part of the globular clusters associated with the Galaxy come from dwarf galaxies that merged with the Milky Way. The initial conditions describing GCs in the simulations discussed in the paper are different from typical initial GC models that are widely used. Instead of GCs being highly concentrated and lying deep inside the Roche lobe, models that fill the Roche lobe are required. This carries strong constraints on where in the galaxy GCs are formed.","Historically, globular clusters (GCs) have for many decades been thought of as gravitationally bound large collections of stars that formed over a short period of time and have a uniform chemical composition. Observations, both spectroscopic and photometric, made in recent decades have forced a revision of this view. GCs have been shown to contain different stellar populations that differ significantly in chemical composition, especially in light element content. A thorough description of the observational data and their analysis leading to the explanation of the phenomenon of multiple stellar populations (MSPs) can be found in excellent review papers, (e.g. Gratton et al. 2019; Bastian & Lardo 2018; Milone & Marino 2022). Observations, both spectroscopic and photometric, provide the following information: 1. Star-to-star light element abundance variations: He, C, O, N, Na, Mg, Al. Abundances are correlated (Na-N and N/Na-He) or anti-correlated (Na-O and N-C). This points out for hot hydrogen burning through CNO-, NeNa-, and MgAl-cycles (e.g. Langer et al. 1993). Such correlations and anti-correlations are present for the whole range of CMD diagrams, from the bottom of MS up to RGB and HB, and also for WD cooling sequence (Dondoglio et al. 2021); 2. There is very small Fe spreads allowed of about \sim 0.1 dex (e.g. Marino et al. 2019). There are some exceptions e.g. NGC 6341 (Lee 2023); 3. There is practically no time spread between populations. It should be at most a few hundred Myr (e.g. Nardiello et al. 2015; Lucertini et al. 2021); 4. Enriched population (POP2) is centrally concentrated, but there are some exceptions (e.g. Leitinger et al. 2023). One of the possible origins of the reversed spatial distribution is a merger of clusters (e.g. Lee 2015); 5. MSP are very obvious in massive (larger than \sim 10^{4}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}) and old clusters and are observed not only in MW but also in nearby dwarf galaxies. It seems that massive young clusters, younger than \sim 2 Gyr, do not contain MSPs (e.g. Niederhofer et al. 2017; Martocchia et al. 2017). The observational ratio between number of stars from POP2 to the total number of stars in the cluster (\mathrm{N_{2}/N_{tot}}) is between 0.3–0.4 and 0.9; 6. Fraction of enriched stars increases with cluster mass, may also increase with cluster age (e.g. Milone et al. 2020); 7. MSPs are also related to differences in kinematic properties and binary content between populations. POP2 stars have more radially anisotropic velocity distributions (e.g. Libralato et al. 2019, 2023), a more rapid rotation (e.g. Kamann et al. 2020a; Cordoni et al. 2020; Szigeti et al. 2021), a lower fraction of binaries (e.g. Lucatello et al. 2015; Kamann et al. 2020b; Milone et al. 2020) The above observational findings impose strong constraints on models explaining the formation of MSPs in GCs. The observed correlations and anti-correlations between light elements suggest the need for dilution of the ejected products of thermonuclear reactions from stars/binary systems with remnants of the gas after pristine population (POP1) formation. The observed large \mathrm{N_{2}/N_{tot}} ratios suggest a very efficient and rapid process of POP1 star loss from the cluster. It is estimated that POP1’s mass loss should be about 90% of its initial mass (e.g. Bastian & Lardo 2018). The observed correlation between the current GC mass and the \mathrm{N_{2}/N_{tot}} ratio imposes the strongest constraints on the models and probably suggests a strong influence on the environment in which GCs form and live. Several scenarios have been proposed that attempt to explain the emergence and continued evolution of MSP. These models can be divided into two groups. The first group, in which the formation of POP2 is shifted in time relative to POP1 and requires the re-accretion of gas on GC and its mixing with matter ejected by AGB stars, belongs to the AGB scenario (e.g. D’Antona et al. 2002; D’Ercole et al. 2008; D’Antona et al. 2016; Calura et al. 2019). The second group belongs to models in which POP2 is formed at virtually the same time as POP1 and does not require the re-accretion of gas by the GC. Matter ejected from massive stars and binary systems mixes with residual primordial gas. These scenarios include: interacting massive binaries (de Mink et al. 2009), fast-rotating massive stars (Prantzos & Charbonnel 2006; Decressin et al. 2007), the early disc accretion (Bastian et al. 2013), very massive stars (Vink 2018; Higgins et al. 2023), very massive stars due to runaway collisions (Denissenkov & Hartwick 2014; Gieles et al. 2018), nucleosynthesis in accretion disks around stellar-mass black holes (Breen 2018; Fréour et al. 2024) and recently renewed single-binary composite scenario (Vanbeveren et al. 2012; Bekki 2023). It has also been proposed that POP1 stars moving through a medium polluted by AGB and massive star ejecta could form and subsequently accrete enriched substellar companions (Winter & Clarke 2023) Some of these scenarios will be discussed in detail later in Section 4. Unfortunately, as pointed out in the excellent review paper by Bastian & Lardo (2018), no scenario can explain a significant number of observational facts. In recent years, there have been many attempts and simulations with various numerical codes to obtain a model corresponding to the MSP observations. Monte Carlo (e.g. Vesperini et al. 2021; Sollima 2021; Hypki et al. 2022, 2024), nbody (e.g. Lacchin et al. 2024), hydrodynamic (e.g. Calura et al. 2019; McKenzie & Bekki 2021; Yaghoobi et al. 2022) and semi-analytical (e.g. Bekki 2023; Parmentier 2024) codes have been used for this purpose. Despite the success in reproducing some observational properties of GCs from MSP, these simulations were associated with important simplifying assumptions about the effect of gas re-accretion on GCs, the time of formation and parameters describing POP2, as well as the effect of external conditions on the evolution of GCs. Because of the above, it is important to check whether the results obtained so far concerning mass, half-mass radius (\mathrm{R_{h}}) of GCs, or \mathrm{N_{2}/N_{tot}} ratio will be maintained when a more physical prescription of POP2 formation is introduced and the influence of the external environment is taken into account, at least partially and in a simplified manner. To test how the inclusion of environmental effects and the effect of mass re-accretion on GCs and the time shift of POP2 formation affects the evolution of stellar populations in GCs and whether the constraints and results obtained from previous simulations are still correct, the mocca code was substantially updated. The expansion of the mocca code will allow us to follow in a simplified way the evolution of GCs with MSPs in a variable galactic environment the influence of the parameters describing the formation of POP1 and POP2 and the parameters defining their spatial and kinematic characteristics. We expect that these extensions will allow a better understanding of the evolution of GCs with MSPs, bring closer to a more accurate reproduction of the observations, and impose stronger constraints on the initial conditions and physical processes responsible for the formation of MSPs in GCs. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the latest version of the mocca code with all added extensions and the initial conditions of the numerical simulations performed for this paper. Section 3 presents the results obtained with the mocca simulations through the ratio \mathrm{N_{2}/N_{tot}}, \mathrm{R_{h}}, and cluster mass. In Section 4 we discuss the potential implications obtained from mocca simulations for the observational signatures of the multiple populations in GCs and some implications for the scenarios of their formation. We also provide a speculative scenario explaining the observational parameters of Milky Way GCs (MWGCs) and the correlation between cluster mass and \mathrm{N_{2}/N_{tot}} ratio. Section 5 briefly summarizes the main findings of the paper and describes future works."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06372v1,NEXUS Early Data Release: NIRCam Imaging and WFSS Spectroscopy from the First (Partial) Wide Epoch,"We present the Early Data Release of the Multi-Cycle JWST-NEXUS Treasury program (2024-2028), which includes NIRCam imaging and WFSS observations from the first (partial) NEXUS-Wide epoch covering the central 100 {\rm arcmin^{2}} of the NEXUS field, located near the North Ecliptic Pole and within the Euclid Ultra-Deep Field. We release reduced NIRCam mosaics (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F356W, F444W), photometric source catalogs, as well as preliminary WFSS spectra (in F322W2 and F444W) for the subset of bright sources (F356W<21 mag or F444W<21 mag). These observations fully cover the NEXUS-Deep area, and anchor the long-term baseline of the program. These data will be used for initial target selection for the NIRSpec/MSA spectroscopy starting from June 2025. The NIRCam imaging reaches depths of 27.4–28.2 (AB) mags in F090W–F444W. Upcoming NEXUS-Wide epochs will expand the area to the full \sim 400\,{\rm arcmin^{2}}, and improve the NIRCam exposure depths in the Wide tier by a factor of three. In addition, this central region will be repeatedly covered by the NEXUS-Deep observations (NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec/MSA PRISM spectroscopy) over 18 epochs with a \sim 2-month cadence. We demonstrate the data quality of the first NEXUS observations, and showcase some example science cases enabled by these data.","The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST; Gardner et al., 2006) has enabled unprecedented observations of the distant and faint Universe. Medium to large survey programs, such as JADES (Eisenstein et al., 2023), UNCOVER (Bezanson et al., 2022), COSMOS-Web (Casey et al., 2023), FRESCO (Oesch et al., 2023), PRIMER (Dunlop et al., 2021), NGDEEP (Bagley et al., 2023), EIGER (Kashino et al., 2023), ASPIRE (Wang et al., 2023), CEERS (Finkelstein et al., 2023), PEARLS (Windhorst et al., 2023), GLASS-JWST (Treu et al., 2022), etc., from the first few cycles have already produced a wealth of IR imaging and spectroscopic data. These surveys have been addressing many important questions in extragalactic astronomy, such as the formation of the first galaxies and supermassive black holes (e.g., Curtis-Lake et al., 2023; Maiolino et al., 2024; Carniani et al., 2024; Schouws et al., 2024) and the start of the quenching of massive galaxies at z>4 (e.g., Carnall et al., 2023, 2024; de Graaff et al., 2024). The North ecliptic pole EXtragalactic Unified Survey (NEXUS) project (Shen et al., 2024) is a multi-cycle (3, 4, and 5) Treasury program (368 hrs total) that monitors a field in the JWST Continuous Viewing Zone (CVZ). The footprint of the NEXUS survey is chosen to be within the Euclid Ultra-Deep Field (Euclid Collaboration et al., 2024). NEXUS has two tiers of area coverage and cadences. The Wide tier (400 arcmin2) has three epochs, each of which costs \sim65 hrs, to be observed with primary NIRCam/WFSS at three PAs (PA1, PA1+135 deg, PA1+270 deg). The Deep tier (\sim50 arcmin2 within Wide) has 18 epochs, each with \sim10 hrs, performing primary NIRCam imaging and primary NIRSpec MOS spectroscopy with a cadence of \sim2 months over three years (2024–2028). In each tier, NIRCam and MIRI imaging is also obtained either as primary or coordinated parallel observations. The full details about the design of the NEXUS program, the scheduling of the observations, and science motivation are presented in the overview paper (Shen et al., 2024). In this paper, we present the early data release (EDR) of NIRCam imaging and WFSS from NEXUS-Wide tier epoch1 observations, covering the central 100 arcmin2. This release includes fully reduced NIRCam images in the F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F356W, and F444W filters, a photometric source catalog, and reduced NIRCam WFSS 1D spectra of bright sources (F356W<21 mag or F444W<21 mag) in F322W2 and F444W grisms. The paper is structured as follows. We describe the NEXUS observations in Section 2, introduce the data reduction methodology in Section 3, photometric catalog construction in Section 4, basic data properties in Section 5, and data products and access in Section 6. Figure 1: Pseudo-color image of the NEXUS-Wide Epoch1 NIRCam observations (covering the central 100 arcmin2), constructed from the F444W (red), F200W (green), and F115W (blue) images. The scale bar indicates two arcmin. North is up and east is left. The image gaps in the first Wide epoch will be covered by future epochs. Certain small patches and edges of the mosaics are only covered by F444W in the first epoch and are shown in monochromatic red color."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06277v1,An analytical model for the magnetic field in the thick shell of (super-) bubbles,"Bubbles and super-bubbles are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium and influence their local magnetic field. Starting from the assumption that bubbles result from violent explosions that sweep matter away in a thick shell, we derive the analytical equations for the divergence-free magnetic field in the shell. The explosion velocity field is assumed to be radial but not necessarily spherical, making it possible to model various-shaped bubbles. Assuming an explosion center, the magnetic field at the present time is fully determined by the initial uniform magnetic field, the present-time geometry of the bubble shell, and a radial vector field that encodes the explosion-induced displacement of matter, from its original location to its present-time location. We present the main characteristics of our magnetic-field model using a simple displacement model which predicts a constant density of the swept-up matter in the bubble shell and magnetic flux conservation. We further estimate the expected contribution of the shell of the Local Bubble, the super-bubbles in which the Sun resides, to the integrated Faraday rotation measures and synchrotron emission and compare these to full-sky observational data. We find that, while the contribution to the former is minimal, the contribution to the latter is very significant at Galactic latitudes |b|>45^{\circ}. Our results underline the need to take the Local Bubble into account in large-scale Galactic magnetic field studies.","Like external galaxies, the Milky Way is permeated by magnetic fields. Magnetic fields are relevant in various processes and scales, from regulating star formation to shaping large-scale structures in the disk and the halo of the Galaxy. Magnetic fields in the Galaxy also affect our ability to study the Universe’s structure and history and to identify the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (e.g., see Beck 2015; Haverkorn 2015 for recent reviews). To gain insight into the general structure and amplitude of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) on the kiloparsec scale, authors have primarily relied on observations of Faraday rotation measures (RM) towards extragalactic sources, Galactic synchrotron emission and, to a lesser extent, polarized emission from Galactic dust. Using forward modeling frameworks, where model predictions are compared to observations, authors have deduced constraints on a variety of three-dimensional (3D) models for the GMF (e.g., see Jaffe 2019 for a recent review on model tuning). One of the main obstacles to such an approach is the line-of-sight-integrated nature of the observables, which leads to degeneracy between models and model parameters and, consequently, uncertainties in the reconstructed picture of the GMF. In the future, this degeneracy will probably be overcome, at least for the first few kiloparsecs around the Sun, by the advent of tomography data derived from both starlight polarization and Faraday tomography (e.g., Pelgrims et al. 2023, 2024; Erceg et al. 2024a, b) which are made possible by major surveys (Magalhães et al. 2005; Tassis et al. 2018; Shimwell et al. 2022). In the meantime, it is difficult to disentangle the respective contributions of the Galaxy’s near and far regions to the line-of-sight-integrated observables. In this context, it should be stressed that most efforts to model the large-scale GMF have overlooked the fact that the Solar system resides in the Local Bubble. The Local Bubble is a cavity with unusually low density of gas (e.g., Cox & Reynolds 1987); Lallement et al. 2003), filled with an X-ray emitting plasma (e.g., Liu et al. 2017), and surrounded by a shell of cold (ionized) gas and dust (e.g., Pelgrims et al. 2020; O’Neill et al. 2024b). This local cavity has most likely been created by successive supernovae explosions that occurred in the past 10-15 Myr (e.g., Maíz-Apellániz 2001; Breitschwerdt et al. 2016; Schulreich et al. 2023), and has currently a radius on the order of 100-300 pc. As for other bubbles in the interstellar medium (ISM), it is expected that supernovae explosions and the resulting motion of the swept-up matter have deformed the initial magnetic field. This is in agreement with the picture obtained from starlight polarization that the magnetic field in the local ISM does not follow the large-scale GMF (e.g., Heiles 1998; Leroy 1999; Santos et al. 2011; Frisch et al. 2012; Berdyugin et al. 2014; Gontcharov & Mosenkov 2019). Although imprints of the magnetized shell of the Local Bubble have recently been detected in tomographic data, from measurements on Faraday depth and starlight polarization, in combination or not with dust polarized emission (Erceg et al. 2024a, b; Skalidis & Pelgrims 2019; Pelgrims et al. 2024; Uppal et al. 2024), its contribution to line-of-sight integrated observables which are sensitive to the GMF is still unknown, or at least little constrained. The chance for its contribution to be dominant naturally increases toward high-Galactic latitudes as less matter is encountered beyond the Local Bubble wall. This is even more likely to be the case the smaller the scale height of the density distribution of the relevant ISM matter. This, for example, has motivated Alves et al. (2018) to use the dust polarized emission at high-Galactic latitudes to constrain a physical model for the magnetic field in the shell of the Local Bubble whose shape was assumed to be spheroidal, and with no thickness. This motivation was later validated by Skalidis & Pelgrims (2019) (but see Halal et al. 2024) and encouraged Pelgrims et al. (2020) to have the analysis of Alves et al. (2018) reworked with a more realistic shape for the Local Bubble shell that they deduced directly from 3D dust density maps available at the time. However, it is difficult to predict how the relative contribution from the Local Bubble shell and the background change with sky regions, toward lower Galactic latitudes. This is primarily due to depolarization effects which happen both along the sightline and within the beam of observation. Surprisingly, perhaps, O’Neill et al. (2024a) suggested recently that the wall of the Local Bubble may be a substantial contributor to the dust-polarized emission for large portions of the sky. Recently, Korochkin et al. (2024) were the first to include a prescription for the magnetic field in the shell of the Local Bubble into the modeling of the regular component of the GMF using full-sky data on Galactic synchrotron polarized emission and Faraday RM from extragalactic sources. They find that the contribution from the shell of the Local Bubble is substantial. However, in their implementation, they use a spherical model for the shape of the Local Bubble and a geometrical prescription to derive the magnetic field in its shell, which does not lead to a divergence-free magnetic field. With this paper, we aim to go beyond this and quantify the effects of a more realistic shape for the shell of the Local Bubble. In their paper, Alves et al. (2018) derive an analytical expression for a divergence-free magnetic field in the shell of the Local Bubble which they assume to be very thin. While in principle this formalism makes it possible to describe the magnetic field in non-spherical shells, it has the important drawback that the shell must be infinitely thin and, as a consequence, that the amplitude of the magnetic field becomes very large (infinite) in the shell. Consequently, this analytical prescription is inadequate for characterizing the magnetic field in a realistic shell of finite thickness, and for predicting the shell’s contribution to Faraday RM and synchrotron, both of which depend on the amplitude of the magnetic field. In this work, we move past the assumption that the bubble shells must be infinitely thin. We propose a general analytical expression for the divergence-free magnetic field in the thick shell of bubbles which, additionally might be non-spherical. We derive our analytical model in Sect. 2 where we also present its main features and some illustrative examples. In Sect. 3, we particularize our model to the case of the Local Bubble and estimate its contribution to the full-sky data on synchrotron polarized emission and Faraday RM, adopting realistic shapes for the shell of the Local Bubble as inferred from a 3D dust map. We discuss the limitations of our model and the possible implications of our findings for the modeling of the large-scale GMF in Sect. 4."

We measure flux ratios between the various ions to help to distinguish photoionized from shock-ionized gas, and we find that the flux ratios of the arc and shell are not indicative of shock ionization. This provides strong evidence against a previous interpretation of the arc as an interstellar shock produced by an unrecognized supernova. We suggest that all of these objects, including the arc, are associated with the M81 Group and are located at roughly the distance \approx 3.6 Mpc of M81, that the arc is an intergalactic filament, and that the objects are associated with the low-redshift cosmic web.","Over the past several years, we have used the Condor Array Telescope (Lanzetta et al., 2023b) to obtain deep imaging observations through luminance broad-band and He II 468.6 nm, [O III] 500.7 nm, He I 587.5 nm, H\alpha, [N II] 658.4 nm, and [S II] 671.6 nm narrow-band filters of an extended region of the M81 Group comprising 13 adjacent “Condor fields”111“Condor fields” are a set of fields with field centers that tile the entire sky with the Condor field of view, allowing for overlap. spanning \approx 8\times 8 deg2 on the sky centered near M81 and M82.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06255v1,"Introducing the Condor Array Telescope. V. Deep Broad- and Narrow-Band
Imaging Observations of the M81 Group","We used the Condor Array Telescope to obtain deep imaging observations through the luminance broad-band and He II 468.6 nm, [O III] 500.7 nm, He I 587.5 nm, H\alpha, [N II] 658.4 nm, and [S II] 671.6 nm narrow-band filters of an extended region comprising 13 “Condor fields” spanning \approx 8\times 8 deg2 on the sky centered near M81 and M82. Here we describe the acquisition and processing of these observations, which together constitute unique very deep imaging observations of a large portion of the M81 Group through a complement of broad- and narrow-band filters. The images are characterized by an intricate web of faint, diffuse, continuum produced by starlight scattered from Galactic cirrus, and all prominent cirrus features identified in the broad-band image can also be identified in the narrow-band images. We subtracted the luminance image from the narrow-band images to leave more or less only line emission in the difference images, and we masked regions of the resulting images around stars at an isophotal limit. The difference images exhibit extensive extended structures of ionized gas in the direction of the M81 Group, from known galaxies of the M81 Group, clouds of gas, filamentary structures, and apparent or possible bubbles or shells. Specifically, the difference images show a remarkable filament known as the “Ursa Major Arc;” a remarkable network of criss-crossed filaments between M81 and NGC 2976, some of which intersect and overlap the Ursa Major Arc; and details of a “giant shell of ionized gas.”","The M81 Group consists of the galaxies M81, M82, NGC 3077, NGC 2976, and more than 30 other galaxies (Karachentsev, 2005) that together stretch for more than 10 deg on the sky. The group is located just 3.6 Mpc away (Freedman et al., 1994), making it one of the nearest galaxy groups beyond the Local Group. The group is notable in that its most prominent members M81, M82, and NGC 3077 are strongly interacting, and this interaction has caused gas and stars to be stripped from the galaxies into a complex network of gaseous and stellar streams and has driven strong star-formation activity in the centers of M82 and NGC 3007. In fact, M82 is the prototypical and by far nearest example of a “starburst” galaxy with a high-velocity “superwind” that emanates from its center. Analysis and interpretation of all deep imaging observations of the M81 Group are made complicated by two properties of the group: (1) The group exhibits a very low recession velocity, with M81 itself exhibiting a negative heliocentric recession velocity of -36 km s-1 (Kourkchi et al., 2020). This makes it difficult to distinguish features of Galactic origin from features at the distance of the group, even with spectroscopic observations in hand. And (2) the group is located at a Galactic latitude of b\approx 40 deg in a direction of significant Galactic cirrus. Starlight scattered from the cirrus dominates the diffuse light seen in both broad- and narrow-band images, thereby muddying the view of foreground and background objects alike. Over a period stretching from December 2021 through February 2024, we used the Condor Array Telescope (Lanzetta et al., 2023a) to obtain deep imaging observations through the luminance broad-band and He II 468.6 nm, [O III] 500.7 nm, He I 587.5 nm, H\alpha, [N II] 658.4 nm, and [S II] 671.6 nm narrow-band filters of an extended region comprising 13 “Condor fields”111“Condor fields” are a set of fields with field centers that tile the entire sky with the Condor field of view, allowing for overlap. spanning \approx 8\times 8 deg2 on the sky centered near M81 and M82. We obtained all broad-band observations at a cadence of one minute. Our motivation was severalfold: • to characterize the Galactic cirrus in the direction of the M81 group to very sensitive levels; • to search for ionized gas in the direction of the M81 Group, perhaps associated with the group or the cosmic web or perhaps associated with the Galaxy; • to experiment with possibilities of combining deep imaging observations through both broad- and narrow-band filters to determine and subtract continuum from narrow-band images in regions of significant Galactic cirrus; • to exploit the diagnostic capabilities of narrow-band images obtained through the [O III], H\alpha, [N II], and [S II] filters to determine or constrain physical properties of ionized gas; • to use the broad-band observations obtained at a one-minute cadence to search for short-period planets transiting white dwarfs; • to use the broad-band observations summed at a daily cadence to search for intergalactic novae in the outskirts of and between and around M81, M82, NGC 3077, NGC 2976, and other galaxies of the group; • to use the broad- and narrow-band observations to search for intergalactic planetary nebulae in the outskirts of and between and around M81, M82, NGC 3077, NGC 2976, and other galaxies of the group; • and to continue to establish and demonstrate the low-surface-brightness sensitivity of Condor through both broad- and narrow-band filters. Here we describe the acquisition and processing of these observations, which we believe together constitute the deepest wide-field imaging observations of the M81 Group ever obtained through a complement of broad- and narrow-band filters. We use these observations to examine ionized gas in the direction of the M81 Group in Lanzetta et al. (2024), and we will present additional results of the analysis and interpretation of these observations elsewhere, addressing various of the topics noted above."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06125v1,Accurate sticking coefficient calculation for carbonaceous dust growth through accretion and desorption in astrophysical environments,"Context. Cosmic dust is ubiquitous in astrophysical environments, where it significantly influences the chemistry and the spectra. Dust grains are likely to grow through the accretion of atoms and molecules from the gas-phase onto them. Despite their importance, only a few studies compute sticking coefficients for relevant temperatures and species, and their direct impact on grain growth. Overall, the formation of dust and its growth are processes not well understood.Aims. To calculate sticking coefficients, binding energies, and grain growth rates over a wide range of temperatures, for various gas species interacting with carbonaceous dust grains.Methods. We perform molecular dynamics simulations with a reactive force field algorithm to compute accurate sticking coefficients and obtain binding energies. The results are included in an astrophysical model of nucleation regions to study dust growth.Results. We present, for the first time, sticking coefficients of H, H2, C, O, and CO on amorphous carbon structures for temperatures ranging from 50 K to 2250 K. In addition, we estimate the binding energies of H, C, and O in carbonaceous dust to calculate the thermal desorption rates. Combining accretion and desorption allows us to determine an effective accretion rate and sublimation temperature for carbonaceous dust.Conclusions. We find that sticking coefficients can differ substantially from what is commonly used in astrophysical models and this gives new insight on carbonaceous dust grain growth via accretion in dust-forming regions.","Dust grains in space provide a surface on which atoms and molecules may collide and stick, and also undergo chemical reactions. They are also important for the thermodynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) (Draine 2011). The evolution of dust grains in these processes depends on several factors, such as the physical conditions of the environment, the chemical type and morphology of the grains, as well as the abundance of the gas-phase species (Dwek & Scalo 1980; Tielens 1998; Dwek & Cherchneff 2011; Jones & Nuth 2011). When a species collides with a dust grain, its probability of sticking to the surface, and hence to participate to its growth by accretion, is called the sticking coefficient (Leitch-Devlin & Williams 1985; Laffon et al. 2021). This factor significantly impacts the evolution and processing of cosmic dust in astrophysical environments (Andersen et al. 2003), especially in regions where dust grains are thought to nucleate from the gas-phase in so-called nucleation regions - the winds of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and the ejecta of Core-Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe) (Bocchio, Marco et al. 2014). Given a lack of theoretical predictions or experimental measurements, the previous literature has mainly treated the sticking coefficient as a parameter. In most cases, a fixed value has been chosen, e.g., 1 or 0.5, regardless of the type of gas particle, of the dust composition, or of the gas conditions (Dwek & Cherchneff 2011; Hirashita 2012). Here we emphasize that the fate of cosmic dust largely depends on the sticking coefficients and requires a more accurate knowledge of such quantities. Although the chemical and mineral composition of cosmic dust remains uncertain, both empirical constraints and theoretical considerations suggest that, especially in nucleation environments, cosmic dust consists mainly of two different species: carbonaceous and silicate dust (Tielens 2022). In O-rich nucleation environments, silicate dust is found and is composed of various species, but mainly O, Si, Fe, Mg, Ca, and Al (Henning 2010; Gobrecht et al. 2019), since most C is trapped in CO molecules. In C-rich nucleation environments, carbonaceous dust is formed and is composed mainly of C and H, the O being trapped mostly in CO molecules. In this work, we are interested in the latter dust type. Due to the importance of accretion that is, together with coagulation, the main grain growth mechanism, previous works have obtained sticking coefficients for some silicate and carbonaceous grains both theoretically (Leitch-Devlin & Williams 1985) and experimentally (Chaabouni, H. et al. 2012). Concerning carbonaceous dust, calculations were carried out mainly on graphite-like surfaces (Leitch-Devlin & Williams 1985; Hollenbach & Salpeter 1970, 1971; Cazaux, S. et al. 2011), which is one possible structure of carbon dust. However, spectroscopic evidence supports that carbonaceous grains are often in the form of amorphous carbon structures (Ehrenfreund & Cami 2010; Nashimoto et al. 2020; Cherchneff & Cau 1999) for which very little literature on sticking coefficients exists, and that which does exist only concerns hydrogenated amorphous carbon (de Rooij et al. 2010; von Keudell et al. 2002), due to its importance in materials science. Many studies also focus on dust in cold environments (below 100 K), where the dust particles in circumstellar ejecta/nucleation environments can be partially coated with amorphous ice, for which more calculations and experiments are available (Buch & Zhang 1991; Masuda & Takahashi 1997; Al-Halabi et al. 2004; Chaabouni, H. et al. 2012; Veeraghattam et al. 2014). In the present work, we study the sticking process of different atomic and diatomic species on amorphous carbon particles. We compute the sticking coefficients as a function of temperature, ranging from 50 K to 2250 K, setting the dust and gas at the same temperature. In fact, this study provides sticking coefficients, not available elsewhere in the literature, that are fundamental to model environments where carbon dust is present without an icy mantle and is in thermal equilibrium with the gas-phase, i.e., primarily the circumstellar ejecta in which dust grains nucleate. Using these coefficients, we also show how the gas-phase chemistry will impact the growth of these grains. In the following section 2, Numerical Details, we give some details on the amorphous carbon structure used and the dynamical calculations performed to determine sticking coefficients and binding energies. Thereafter comes the section 3, Results and Discussion, where we present the obtained sticking coefficients and an application to the dust growth process in astrophysical environments, which is followed by a discussion of the impact of this work and finally by section 4, Conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06061v1,Hydrodynamics of giant planet formation,"Context. To investigate the physical nature of the ‘nucleated instability’ of proto giant planets, the stability of layers in static, radiative gas spheres is analysed on the basis of Baker’s standard one-zone model.Aims. It is shown that stability depends only upon the equations of state, the opacities and the local thermodynamic state in the layer. Stability and instability can therefore be expressed in the form of stability equations of state which are universal for a given composition.Methods. The stability equations of state are calculated for solar composition and are displayed in the domain -14\leq\lg\rho/\mathrm{[g\,cm^{-3}]}\leq 0, 8.8\leq\lg e/\mathrm{[erg\,g^{-1}]}\leq 17.7. These displays may be used to determine the one-zone stability of layers in stellar or planetary structure models by directly reading off the value of the stability equations for the thermodynamic state of these layers, specified by state quantities as density \rho, temperature T or specific internal energy e. Regions of instability in the (\rho,e)-plane are described and related to the underlying microphysical processes.Results. Vibrational instability is found to be a common phenomenon at temperatures lower than the second He ionisation zone. The \kappa-mechanism is widespread under ‘cool’ conditions.","In the nucleated instability (also called core instability) hypothesis of giant planet formation, a critical mass for static core envelope protoplanets has been found. Mizuno (1980) determined the critical mass of the core to be about 12\,M_{\oplus} (M_{\oplus}=5.975\times 10^{27}\,\mathrm{g} is the Earth mass), which is independent of the outer boundary conditions and therefore independent of the location in the solar nebula. This critical value for the core mass corresponds closely to the cores of today’s giant planets. Although no hydrodynamical study has been available many workers conjectured that a collapse or rapid contraction will ensue after accumulating the critical mass. The main motivation for this article is to investigate the stability of the static envelope at the critical mass. With this aim the local, linear stability of static radiative gas spheres is investigated on the basis of Baker’s (1966) standard one-zone model. Phenomena similar to the ones described above for giant planet formation have been found in hydrodynamical models concerning star formation where protostellar cores explode (Tscharnuter 1987, Balluch 1988), whereas earlier studies found quasi-steady collapse flows. The similarities in the (micro)physics, i.e., constitutive relations of protostellar cores and protogiant planets serve as a further motivation for this study."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06054v1,DULAG: A DUal and Lensed AGN candidate catalog with GMP method,"Context. A series of studies have demonstrated that the Gaia multipeak method (GMP) is a very efficient technique to select active galactic nucleus (AGN) pair candidates. The number of candidates is determined by the size of the input AGN catalogs, usually limited to spectroscopically-confirmed objects.Aims. The objective of this work is to compile a larger and highly reliable catalog of GMP pair candidates extracted from the six million objects the Gaia AGN catalog, the majority of which lack spectroscopic information.Methods. In order to ascertain the differences in the properties of GMP pair candidates compared to normal AGN, we conducted an investigation utilising samples of GMP AGN. These differences were employed to establish the optimal selecting criteria, which ultimately led to the identification of a highly reliable candidate catalog.Results. We found significant differences in astrometry and multi-band colour distribution between normal AGN and GMP pair candidates. A DUal and Lensed AGN candidate catalog with GMP method (DULAG) comprising 5,286 sources was ultimately compiled, accompanied by a highly reliable Golden sample of 1,867 sources. A total of 37 sources in the Golden sample have been identified as dual AGN or lensed AGN. For the majority of sources in the Golden sample, we provide reference redshifts and find three close AGN pair candidates among them.","Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are the key to our understanding of the evolutionary process of the massive objects in the Universe (e.g. Dosopoulou & Antonini, 2017), the verification of gravitational theories (e.g. Healy et al., 2012), and the origin of the gravitational waves (e.g. Belczynski et al., 2014). Rodriguez et al. (2006) discovered a SMBHB with a projected separation of 7.3 pc using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), which is the closest black hole pair yet. Many SMBHB candidates have been reported over the years (e.g. Ju et al., 2013; Graham et al., 2015a, b; Wang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2019). However, it’s difficult to identify them because the components of the systems are too close to be distinguished by the telescope. Dual AGNs at kpc separations are the precursor of SMBHBs, with more easily observable separations, so it is important to take systematic investigations and observations of them. In the past decade, a large number of AGN pairs (dual and lensed AGNs) with different separations have been discovered. In particular, with the release of high-resolution data from Gaia DR2 (Brown et al., 2018) and (E)DR3 (Brown et al., 2021; Vallenari et al., 2023), many authors have developed effective and systematic methods to search for AGN pairs using Gaia data. Shen et al. (2019) proposed that AGN pair candidates can be selected by varstrometry method, which is a strong testament to the effectiveness of Gaia’s data in the search for Dual AGNs (e.g. Chen et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023). Recently, Mannucci et al. (2022) proposed the Gaia Multi Peak (GMP) method for effectively selecting dual AGN candidates. The GMP method select AGN pair candidates by using the Gaia multipeak parameter ipd\_frac\_multi\_peak (FMP). The basic principle is that when Gaia is observing pairs with angular separations between \leavevmode\nobreak\ 0.15^{\prime\prime} and \leavevmode\nobreak\ 0.8^{\prime\prime}, if the telescope cannot resolve them effectively, a secondary peak might be detected in the profile. The FMP parameter reports the percentage (from 0 to 100) of Gaia scans showing the presence of multiple peaks. Mannucci et al. (2023) have shown that for sources with G\textless 20.5 mag and \delta (separation) \textgreater 0.15^{\prime\prime}, the cut of FMP \geq 8 ensures a low contamination and high efficiency. Based on this method and high-precision spectroscopic observations, many AGN pairs have been identified (e.g. Ciurlo et al., 2023; Scialpi et al., 2023). The purity of the AGN pair candidates selected by, varstrometry, GMP, or other astrometric methods (e.g. Wu et al., 2022), can be improved by considering the quasars that have already been spectroscopically identified by different telescopes, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar catalog (SDSS, Lyke et al., 2020), the LAMOST quasar survey (Dong et al., 2018), the DESI spectroscopic survey (Chaussidon et al., 2023), and so on. The Million Quasars (Milliquas) catalog (Flesch, 2023), collects almost all the quasars currently identified for large-sample spectroscopy have been cataloged, with a total number of 0.9 million. The benefits of using these catalogs as input catalogs are obvious, as all quasars are spectroscopically identified. However, these catalogs are incomplete for most of the sky region (see Flesch, 2023, for the sky coverage of these catalogs). Therefore in order to expand the sample of AGN pair candidates, it is necessary to select reliable quasar candidates from the sources without spectroscopic observations. Over the past decade, many outstanding projects aimed at selecting quasar candidates have been completed (e.g. Secrest et al., 2015; Bailer-Jones et al., 2019). Various groups have obtained large numbers of quasar candidates based on different methods, bringing the number of quasar candidates into several millions. Especially after the publication of the Gaia DR3, with its high-precision astrometric data with multi-color magnitudes, Collaboration et al. (2023) obtained a high-completeness but low-purity sample of quasar candidates numbering up to 6.6 million by multiple methods. Based on this catalog, some pure quasar candidate catalogs have been constructed. For example, Storey-Fisher et al. (2023) built a pure QUAIA catalog of 1.3 million quasar candidates based on the Gaia proper motions and unWISE color (Lang, 2014), while Fu et al. (2023) constructed the CatNorth catalog of 1.5 million quasar candidates (\textgreater 90\% purity) with data from Gaia, Pan-STARRS1 (Flewelling et al., 2020), and CatWISE2020 (Marocco et al., 2021). An important objective in the creation of these substantial collections of QSO candidates was the establishment of Gaia optical celestial reference frame (Klioner et al., 2022). Therefore, principal characteristics of these catalogs are their high purity and the almost zero parallax and proper motion of their sources. When selecting AGN pair candidates using these catalogs, the high purity may result in a significant loss of completeness. The reason is that AGN pairs are different from normal quasars in various ways: 1. Proper motions and parallaxes. It is generally accepted that, since quasars are extremely distant, their parallaxes and proper motions should be consistent with 0. Therefore, most quasar candidates selection techniques set up cut-off parallaxes and proper motions (e.g. Lindegren et al., 2018; Klioner et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023). However, AGN pairs may show observable parallaxes and proper motions due to apparent movements of their optical centers caused by the variability of the two AGNs (Makarov & Secrest, 2022). 2. The optical color and infrared color. Gaia photometry is optimized for point sources, and this can lead to shifts in the photometry of some dual and lensed AGNs. Also, since the blue and red photometry is derived from extended spectra (De Angeli et al., 2023), the bp-g and g-rp, which are commonly used in the selection of quasar candidates, may not be reliable for sources with components. As for the infrared color, there are no known differences that exist between AGN pairs and normal AGNs when z \textgreater 0.5, so we will explore and discuss that in this paper. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the data we used and analyze their characters. In Section 3, we explore the differences in astrometric and colors between GMP AGN pair candidates and normal AGNs and determine the final selection criteria. We also describe in detail the construction of our dual and lensed AGN candidate catalog (DULAG) in this section. The properties of the catalog are demonstrated in Section 4. In Section 5, we give the conclusion and discuss the future of the selection."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06045v1,"Moving Groups in the Solar Neighborhood with Gaia, APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST: Dynamical Effects Gather Gas and the Ensuing Star Formation Plays an Important Role in Shaping the Stellar Velocity Distributions","With Gaia, APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST data, we investigate the positional, kinematic, chemical, and age properties of nine moving groups in the solar neighborhood. We find that each moving group has a distinct distribution in the velocity space in terms of its metallicity, \alpha abundance, and age. Comparison of the moving groups with their underlying background stars suggests that they have experienced the enhanced, prolonged star formation. We infer that any dynamical effects that gathered stars as a moving group in the velocity space also worked for gas. We propose for the first time that the ensuing newborn stars from such gas inherited the kinematic feature from the gas, shaping the current stellar velocity distributions of the groups. Our findings improve the understanding of the origins and evolutionary histories of moving groups in the solar neighborhood.","1 INTRODUCTION Moving groups in the solar neighborhood provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our Galaxy’s disk (Eggen, 1996; Dehnen, 1998), thanks to their retention of birth environment signatures and dynamical histories. Moving groups are associated with large kinematic structures like arches, ridges, and phase spirals (Antoja et al., 2018; Gaia Collaboration et al., 2018; Ramos et al., 2018; Fragkoudi et al., 2019; Khanna et al., 2019; Monari et al., 2019; Laporte et al., 2020; Bernet et al., 2022; Hunt et al., 2022; Khoperskov & Gerhard, 2022). Models have shown that many mechanisms affect the velocity distribution of stars in the solar neighborhood, such as (a) spiral waves churning both stars and gas, inducing radial mixing (Sellwood & Binney, 2002; Schönrich & Binney, 2009); (b) the effect of spiral arms (Quillen & Minchev, 2005; Antoja et al., 2009; Purcell et al., 2011; Hunt et al., 2018; Michtchenko et al., 2018; Barros et al., 2020); (c) nonlinear effects of orbital resonances (Contopoulos & Grosbol, 1986; Fux, 2001; Minchev et al., 2009; Monari et al., 2019; Clarke & Gerhard, 2022; Bernet et al., 2024) like the outer Lindblad resonance of the Galactic bar (Dehnen, 2000; Hunt & Bovy, 2018; Fragkoudi et al., 2019; Fujii et al., 2019; Monari et al., 2019; Asano et al., 2022; Trick, 2022), corotation resonance of a long bar (Pérez-Villegas et al., 2017; Monari et al., 2017, 2019; Asano et al., 2020; D’Onghia & L. Aguerri, 2020), and resonance sweeping by a decelerating Galactic bar (Chiba et al., 2021; Chiba & Schönrich, 2021); (d) heating of Galactic disks by mergers (Quinn et al., 1993); (e) footprints of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy passing through the disk (Quinn et al., 1993; Purcell et al., 2011; D’Onghia et al., 2016; Laporte et al., 2019; Craig et al., 2021); (f) phase-mixing due to external perturbations (Minchev et al., 2009; Gómez et al., 2012; de la Vega et al., 2015; Antoja et al., 2018; Hunt et al., 2018; Ramos et al., 2018; Laporte et al., 2019, 2020; Khanna et al., 2019); and (g) tidally stripped stars (Helmi et al., 1999; Sanders & Binney, 2013). The chemical tagging technique (Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn, 2002) is a popular method to uncover the fossil evidence provided by the Galaxy. Bensby et al. (2007) studied the Hercules moving group with high-resolution spectra of nearby F and G dwarf stars, supporting its dynamical origin. De Silva et al. (2007) studied the age and chemical abundances of the HR 1614 group and suggested that it is the remnant of a dispersed star-forming event. De Silva et al. (2011) used high-resolution spectra to study the Hyades moving group and found that it is made up at least partly of dispersed Hyades cluster stars. Liang et al. (2017) utilized data from LAMOST DR3 combined with Gaia DR1 TGAS to unveil a distinct metal-poor gap separating the Hyades-Pleiades and Hercules moving groups, hinting at underlying Galactic processes shaping their compositions. Ramya et al. (2019) studied K giants of the Hyades and Sirius superclusters and suggested that the Hyades moving group is populated by stars from the Hyades and Praesepe open clusters, while the Sirius moving group is populated by stars from the Ursa Major open cluster. Yang et al. (2021) investigated the chemistry and ages of moving groups using APOGEE DR16, revealing significant dispersion among them. Liang et al. (2023) suggested that the Hercules 1 and Hercules 2 moving groups have formed primarily through radial migration processes according to their radial age and chemical abundance distributions. Nepal et al. (2024) proposed a theory that the bar could affect the star formation in the solar neighborhood. Khoperskov & Gerhard (2022) discovered some moving groups exhibiting slightly enriched mean metallicity and periodic variations correlated with angular momentum. They further suggested that these patterns in the (R, V_{\phi}) plane (Khanna et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2019; Fragkoudi et al., 2020) are linked to the large-scale Milky Way spiral arms and main bar resonances. Yang et al. (2023) suggested that bar dynamics are not enough to explain all ridge properties in the (R, V_{\phi}) plane. Wheeler et al. (2022) explored the chemical signatures of bar resonances and associated some moving groups with the bar’s outer Lindblad and corotation resonances. Khoperskov et al. (2023) using chemodynamical simulations show that dynamical effects play a key role in the formation of large-scale metallicity variations across spiral arms. Haywood et al. (2024) used simulations to show that bar formation in galaxies is accompanied by an episode of radial migration induced by the bar’s slowing down. This process is responsible for spreading stars from the inner disc toward the outer Lindblad resonances. Despite the efforts, the mechanisms governing the formation and evolution of moving groups, as well as their connections to broader Galactic structures, remain unresolved. To address the issue, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the chemical abundances, ages, and kinematic properties of moving groups within the thin disk, aiming to unravel their complex origins and evolution histories. In this study, we adopt the terminology of moving groups in Liang et al. (2017). Some moving groups listed in Liang et al. (2017) are not studied in this work because they have only a small number of member stars with available chemical abundances and age information. We combine the Hyades moving group and the Pleiades moving group as one entity due to their analogous characteristics and the precision of available data. Lucchini et al. (2023) suggested that the Pleiades moving group’s radial extent is only 200 pc, influenced by contributions from the Pleiades cluster’s tidal tail (Lodieu et al., 2019). Similarly, we do not distinguish between the two density peaks within the \gamma Leo moving group. Liang et al. (2018) used high-resolution spectra observed with the Subaru High Dispersion Spectrograph to study the chemical abundances of the \gamma Leo moving group and found that it is composed of local stars. Monari et al. (2018) suggested that the Coma Berenices moving group must have formed less than 1.5 billion years ago, possibly related to a pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf satellite galaxy. Tarricq et al. (2021) showed that the Pleiades, Hyades, and Coma Berenices moving groups are more populated by young clusters, while the Sirius region seems to contain a clump of clusters with ages exceeding 300 Myr, and no cluster populates in the two Hercules moving groups. Liang et al. (2023) showed that Hercules 1 and Hercules 2 moving groups are two independent structures with different metallicities and ages. Bernet et al. (2024) measured the azimuthal and radial gradients of the moving groups and compared them with simulation results. They suggested that a simple model with a fast and a slow bar is not sufficient to produce the radial gradient of the Hercules moving groups, although it can produce the azimuthal gradient. In Section 2, we describe the data used for selecting member stars and underlying background stars for each moving group, as well as the data used for determining their metallicity, \alpha abundance, and age. Section 3 presents [Fe/H], [\alpha/Fe], and age distributions in the (V_{R}, V_{\phi}) coordinate. We also provide the comparison results of the member stars and the background sample of each moving group. In Section 4, we discuss various theories in the literature that are relevant to our findings. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our new findings and their implications.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05910v1,Exploring lenticular galaxy formation in field environments using : evidence for counter-rotating gas accretion as a formation channel,"The formation pathways of lenticular galaxies (S0s) in field environments remain a matter of debate. We utilize the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, NewHorizon, to investigate the issue. We select two massive star-formation quenched S0s as our main sample. By closely tracing their physical and morphological evolution, we identify two primary formation channels: mergers and counter-rotating gas accretion. The former induces central gas inflow due to gravitational and hydrodynamic torques, triggering active central star formation which quickly depletes the gas of the galaxy. Counter-rotating gas accretion overall has a similar outcome but more exclusively through hydrodynamic collisions between the pre-existing and newly-accreted gas. Both channels lead to S0 morphology, with gas angular momentum cancellation being a crucial mechanism. These formation pathways quench star formation on a short timescale (< Gyr) compared to the timescales of environmental effects. We also discuss how counter-rotating gas accretion may explain the origin of S0s with ongoing star formation and the frequently observed gas-star misaligned kinematics in S0s.","The class of S0 galaxies was originally introduced to bridge the morphological transition between elliptical and spiral galaxies in the Hubble’s tuning fork scheme (Hubble, 1936). S0s were traditionally characterized by a flattened shape without spiral arms, a prominent bulge, and red colors. Research on their formation mechanisms has been strongly affected by the morphology-density relation (Dressler, 1980; Goto et al., 2003; Postman et al., 2005), which reveals a higher proportion of S0s in high-density environments at the expense of a decreasing fraction of late-type galaxies. Various scenarios have been proposed to explain this relation, including ram pressure stripping of gas from late-type galaxies as they pass through the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) (Gunn & Gott, 1972; Quilis et al., 2000), and the removal of halo gas via hydrodynamical interaction with ICM that prevents further cold gas accretion and shuts down star formation (Larson et al., 1980; Bekki et al., 2002). However, the high fraction of S0 galaxies in group or subgroup environments at low redshifts (Wilman et al., 2009; Just et al., 2010), along with the difficulties in interpreting their scaling relation solely by faded spiral scenarios (e.g., Bedregal et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2010), suggests that previous models may not fully account for S0 formation. Numerical studies have shown that both minor and major mergers are able to produce S0 remnants, affecting stellar kinematics and structures (Querejeta et al., 2015; Eliche-Moral et al., 2018). In contrast, Rizzo et al. (2018) argued that mergers are not primary pathways in low-density environments. Their analysis of stellar kinematics from CALIFA (Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area) (Sánchez et al., 2012; García-Benito et al., 2015) survey data revealed that most S0s follow the trend of spiral galaxies on the stellar specific angular momentum versus stellar mass (j_{\star}-M_{\star}) plane. They proposed that spirals can transform to S0s through a passive evolution driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback (Van den Bergh, 2009) or the cessation of cold gas supply (e.g., Dekel & Birnboim, 2006; Peng et al., 2015; Armillotta et al., 2016). Recent SAMI (Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral-field Spectrograph) (Croom et al., 2012; Bryant et al., 2015) survey findings reveal that many S0 galaxies in low-mass group and field environments exhibit weaker stellar rotation and signs of disruptive merger events, such as shells and tidal streams, suggesting their merger origins (Deeley et al., 2020). Since Galletta (1987) first observed the gas-star counter-rotation in a barred S0 galaxy, numerous similar cases have been documented (Bertola et al., 1992; Rubin et al., 1992; Kuijken et al., 1996). Studies indicate that ellipticals and S0s more frequently harbor counter-rotating gaseous components compared to spiral galaxies (Kannappan & Fabricant, 2001; Pizzella et al., 2004; Bureau & Chung, 2006; Katkov et al., 2015). These findings have spurred further investigations into S0 formation pathways involving kinematic misalignment. Bassett et al. (2017) conducted hydrodynamical simulations of minor mergers between a disc galaxy and a gas-rich satellite across various merger parameters, discovering that a retrograde orbit is essential for generating gas-star counter-rotation in an S0 galaxy. They also noted that a large amount of gas in the primary galaxy can hinder the formation of a counter-rotating gas disk. Osman & Bekki (2017) proposed that a high fraction of counter-rotating gas disturbs spiral arm formation. Using the sample of 401 emission-line S0s from the MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) (Blanton et al., 2017) survey data, Zhou et al. (2023) found that \sim 20\% of S0s exhibit gas-star misalignment, highlighting misaligned gas accretion as an important channel for S0 formation. A recent study on S0 formation using a large-scale cosmological simulation was conducted by Deeley et al. (2021). They utilized the IllustrisTNG100 simulation (Pillepich et al., 2018) to explore S0 formation across a range of environmental settings, from fields to high-mass groups. They identified merger events and gas stripping due to group infall as the major formation pathways, with a smaller contribution from passive evolution through gas exhaustion. However, S0s with counter-rotating components in the simulation were not discussed. In this work, we aim to study S0 formation in low-density environments using the NewHorizon simulation (Dubois et al., 2021), a cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulation. NewHorizon is particularly well-suited to our study due to its high time output cadence and its excellent mass and spatial resolutions, which enable us to trace the detailed evolution of physical properties and galactic morphology. Furthermore, it predominantly covers field and low-mass group environments, aligning with our primary research interests. We demonstrate in this study that S0 formation can be driven by both mergers and counter-rotating gas accretion. In both scenarios, a decrease in gas angular momentum plays a key role in building S0 morphology by relocating exterior gas to the galactic center. In Section 2, we briefly describe the NewHorizon simulation. We then detail the sample selection process and the analysis. In Section 3, we examine the evolution of S0 galaxies’ physical properties and morphology to identify key factors determining their final morphology. We further discuss the formation pathways identified in this study and their physical mechanisms in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize our findings and highlight their implications."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06949v1,The Role of Thermal Instability in Accretion Outbursts in High-Mass Stars,"Context. High-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs) can exhibit episodic bursts of accretion, accompanied by intense outflows and luminosity variations. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving these phenomena is crucial for elucidating the early evolution of massive stars and their feedback on star formation processes.Aims. Thermal Instability (TI) due to Hydrogen ionisation is among the most promising mechanisms of episodic accretion in low mass (M_{*}\lesssim 1{\rm M_{\odot}}) protostars. Its role in HMYSOs has not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigate the properties of TI outbursts in young, massive (M_{*}\gtrsim 5 {\rm M_{\odot}}) stars, and compare them to those observed so far.Methods. We employ a 1D numerical model to simulate TI outbursts in HMYSO accretion disks. We vary key model parameters, such as stellar mass, mass accretion rate onto the disc, and disc viscosity, to assess TI outburst properties.Results. Our simulations show that modelled TI bursts can replicate the durations and peak accretion rates of long (a few years to decades) outbursts observed in HMYSOs with similar mass characteristics. However, they struggle with short-duration (less than a year) bursts with short (a few weeks or months) rise times, suggesting the need for alternative mechanisms. Moreover, while our models match the durations of longer bursts, they fail to reproduce the multiple outbursts seen in some HMYSOs, regardless of model parameters. We also emphasise the significance of not just evaluating model accretion rates and durations, but also performing photometric analysis to thoroughly evaluate the consistency between model predictions and observational data.Conclusions. Our findings suggest that some other plausible mechanisms, such as gravitational instabilities and disc fragmentation can be responsible for generating the observed outburst phenomena in HMYSOs and underscore the need for further investigation into alternative mechanisms driving short outbursts. However, the physics of TI is crucial in sculpting the inner disc physics in the early bright epoch of massive star formation, and comprehensive parameter space exploration and the use of 2D modeling are essential for obtaining a more detailed understanding of the underlying physical processes. By bridging theoretical predictions with observational constraints, this study contributes to advancing our knowledge of HMYSO accretion physics and the early evolution of massive stars.","Understanding the formation and evolution of high-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs), and their various accretion outbursts, requires a comprehensive study that includes observations, analytical models, and numerical simulations. HMYSOs hold crucial information on the formation process of massive stars, which play a key role in shaping the cosmic environment. While FU Orionis-type accretion outbursts are typically associated with low-mass young stellar objects (Hartmann & Kenyon, 1996), recent observations have suggested that HMYSOs may also experience similar episodic accretion events (Caratti o Garatti et al., 2017; Stecklum et al., 2021; Fischer et al., 2022). However, the mechanisms driving these outbursts in HMYSOs are likely different, given the distinct physical conditions in high-mass star formation. FU Orionis type accretion outbursts are a puzzling and fascinating phenomenon in astrophysics, primarily observed in low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs). These outbursts, lasting for several years or decades, involve an intense increase in the accretion rate onto a young star, leading to a brightening of several magnitudes. The prototype of this class of outbursts is FU Orionis itself, a low-mass star discovered more than 85 years ago (Herbig, 1977). Since then, many other examples of FUors have been identified, in different regions of our galaxy (Audard et al., 2014), providing evidence that these phenomena might be ubiquitous in low-mass star-forming environments. Later on, with the discovery of EXor bursts (Herbig, 1989), it was realized that episodic accretion is a much broader and varied phenomenon, that occurs at all stages of star formation. The outburst of V1647 Ori in 2004 showed that some objects do not fit into the traditional EXor and FUor categories, despite the broad range of properties these groups cover. Properties of several recently discovered outbursting objects are even more unusual, thus creating a zoo of outbursting objects with various properties (see Fischer et al., 2022, for the review). Despite several attempts to explain the physical processes driving these outbursts, the exact mechanism behind them remains unclear. Nevertheless, numerous theoretical scenarios have been proposed, ranging from gravitational instability (GI) in the disc around the young star (Vorobyov & Basu, 2010; Machida et al., 2011; Hosokawa et al., 2016; Meyer et al., 2017; Vorobyov & Elbakyan, 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Kuffmeier et al., 2018; Oliva & Kuiper, 2020), thermal instability (TI) (Bell & Lin, 1994; Kley & Lin, 1996), stellar flyby (Borchert et al., 2022; Cuello et al., 2023), interaction of a massive planet with the disc (Lodato & Clarke, 2004) or the presence of a ”dead zone” in the inner 0.1\leq r\leq a few AU disc with eventual development of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in that zone (Armitage et al., 2001; Zhu et al., 2009, 2010; Kadam et al., 2020; Vorobyov et al., 2020). One of the possible mechanisms responsible for the episodic accretion outbursts is the well-established phenomenon of disc thermal instability caused by the sudden increase in opacity when hydrogen ionizes at a temperature of \sim10^{4} K. The inner, thermally unstable region of the disc periodically switches between two (cold and hot) stable branches of the so-called S-curve (see Sect. 6 in Armitage, 2015), thus developing a strong accretion variability onto the star (e.g., Lodato & Clarke, 2004; Elbakyan et al., 2021). This phenomenon was originally studied as part of a model for dwarf novae (Hōshi, 1979; Meyer & Meyer-Hofmeister, 1981; Lin et al., 1985). This model, while proving to be a good fit to observations, requires not only a substantial change in opacity and distinct values of the \alpha-parameter for the cold and hot branches of the S-curve, but also that the disc midplane temperatures exceed \sim10^{4} K. Initial studies of accretion outbursts were focused mainly on a FU Orionis objects (FUors), which are low-mass stars exhibiting outbursts every few decades (Hartmann & Kenyon, 1996). However, with the advent of observational techniques and new instruments (such as ALMA, VLTI, VISTA), several groups have discovered multiple HMYSOs showing accretion outbursts (Caratti o Garatti et al., 2017; Hunter et al., 2018; Stecklum et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Wolf et al., 2024), which introduce some discrepancies among their observational properties compared to the FUors. These discrepancies could potentially help to fill in critical details of the underlying physical mechanisms at work, as well as refining theoretical predictions. While in low-mass YSOs we distinguish the two large categories as magnetospheric-accretion driven (EXors) and boundary layer accretion driven (FUors), in HMYSOs the situation is more complex, as in principle, magnetospheric accretion should not work (Beltrán & de Wit, 2016; Mendigutía, 2020). The outbursts so far observed in HMYSOs are rapid and short-lived events, that are manifested by a sudden increase in luminosity that may last for months to a few decades before returning to quiescence. Unfortunately, due to the low statistics for the outbursts in HMYSOs (less than 10 objects), it’s hard to determine their recurrent rate like it is done for FUors (\sim 1.75 kyr; Contreras Peña et al. (2024)). It is worth to note that bursts similar to the one in FU Orionis system have not yet been detected in HMYSOs (all bursts observed so far have relatively short durations and low amplitudes compared to FU Ori bursts). However, the lack of detections is likely due to an observational bias (and the relative low number of such events), and we should keep an open mind and ask ourselves if FUor events are possible in HMYSOs. While the observed sample is still too small to judge whether these short bursts represent a common and unique feature or are just caused by an observational bias, we can still draw some conclusions. The short durations of the bursts correspond to the dynamical and viscous timescales at the (sub-)AU radial distances, meaning that only the region of the disc close to the star is involved in the burst triggering. However, the multidimensional numerical simulation of (sub-)AU radial distances in a disc is usually too computationally costly and a so-called “sink cell” approach is used to simulate the inner region of the disc (Meyer et al., 2017; Oliva & Kuiper, 2020) or these small-scale structures are hidden within a Gaussian accretion kernel around sink particles (Krumholz et al., 2004; Mignon-Risse et al., 2020; Commerçon et al., 2022). This approach does not allow simulating properly the hydrodynamical evolution of the inner disc, which is crucial for the understanding of accretion outbursts. The most practical way to overcome this ”computational barrier” is the usage of one dimensional (1D) numerical models of circumstellar discs. In our current study, we aim to advance our understanding of accretion outbursts in HMYSOs by investigating the main characteristics of the phenomenon and its fundamental effects on forming massive stars and their surrounding discs. This is done by studying the evolution of circumstellar discs around HMYSOs, which are prone to TI in the inner disc. In Sec. 2, we detail the numerical methodology employed in this study. We discuss the implementation of classic thermal instability (TI) bursts in Sec. 3, where we explore the fundamental characteristics of these bursts under varying model parameters. In Sec. 4, we extend our analysis to investigate TI bursts for different sets of model parameters, systematically examining their impact on the observed burst behaviour of HMYSOs. Following this, in Sec. 5, we compare our simulation results with observational data. In Sec. 6, we delve into the phenomenon of thermal instability bursts with higher frequency. The discussion section (Sec. 7) covers comparisons with observational data, possible burst mechanisms, and the importance of parameter space exploration. We conclude with our main findings and suggestions for future research in Sec. 8."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06884v1,X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity,"Context. Mass loss through a stellar wind is an important physical process that steers the evolution of massive stars and controls the properties of their end-of-life products, such as the supernova type and the mass of compact remnants. To probe its role in stellar evolution over cosmic time, mass loss needs to be studied as function of metallicity. For mass loss to be accurately quantified, the wind structure needs to be established jointly with the characteristics of small-scale inhomogeneities in the outflow, which are known as wind clumping. Aims. We aim to improve empirical estimates of mass loss and wind clumping for hot main-sequence massive stars, study the dependence of both properties on the metal content, and compare the theoretical predictions of mass loss as a function of metallicity to our findings.Methods. Using the model atmosphere code Fastwind and the genetic algorithm fitting method Kiwi-GA, we analyzed the optical and ultraviolet spectra of 13 O-type giant to supergiant stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy, which has a metallicity of approximately one-fifth of that of the Sun. We quantified the stellar global outflow properties, such as the mass-loss rate and terminal wind velocity, and the wind clumping properties. To probe the role of metallicity, our findings were compared to studies of Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud samples that were analyzed with similar methods, including the description of clumping.Results. We find significant variations in the wind clumping properties of the target stars, with clumping starting at flow velocities 0.01-0.23 of the terminal wind velocity and reaching clumping factors f_{\rm cl}=2-30. In the luminosity (\log L/L_{\odot}=5.0-6.0) and metallicity (Z/Z_{\odot}=0.2-1) range we considered, we find that the scaling of the mass loss \dot{M} with metallicity Z varies with luminosity. At \log L/L_{\odot}=5.75, we find \dot{M}\propto Z^{m} with m=1.02\pm 0.30, in agreement with pioneering work in the field within the uncertainties. For lower luminosities, however, we obtain a significantly steeper scaling of m>2.Conclusions. The monotonically decreasing m(L) behavior adds a complexity to the functional description of the mass-loss rate of hot massive stars. Although the trend is present in the predictions, it is much weaker than we found here. However, the luminosity range for which m is significantly larger than previously assumed (at \log L/L_{\odot}\lesssim 5.4) is still poorly explored, and more studies are needed to thoroughly map the empirical behavior, in particular, at Galactic metallicity.","Feedback from massive stars plays an important role in the thermal and dynamical evolution of the interstellar medium and galaxy halos (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2011, 2018; Andersson et al. 2020). It is provided through jets, (ionizing) radiation, powerful stellar outflows, and, when their cores ultimately collapse, through supernovae (e.g., Kuiper & Hosokawa 2018; Dale & Bonnell 2011; Luisi et al. 2016; Geen et al. 2020; Efstathiou 2000; McLeod et al. 2019). The mass and angular momentum that are lost through their stellar outflows (processes that persist throughout their lives) strongly influence the evolution of massive stars (e.g., Puls et al. 2008; Langer 2012; Renzo et al. 2017; Vink 2022). At Galactic metallicities, mass loss causes the mass at the end of carbon burning to be 25 to 40% of the initial mass for stars that started their lives with 20 M_{\odot} or more (Ekström et al. 2012). The cumulative mass loss experienced by a massive star throughout its evolution is found to be a function of the initial stellar metal content (see below). Metal-poor hot luminous stars have weaker winds, as has been shown empirically for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, e.g., Brands et al. 2022), the Small Magellanic Clould (SMC, e.g., Ramachandran et al. 2019), and for sub-SMC (e.g., Garcia et al. 2014; Bouret et al. 2015). One consequence of this is that properties of core-collapse supernovae are expected and are found to differ for galaxies with low and high metal content. Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (e.g., Modjaz et al. 2008; Heger et al. 2003; Savaglio et al. 2009), superluminous supernovae (e.g., Chen et al. 2017), and pair-instability supernovae (e.g., Young et al. 2010), for instance, favor lower-metallicity environments. It also implies that the first stars to form in the Universe (e.g., Hirano et al. 2015; Hosokawa et al. 2016) must have lost relatively little mass (e.g., Kudritzki 2002), with important consequences for their end-of-life products (e.g., Marigo et al. 2003). An accurate understanding of the mass loss from massive stars is therefore very important, including its dependence on the metal content. On the theory side, the hot-phase driving mechanism has been identified to be radiation pressure on the metal lines of mostly CNO and iron-group elements that are clustered in the ultraviolet, where the stars emit the bulk of their radiation (e.g., Lucy & Solomon 1970; Castor et al. 1975; Abbott & Lucy 1985; Pauldrach et al. 1986; Puls et al. 1996). Combined stellar atmosphere and hydrodynamical methods that take into account several 10^{5} of these lines have been developed to make quantitative predictions (de Koter et al. 1997; Vink et al. 2001; Sander et al. 2017; Krtička & Kubát 2018; Björklund et al. 2021; Gormaz-Matamala et al. 2022a). The behavior of mass loss versus metallicity was probed by studies of the solar metallicity and of the LMC (Z=0.5\,Z_{\odot}), and SMC (Z=0.2\,Z_{\odot}) metallicities. When they were based on relatively high-luminosity sources (\log L/L_{\odot}\gtrsim 5.4), where wind signatures in H\alpha and He ii 4686 are clearly visible, the studies inferred a luminosity-independent behavior \dot{M}\propto Z^{0.5-0.8} (Mokiem et al. 2007; Marcolino et al. 2022). To constrain the mass-loss properties for lower-luminosity stars, the spectral analysis relies strongly on the ultraviolet spectral range, where UV resonance lines such as C iv 1548,1550 Å provide more sensitive probes of the wind strength. Marcolino et al. (2022) used a compilation of UV and optical studies to first address this parameter space and tentatively found a weaker or even vanishing dependence on Z: \dot{M}\propto Z^{0.1} at \log L/L_{\odot}=4.5. They stressed that their findings should be tested with larger samples that include more accurate determinations of the terminal wind velocity. The combination of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) (Roman-Duval et al. 2020) and Very Large Telescope (VLT) X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) (Vink et al. 2023) programs provides high-quality spectra of OB stars in the Magellanic Clouds with an extensive wavelength coverage from the UV to the optical. We analyze a sample of O4 to O9.5 dwarfs, giants, bright giants, and supergiants in the SMC from these programs. The spectra allow us to constrain the photospheric conditions and a range of wind properties, including inhomogeneities in the outflow and the terminal velocity. To gain insight into the metallicity dependence of our findings, we compare them with similar studies of Galactic (Hawcroft et al. 2021) and LMC stars (Hawcroft et al. 2024a, Brands et al. in prep.). A major challenge in the empirical determination of mass-loss rates is the inhomogeneity in the wind, which is also referred to as clumping. These clumps are overdense regions that are surrounded by lower density material. Clumps affect the strength of spectral lines both directly and indirectly. They affect the lines directly in the case of recombination lines, such as H\alpha and He ii 4686, the strength of which depends on the mean of the square of the density of the medium; and they affect them indirectly in the case of lines that trace ionic species whose ionization balance shifted significantly because the different density. Scattering lines of abundant ionic species, such as C iv 1550 Å, may be unaffected by clumping depending on the stellar temperature, however. Because of these different effects, clumping has been suggested and used as solution for the discrepancies between inferred mass-loss rate from different diagnostic lines (e.g. Bouret et al. 2003; Fullerton et al. 2006). Whether wind clumping itself is a function of metallicity and/or luminosity has been little explored so far. If this is the case, it may affect the derived mass-loss properties and should thus be accounted for when the empirical \dot{M}(Z) or \dot{M}(L,Z) relations are derived. This challenging problem is a goal of this study as well. So far, Driessen et al. (2022) reported a weak relation between the metallicity and the clumping factor in 2D line-deshadowing instability simulations. Parsons et al. (2024) reported a similar trend for structures that appeared in single-epoch observations of wind lines in the UV spectra of B supergiants. This paper is organized as follows. We describe the data and the sample in Section 2, along with the data preparation and normalization process. The model and fitting routine are presented in Section 3. Section 4 shows and describes the best-fit line profiles and the corresponding stellar and wind parameters. In Section 5, we briefly discuss the evolutionary stage of the sample stars and present the implications for \dot{M}(L,Z), and the wind structure parameters. Finally, Section 6 lists the main conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06647v2,Multiplicity of Galactic Cepheids from long-baseline interferometry V. High-accuracy orbital parallax and mass of SU Cygni,"Aims. We aim at accurately measuring the dynamical mass and distance of Cepheids by combining radial velocity measurements with interferometric observations. Cepheid mass measurements are particularly necessary to help solving the Cepheid mass discrepancy, while independent distance determinations provide crucial test of the period-luminosity relation and Gaia parallaxes.Methods. We used the multi-telescope interferometric combiners Michigan InfraRed Combiner (MIRC) of the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array to detect and measure the astrometric positions of the high-contrast companion orbiting the Galactic Cepheid SU Cygni. We also present new radial velocity measurements from ultraviolet spectra taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. The combination of interferometric astrometry with optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy provided the full orbital elements of the system, in addition to component masses and the distance to the Cepheid system.Results. We measured the mass of the Cepheid, M_{A}=4.859\pm 0.058\,M_{\odot}, and its two companions, M_{Ba}=3.595\pm 0.033\,M_{\odot} and M_{Bb}=1.546\pm 0.009\,M_{\odot}. This is the most accurate existing measurement of the mass of a Galactic Cepheid (1.2 %). Comparing with stellar evolution models, we show that the mass predicted by the tracks is higher than the measured mass of the Cepheid, similar to conclusions of our previous work. We also measured the distance to the system to be 926.3\pm 5.0 pc, i.e. an unprecedented parallax precision of 6\,\muas (0.5 %), being the most precise and accurate distance for a Cepheid. Such precision is similar to what is expected by Gaia for the last data release (DR5 in \sim 2030) for single stars fainter than G=13, but is not guaranteed for stars as bright as SU Cyg.Conclusions. We demonstrated that evolutionary models remain inadequate in accurately reproducing the measured mass, often predicting higher masses for the expected metallicity, even when factors such as rotation or convective core overshooting are taken into account. Our precise distance measurement allowed us to compare prediction from some period-luminosity relations. We found a disagreement of 0.2-0.5 mag with relations calibrated from photometry, while relations calibrated from direct distance measurement are in better agreement","One of the most discussed topics in astrophysics today is the tension between the Hubble constant H_{0} determined for the present universe based on Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae and that from the early universe based on Planck satellite Cosmic Microwave Background observations (see e.g. Freedman 2021). Extensive efforts are being made to reduce uncertainties involved, since the discrepancy hints at possible new physics. For Cepheids (the foundation of the local determination), the Leavitt (Period-Luminosity) Law needs to be calibrated to the highest accuracy and we need to understand the physics of Cepheid pulsation and evolution as thoroughly as possible. A crucial test of our understanding is the luminosity at the Cepheid stage for a given stellar mass. Evolutionary tracks are beginning to incorporate new insights about rotation in stellar interiors from astroseismology in phases leading up to the Cepheid stage. Thus Cepheid masses of the highest accuracy coupled with very accurate luminosities (partly through Gaia among other approaches) are a stringent test of forefront stellar modelling, and an important underpinning of objects used in deriving H_{0}. It has been known since the first hydrodynamic modelling of Cepheid pulsation in the 1960’s that masses inferred from pulsation and evolutionary calculations differed. This difference has now been reduced to \leq 20 %. The most cited scenarios to explain this discrepancy are a mass-loss mechanism during the Cepheid’s evolution, convective core overshooting, and rotation during the main-sequence stage (Anderson et al. 2014; Neilson et al. 2011; Keller 2008; Bono et al. 2006), but none agrees with the measured dynamical mass (Evans et al. 2024b, 2018a). This discrepancy points to an uncomfortable lack in our understanding of objects important in the H_{0} tension. While calibration of Cepheid luminosities will be significantly improved in the final Gaia release, masses can only be directly measured in binary systems, and hence only a limited number are available. We currently have two capabilities available which have made it possible to directly measure masses for several non-eclipsing Cepheids. High resolution spectra in the ultraviolet (UV) allow the orbital velocity amplitude of hot companions of Cepheids to be measured. Combining this with the orbital amplitude of the Cepheid from the ground-based orbit provides the mass ratio. In addition, interferometry has resolved a number of systems, providing the semi-major axis (a_{1}+a_{2}) and the inclination. V1334~Cyg is a system for which complete observational data are available: an interferometric orbit and a mass ratio from the orbital velocity amplitudes for the Cepheid and the companion (Gallenne et al. 2018). For this combination both the masses of the stars and a distance can be determined, resulting in the most accurate mass and distance to a Galactic Cepheid (M_{A}=4.29\pm 0.13\,M_{\odot},d=720.4\pm 7.8 pc). This paper is part of a series discussing binary or multiple systems containing Cepheids, and what can be inferred about Cepheid masses from them. SU~Cyg = HD 186688 = HR 7518 is a V=6.44 mag Cepheid star with a period of 3.85 d. It has a asymmetric light curve and a large pulsation amplitude, consistent with pulsation in the fundamental mode. Orbital motion in the system containing the Cepheid SU Cyg was found by Hellerich (1919). An orbit was first determined by Evans (1988). Ground-based velocities of the Cepheid were then combined with velocities of the companion from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) satellite by Evans & Bolton (1990). The companion was found to be itself a short-period binary. This produced a dynamical lower limit to the mass of the Cepheid of 5.9\pm 0.4\,M_{\odot}. The stars in the system are thus A (the Cepheid), Ba (the hottest star) and Bb. Inspection of a low resolution International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectrum showed that the star B has a strong Ga II feature at 1400Å, indicative of a chemically peculiar HgMn star (Evans 1995). This is consistent with a rotation rate slowed to synchronize with the orbital period of 4.67 d. This was further discussed by Wahlgren & Evans (1998). In this paper we revisit the SU Cyg system using new UV spectra from the Hubble space telescope and new interferometric observations with the goal of measuring accurate dynamical masses and distance. We present the observations and the data reduction process in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 we detailed the data analysis to extract radial velocities and astrometric motion, which we then used for a global orbital fit in Sect. 4. We then discussed our results in Sect. 5 and conclude in Sect. 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06351v1,A shock crashing into confined dense circumstellar matter brightens the nascent SN 2023ixf,"Red supergiants may experience a short-lived period of episodic mass loss rather than steady winds before their core collapses, leading to dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Interaction of SN ejecta with such nearby CSM can generate additional radiation, appending to the cooling radiation from the shock breakout of the progenitor envelope, to brighten the nascent SN explosion. This phenomenon is conspicuous for SN 2023ixf as its V-band brightness showed a rapid increase of about three magnitudes from the first to the third day after the explosion, which is distinctive among type II SNe with flash ionized signatures. In this paper, we employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate the radiative diffusion process in the unshocked CSM. Considering a wide range of mass-loss rates from 10^{-5} to 10^{-2} M⊙ yr-1, we found that the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf can be fitted by the interaction of the SN ejecta with a CSM having a mass-loss rate of about 10^{-2} M⊙ yr-1 located within 10^{15} cm to the progenitor.","When massive stars deplete their nuclear fuel, the collapse of the core creates an explosive event known as core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Several pre-explosion detections support the scenario that red supergiants (RSGs) are the progenitor of type II SNe with plateau-shaped light curves (e.g., Smartt 2009). Thanks to the wide-field optical survey programs and the fast-responding spectroscopically follow-up observations, a relatively large fraction of type II SNe were found to display short-lived narrow emission lines in their early-phase spectra (Gal-Yam et al., 2014; Khazov et al., 2016; Yaron et al., 2017; Hosseinzadeh et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020; Bruch et al., 2021; Tartaglia et al., 2021). These emission lines arise from the recombination of the highly ionized gas in the compact circumstellar matter (CSM) due to the emerging shock breakout (Kochanek, 2019). Apart from the cooling radiation of the shock breakout, the subsequent interaction between the ejecta and the nearby CSM could also generate additional radiation, resulting in an early-phase fast-rising light curve relating to a scenario of an RSG embedded in the dense confined CSM. SN 2023ixf, a type II SN exploded in Messier 101 (M101) (Itagaki, 2023) and was serendipitously captured by amateur astronomers; this provides a crucial chance for constraining the SN progenitor systems. The intra-night observations of SN 2023ixf over the first few days since the discovery delineate the early-phase evolution of its ionized flash signatures. The narrow emission lines from the recombination of the ionized gas rapidly decrease and mostly disappear a week later, suggesting the existence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to the progenitor star (Bostroem et al., 2023; Hiramatsu et al., 2023; Jacobson-Galán et al., 2023; Smith et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). Pre-explosion archival images from the HST and the Spitzer Space Telescope indicate that the progenitor of SN 2023ixf is an RSG with a dusty environment and it experienced eruptive or episodic mass loss shortly before the explosion (Dong et al., 2023; Jencson et al., 2023; Kilpatrick et al., 2023; Soraisam et al., 2023; Neustadt et al., 2024; Xiang et al., 2024). Therefore, SN 2023ixf is an excellent example to investigate the mass-loss history of massive stars before core collapse. M101 is an attractive target to amateur astronomers who monitor it frequently, leading to the first detection of SN 2023ixf about one day earlier than the discovery (Mao et al., 2023). These rare chromatic images recorded the radiation from the shock breakout of the RSG envelope and exhibited a color redder than the typical model predictions. Li et al. (2024) suggest that there is time-variant extinction due to the sublimation of circumstellar dust during the spherical phase of the shock breakout. On the other hand, shock cooling and the ejecta-CSM interaction contribute to the radiation a few days after the explosion, resulting in the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf (Li et al., 2024; Zimmerman et al., 2024). In this paper, we focus on the ejecta-CSM interaction process to fit the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf. Section 2 describes our Monte Carlo method to simulate the radiative diffusion process in the unshocked CSM, and Section 3 displays the results. The discussions and conclusions are given in Section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06330v1,"Simulating Solar Neighborhood Brown Dwarfs I:
The Luminosity Function Above and Below the Galactic Plane","Brown dwarfs form the key, yet poorly understood, link between stellar and planetary astrophysics. These objects offer unique tests of Galactic structure, but observational limitations have inhibited the large-scale analysis of these objects to date. Major upcoming sky surveys will reveal unprecedented numbers of brown dwarfs, among even greater numbers of stellar objects, enabling the statistical study of brown dwarfs. To extract the comparatively rare brown dwarfs from these massive datasets, we must understand how they will look in upcoming surveys. In this work, we construct a synthetic population of brown dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood to explore their evolutionary properties using Gaia-derived star formation histories alongside observational mass, metallicity, and age relationships. We apply the cloudless Sonora Bobcat, hybrid SM08, and gravity-dependent hybrid Sonora Diamondback evolutionary models to the sample. We present the simulated luminosity function and its evolution with distance from the Galactic Plane. Our simulation shows that brown dwarf population statistics are a function of height above/below the Galactic Plane and sample different age distributions. Interpreting the local sample requires combining evolutionary models, the initial mass function, the star formation history, and kinematic heating. Our models are a guide to how well height-dependent samples can test these scenarios. Sub-populations of brown dwarfs farther from the Plane are older and occupy a different region of brown dwarf parameter space than younger sub-populations closer to the Galactic Plane. Therefore, fully exploring population statistics both near and far from the Plane is critical to prepare for upcoming surveys.","The study of brown dwarfs, sub-stellar objects that lack the ability to fuse hydrogen, has been driven by large-scale digital sky surveys for the past 30 years. Originally theorized in 1962 (Kumar, 1962), brown dwarfs have been discovered through dedicated surveys with large facilities such as 2MASS (Kirkpatrick et al., 1999; Gizis et al., 2000), PAN-STARRS1 (Deacon et al., 2014; Best et al., 2018), WISE (Cushing et al., 2011; Kirkpatrick et al., 2011), DENIS (Delfosse et al., 1997), SDSS (Leggett et al., 2000), and UKIRT West et al. (2004), but also as foreground contaminants in extragalactic surveys (Hainline et al., 2024; Tee et al., 2023). We are entering an exciting time for brown dwarf science as the next generation of observation facilities become a reality and start to come online. Observatories such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Euclid, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope promise to drastically increase the discovery rate for brown dwarfs and propel the field forward. Brown dwarfs are cold, sub-stellar objects that extend beyond the main sequence through spectral types L (Martín et al., 1999; Kirkpatrick et al., 1999), T (Burgasser et al., 2002; Geballe et al., 2002), and Y (Delorme et al., 2008; Cushing et al., 2011). These objects have effective temperatures below \sim2400, 1300, and 600 K, respectively. As such, these objects are faint in wavelengths shorter than 1 \mum and present a challenge to observe. Furthermore, since brown dwarfs are not massive enough to fuse hydrogen in their cores, they perpetually cool and grow dimmer, only increasing the difficulty of their observation. Brown dwarfs are excellent probes for tracing Galactic evolution and structure (Burgasser, 2009). Their kinematics have been used to study their population distributions as well as mapping out the structure of the Milky Way’s thin disk (Faherty et al., 2009; Kirkpatrick et al., 2024). Furthermore, distant M-, L-, and T-type dwarfs can help measure thin disk structure and constrain the thick disk and halo scale heights (Aganze et al., 2022). Therefore, the ability to detect more distant brown dwarfs and understand their formation mechanisms with current and future surveys will play a key role in mapping the Milky Way and advancing such science cases. Accurately modeling the atmospheres of brown dwarfs is a complicated affair. While their interiors are well known to be fully convective, their atmospheres are complex, filled with molecular features and weather that depend on temperature and pressure evolution (Burrows et al., 2006). The warmer L-dwarfs are covered by cloudy atmospheres, but the observation of these clouds is inclination-dependent (Suárez et al., 2023). As brown dwarfs cool through the L-sequence and into the T-sequence, the clouds sediment and “rain out” minerals and metals leading to clear, cloudless atmospheres (Burrows et al., 2006). These T-dwarfs are further characterized by strong molecular features and the emergence of methane bands in their spectra. Finally, the coolest Y-dwarfs spectral energy peaks at \sim5 \mum and show large spectral absorption features from molecules like water, methane, ammonia, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide (Cushing et al., 2011). It appears increasingly likely that late-T and Y dwarf spectra can be described by a second parameter other than temperature, such as metallicity or surface gravity (Beiler et al., 2023). These diverse spectral types are not distinct classifications without overlap, but rather form an evolutionary sequence brown dwarfs undergo as they age and cool. The cooling mechanisms of brown dwarfs are an area of active research for future surveys. In order to prepare for next-generation surveys that will reveal these dim populations of brown dwarfs and enable the statistical analysis of their characteristics, we must understand their underlying distribution within the Galaxy. We turn to simulating the Solar Neighborhood population of brown dwarfs to predict the characteristics of brown dwarfs that future surveys will see. Previously, the creation of synthetic populations required assuming a birth-rate, star formation rate, and an underlying exponential distribution with height above the Galactic Plane (Ryan et al., 2022). We present a novel approach using recent Gaia results in conjunction with recent observational relations to build synthetic populations of brown dwarfs. This paper presents our simulation of Solar Neighborhood brown dwarfs. In Section 2 we build the synthetic population of brown dwarfs. We present the results of the simulation as parameter functions in Section 3. The implications of the results are discussed and compared to recent studies in Section 4. Our conclusions and future work are summarized in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05906v1,"Galaxy Tomography with the Gravitational Wave Background 
from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries","The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar timing arrays suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole binary population. Although the observed spectrum generally aligns with predictions from orbital evolution driven by gravitational wave emission in circular orbits, there is a discernible preference for a turnover at the lowest observed frequencies. This turnover could indicate a significant hardening phase, transitioning from early environmental influences to later stages predominantly influenced by gravitational wave emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. By analyzing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we assess how the gravitational wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile prior to disruption by binary ejections, accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. Our findings suggest a parsec-scale galactic center density around \displaystyle 10^{6}\,M_{\odot}/\textrm{pc}^{3} across most of the parameter space, offering insights into the environmental effects on black hole evolution and combined matter density near galaxy centers.","Recent advances by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), leveraging precise measurements of timing residuals within a galactic-scale detector, have ushered in a new era of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) detection. The SGWB, defined by a superposition of incoherent gravitational waves (GWs), initially emerged as a common-spectrum process [1, 2, 3, 4]. Subsequent data provided robust evidence of a quadrupolar correlation function [5, 6, 7, 8], famously known as the Hellings-Downs curve [9], further affirming the SGWB’s presence and characteristics. The observed spectrum of the SGWB is consistent with expectations for a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), dominated by binaries with comparable mass ratios, total masses in the range of \displaystyle 10^{9.2-10.4}\,M_{\odot}, and redshifts from \displaystyle 0.15 to \displaystyle 0.9 [10, 11], where \displaystyle M_{\odot} represents the solar mass. Although the spectrum is consistent with a steady spectral slope driven by GW emission from circular binaries, it also suggests a low-frequency turnover [10, 12]. This feature implies an acceleration in the rate of orbital hardening, offering a potential solution to the final parsec problem [13, 14]. Possibilities include interactions with environmental factors—such as gas [15, 16], stars [17], and dark matter (DM) [18]—and the impact of significant initial orbital eccentricities [19, 20, 21]. An intriguing aspect of environmental interactions involves the role of stars and particle DM, which are noted for their potentially high density in galactic centers (GCs) [22, 23, 24]. Both stars and DM can be expelled from the system through gravitational slingshots during encounters with binary components, thereby extracting orbital energy [17]. This process involves three-body scattering, where the energy extraction efficiency is significantly higher than that of two-body dynamical friction [25], especially when the binary components have comparable masses and are sufficiently close. Such three-body slingshot interactions can substantially alter the density profile of the GC, particularly flattening the inner distribution [18, 26]. This underscores the importance of considering the co-evolution of the density profile and the binary orbit. A pivotal study by Ref. [27] demonstrates that the orbital hardening rate observed in N-body simulations can be effectively approximated by results from scattering experiments [17] within environments characterized by the GC distribution at the SMBHB influence radius [28] prior to disruption. In this study, we examine the impact of initial GC density profiles and SMBHB eccentricities on the SGWB spectrum, utilizing NANOGrav’s 15-year dataset to constrain the parameter space of these two factors."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05905v1,Robustness of Neural Ratio and Posterior Estimators to Distributional Shifts for Population-Level Dark Matter Analysis in Strong Gravitational Lensing,"We investigate the robustness of Neural Ratio Estimators (NREs) and Neural Posterior Estimators (NPEs) to distributional shifts in the context of measuring the abundance of dark matter subhalos using strong gravitational lensing data. While these data-driven inference frameworks can be accurate on test data from the same distribution as the training sets, in real applications, it is expected that simulated training data and true observational data will differ in their distributions. We explore the behavior of a trained NRE and trained sequential NPEs to estimate the population-level parameters of dark matter subhalos from a large sample of images of strongly lensed galaxies with test data presenting distributional shifts within and beyond the bounds of the training distribution in the nuisance parameters (e.g., the background source morphology). While our results show that NREs and NPEs perform well when tested perfectly in distribution, they exhibit significant biases when confronted with slight deviations from the examples seen in the training distribution. This indicates the necessity for caution when applying NREs and NPEs to real astrophysical data, where high-dimensional underlying distributions are not perfectly known.","One of the most striking open problems in modern astrophysics is that the nature of \sim 80\% of the matter content of the universe is remains unknown (e.g., Davis et al., 1985; Blumenthal et al., 1984; White et al., 1987; Bertone et al., 2005). This form of matter, called dark matter, is believed to consist of new, invisible particles that do not interact with regular matter electromagnetically. Shedding light on the nature of the dark matter particle is one of the main goals of modern cosmology and particle astrophysics (e.g., Drlica-Wagner et al., 2019). It has been well understood that different dark matter particle properties can result in different spatial distributions of dark matter structures on various scales (e.g., Kuhlen et al., 2012). Thus, by measuring the spatial distribution of dark matter it is possible to discriminate between different dark matter models. The most commonly accepted dark matter model, Cold Dark Matter (CDM) has been able to explain the observations of the large scale structure (e.g., the Cosmic Microwave Background, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, weak lensing, etc.) with great precision and accuracy (e.g., Hinshaw et al., 2013; Planck Collaboration et al., 2020). However, on subgalactic scales a number of discrepancies between the predictions of CDM and the observations of the dwarf satellites of the Milky Way have given rise to the possibility of alternative dark matter models (e.g., Kravtsov & Borgani, 2012). Strong gravitational lensing, the formation of multiple images of distant light sources due to the deflection of their light rays by the gravity of intervening structures, is a powerful probe of the subgalactic distribution of matter in the lensing galaxies and along the line-of-sight to the background sources due to its purely gravitational nature. Since different spatial distributions for the projected matter density can result in different distortions in the images, the analysis of lensed images allows the inference of these projected densities, including the abundance and distribution of subhalos. These can then be related to population-level parameters such as the halo mass function on these subgalactic scales, which are directly linked to predictions of dark matter models. However, measuring the effect of small halos on lensed images is a challenging, nonlinear inverse problem. The signal is weak and suffers from multiple degeneracies with other nuisance parameters, such as the morphology of the background source. Furthermore, the properties of a population of dark matter subhalos correspond to a high-dimensional space (e.g., the positions and masses of a large number of subhalos), making the inference of the abundance and distribution of subhalos a difficult problem for traditional, explicit likelihood modeling methods. Past works have introduced a number of approximations in an attempt to make the problem tractable, for example by assuming Gaussian priors, linearizing the lensing model, limiting the analysis to only modeling the effect of the most massive subhalos, or performing a power-spectrum analysis (e.g., Vegetti et al., 2010; Hezaveh et al., 2016b, a; Cyr-Racine et al., 2016; Birrer et al., 2017; Brennan et al., 2019; Despali et al., 2020). Despite these simplifications, these methods are still generally computationally costly, which limits the possibility of extensive testing them for potential biases. Neural network inference frameworks, such as Neural Ratio Estimators (NREs) and Neural Posterior Estimators (NPEs), have recently emerged as a promising solution to these problems since they can be trained to approximate the intractable likelihood or the posterior of parameter distributions directly from high-dimensional input data (e.g., Cranmer et al., 2015; Baldi et al., 2016; Papamakarios & Murray, 2016; He et al., 2016; Brehmer et al., 2018, 2018, 2020). In principle, both analysis frameworks can marginalize over large numbers of nuisance parameters and return an optimal, unbiased likelihood or posterior for the parameters of interest. Within the context of subhalo studies with strong gravitational lensing, this means directly inferring parameters describing the population-level distribution of subhalos (e.g., the subhalo mass function) from a collection of strong lensing systems, while marginalizing over nuisance parameters, including the source galaxy morphologies, the macro-lens parameters, and the parameters of an a priori unknown number of individual subhalos. Recent work has demonstrated the promise of such approaches to circumvent approximations of the intractable likelihood in strong gravitational lensing (e.g., Brehmer et al., 2019; Coogan et al., 2022; Mishra-Sharma, 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Karchev et al., 2023; Wagner-Carena et al., 2023, 2024; Zhang et al., 2024). Despite their potential, these methods face challenges when applied to real observational data. While these methods have been shown to work well when tested on data coming from the same distribution as the training data, their performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data is not guaranteed. These subhalo inference frameworks rely on producing large volumes of labeled, simulated data for training, requiring a detailed match between the distributions of real and simulated data for unbiased inference. However, even using the most sophisticated simulation pipelines, it is to be expected that there will always remain some level of mismatch between synthetic and real data distributions. Given the weakness of the expected signal of interest, this leaves NPEs and NREs vulnerable to biased inference. In this work, we investigate the performance of NREs and NPEs for the inference of the subhalo mass function in the presence of realistic distributional shifts between the training and test datasets. We produce several simulated datasets with minor variations in background source morphologies, the distribution of lens macro model parameters, subhalo profiles, and observational noise statistics and show that when the training and test datasets are distributionally shifted, the performance of the NRE and NPE can be dramatically affected. Note that these experiments are not meant to explore an exhaustive list of possible distributional shifts, but rather to establish the vulnerability of this class of methods to such shifts in strong lensing analysis. In Section 2 we describe the simulations and the inference frameworks. In Section 3 we describe the data generation process for the inference frameworks. In Section 4, we present the details of the distributional shifts considered. In Section 5 we present the performance of the inference frameworks on OOD tests and present our conclusions in Section 6. In what follows, we adopt a flat \LambdaCDM cosmology with parameters from Planck Collaboration et al. (2020)."
