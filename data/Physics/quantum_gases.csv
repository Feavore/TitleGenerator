https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09877v1,Distribution Function for n\geq g Quantum Particles,"A new quantum mechanical distribution function n^{I}(\varepsilon), is derived for the condition n\geq g, where in contrast to the exclusion principle n\leq g for fermions, each energy state must be populated by at least one particle. Although the particles share many features with bosons, the anomalous behavior of n^{I}(\varepsilon) precludes Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) due to the required occupancy of the excited states, which creates a permanently pressurized background at T=0, similar to the degeneracy pressure of fermions. An exhaustive classification scheme is presented for both distinguishable and indistinguishable, particles and energy levels based on Richard Stanley’s twelvefold way in combinatorics.","References Kittel (2005) C.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09744v1,Measuring Hall voltage and Hall resistance in an atom-based quantum simulator,"The Hall effect [1, 2, 3, 4] has a paramount role in a wide range of disciplines, from applied sciences [5, 6] to the fundamental exploration of novel topological phases of matter [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In the solid state, this effect describes the emergence of a voltage drop perpendicular to the current flow in the presence of a magnetic field, leading to a transverse Hall resistance. Despite its fundamental nature, a full understanding and control of the Hall effect in interacting quantum systems is still lacking. This has led to the development of quantum simulators based on neutral atoms [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], where strongly correlated and universal manifestations of the Hall effect were recently unveiled [21, 22]. However, a direct measurement of the Hall voltage and of the Hall resistance in those systems was not achieved so far. Here, we demonstrate a technique for the measurement of the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator. From that we provide the first direct measurement of the Hall resistance in a non-electron-based system and study its dependence on the carrier density, along with theoretical analyses. Our work closes a major gap between analog quantum simulations and measurements performed in real solid-state systems, providing a key tool for the exploration of the Hall effect in highly tunable and strongly correlated systems.","References Ashcroft and Mermin [1976] N.

with neural quantum states","Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states—specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS)—to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the t-J model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as 6\times 10 sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.","References D.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10085v1,"Entanglement entropy dynamics of non-Gaussian states
in free boson systems: random sampling approach","We develop a random sampling method for calculating the time evolution of the Rényi entanglement entropy after a quantum quench from an insulating state in free boson systems. Because of the non-Gaussian nature of the initial state, calculating the Rényi entanglement entropy calls for the exponential cost of computing a matrix permanent. We numerically demonstrate that a simple random sampling method reduces the computational cost of a permanent; for an N_{\mathrm{s}}\times N_{\mathrm{s}} matrix corresponding to N_{\mathrm{s}} sites at half filling, the sampling cost becomes \mathcal{O}(2^{\alpha N_{\mathrm{s}}}) with a constant \alpha\ll 1, in contrast to the conventional algorithm with the \mathcal{O}(2^{N_{\mathrm{s}}}) number of summations requiring the exponential-time cost. Although the computational cost is still exponential, this improvement allows us to obtain the entanglement entropy dynamics in free boson systems for more than 100 sites. We present several examples of the entanglement entropy dynamics in low-dimensional free boson systems.","Understanding dynamics of quantum many-body systems is a central issue in modern physics. The entanglement entropy is a key quantity to characterize the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. Previous studies have shown that the entanglement entropy provides information on the thermalization process and the propagation of quantum information [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Although the von Neumann entanglement entropy is not a directly measurable quantity, there are several proposals to measure Rényi entanglement entropy [33, 34, 35]. Recent experiments have successfully observed the dynamics of the Rényi entanglement entropy using ultracold atoms in optical lattices [36, 37] and trapped ions [38]. The numerical simulation of dynamics of the the entanglement entropy is also an important approach to understanding quantum many-body systems and providing a benchmark for experiments. In contrast to the fermion and spin systems, the boson systems are much harder to simulate because of the large number of local Hilbert spaces. Even in the free boson systems with simple initial states, such as the Mott insulating state and the charge-density-wave (CDW) state, the entanglement entropy dynamics is difficult to calculate because of the non-Gaussian nature of the initial states. Although the analytical formula for the entanglement entropy is formally obtained by a matrix permanent, its numerical evaluation requires the exponential cost [30]. This situation limits the system size that can be studied to a few tens of sites or particles. Therefore, understanding dynamics of the entanglement entropy in boson systems remains to be a challenging problem even in noninteracting systems. In this paper, we develop a random sampling method for calculating the time evolution of the Rényi entanglement entropy in free boson systems. In the developed method, we still need to evaluate the matrix permanent, which requires the exponential computational cost in general. However, the growth rate of the computational cost is much slower than the exact permanent calculation. We have numerically found that the computational cost is reduced to \mathcal{O}(2^{\alpha N_{\mathrm{s}}}) with a small constant \alpha\ll 1 and the system size N_{\mathrm{s}}. This improvement enables us to study dynamics of the entanglement entropy in free boson systems for more than 100 sites, confirming that the entanglement entropy in the long-time region exhibits the volume-law scaling as expected. This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we briefly review the calculation of the Rényi entanglement entropy in free boson systems and describe the conventional algorithm for evaluating the entanglement entropy, which requires the computation of a matrix permanent. To reduce the computational cost, we propose a random sampling method for the matrix permanent. In Sec. III, we examine the performance of the random sampling method by estimating the size dependence of the statistical error. We then present numerical results for dynamics of the entanglement entropy in free boson systems for spatial one (1D) and two dimensions (2D). Finally, in Sec. IV, we summarize our results and discuss future prospects. For simplicity, we set \hbar=1 and take the lattice constant to be unity throughout this paper."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09186v1,Acceleration-driven dynamics of  in coplanar superfluid rings,"Precise control of topologically protected excitations, such as quantum vortices in atomtronic circuits, opens new possibilities for future quantum technologies. We theoretically investigate the dynamics of Josephson vortices (rotational fluxons) induced by coupled persistent currents in a system of coplanar double-ring atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. We study the Josephson effect in an atomic Josephson junction formed by coaxial ring-shaped condensates. Tunneling superflows, initiated by an imbalance in atomic populations between the rings, are significantly influenced by the persistent currents in the inner and outer rings. This results in pronounced Josephson oscillations in the population imbalance for both co-rotating and non-rotating states. If a linear acceleration is applied to the system, our analysis reveals peculiar azimuthal tunneling patterns and dynamics of Josephson vortices which leads to non-zero net tunneling current and shows sensitivity to the acceleration magnitude. When multiple Josephson vortices are present, asymmetric vortex displacements that correlate with both the magnitude and direction of acceleration can be measured, offering potential for quantum sensing applications.","The Josephson effect (JE), first predicted in superconductors [1, 2], has since been observed in a wide range of different types of Josephson junctions. Ring-shaped geometries are of particular interest, as they support stable supercurrents, commonly known as persistent currents. Cylindrical superconducting long Josephson junctions and fluxons have been the focus of extensive research over the past several decades [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 11, 12]. The observation of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) Josephson effects in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) by [16], along with subsequent studies on bosonic Josephson junctions by [17], has further stimulated theoretical and experimental investigations of Josephson effects in quantum gases. Persistent currents in toroidal atomic BECs have been the focus of extensive theoretical and experimental investigations as a signature of superfluidity at macroscopic scale [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. The toroidal trap geometry, characterized by a substantial central hole surrounding the axis of the condensate, inherently bounds the core of the vortex states within the effective potential trap. This confinement enhances the stability even for multicharged vortices. The robustness of persistent currents in a single ring naturally leads to the exploration of quantized angular momentum in two parallel-coupled superfluid rings, particularly concerning the JE in such a dual-ring configuration [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. A key phenomenon in such systems is the formation of Josephson vortices (JVs). These vortices, also known as rotational fluxons, result from the phase difference across a junction between two BECs. As topologically protected structures, they are very robust and valuable for quantum sensing applications [46, 47]. In atomic BEC systems, JVs are particularly important for exploring new applications in atomtronics, where their unique properties can be used for building quantum devices [48, 49]. Very recently, a side-by-side configuration of two rings connected by a tunable weak link was proposed as a physical platform for creating acceleration [50] and rotation [51] sensors, based on a threshold-driven vortex transfer approach previously introduced in [52]. In this setup, the barrier amplitude directly modulates vortex transitions, enabling discrete, measurable shifts that can be finely controlled, or even halted, by tuning the barrier strength. In the present work, we investigate the dynamics of JVs in a dual co-planar ring configuration of atomic BECs (see Fig.1). First, we study the AC JE in coaxially aligned toroidal condensates separated by a potential barrier. We demonstrate that tunneling superflows, initiated by an imbalance in atomic population between the rings, are strongly influenced by the persistent currents in both the inner and outer rings. This leads to pronounced Josephson oscillations in the population imbalance for rings with identical angular momentum states. In contrast, rings with different angular momentum states exhibit zero net current across the junction. We analyze the azimuthal pattern of the tunneling flow and JVs in the circular junction between rings. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of linear acceleration on vortex dynamics, showing that it induces an asymmetric displacement of the JVs. This asymmetry in JV position can be quantified and used to determine both the magnitude and direction of the acceleration. The article is organized as follows. In Section II we analyze Josephson oscillations and the dynamics of JVs in a double-ring system. We highlight several different dynamical regimes of the system depending on the topological charges of the rings and the magnitude of acceleration. Section III examines the relaxation dynamics of JVs under linear acceleration. It also demonstrates how the stabilized arrangement of Josephson vortices between the rings can be used to measure the direction and magnitude of the external acceleration. Section IV provides summary and conclusions. Figure 1: (a) Schematic of the coplanar double-ring BEC with counter-propagating superflows (green arrows) and JVs (black dotted lines).

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08942v1,Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality in superfluid vortex reconnections,"The minimum separation between reconnecting vortices in fluids and superfluids obeys a universal scaling law with respect to time. The pre-reconnection and the post-reconnection prefactors of this scaling law are different, a property related to irreversibility and to energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms. In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and post-reconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behaviour independent of the small-scale regularising dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.","Introduction.— Reconnections are the fundamental events that change the topology of the field lines in fluids and plasmas during their time evolution. Reconnections thus determine important physical properties, such as mixing and inter-scale energy transfer in fluids [1], or solar flares and tokamak instabilities in plasmas [2]. The nature of reconnections is more clearly studied if the field lines are concentrated in well-separated filamentary structures: vortices in fluids and magnetic flux tubes in plasmas. In superfluid helium this concentration is extreme, providing an ideal context: superfluid vorticity is confined to vortex lines of atomic thickness (approximately a_{0}\approx 10^{-10}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm m); a further simplification is that, unlike what happens in ordinary fluids, the circulation of a superfluid vortex is constrained to the quantized value \kappa=h/m=9.97\times 10^{-8}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm m^{2}/s, where m is the mass of one helium atom and h is Planck’s constant. It was in this superfluid context that it was theoretically and experimentally recognized [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] that reconnections share a universal property irrespective of the initial condition: the minimum distance between reconnecting vortices, \delta^{\pm}, scales with time, t, according to the form \delta^{\pm}(t)=A^{\pm}(\kappa|t-t_{0}|)^{1/2}, (1) where t_{0} is the reconnection time, and the dimensionless prefactors A^{-} and A^{+} refer respectively to before (t<t_{0}) and after (t>t_{0}) the reconnection. The same scaling law was then found for reconnections in ordinary viscous fluids [9]. In the case of a pure superfluid at temperature T=0\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm K, theoretical work based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) has shown that A^{+}>A^{-}, that is, after the reconnection, vortex lines move away from each others faster than in the initial approach; this result has been related to irreversibility [10, 11]. Indeed, a geometrical constraint imposes [11] that a piece of vortex length needs to be “deleted” during the reconnection process. In the GP model, this loss is possible by the emission of a rarefaction pulse created immediately after the reconnection [12, 6] which removes some of the kinetic energy and momentum of the vortex configuration. This vortex energy loss depends on the ratio A^{+}/A^{-}, which in turns defines the approaching angle of collision between the vortices, together with other several geometrical quantities [7, 11]. The temporal asymmetry A^{+}>A^{-} can be thus interpreted as a non-trivial manifestation of irreversibility, as it originates from an ideal hydrodynamic process independent of the small-scale regularisation mechanism of the fluid. Indeed, in classical fluid vortex reconnections, although the definition of A^{+} is more delicate as circulation is not necessarily conserved, the same asymmetry A^{+}>A^{-} was reported [9]. Instead of the generation of rarefaction pulses, like in the case of T=0 superfluids, close to the reconnection, the classical fluid creates a series of thin secondary structures that can be then efficiently dissipated by viscous dissipation. The case of superfluid helium at non-zero temperatures is more intriguing. Most experiments are performed at T>1\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm K, a regime in which in addition to quantum vortices, thermal excitations constitute a viscous liquid called the normal fluid. The normal fluid can steal energy from filaments and dissipate it by viscous effects, opening in that way more routes towards irreversibility. Modern visualisation techniques rely on hydrogen/deuterium tracer particles to decorate superfluid vortices [13, 4, 14, 15]. Numerous studies have provided insight into the post-reconnection dynamics and the prefactor A^{+}, but much less is known about A^{-} from experiments due to the challenges of visualising vortices approaching a reconnection. The aim of this Letter is to investigate the role played by the normal fluid in the reconnection dynamics. In particular, given the temperature dependence of the normal fluid’s properties, we study experimentally and numerically the temperature dependence of the prefactors A^{+} and A^{-} and numerically investigate the energy injected in the normal fluid. To achieve this aim we need a more powerful model than the GPE to account not only for the dynamics of the superfluid vortices, but also for the dynamics of the normal fluid. We show that at non-zero temperatures Eq. (1) and the relation A^{+}>A^{-} hold true, in agreement with experiments, revealing, for the first time, a temperature dependence of A^{+}/A^{-}. In addition, we show that a vortex reconnection represents an unusual kind of punctuated energy injection into the normal fluid which acts alongside the well-known (continual) friction. When applied to superfluid turbulence, this last result implies that, if the vortex line density (hence the frequency of reconnections) is large enough, vortex reconnections can maintain the normal fluid in a perturbed state."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09596v1,Toward the Observation of Entangled Pairs in BEC analogue Expanding Universes,"Pair creation is a fundamental prediction of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. While classical aspects of this phenomenon have been observed, the experimental confirmation of its quantum origin remains elusive. In this article, we quantify the entanglement produced by pair creation in a two dimensional Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) analogues of expanding universes and examine the impact of various experimental factors, including decoherence from thermal noise and losses. Our analysis evaluates the feasibility of detecting entanglement in these systems and identifies optimal experimental configurations for achieving this goal. Focusing on the experimental setup detailed in [1], we demonstrate that entanglement can be observed in these BEC analogues at a significance level of \sim 2\sigma with current capabilities, and at \gtrsim 3.3\sigma with minor improvements. Achieving this would provide unequivocal evidence of the quantum nature of pair creation and validate one of the most iconic predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.","The spontaneous creation of particle pairs triggered by the expansion of the universe was first identified by E. Schrödinger in the late 1930s, referring to it as an “alarming” phenomenon [2]. Schrödinger’s insights did not attract much attention at the time. This phenomenon was rediscovered by L. Parker about thirty years later, who, equipped with the modern language of quantum field theory (QFT), was able to firmly establish the phenomenon of spontaneous excitation of entangled pairs by the cosmic expansion [3, 4, 5]. These works laid the foundation for quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (QFTCS), a framework that has led to profound insights and predictions [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. As is often the case when discussing the intersection of quantum and gravitational effects, these phenomena are faint and difficult to be observable in the cosmos. Subsequently, Unruh proposed that similar effects might appear in other systems that can be recreated in the laboratory [14]. The key observation is that, although many of the predictions of QFTCS were first derived with gravitational backgrounds in mind, Einstein’s equations did not play any role, indicating that the fundamental predictions are universal aspects of quantum fields propagating on non-trivial effective geometries, regardless what the physical origin of the geometry is. Rapid progress in this field has led to outstanding experimental results that confirm classical aspects of QFTCS predictions in experimental analogues of the Hawking effect [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], superradiance [25, 26], pair creation in expanding universes [27, 28, 1, 29], and the dynamical Casimir effect [30]. These observations have been carried out on different physical platforms, confirming the universality of these phenomena [31]. Significant efforts are currently focused on detecting entanglement between the created quanta [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. This is of primary conceptual importance, because entanglement constitutes the core of pair creation in QFTs. Successfully observing entanglement would serve as a crucial benchmark, providing unambiguous confirmation of the quantum origin of the observed excitations. Observing entanglement, however, presents an extraordinary experimental challenge due to its inherently faint and fragile nature. Indeed, recent claims of observation in analogue spacetimes have been debated [44, 45, 46], and independent confirmation of this observation (see [47] for observation of quantum correlations in a related scenario, although without an analog background metric). Fortunately, technological advancements are progressing at a fast rate, making the observation of entanglement associated with spontaneous pair creation by dynamical backgrounds attainable in the near future [48]. Observing entanglement would rule out any classical explanation of the phenomenon [49, 50, 51, 52]. The goal of this article is to contribute to this exciting pursuit from the theoretical side. We aim at laying out effective tools for the quantification of the entanglement produced by pair creation, and of the way this entanglement is affected by various experimental factors, particularly by detrimental effects such as decoherence induced from thermal ambient noise and experimental losses. This quantification is of vital importance for the design of optimal experimental configurations. Although our approach is general and can be applied to a wide range of experimental setups (see, e.g., [39, 53, 54, 41]), in this article we apply it on a current experimental platform which utilizes quantum fluids—Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs)—to simulate a two-dimensional (2D) expanding universe [1]. Focusing on this particular experimental platform makes our analysis more concrete and tangible, allowing us to use realistic parameters in our calculations. But, most importantly, our focus is motivated by the fact that, as we discuss in this article, this platform is on the verge of observing entanglement originating from cosmological pair creation. Indeed, one of the key outcomes of our analysis is the identification of modest and achievable upgrades to the experiment aimed at reaching optimal configurations for detecting entanglement within the current capabilities and experimental constraints. The article is organized as follows. In section II we review the theory behind BEC analogs of expanding universes. In section III, we describe the experimental platform used in [1], in which classical aspects of acoustic waves compatible with the phenomenon of pair creation were detected after a single expansion ramp. In section IV, we present basic features of the Gaussian state formalism, and explain how to reconstruct the quantum state of the system from time-series measurements of density contrast correlations. We also discuss how to quantify entanglement in this setup. In section V, we discuss our modeling of the proposed experiment, and focus on quantifying the entanglement produced by pair creation. In section VI, we perform an optimization in experimental parameter space of expansion/contraction experiments aimed at maximizing entanglement detectability, showing how entanglement could be detected with current techniques. Finally, section VII provides a summary of the main results achieved and includes some discussions on potential future directions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09376v1,Trions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides,"The reduced dielectric screening in atomically thin semiconductors leads to remarkably strong electron interactions. As a result, bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and charged excitons (trions), which have binding energies in the hundreds and tens of meV, respectively, typically dominate the optical properties of these materials. However, the long-range nature of the interactions between charges represents a significant challenge to the exact calculation of binding energies of complexes larger than the exciton. Here, we demonstrate that the trion binding energy can be efficiently calculated directly from the three-body Schrödinger equation in momentum space. Key to this result is a highly accurate way of treating the pole of the electronic interactions at small momentum exchange (i.e., large separation between charges). Our results are in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, while yielding a substantially larger ratio of the trion to exciton binding energies than obtained in recent variational calculations. Our numerical approach may be extended to a host of different few-body problems in 2D semiconductors, and even potentially to the description of exciton polarons.","Two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained significant attention due to their unique electronic, optical, and mechanical properties, and their potential for applications in next-generation technologies such as nanoelectronics, photonics, sensing, energy storage, and optoelectronics Britnell et al. (2013); Schaibley et al. (2016). Many of these properties can be attributed to the presence of strongly bound few-body complexes, such as excitons (electron-hole bound states) and trions (bound states of an exciton with an electron or a hole), which arise from the reduced screening of the Coulomb interaction due to quantum confinement and the relatively heavy carrier masses in these materials Velický and Toth (2017). In monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), exciton binding energies have been found to be several hundred meV He et al. (2014); Chernikov et al. (2014), while trion binding energies have been reported to reach values up to 20 to 40 meV Mak et al. (2013); Arora et al. (2019); Zhu et al. (2015); Yang et al. (2015a); Ross et al. (2013); Wang et al. (2014); Plechinger et al. (2015); Singh et al. (2016) (see Refs. Wang et al. (2018); Durnev and Glazov (2018) for recent reviews). These values are substantially larger than in traditional quantum wells, such as GaAs Finkelstein et al. (1996); Bracker et al. (2005); Bar-Joseph (2005) and CdTe Kheng et al. (1993); Huard et al. (2000); Portella-Oberli et al. (2004); Moody et al. (2014), where the trion binding energy is of the order of 0.5-3 meV, and ZnSe, where it can reach 10 meV Astakhov et al. (2002). Larger binding energies are desirable as they prevent thermal dissociation, thus increasing their stability at room temperature, which is important for practical applications Mueller and Malic (2018); Emmanuele et al. (2020). From a theoretical perspective, calculations of the trion bound state are challenging due to the singular nature of the electronic interaction, both at long and short distances. For the case of unscreened Coulomb interactions in three dimensions, a precise treatment of the long-range divergence in momentum space was proposed by A. Landé and realized by Kwon and Tabakin in their work on hadronic atoms Kwon and Tabakin (1978). The key idea is to subtract and add an appropriately chosen factor to the interaction potential in order to produce a well-behaved effective potential in the numerical solution. This method has been tried and tested in the treatment of the Coulomb two-body problem both in the context of nuclear physics Landau (1983); Norbury et al. (1994); Ivanov and Mitroy (2001) and 2D semiconductors Laird et al. (2022), and is numerically inexpensive and accurate. The technique can also be applied to the Rytova-Keldysh potential de la Fuente Pico et al. (2024), which accounts for the spatially inhomogeneous dielectric screening of Coulomb interactions in a monolayer TMD Rytova (1967); Keldysh (1979); Cudazzo et al. (2011). In this paper, we apply the Landé subtraction technique to the calculation of trion binding energies in two-dimensional semiconductors, focusing on parameters relevant to monolayer TMDs as well as traditional quantum wells. We supplement the subtraction scheme with a simple iterative Lanczos-type method Stadler et al. (1991); Demmel (1997); Hadizadeh and Bayegan (2007); Hadizadeh et al. (2012), which allows us to calculate the trion energy directly from the momentum-space Schrödinger equation. For the case of equal electron and hole masses and uniform dielectric screening—which, due to its high symmetry, is the most investigated scenario—we find the trion binding energy to be 0.122\varepsilon_{X} (with \varepsilon_{X} the exciton binding energy). This indicates a stronger binding than that obtained with variational wave functions which predict trion binding energies \sim 0.11\varepsilon_{X} Sergeev and Suris (2001a); Courtade et al. (2017), and agrees well with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations which predict \sim 0.12\varepsilon_{X} Szyniszewski et al. (2017). More generally, we calculate the trion binding energy in monolayer TMDs as a function of the dielectric screening length Rytova (1967); Keldysh (1979), again finding excellent agreement with QMC calculations Szyniszewski et al. (2017) while obtaining a larger trion binding energy than in variational calculations Courtade et al. (2017). We also find very good agreement with the exact diagonalization calculations of Ref. Fey et al. (2020) for the select TMD parameters chosen in that work. Due to their general nature, our numerical methods can be applied to a host of other few- and many-body problems in 2D semiconductors. The paper is organized as follows. The model is introduced in Sec. II and we demonstrate the Landé subtraction technique in Sec. III in the context of the exciton problem. We introduce the trion Schrödinger equation in Sec. IV, where we also apply the Landé subtraction technique and solve for the trion binding energies using a Lanczos-type algorithm. We conclude and give a brief outlook in Sec. V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09067v1,Critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces,"The critical states of disordered systems are intriguing subjects within the realm of condensed matter physics and complex systems. These states manifest in materials where disorder plays a significant role, and are distinguished by their multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, accurately characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we argue that critical states exhibit a certain invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both domains. More specifically, it is expected that typical physical quantities characterizing critical states, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, should exhibit invariance in both position space and momentum space. Subsequent numerical simulations validate the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.","The concept of critical states Critical in various physical systems pertains to the behaviors and characteristics exhibited during phase transitions or as they approach critical points. The examination of critical states provides profound insights into the nature of order, disorder, and collective behavior across diverse disciplines Sachdev1 . These states are fundamental for comprehending a wide range of phenomena in statistical physics Critical0 , condensed matter physics Critical1 , and complex systems Critical2 . As a defining feature of critical phenomena Critical3 , fluctuations in critical states become correlated over large distances, with the system demonstrating self-similar behavior at different scales. Critical fluctuations have been observed in various systems, including phase transitions in ferromagnets-antiferromagnets Critical4 , percolation thresholds in complex networks Critical5 , and photonic quasicrystals photonic . As research continues to advance, the exploration of critical states holds promise for unveiling new phenomena and deepening our understanding of complex systems. Recently, significant advancements have been achieved in the investigation of critical states of wave functions, specifically focusing on critical states of quantum disordered systems Liu-self-duality ; Li1 ; Li2 ; You ; g1 ; g2 ; zhou ; Biddle ; Zhang ; Chen ; q1 ; q2 ; q3 ; q4 ; q5 ; q6 ; q7 ; q8 ; Yao1 ; Yao2 ; cai ; Slager ; SSHQ ; gg3 ; gg4 ; gg5 ; gg6 ; gg7 ; gg8 ; gg0 ; gg9 . Novel concepts and phenomena such as anomalous mobility edges Liu-Anomalous , the utilization of renormalization groups for critical states RG1 ; RG2 , real eigenvalues determined through recursion of eigenstates Liu-Real1 ; Liu-Real2 , critical states induced by coupling of two chains twochain , and critical states of two-dimensional quasicrystals Duncan are continuously emerging. Nevertheless, the primary challenge in comprehending critical states lies in determining the conditions under which they arise and accurately characterizing them. Bohr’s complementarity principle MQM provides us with inspiration to bridge this gap. According to the complementarity principle, it is impossible to simultaneously observe the wave nature and particle nature of matter under different representations, such as position space and momentum space. Matter exhibits different properties in these representations. The relationship between position space and momentum space is primarily established through the Fourier transform; position space serves as a mathematical framework for describing the location of particles or objects in physical space, while momentum space is perceived as the duality of position space QM . The critical state can be considered as a third state in addition to particle and wave properties, thus it can be reasonably inferred that the critical state may exhibit some invariance in both position space and momentum space. Figure 1: (Color online) (a) and (b) demonstrate an application of Bohr’s complementarity principle, showing that a localized state in position space must be delocalized in momentum space, and vice versa for an extended state. (c) and (d) illustrate that critical states can simultaneously exhibit delocalization, multifractality, and self-similarity in both position space and momentum space. Based on this duality perception, Liu and Xia propose an explicit criterion Liu-Critical for precisely characterizing critical states. They assert that the Lyapunov exponents of critical states should simultaneously be 0 in both position space and momentum space. The criterion definitively distinguishes critical states from extended and localized states, as the Lyapunov exponents of the latter two are not equal in position space and momentum space. If one exponent is 0, then the dual exponent must be greater than 0. In physics, this also implies that extended and localized states cannot simultaneously exhibit delocalization in position space and momentum space, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a) and (b). In contrast, critical states should demonstrate delocalization, multifractality, and self-similarity in both position space and momentum space, as depicted in Fig. 1(c) and (d). These findings clearly illustrate that critical states maintain a certain kind of invariance across two dual spaces. A natural question arises: can the invariance of the critical state extend beyond the Lyapunov exponent to include other physical quantities in both position and momentum spaces? This study demonstrates that the invariance of the critical state is universal, encompassing various physical quantities such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08780v1,Measuring pair correlations in Bose and Fermi gases via atom-resolved microscopy,"We demonstrate atom-resolved detection of itinerant bosonic 23Na and fermionic 6Li quantum gases, enabling the direct in situ measurement of interparticle correlations. In contrast to prior work on lattice-trapped gases, here we realize microscopy of quantum gases in the continuum. We reveal Bose-Einstein condensation with single-atom resolution, measure the enhancement of two-particle g^{(2)} correlations of thermal bosons, and observe the suppression of g^{(2)} for fermions; the Fermi or exchange hole. For strongly interacting Fermi gases confined to two dimensions, we directly observe non-local fermion pairs in the BEC-BCS crossover. We obtain the pairing gap, the pair size, and the short-range contact directly from the pair correlations. In situ thermometry is enabled via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our technique opens the door to the atom-resolved study of strongly correlated quantum gases of bosons, fermions, and their mixtures.","References Zwerger [2012] W.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08779v1,imaging of the thermal de Broglie wavelength in an ultracold Bose gas,"We report the first in situ observation of density fluctuations on the scale of the thermal de Broglie wavelength in an ultracold gas of bosons. Bunching of 87Rb atoms in a quasi two-dimensional system is observed by single-atom imaging using a quantum gas microscope. Compared to a classical ensemble, we observe a 30 percent enhancement of the second-order correlation function. We show the spatial and thermal dependence of these correlations. The reported method of detecting in situ correlations can be applied to interacting many-body systems and to the study of critical phenomena near phase transitions.","Introduction. The original Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) experiment introduced the importance of correlations in photon detection and triggered the development of quantum optics Hanbury Brown and Twiss (1956a, b); Glauber (1963a, b). HBT observed a spatial correlation of the intensity fluctuations for light emitted from the distant star Sirius. These fluctuations represent an optical speckle pattern with a characteristic length scale of the optical wavelength \lambda on the star’s surface. As illustrated in Fig. 1, when light propagates from a distant star of radius R to the earth at distance D, the speckle size is magnified to \lambda D/R, which HBT determined to be around 5\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{m} for Sirius. Matter waves have an equivalent speckle pattern with a characteristic grain size of the thermal de Broglie wavelength \lambda_{\text{dB}}=h/\sqrt{2\pi mk_{B}T}. The atomic speckle is a quantum effect, given that its scale involves Planck’s constant, h. In contrast, a classical gas has purely Poissonian fluctuations, which has no length scale since there are no correlations in the gas. Similar to light propagation, ballistic expansion of ultracold atoms magnifies the in situ correlation length in the far-field by D/R Gomes et al. (2006). Consequently, HBT experiments have been extended beyond photons to include electrons Oliver et al. (1999); Henny et al. (1999); Kiesel et al. (2002), neutrons Iannuzzi et al. (2006), cold atoms Yasuda and Shimizu (1996); Dall et al. (2011); Schellekens et al. (2005); Jeltes et al. (2007); Manning et al. (2010, 2013); Thomas et al. (2024); Esteve et al. (2006); Perrin et al. (2012); Sunami et al. (2024); Fölling et al. (2005); Blumkin et al. (2013); Rom et al. (2006); Sanner et al. (2010); Müller et al. (2010); Guarrera et al. (2011), and cold molecules Rosenberg et al. (2022). As a result of limited detector resolution, the atomic speckle pattern has primarily been probed in the far-field after time-of-flight expansion. In situ studies have only probed enhanced density fluctuations on a length scale much larger than the de Broglie wavelength Esteve et al. (2006) or focused on temporal correlations Guarrera et al. (2011). For cold fermions in a lattice, Pauli antibunching between next-neighbor sites has been observed in Cheuk et al. (2015); Omran et al. (2015); Hartke et al. (2020). However, the counterpart of bosonic bunching is less studied. Figure 1: In situ and far-field speckle patterns. An ensemble of identical bosons exhibits a spatial length scale \lambda where density fluctuations are correlated. In photonic systems, the length scale of this speckle pattern is given by the optical coherence length, while for a gas of thermal atoms, it is the thermal de Broglie wavelength. In both the HBT experiment and previous cold atoms experiments, a free expansion over a distance D is employed to enlarge the far-field speckle size by D/R. In this work, we use a microscope with a spatial resolution smaller than the thermal de Broglie wavelength to directly image the atomic speckle in situ. In this Letter, we report the first in situ observation of the atomic correlation length in a bulk, thermal Bose gas. The correlations and speckle pattern are quantitatively described by the second-order correlation function, g^{(2)}, which gives the joint probability of detecting two particles. The g^{(2)} function is measured by cooling a small quasi two-dimensional ensemble of approximately 100 rubidium atoms to below 10\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{nK}, with a corresponding thermal de Broglie wavelength \lambda_{\text{dB}}\approx 2.3\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mu\mathrm{m}, larger than the a_{\text{lat}}=532\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{nm} pinning lattice spacing used for imaging. Detection of such sparse samples is enabled by using a quantum gas microscope with single-atom resolution. Herein, we show a clear bunching signal and observe its spatial extent to be the thermal de Broglie wavelength. Figure 2: Experimental overview. (a) Using a 87Rb quantum gas microscope, we probe in situ the density fluctuations in an ultracold, quasi two-dimensional thermal Bose gas. (b) We project the 2D Bose distribution onto a pinning lattice and reconstruct the site-by-site lattice occupation. To determine the bosonic enhancement, we count pairs of atoms separated by distance r and determine the enhancement factor g^{(2)}(r) over the classical distribution corresponding to fully distinguishable particles. On the lattice grid, we show the distance between three types of pairs, corresponding to the nearest-neighbor (NN, red), next-nearest-neighbor (NNN, blue), and third-nearest-neighbor (N3, green). (c) To experimentally determine g^{(2)}(r) with high signal-to-noise, we average over 650 experimental snapshots. The region of interest is sectioned into 10\times 10 boxes to address the spatial inhomogeneity of the harmonic trap. The mean occupancy \bar{n} on each lattice site averaged over all snapshots is plotted. We remain dilute (\bar{n}<0.15) to avoid double occupation and to ensure that we do not cross the BEC phase transition."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08776v1,Quantum Gas Microscopy of Fermions in the Continuum,"Microscopically probing quantum many-body systems by resolving their constituent particles is essential for understanding quantum matter. In most physical systems, distinguishing individual particles, such as electrons in solids, or neutrons and quarks in neutron stars, is impossible. Atom-based quantum simulators offer a unique platform that enables the imaging of each particle in a many-body system. Until now, however, this capability has been limited to quantum systems in discretized space such as optical lattices and tweezers, where spatial degrees of freedom are quantized. Here, we introduce a novel method for imaging atomic quantum many-body systems in the continuum, allowing for in situ resolution of every particle. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on a two-dimensional atomic Fermi gas. We probe the density correlation functions, resolving their full spatial functional form, and reveal the shape of the Fermi hole arising from Pauli exclusion as a function of temperature. Our method opens the door to probing strongly-correlated quantum gases in the continuum with unprecedented spatial resolution, providing in situ access to spatially resolved correlation functions of arbitrarily high order across the entire system.","Challenges Quantum gas microscopy was initially developed in the context of Hubbard physics [6, 7] and has so far been devoted to the study of lattice and spin-chain systems [1, 2], where atoms initially evolve in a discretized space and can tunnel from site to site. To image the system, atoms are first pinned by ramping up the lattice depth to a value preventing any tunneling according to a simple and well defined adiabaticity criterion, and subsequently exposed to fluorescence light allowing to detect each atom. Here, in contrast, we are interested in pinning the atoms of many-body systems that initially evolve in continuous space, whose projection dynamics is far more complex due to the absence of an initial energy gap and has not been studied to date. A first crucial challenge is therefore to ensure that the pinning of the many-body wave function preserves the collective information prior to pinning. A second difficulty stems from light-assisted collisions that occur during imaging when two atoms occupy the same lattice site, such that quantum gas microscopy only gives access to the parity of the occupation number. In the study of Bose- or Fermi-Hubbard systems, the occupation is typically of one or two atoms per lattice site such that this parity projection can be mitigated [1, 2]. In contrast, the high densities typically used in bulk systems correspond to having tens to hundreds of atoms per lattice site, such that parity projection would be crippling for most quantitative measurements. This detrimental effect can be circumvented by working with extremely dilute clouds, with about two orders of magnitude lower densities. The associated challenge is to prepare samples at accordingly lower temperatures in order to reach the deep quantum degenerate regime. In practice, this requires temperatures in the range of 1–20 nK, which are below or at the lowest end of the temperatures typically reached in bulk quantum gases. In this work, we tackle these two challenges and perform quantum gas microscopy in the continuum for the first time, which we describe in the following."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08578v1,Double-flattop quantum droplets in,"We predict the existence of double-flattop quantum droplets in atomic Bose-Bose mixtures. Solutions of this type have two flattop regions of nearly uniform atomic density corresponding to a compressed central core surrounded by a rarefied layer. The birth of these double-flattop quantum droplets is analytically described using a perturbation theory, which in the leading order reduces the problem to the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Its properties are then used to predict the shape of double-flattop solutions and draw the conclusions about their stability. The analytical results apply to one- and multidimensional quantum droplets, provided that the energy density satisfies certain conditions. Using the numerical continuation from the asymptotic limit, we obtain the families of one- and two-dimensional double flattop quantum droplets and confirm the stability of the nodeless states of this type.","In the lowest-order approximation of Bogoliubov theory for a dilute gas of weakly interacting Bose particles Bogo1947 , the ground-state energy density is proportional to the squared particle density, and the coefficient of proportionality is positive or negative for repulsive or attractive interactions, respectively. For a nonuniform Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), this approximation can be developed into the well-known Gross-Pitaevskii equation Pita , which is widely and successfully used for theoretical description of BECs in a variety of realistic settings. At the same time, it has been predicted that in dilute two-component Bose-Bose mixtures, quantum corrections to the ground state energy LHY may become non-perturbative and, moreover, may enter into competition with the meanfield cubic nonlinearity Petrov2015 . A delicate balance between meanfield and beyond-meanfield nonlinearities enables the formation of quantum droplets, i.e., self-bound liquidlike states that can exist in stable form even in free space Bulgac ; Michi2002 . Quantum corrections play in this case a constructive role by stabilizing the condensate against collapse predicted by the meanfield theory. Another prominent property of quantum droplets (which further emphasizes the analogy with usual liquids) is the incompressibility: irrespective of the number of condensed atoms, the particle density cannot exceed a certain maximal value. As a result, for large numbers of atoms, quantum droplets tend to develop the so-called flattop shapes, i.e., broad plateaus of nearly uniform density (as it happens also in optical materials with competing nonlinearities Quiroga ). Soon after the theoretical prediction, quantum droplets in Bose-Bose mixtures were observed in several experiments Cabrera2018 ; Semeghini2018 ; Cheiney2018 ; 39K ; collisions ; hetero . Analogous quantum liquidlike states, resulting from the balance between repulsive and attractive terms, have been also observed in single-component dipolar condensates Schmitt2016 ; FerrierBarbut2016 ; Baillie2018 . Broad reviews of the progress made in rapidly developing area of multidimensional quantum droplets can be found in Luo2021 ; Malomed2021 ; Khan2022 ; Multidim2019 ; MaloBook ; Bottcher2021 . The beyond-meanfield theory of Bose-Bose mixtures can be generalized to low-dimensional liquids Petrov2016 ; Parisi1 ; Parisi2 , where the functional form of the energy density differs from that in the three-dimensional (3D) case, that results in different modifications of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with functional form of nonlinearity depending on dimensionality of the problem. Steady-state solutions corresponding to quantum droplets emerging in such models have been in the focus of numerous theoretical studies. The simplest solutionscan be obtained by assuming that density distributions in both components are proportional Li2018 ; Petrov2016 ; AstaMalo ; Katsimiga2023 ; Katsimiga2023CM ; Edmonds2023 ; Khan2022 ; Abdullaev ; Otajonov ; Paredes ; Dong2024 ; DongFan2024 ; Kartashov2019 ; Kartashov2018 ; Kartashov2021 ; Gangwar2024 ; Bougas2024 ; Flynn2023 . This assumption substantially simplifies the problem but, at the same time, it drastically restricts the set of available quantum droplet solutions. More complex, essentially two-component states, which cannot be described in terms of a single wavefunction, have also been addressed in several recent studies Mithun2020 ; Kartashov2020 ; Mista2021 ; Kartashov2022 ; KartashovZ2024 ; Gangwararx ; Englezos2024 ; Charalampidis2024 , but in general they received insufficient attention, especially in multidimensional geometries, where exploration of new types of self-sustained states that can be dynamically stable, is a task of considerable interest. Particularly interesting solutions, which cannot be implemented in the scalar case, correspond to structured quantum droplets with essentially different density distributions in two components. For instance, two wavefunctions describing components of the quantum droplet may have different parities KartashovZ2024 (in the 1D case) or different topological charges Kartashov2020 (for vortex states in the 2D case). The goal of this paper is to introduce a previously unexplored class of double-flattop quantum droplets that form in two-component mixtures. We demonstrate that the flattop region emerging in one of the components can serve as a background for the formation of a secondary droplet that is localized on the top of the already existed density plateau. As a result, the total density distribution acquires a double-flattop structure being composed of a compressed internal core surrounded by a rarefied shell. The analytical predictions are developed using a perturbation theory, which indicates that in the leading order the shape and stability of the emerging states is determined by the cubic nonlinear Schrïdinger (NLS) equation. Numerical results are obtained for one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) quantum droplets. In the 1D case, the obtained solutions are stable, whereas in the 2D case there is a countable set of families, and only the fundamental one includes stable solutions. The content of this paper can be outlined as follows. Section II introduces the general model and presents analytical results regarding the existence and stability of double-flattop states. Section III presents numerical results for 1D and 2D quantum droplets. Section IV concludes the paper."

The vortices and antivortices carry fractional charges of equal sign but unequal magnitude and have a honeycomb lattice structure that contrasts with the triangular lattices of superconducting electron-electron-pair vortex lattices. We predict that increasing charge density and weakening magnetic fields drive vortex delocalization transitions signaled experimentally by abrupt increases in counterflow transport resistance.,"References Ma et al.

Here, we demonstrate the existence of a new class of CLPTs, associated with changes in the topological properties of the optimal level set in a two-qubit state-preparation problem. In particular, the distance distribution of control protocols sampled through stochastic homotopic dynamics reveals discontinuous changes in the number of connected components in the optimal level set, as a function of the protocol duration.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08356v1,Proposal for a Bell Test with Entangled Atoms of Different Mass,"We propose an experimental scheme for performing a Bell test using momentum-entangled pairs of atoms with different masses. This proposal uses the metastable isotopes of helium \operatorname{{}^{3}\mathrm{He}^{\ast}}and \operatorname{{}^{4}\mathrm{He}^{\ast}}for their single-atom detection capabilities, though the approach could be generalised to other atoms. The entangled state is generated by colliding these species and manipulated via two independent atom interferometers. This method enables precise control of the relative phases of each species, overcoming previous challenges in single-species atomic momentum Bell tests. Numerical simulations of the process show that it should be possible to achieve a significant violation of Bell’s inequality under realistic experimental conditions and within a quantum mechanics framework. This type of superposition is interesting from a general relativity perspective as it introduces ambiguity in determining spacetime curvature of the quantum state. Such experiments are necessary to better understand the intersection between quantum mechanics and gravity.","Quantum mechanics has profoundly affected our understanding of the natural world. One of its most intriguing consequences is the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, where two or more entangled particles exhibit correlations that defy classical intuition. These correlations are such that the measurement outcome of one particle directly affects the other, regardless of the spatial separation between them, challenging the concept of local realism. This concept was famously discussed in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox [1], which suggested that quantum mechanics might be incomplete and that hidden variables could account for the observed correlations to preserve local realism. To address this, John Bell formulated a theorem [2] that provides a way to experimentally distinguish between the predictions of quantum mechanics and those of local hidden variable (LHV) theories. The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) formulation [3] later refined Bell’s theorem, making it more amenable to experimental tests. While entanglement has been verified experimentally in many systems, mostly with photons, a relatively unexplored frontier is extending this framework to massive particles and exploring their behaviour under gravitational influences. Historically, Bell tests have predominantly been performed on photons and internal degrees of freedom of particles, yielding violations of Bell inequalities and thereby supporting quantum mechanics. In the field of optics, numerous experiments have tested Bell inequalities using various photonic degrees of freedom, such as polarisation [4, 5], time-bin encoding [6], spatial modes [7], orbital angular momentum [8], and their momentum [9, 10]. Similarly, Bell tests using atoms and electrons have primarily explored their internal degrees of freedom, e.g., experiments with trapped ions [11], particle spins [12, 13, 14]. While these experiments have provided strong evidence against local hidden variable theories, there remains a lack of experimental evidence for Bell tests involving the external degrees of freedom (momentum) of massive particles. Recent attempts at atomic momentum entanglement for Bell tests have faced significant experimental challenges [15]. Dussarrat et al. [16] experimentally interfered different modes of two particles and ruled out the possibility of a mixed state. Fadel et al. [17] and Lange et al. [18] showed spatial entanglement in cold atom experiments. Shin et al. [13] demonstrated Bell correlations between separated atomic pairs, using momentum as their particle label and atomic spin states of metastable helium (\operatorname{{}^{4}\mathrm{He}^{\ast}}) atoms to show entanglement in spin. Other attempts to produce entanglement in atomic momentum [19, 20, 16, 21], while successfully showing forms of non-classical correlations, possessed insufficient coherence to perform a full Bell test. Our recent attempt [22] used mixing between different momentum states in two separate s-wave scattering halos of \operatorname{{}^{4}\mathrm{He}^{\ast}}atoms to perform a Bell test [23], although with insufficient visibility to exclude LHVTs. In this paper, we propose an experiment to test Bell’s inequality using momentum-entangled \operatorname{{}^{3}\mathrm{He}^{\ast}}and \operatorname{{}^{4}\mathrm{He}^{\ast}}atoms. By inducing controlled collisions between these isotopes and utilising species-specific momentum-transfer pulses for independent control, we generate and manipulate entangled pairs suitable for a Bell test. We present theoretical modeling of the entangled state generation, followed by numerical simulations that demonstrate a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality under realistic experimental conditions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08102v1,Magnetic-field suppression of tomographic electron transport,"Degenerate two-dimensional electron liquids are theoretically established to possess two vastly distinct collisional electron mean free paths, where even-parity deformations of the Fermi surface are hydrodynamic with a short collisional mean free path but odd-parity deformations remain near ballistic (known as the “tomographic” transport regime). Predicted signatures of this regime rely on the scaling of observables with temperature or device dimension, both of which are difficult to establish with certainty. Here, we consider magnetotransport in a minimal model of tomographic electrons and show that even a small magnetic field suppresses tomographic transport signatures and thus acts as a sensitive and unique probe of this regime. Fundamentally, the magnetic field breaks time-reversal invariance, which is a prerequisite for the odd-even parity effect in the collisional relaxation. We analyze in detail the scaling of the transverse conductivity, which has been linked to small-channel conductance of interaction-dominated electrons, and show that a tomographic scaling regime at intermediate wavenumbers is quickly suppressed with magnetic field to a hydrodynamic or collisionless form. We confirm that the suppression occurs at relatively small magnetic fields when the cyclotron radius is comparable to the ballistic mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode. This occurs at a much smaller magnetic field than the magnetic field strength required to suppress hydrodynamic electron transport, which suggests an experimental protocol to extract the odd-parity mean free path.","Recent advances in the fabrication of ultraclean materials allow to probe interaction-dominated electron transport, for which the electron mean free path due to binary collisions is smaller than the device dimension or the phonon or impurity mean free path [1]. This leads to collective hydrodynamic electron flow with a characteristic scale set by the electron shear viscosity. Hydrodynamics transport is expected to be the generic mode of transport in clean materials, and signatures of hydrodynamic electrons have by now been reported in a wide variety of (predominately two-dimensional) materials like mono-[2, 3] and bilayer graphene [4, 5], (Al,Ga)As [6, 7, 8], WTe2 [9, 10], WP2 [11], PdCoO2 [12], MoP [13], and NbP [14]. Since by Fermi liquid theory, electron interactions are phase-space suppressed at low temperature, the hydrodynamic regime is expected to span an intermediate temperature range where temperatures are large enough that electron interactions dominate over impurity scattering yet high-temperature relaxation due to phonon scattering is not yet prevalent. In this context, it has been suggested that the Pauli principle imposes very different phase space restrictions on electron relaxation depending on the parity of the Fermi surface perturbation [15], which leads to the emergence of not one but two vastly different electronic mean free paths: First, even-parity deformations of the Fermi distribution, which are described by a momentum-parity symmetrized distribution f_{e}({\bf k})=[f({\bf k})+f(-{\bf k})]/2, relax with a short mean free path that at low temperatures increases as an inverse square of temperature \ell_{e}\sim v_{F}T_{F}/T^{2} (where v_{F} is the Fermi velocity and T_{F} the Fermi temperature) [16, 17, 18]. Second, by strong contrast, odd-parity deformations, described by the anti-symmetrized distribution f_{o}({\bf k})=[f({\bf k})-f(-{\bf k})]/2, have a much larger anomalously increased ballistic mean free path, \ell_{o}\gg\ell_{e}. Indeed, for a simple circular Fermi surface (applicable to, for example, GaAs or doped graphene), more recent studies predict an asymptotic low-temperature scaling of \ell_{o}\sim v_{F}T_{F}^{3}/(m^{4}T^{4}), which is significantly increased at low temperatures, with an additional dependence on an angular-momentum index m that labels different odd-parity modes [19, 20, 21, 22]. This odd-even effect in the quasiparticle relaxation is surprisingly robust and predicted to exist up to temperatures T\lesssim 0.1T_{F} with a finite number of {\it O}(\sqrt{T_{F}/T}) decoupled odd-parity modes [19, 20, 21, 22]. Quite generally, the odd-even effect will be present for any system with a parity-even Fermi surface, for which deformations can be classified into even-parity and odd-parity modes. Fundamentally, the symmetry that guarantees this is time-reversal invariance, which implies a parity-even electron dispersion, \varepsilon({\bf k})=\varepsilon(-{\bf k}) [23]. Electron flows exhibiting the odd-even effect have been dubbed “tomographic” to distinguish this new regime from hydrodynamic and ballistic flows. Recent predictions for phenomena exhibited by these flows include anomalous fractional scaling of a narrow channel’s conductivity with its width [24], distinct bulk collective modes [25], and an enhanced nonlinear response [26]. Indeed, two recent experiments report signatures that could be attributable to tomographic flow: First, the observed Hall field profile in a narrow channel is seen to have a slightly larger curvature compared to the strict hydrodynamic Poiseuille profile [27], an observation that appears not fully explained so far but is speculated to be due to odd-parity modes in Ref. [27]. Second, the viscosity as extracted from a hydrodynamic modeling of electron flow in a Corbino geometry shows an anomalous inverse linear-in-temperature scaling at low temperatures [28]. This result is unanticipated since the hydrodynamic shear viscosity involves a microscopic even-parity deformation with a relaxation time that (according to Fermi liquid theory) increases with the inverse square of the temperature [29, 30]. Quite generally, a challenge in detecting existing predictions for tomographic phenomena is that establishing an anomalous scaling with device dimensions requires the fabrication (and theoretical modeling) of different samples, and an anomalous temperature scaling must be distinguished from other relaxation due to phonons and impurities. It would therefore be desirable to have an in-situ method to suppress tomographic effects without changing samples or parameter values. This would discriminate tomographic effects from other non-hydrodynamic phenomena. In this paper, we include magnetic field effects on tomographic transport and demonstrate that due to the breaking of time-reversal invariance, tomographic transport signatures are rapidly suppressed with increasing magnetic fields (illustrated in Fig. 1 below). This implies that if anomalous transport observations are indeed due to tomographic flow, then a hallmark signature would be a rapid suppression of such signatures with magnetic fields to a more conventional hydrodynamic or collisionless form (with a subsequent suppression to standard Ohmic transport at even larger fields). Here, we focus in our analysis on the transverse static conductivity, which is linked to the the shear viscosity and which addresses the recent experiment [28], but the general effect of a magnetic-field induced suppression of tomographic transport should hold more broadly [15]. In general, the magnetic field competes with all possible relaxation processes. Specifically, based only on quasiclassical arguments one can argue that as soon as the cyclotron radius r_{c}=m^{*}v_{F}/eB (here m^{*} is the effective electron mass and e>0 the magnitude of the electron charge) becomes smaller than a mean free path scale of interest \ell, the corresponding relaxation-related effects must be suppressed. The characteristic magnetic field scale is thus B_{\star}\simeq m^{*}v_{F}/e\ell. Introducing the cyclotron frequency \omega_{c}=eB/m^{*}, we find that relaxation channel of interest is suppressed after the cyclotron frequency reaches a corresponding relaxation inverse time scale, i.e., the decay rate v_{F}/\ell. In clean Fermi liquids \ell_{min}\sim\ell_{e} and therefore all electronic relaxation effects should be suppressed for B_{\star}\simeq m^{*}v_{F}/e\ell_{e}, an effect that is elegantly utilized by Zeng et al. [28] to disentangle Ohmic and electron hydrodynamic transport contributions. We will argue in this paper that the characteristic magnetic field which impedes the tomographic regime is much smaller than that and is proportional to the inverse mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode at the corresponding wave number. The focus of this study is to establish and illustrate the principles behind the magnetic-field induced suppression of tomographic effects. We therefore adopt a minimal model of tomographic electrons that allows to make semi-analytical calculations. In this model, we assume rigid deviations of the Fermi surface (as opposed to a temperature or interaction-induced broadening of the Fermi edge) and parameterize deformations of the quasiparticle distribution from local equilibrium as \displaystyle\delta f({\bf r},{\bf p}) \displaystyle=e^{i{\bf k}\cdot{\bf r}}\biggl{(}-\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial% \varepsilon}\biggr{)}h(\theta), (1) where {\bf k} is the wave vector of the perturbation (we assume static perturbations in the following), and we separate a nonanalytical factor involving the derivative of the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution f_{0}. In this way, by the chain rule, h(\theta) can be thought of a rigid deformation of the chemical potential that depends on the angle \theta of the momentum vector under the Fermi surface (see, for example, Fig. 2 below for illustrations). This function can be expanded in angular harmonics, \displaystyle h(\theta) \displaystyle=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}e^{im\theta}h_{m} (2) with angular momentum index m. The even- and odd-parity components of the distribution function discussed above are then composed of even and odd m, respectively. For a circular Fermi surface, binary collisions will not change the angular momentum index, such that collisions can be treated in a generalized relaxation-time approximation with individual decay rates \gamma_{m}\sim v_{F}/\ell_{m} that are inversely proportional to the mean free path \ell_{m} of the mode. Here, the first modes m=0,\pm 1 (the “hydrodynamic” modes) describe a compression and a rigid center-of-mass shift of the Fermi surface, respectively, with infinite lifetime since they are linked to conserved quantities (binary collision do not change particle number or total momentum), i.e., \gamma_{0}=\gamma_{\pm 1}=0. Moreover, we will assume that all remaining even-parity modes follow standard Fermi-liquid scaling, \gamma_{m\,{\rm even}}=\gamma, with no pronounced m-dependence. For odd-parity modes, we will adopt here a Matthiessen rule (with \gamma^{\prime}\ll\gamma) \displaystyle\gamma_{m\,{\rm odd}}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\gamma}+\frac{1}{\gamma^{% \prime}m^{4}}} (3) that interpolates between the relaxation rate of the lowest m modes with anomalously long mean free path and m-independent scaling for large m. The form (3) is an accurate description of the lowest odd eigenvalues at low temperatures and is in good agreement with exact diagonalization studies of the Fermi liquid collision integral [21, 22]. Note that elastic impurity scattering (with scattering rate \gamma_{i}) will contribute to all angular modes except for m=0 [25]. The advantage of the parameterisation (1) is that the kinetic Fermi liquid equation takes an effective tight-binding form (omitting the Landau parameters here), \displaystyle\bigl{(}\gamma_{m}-im\omega_{c}\bigr{)}\ h_{m}+i\frac{v_{F}k}{2}(% h_{m+1}+h_{m-1}) \displaystyle\quad=\frac{v_{F}eE}{2}\bigl{(}e^{i\theta_{E}}\delta_{m,1}+e^{-i% \theta_{E}}\delta_{m,-1}\bigr{)}, (4) where we include an external electric field {\bf E} that forms an angle \theta_{E} with the wave vector {\bf k} [see App. A for a derivation of the kinetic equation in a magnetic field and App. B for a derivation of the tight-binding representation (4)]. The left-hand side of Eq. (3) is reminiscent of a one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian with lattice sites labeled by m, where the term v_{F}k/2 fixes the amplitude of nearest-neighbour hopping, the magnetic field corresponds to an effective constant electric field, and \gamma_{m} is a non-Hermitian on-site decay term. For the tight-binding representation (4), very efficient exact numerical solution algorithms exist to solve for the vector \{h_{m}\} that do not rely on a slowly convergent matrix inversion of Eq. (4) with finite cutoff [25, 31]. This paper is structured as follows: In the next Sec. II, we summarize the main results of our analysis and discuss the magnetic field dependence of the transverse conductivity. The following Sec. III presents a detailed discussion of the minimal kinetic model for odd-mode transport outlined above and describes the crossover between the hydrodynamic, tomographic, and collisionless regimes. We conclude the paper with a summary and outlook in Sec. IV. Basics of Fermi liquid theory in a magnetic field, details of the evaluation of the kinetic equation at large momenta, as well as a link between a derivative expansion and Hilbert expansions used in hydrodynamics are relegated to five appendices."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07997v1,Tunneling Spectroscopy in Superconducting Circuit Lattices,"We demonstrate tunneling spectroscopy of synthetic quantum matter in superconducting circuit lattices. We measure site-resolved excitation spectra by coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative particle baths that serve as local tunneling probes. Using incoherent particle source and drain, we independently extract quasi-particle and quasi-hole spectra and reconstruct the spatial structure of collective excitations. We perform spectroscopy of a strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice at different densities, observing changes in energy gaps across the superfluid to Mott-insulator transition and the effects of three-body interactions. Our results provide a new toolset for characterizing many-body states in analog quantum simulators.","Scanning tunneling spectroscopy has become an essential tool for investigating the electronic properties of quantum materials at the atomic scale [1]. By varying the energy of the probe relative to the sample, tunneling spectroscopy facilitates the extraction of the local density of states for both electrons and holes, thereby providing critical insights into collective excitations in the material and their underlying interactions and correlations. Such local spectroscopy measurements are pivotal for the investigation of superconductivity [2], quantum magnetism [3], and emergent topological states [4]. With recent progress in quantum simulation, engineered quantum systems serve to emulate condensed matter models and study synthetic quantum matter with tunable control and precise readout. Ideas for realizing tunneling spectroscopy in such analog quantum simulators have been proposed for ultracold atoms [5, 6, 7], and injection spectroscopy has been recently demonstrated in a non-interacting synthetic lattice [8]. In superconducting circuit quantum simulators, arrays of superconducting resonators and qubits host synthetic quantum matter comprised of interacting microwave photons [9]. Direct microwave spectroscopy measurements can be used to extract lattice parameters [10], measure topological edge states [11], or probe energy-resolved transport [12, 13]. Using coherent local control, the many-body energy spectra can also be extracted from the time-evolution of initial product states [14] or via many-body Ramsey experiments [15]. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to perform site-resolved spectroscopy in strongly correlated lattices at the level of single collective excitations. Furthermore, the asymmetry between the quasi-particle and quasi-hole spectra provides essential insights into the underlying interactions of the constituent particles. However, most spectroscopic methods in synthetic quantum matter cannot distinguish particle excitations from hole excitations. k, we demonstrate tunneling spectroscopy in a superconducting circuit lattice by coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative probes. The local probes serve as particle source and particle drain, as realized in our recent work [16], enabling particles to be injected or removed locally with controlled energy. We measure site-resolved particle- and hole- spectra of a strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice, and reconstruct the spatial structure of quasi-particles from the site-resolved spectra. By performing the spectroscopy at different lattice fillings, we reveal changes in the excitation gap across the superfluid to Mott insulator transitions and directly observe the effects of multi-particle interaction. These experiments provide a new toolset for manipulating and characterizing quantum many-body states in superconducting circuits. Figure 1: Illustration of site-resolved tunneling spectroscopy.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07943v1,Interactions and Reconnections of Four-Dimensional Quantum Vortices,"Interactions and reconnections of vortices are fundamental in many areas of physics, including classical and quantum fluids where they are central to understanding phenomena such as turbulence. In three-dimensional (3D) superfluids, quantum vortices are one-dimensional (1D) filaments that can intersect, reconnect, and recoil with irreversible dynamics described by near-universal scaling laws. We explore quantum-vortex reconnections in a four-dimensional (4D) superfluid, where a vortex is a two-dimensional (2D) surface. Using real-time numerical simulations, we find much richer behaviour than in 3D, including stable intersecting vortex surfaces which do not reconnect, and unusual vortex reconnections which occur without significant energy dissipation, suggesting quasi-reversible dynamics. Our work raises many interesting questions about vortex physics in extra-dimensional systems, and may be extended in the future to more realistic experimental settings where the fourth dimension is simulated with techniques such as synthetic dimensions.","References Che et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07637v1,Spin entanglement in antiferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates,"We study the spin entanglement in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with antiferromagnetic atomic interactions using the Hartree-Fock approach. Based on the isomorphism between symmetric N-qubit states and spin-j=N/2 states, we analyze the negativity of the spin-1 ground state of the condensate viewed as a two spins 1/2, and explore its dependence with the temperature and external Zeeman fields. The scope of this type of entanglement is highlighted and contrasted with other types of entanglement, as the mode and particle entanglement. It is shown that, at finite temperatures, there is a strong dependence of the negativity with respect to the strengths of quadratic Zeeman fields and the spin-spin interactions of the condensate. Interestingly, in the antiferromagnetic ground-state phase, the negativity and the linear Zeeman field are connected quadratically through the equation of a simple circle, in which its radius depends on the temperature. On the other hand, for the polar phase, being the phase that exhibits the highest degree of entanglement, we were able to identify a clear dependency on the spin-spin interactions and the Zeeman fields that can be expressed analytically in a closed form as a function of the temperature. This results might be relevant for applications in quantum information and metrology.","Spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) are many-body quantum systems of very diluted ultracold atomic gases that exhibit novel and exotic spin-dependent phases, making them an ideal platform for the study of complex spin interactions [1, 2, 3, 4]. These systems are routinely confined in optical traps that allow their internal spin degree freedom to be manipulated with remarkable precision, leading to the realization of a variety of spin domain phases which are strongly influenced by the atomic species, besides the external fields involved [5, 6, 7, 8]. Different ground states have been observed in different atomic species, such as the Polar phase in 23Na [9, 10] condensates, or the Ferromagnetic phase in 87Rb [11] and 7Li [12] BECs. Spinor BECs are typically studied at utra-low temperatures, approaching absolute zero, including the recently temperature record of 37pK [13]. At higher temperatures, and other factors such as interaction with the environment, turbulence, and quantum fluctuations, the BEC can be deviated from an ideal atomic condensate state [5, 6, 14]. For instance, as the temperature rises, the interactions of the cloud of thermally excited atoms with the condensate fraction of atoms become stronger [15, 16, 17]. This leads to various novel physical phenomena such as magnetic spin domains, shifts in the phase boundaries, metastable phases and quantum quench dynamics [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 6]. It is well-known that thermal effects can be also detrimental to certain many-particle quantum correlations, such as quantum entanglement. Hence, it is crucial to explore whether physical phenomena as quantum entanglement can still survive and be exploited at higher temperatures. Entanglement plays a paramount role in areas such as quantum metrology and quantum information [23, 24, 25]. Since a spinor BEC is essentially a many-body quantum system, it naturally conforms a suitable physics playground for the study of quantum entanglement. As a matter of fact, each particle in a BEC has an internal multimode degree of freedom, offering various forms of entanglement [26]. For instance, for an N-bosonic identical particle system describing a spin-1 condensate with hyperfine interactions, there can be an N-particle entanglement. However, since each particle conforms a three level system with internal levels, also called modes, given by \left|+1\right\rangle, \left|0\right\rangle, and \left|-1\right\rangle, can also form entangled states called mode entanglement [26]. This kind of entanglement is similar to the entanglement in optical modes of photonic systems. Both types of entanglement, particle and mode entanglement are proposed to be useful for different applications [27, 28, 29, 30]. Yet another type of entanglement is the one that can be exhibited by a system of N spin-f states, and we call it spin-entanglement. As we will discuss in detail later, the Hilbert space of a spin-f particle is isomorphic to the symmetric subspace of the Hilbert space associated to a system of N=2f spin-1/2 states [31]. Therefore, we can reformulate quantities of multipartite quantum entanglement even in a single spin-f atom through its corresponding symmetric 2f qubits of spin-1/2 states. This correspondence will show to be practically useful for the description of spin entanglement in spinorial BECs with f\geq 1, including some practical applications in quantum metrology. As far we know, this idea of spin entanglement has not been discussed earlier. Our system of interest consists of a many-body system constituted by N spin-1 atoms. The isomorphism between a spin-1 state as a symmetric bipartite spin-1/2 system allows the definition of spin entanglement. Whether this correspondence of spin-1 to two spins 1/2 is experimentally feasible or it remains just as an abstract equivalence, however, it is useful to study quantum correlations for applications in quantum technologies [32]. In fact, and as discussed further in the text, the measure of spin entanglement is linked to the Quantum Fisher Information with respect to an angular momentum operator, which is a relevant quantity in quantum-enhanced metrology of rotations [33, 34, 23]. Given these considerations, several questions naturally arise: To what extent do the many-particle interactions have influence on the spin entanglement of the atoms in a BEC? How do the thermal effects impact this entanglement? And, what are the optimal conditions for maximizing spin entanglement in a spinorial BEC? In this work, we address these questions going beyond mean-field theory by the use of the Hartree-Fock approach. We apply this formalism to explore the effects of particle interactions and the temperature on the spin entanglement in spin-1 BECs with antiferromagnetic interactions. Our theoretical results are valid for any general antiferromagnetic spin-1 BEC, and we apply them to study numerically a condensate gas of 23Na atoms. The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we deal with the negativity concept, which is a measure of quantum entanglement for pure and mixed states. Then, we apply it to define the spin entanglement and comment on its potential applications. At the end of this section we briefly review the Mean-Field and the Hartree-Fock approximations, which are later employed in Sec. III to study the entanglement of the spinor BEC in its different spin phases. In Sec. IV, we study the dependence of the spin entanglement with respect to the spin-spin interactions for the polar phase of the BEC. Lastly, we conclude in Sec. V."

The band topology is revealed by the quantization of pumped charge. In the context of Thouless pumping, we present a graphical representation for the topological phases characterized by the Chern number of an effective two-dimensional band. We illustrate how the two topological phases with distinct Zak phase is connected in the pumping process. Such a visual depiction exhibits typical patterns that is directly related to a linking number and to the Chern number, allowing for the construction of Thouless pumping schemes in a practical way. As a demonstration, we present a generalized Creutz model with tunable Peierls phase, inter-leg imbalance and diagonal hopping. Various modulation schemes for Thouless pumping are studied, focusing on their graphical representations in Bloch space, as well as the quantized pumping phenomenon in real space.","The concept of topology has been introduced in the study of quantum systems for decades, paving the way for the exploration of exotic phases of matter that challenge conventional understanding hasan2010colloquium ; qi2011topological . Topological phase transition can occur without breaking any symmetry, which transcends the traditional Ginzburg-Landau paradigm, as exemplified by the quantum Hall effect thouless1982quantized ; niu1985quantized ; avron2003topological ; kane2005quantum . The global properties inherent to a topological phase confer remarkable robustness against local perturbations, making these phases particularly intriguing for both fundamental research and practical applications. This robustness has catalyzed the investigation of topological insulators, materials that promise revolutionary advancements in electronic and spintronic devices due to their unique surface states konig2007quantum ; zhang2009topological ; hsieh2009observation ; sato2017topological . Various quantum models have been proposed to elucidate the topological characteristics of energy bands. In one-dimensional (1D) systems, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model stands out as a fundamental framework, exhibiting non-trivial topology through a non-zero quantized Zak phase su1979solitons ; zak1989berry ; ryu2002topological ; xiao2010berry ; atala2013direct . This non-trivial phase leads to the presence of zero-energy edge modes, which merge into the bulk at the phase transition point, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology and quantum mechanics. In two-dimensional (2D) systems, band topology is typically characterized by the Chern number, which is obtained by integrating the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone (BZ) and has a direct correlation with the Hall conductivity thouless1982quantized . A seminal model that supports 2D topological phases is the Haldane model haldane1988model , which has been successfully simulated in cold atom experiments jotzu2014experimental ; cooper2019topological , demonstrating the feasibility of realizing these exotic states in controlled environments. Thouless pumping is an intriguing manifestation of non-trivial band topology. It refers to the 1D charge transport phenomenon in a quantized manner as a response to periodic modulation of the quantum system. Thouless pumping has been studied in diverse engineered systems ranging from quantum gases to photonics and electric circuits thouless1983quantization ; niu1984quantised ; nakajima2016topological ; lohse2016thouless ; citro2023thouless ; kraus2012topological ; imhof2018topolectrical ; shah2024colloquium . However, specific models for such a quantum pump are still rare. A prominent example is based on the Rice-Mele scheme rice1982elementary ; wang2013topological ; nakajima2016topological ; lohse2016thouless , which involves periodic modulation of hopping rates and on-site potentials within the framework of the SSH model. By treating time as an additional quasi-momentum axis, one can construct a 2D BZ, where the pumped charge is quantized according to the Chern number, a hallmark of topological order in 2D systems. As the 1D model evolves, the inherent chiral symmetry may be broken, leading to a situation where the Zak phase becomes unquantized. This transition raises important questions about the connection between the Zak phase and the Chern number, as well as the characterization and the robustness of topological features in intermediate models. On the other hand, various extensions to the basic models have been proposed to study richer topological phases and to explore Thouless pumping schemes. One notable extension of the SSH model is the cross-linked two-chain ladder, commonly referred to as the Creutz model creutz1999end ; asboth2016short . This model has emerged as a paradigmatic example for investigating topological phenomena due to its unique structure junemann2017exploring ; kuno2020extended ; zurita2020topology . Additional hopping phases and inter-leg detuning can be implemented in such a quasi-1D system, allowing for the investigation of topological phase transition, bulk-edge correspondence and transport properties in the quantum Hall regime. Furthermore, quantized charge pumping through phase modulations has been proposed sun2017quantum , offering insights into the fundamental manipulation of matter waves in topological systems. To simulate the Creutz model, ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide a powerful platform with parameters controllable to a great extent junemann2017exploring ; gross2017quantum ; schafer2020tools ; kang2020creutz . Notably, artificial gauge fields can be synthesized through laser-assisted tunneling aidelsburger2011experimental ; jimenez2012peierls ; miyake2013realizing ; aidelsburger2013realization ; atala2014observation ; galitski2019artificial , facilitating the exploration of non-trivial topological features and their implications for quantum transport. In this work, we present a graphical representation of topological characterization, allowing for the definition of a winding number even in the absence of chiral symmetry in 1D systems. This framework provides a connection between the Chern number and a linking number in Bloch space. Based on such an understanding, we show how Thouless pumping scheme can be constructed by taking the generalized Creutz model as a demonstration. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we give a general formalism to describe the topological feature of static and periodic modulated models, emphasizing the graphical representation as a criterion for topological pumping. In Sec. III, we present a generalized Creutz ladder which supports distinct topological phases. In Sec. IV, three pumping schemes based on such a model are proposed, showing typical winding and linking patterns in Bloch space. Our conclusions are summarized in Sec. V.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07204v1,"Magnetization induced skyrmion dynamics of a spin-orbit-coupled spinor condensate 
under sinusoidally varying magnetic field","We theoretically explore the spin texture dynamics of a harmonically trapped spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and ferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions under a sinusoidally varying magnetic field along the x-direction. This interplay yields an intrinsic spin texture in the ground state, forming a linear chain of alternating skyrmions at the saddle points. Our study analyzes the spin-mixing dynamics for both a freely evolving and a controlled longitudinal magnetization. The spin-1 system exhibits the Einstein-de Hass effect for the first case, for which an exchange between the total orbital angular momentum and the spin angular momentum is observed, resulting in minimal oscillations about the initial position of the skyrmion chain. However, for the fixed magnetization dynamics, the skyrmion chain exhibits ample angular oscillations about the equilibrium position, with the temporary formation of new skyrmions and anti-skyrmions to facilitate the oscillatory motion. Keeping the magnetization constant, this contrast now stems from the exchange between the canonical and spin-dependent contribution to the orbital angular momentum. The variation in canonical angular momentum is linked to the angular oscillations, while the spin-dependent angular momentum accounts for the creation or annihilation of skyrmions. We confirm the presence of scissor mode excitations in the spin texture due to the angular skyrmion oscillations.","Spin texture dynamics of the SO-coupled spin\rm{-}1 BEC: We prepare the initial state with fixed magnetization m_{z}=0 [67]. The density profile for this state resembles the ground state [Fig. 1] for which the magnetization settles at m_{z}=-0.07. To understand the role of magnetization in spin texture dynamics, we then study the evolution of the system under two scenarios of spin-mixing dynamics: (a) with freely evolving magnetization m_{z}\neq 0 and (b) with fixed magnetization m_{z}=0, which we delve into in the ensuing section."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07095v1,Multicomponent Kardar-Parisi-Zhang Universality in Degenerate Coupled Condensates,"We show that the multicomponent Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation describes the low-energy theory for phase fluctuations in a \mathbb{Z}_{2} degenerate non-equilibrium driven-dissipative condensate with global U(1)\times U(1) symmetry. Using dynamical renormalisation group in spatial dimension d=1, we demonstrate that coupled stochastic complex Ginsburg-Landau equations exhibit an emergent stationary distribution, enforcing KPZ dynamical exponent z=3/2 and static roughness exponent \chi=1/2 for both components. By tuning intercomponent interactions, the system can access other regimes, including a fragmented condensate regime from a dynamical instability in the phase fluctuations, as well as a spacetime vortex regime driven by the non-linear terms in the coupled KPZ equations. In stable regimes, we show that in specific submanifolds relevant to polaritons, the RG fixed point offers a transformation to decoupled KPZ equations. Our findings have broad implications for understanding multicomponent KPZ systems in the long-wavelength limit.","Degenerate Coupled Condensates - Typically, mesoscopic dynamics of driven-dissipative condensates in d=1 are modelled by coupled SCGLE for the lower polariton branch fields \psi_{i}\in\mathbb{C} [51] \displaystyle i\partial_{t}\psi_{i} \displaystyle=\Big{[}-(k_{c}-ik_{d})\partial_{x}^{2}+(\mu_{c}+i\mu_{d})+ (1) \displaystyle(u_{c}-iu_{d})|\psi_{i}|^{2}+(v_{c}-iv_{d})|\psi_{\overline{i}}|^% {2}\Big{]}\psi_{i}+\zeta_{i}, with a density coupling to the other component \psi_{\overline{i}}. This model can be derived from Keldysh field theory in the semiclassical approximation assuming a Markovian coupling to the decay and pumping bath modes. All parameters are real and \mu_{d},\,u_{d},\,u_{c}>0 for a stable condensed solution, and \zeta_{i} is a Gaussian complex white noise with diagonal correlations \langle\zeta^{*}_{i}(x,t)\zeta_{j}(x^{\prime},t)\rangle=(\gamma_{p}+\gamma_{l}% )\delta_{ij}\delta(x-x^{\prime})\delta(t-t^{\prime}). The kinetic coefficient is k_{c}=1/2m_{LP} where m_{LP} is the effective polariton mass and k_{d} is a diffusion constant which acts to suppress higher momentum modes. The system is driven-dissipative requiring incoherent external pumping from a laser, and is in contact with an excitonic decay bath. This gives rise to an effective gain \mu_{d}=(\gamma_{p}-\gamma_{l})/2 from the incoherent pump minus the single particle losses which is positive in the U(1) spontaneously symmetry broken (SSB) condensate phase. The two particle losses u_{d},\,v_{d}>0 act as gain saturation terms. This model assumes local interactions which is valid provided we ignore the spatial extent of the excitons. For polaritons, the intercomponent, v_{c}, and intracomponent, u_{c}, interactions are attractive and repulsive respectively. Typically, experimental cross-spin scattering rates are 5-10\% of the intraparticle scattering rate implying v_{c}\approx-0.1u_{c} [52, 53]. Equilibrium two-component condensates support a miscible-immiscible transition when the real intercomponent interactions exceed the intracomponent interactions v_{c}^{2}>u_{c}^{2} [54, 55, 56, 57] where modulation instabilities cause condensate fragmentation. Non-equilibrium condensates support a similar phase separation [14, 43] but differ from their equilibrium counterparts in that the linearised SCGLE (1) no longer has four gapless sound modes in its Bogoliubov spectrum but instead has two gapped density modes and two gapless diffusive phase modes. There are two conditions of different physical origin which can drive a miscible transition shown in FIG. 1(i-ii): (a) the dissipative intercomponent interaction exceeds the intracomponent interactions v_{d}>u_{d}, resulting in the gapped modes becoming dynamically unstable, and (b) when the rescaled intercomponent interaction \tilde{v}_{c}=v_{c}/u_{c} does not satisfy -1-\mathcal{R}(k)\mathcal{R}(u)(1+\tilde{v}_{d})<\tilde{v}_{c}<1+\mathcal{R}(k% )\mathcal{R}(u)(1-\tilde{v}_{d}) (2) with \mathcal{R}(k)=k_{d}/k_{c}, resulting in the gapless modes becoming dynamically unstable. Within the \tilde{v}_{d}=v_{d}/u_{d}<1 region, there exist two sub-cases for the miscible transition depending on whether the intercomponent interaction v_{c} is attractive or repulsive. For repulsive intercomponent interactions v_{c}>0, tuning (\tilde{v}_{c},\tilde{v}_{d}) outside of the immiscible boundary Eq. (2), gives rise to spatially localised single component regions. For these parameters which map to Quadrants II and III in FIG. 1(i-iii), the low-energy sector is described by single component KPZ if density fluctuations are sufficiently irrelevant [51]. If the interaction is attractive \tilde{v}_{c}<0, as shown for the density plot for the simulation in Quadrant III in FIG. 1(ii), there is no obvious fragmentation. However, the density fluctuations are still large and cannot be adiabatically eliminated, making the KPZ mapping inappropriate. The theory is invariant under U(1)\times U(1) symmetry with independent \psi_{i}\mapsto e^{i\theta_{i}}\psi_{i}. When \mu_{d}>0, each U(1) undergoes SSB. The ground state topology dictates that the effective theory is parameterised using the density-phase representation where \theta_{i} parameterise the gapless fluctuations. In the adiabatic approximation around the mean field |\psi_{0,i}|^{2}=\rho_{i}={\mu_{d}}/{(u_{d}+v_{d})}=-{\mu_{c}}/{(u_{c}+v_{c})}, gapped fluctuations can be integrated out [58] giving multicomponent KPZ equations for \mathbb{R}^{2}-fields (\theta^{\alpha}(x,t))_{\alpha=1}^{2} \displaystyle\partial_{t}\theta^{\alpha}=D_{\alpha\beta}\partial_{x}^{2}\theta% ^{\beta}+\dfrac{1}{2}\Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma}(\partial_{x}\theta^{\beta})% (\partial_{x}\theta^{\gamma})+\zeta^{\alpha} (3) driven by a real Gaussian additive white noise (\zeta^{\alpha})_{\alpha=1}^{2} with symmetric covariance \langle\zeta^{\alpha}(x,t)\zeta^{\beta}(x^{\prime},t^{\prime})\rangle=2\Delta^% {\alpha\beta}\delta(x-x^{\prime})\delta(t-t^{\prime}). Strictly, the phase itself is a compact variable, supporting non-trivial topological excitations such as spacetime vortices (STV) which modify the scaling. For the single-component case in the low-noise regime, compactness does not affect KPZ scaling for significant time windows [59]. The parameters from the SCGLE mapping are D_{11}=k_{c}\mathcal{C}_{1}(u_{d}u_{c}-v_{c}v_{d})+k_{d},\,D_{12}=k_{c}% \mathcal{C}_{1}(v_{c}u_{d}-u_{c}v_{d}),\,\Gamma^{1}_{11}=-2k_{c}+2k_{d}% \mathcal{C}_{1}\left(u_{c}u_{d}-v_{c}v_{d}\right),\,\Gamma^{1}_{22}=2k_{d}% \mathcal{C}_{1}(v_{c}u_{d}-u_{c}v_{d}),\,\Gamma^{1}_{12}=0, where \mathcal{C}_{1}=(u_{d}^{2}-v_{d}^{2})^{-1}. The remaining parameters can be inferred from \mathbb{Z}_{2} symmetry. Coupling in the real density channel between the condensates v_{c} produces non-trivial couplings in the off-diagonals of the diffusion and noise matrices. The non-linearity vanishes at the equilibrium condition when k_{d}/k_{c}=v_{d}/v_{c}=u_{d}/u_{c} define collinear rays in the complex plane [60]. A point to stress is that off-diagonal interaction vertices \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma} are only generated if k_{d}\neq 0. The \Delta^{\alpha\beta} have non-trivial cross-components resulting in correlated white noise driving the two phase modes and are presented in the supplemental materials Ref. [61]. Imposing that the diffusion matrix D is positive definite is equivalent to the dynamical stability condition in Eq. (2). In the spirit of Landau, the effective theory in the multicomponent regimes should be described by Eq. (3) with \mathbb{Z}_{2} symmetry \theta^{1}\leftrightarrow\theta^{2} resulting in the degenerate structure of the \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma} tensors \Gamma^{1}=\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}\Gamma^{1}_{11}&\Gamma^{1}_{12}\\ \Gamma^{1}_{12}&\Gamma^{1}_{22}\end{array}\right),\hskip 5.69054pt\Gamma^{2}=% \left(\begin{array}[]{cc}\Gamma^{1}_{22}&\Gamma^{1}_{12}\\ \Gamma^{1}_{12}&\Gamma^{1}_{11}\end{array}\right) (4) and D=D^{T}=D^{\tau}, \Delta=\Delta^{T}=\Delta^{\tau} where \tau denotes the off-diagonal transpose. It is insightful to transform Eq. (3) to its normal modes where the rotated fields, denoted by tildes, transform as \tilde{\theta}^{1}={(\theta^{1}+\theta^{2})}/{\sqrt{2}}, \tilde{\theta}^{2}={(\theta^{1}-\theta^{2})}/{\sqrt{2}}. These coordinates capture the joint phase and phase difference between the condensates. The linear equations decouple with diffusion matrices \tilde{D}_{11}=D_{11}+D_{12} and \tilde{D}_{22}=D_{11}-D_{12}. The noise covariance inherits the diagonal structure \langle\tilde{\zeta}^{\alpha}(x,t)\tilde{\zeta}^{\beta}(x^{\prime},t^{\prime})% \rangle=\delta^{\alpha\beta}(\Delta_{11}\pm\Delta_{12})\delta(x-x^{\prime})% \delta(t-t^{\prime}) where +,\,- are for (1,1) and (2,2) components respectively. Interaction vertices are rank-(1,2) tensors, transforming non-trivially \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}=(\Gamma^{1}_{11}+2\Gamma^{1}_{12}+\Gamma^{1}_{22})/% \sqrt{2}, \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}=(\Gamma^{1}_{11}-2\Gamma^{1}_{12}+\Gamma^{1}_{22})/% \sqrt{2}, \tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12}=(\Gamma^{1}_{11}-\Gamma^{1}_{22})/\sqrt{2} while all other non-linear terms vanish. In these coordinates, the \mathbb{Z}_{2}-theory maps onto \displaystyle\partial_{t}\tilde{\theta}^{1} \displaystyle=\tilde{D}_{11}\partial_{x}^{2}\tilde{\theta}^{1}+\dfrac{1}{2}% \left(\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}(\partial_{x}\tilde{\theta}^{1})^{2}+\tilde{% \Gamma}^{1}_{22}(\partial_{x}\tilde{\theta}^{2})^{2}\right)+\tilde{\zeta}_{1} (5) \displaystyle\partial_{t}\tilde{\theta}^{2} \displaystyle=\tilde{D}_{22}\partial_{x}^{2}\tilde{\theta}^{2}+\tilde{\Gamma}^% {2}_{12}(\partial_{x}\tilde{\theta}^{1})(\partial_{x}\tilde{\theta}^{2})+% \tilde{\zeta_{2}} previously studied by Ertaş and Kardar in dynamic roughening of directed lines [16]. For decoupled \mathbb{Z}_{2} symmetric KPZ equations with v_{c}=v_{d}=0, the bare parameters transform to \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}=\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}=\tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12} which corresponds to the point (1,1) in FIG. 1(iii). Tuning the intercomponent interactions allows you to move away from the decoupled point into other quadrants, each representing distinct physical behaviours. At large times, the dynamics is dominated by the non-linearity and stability analysis shows that if \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22} and \tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12} do not have the same sign, there is an instability. This instability arises from the non-hyperbolicity of the linearised equations and non-linear dominated dynamics in Quadrants II and IV in FIG. 1. Tuning (\tilde{v}_{c},\tilde{v}_{d}), we can access this instability in Quadrant IV from the SCGLE by choosing bare parameters which satisfy Eq. (2) but violate conditions \displaystyle-1+\dfrac{\mathcal{R}(u)}{\mathcal{R}(k)}(1+\tilde{v}_{d}) \displaystyle<\tilde{v}_{c}<1-\dfrac{\mathcal{R}(u)}{\mathcal{R}(k)}(1-\tilde{% v}_{d}) (6a) \displaystyle 1-\dfrac{\mathcal{R}(u)}{\mathcal{R}(k)}(1-\tilde{v}_{d}) \displaystyle<\tilde{v}_{c}<-1+\dfrac{\mathcal{R}(u)}{\mathcal{R}(k)}(1+\tilde% {v}_{d}) (6b) for \mathcal{R}(u)<\mathcal{R}(k) and for \mathcal{R}(u)>\mathcal{R}(k) respectively. For clarity, we draw attention to the significance of this quadrant in the context of the original \mathbb{Z}_{2} parameters. In FIG. 1(iii), Quadrant IV is achieved when both X = \tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12}/\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}<0 and Y=(\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}\tilde{\Delta}_{22}\tilde{D}_{11})/(\tilde{\Gamma}^{% 1}_{11}\tilde{\Delta}_{11}\tilde{D}_{22})>0. In the specific case of the SCGLE mapping, \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}=\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11} and \tilde{\Delta}_{11},\tilde{\Delta}_{22}>0 are always satisfied, leading to the equivalence of conditions Y>0 and Eq. (2), both of which ensure the positive definiteness of the diffusion constants \tilde{D}_{11},\,\tilde{D}_{22}>0. Therefore, Quadrant IV emerges by tuning the effective KPZ interactions, \tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12}\sim(\Gamma^{1}_{11}-\Gamma^{1}_{22}) and \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}\sim(\Gamma^{1}_{11}+\Gamma^{1}_{22}), to have different signs. Consequently, in the \mathbb{Z}_{2} coordinates, this occurs when the KPZ intercomponent interaction between the phase modes is larger than the KPZ intracomponent interaction |\Gamma^{1}_{22}|>|\Gamma^{1}_{11}|. In this quadrant, the non-hyperbolicity gives rise to large phase differences between nearest-neighbour sites. At the physical level, this triggers the proliferation of STVs, non-trivial windings in the phase due to compactness. The vortex turbulent regime dramatically modifies the scaling, resulting in growth exponent \beta=1/2 and dynamical exponent z=1 as shown in FIG. 2. An STV phase has been observed in the single component case in the large noise regime [59], however this phase transition originates from tuning the intercomponent interaction \tilde{v}_{c}. More detail on the analysis of the STV phase can be found in the supplemental material Ref. [61]. Figure 2: SCGLE simulations with parameters v_{d}=0, k_{d}=u_{d}=\mu_{d}=1 and k_{c}=3,\;u_{c}=1.5 and tuning \tilde{v}_{c} from 0 to -1.2. (i-ii) The autocorrelation \Delta(t_{1}-t_{2}) of the unwound phase for \tilde{\theta}_{1} and \tilde{\theta}_{2} respectively showing a crossover to the STV regime when tuning \tilde{v}_{c} between 0 to -1.2 plotted from bottom to top. (iii) Probability of a vortex in the spacetime lattice for unrotated \theta_{1}, \theta_{2} as a function of attractive \tilde{v}_{c}. Inset shows the line traced out in the (X,Y) plane in FIG. 1(iii) from the decoupled point (1,1) in Quadrant I (KPZ) in blue to Quadrant IV (STV) in red. (iv) Vortex charge distribution with +1 (red) and -1 (blue) on a section of the spacetime lattice for \tilde{v}_{c}=-1.2 in the STV dominated Quadrant IV. The RG flows are best interpreted in the normal mode basis in adimensionalised coordinates from Eq. (5), closing under the \mathbb{R}^{4}-parameter space: T=\tilde{D}_{22}/\tilde{D}_{11}, X=\tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12}/\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}, Y=(\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}\tilde{\Delta}_{22}\tilde{D}_{11})/(\tilde{\Gamma}^{% 1}_{11}\tilde{\Delta}_{11}\tilde{D}_{22}), Z=(\tilde{\Delta}_{11}(\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22})^{2})/(4\Lambda\tilde{D}_{11}^{% 3}) where \Lambda is the UV cutoff regularising the effective theory. The cutoff has a natural origin in exciton-polariton systems since excitons typically have a Bohr radius up to 100\text{\AA} giving k_{max}=h/100\text{\AA}. The noise ratio W=\tilde{\Delta}_{22}/\tilde{\Delta}_{11} is required to be positive definite to retain its connection to probability. The RG flow equations are autonomous ODEs describing how the parameters change as we iteratively integrate out high momentum modes. The boundary condition for the flows is specified at \ell=0 where the parameters assume their initial bare values. The projected flows of X and Y are shown in FIG. 1(iii). The parameters X,\,Y do not change sign under RG, implying that the flows do not cross between quadrants. To understand the phase dynamics, we can concentrate on Quadrants I and IV since the other quadrants present a physical instability from Eq. (2). The RG suggests that the scaling should be Edwards-Wilkinson z=2 for the \tilde{\theta}_{2} mode and KPZ z=3/2 for \tilde{\theta}_{1} in Quadrant IV, however we must discount it based on the instability from conditions (6a) and (6b). Physically, this quadrant as previously discussed corresponds to a disordered STV phase with z=1 for both modes. At this point, we focus on the analysis of the coupled SCGLE in Quadrant I."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06854v1,Condensation of Composite Bosonic Trions in Interacting Bose-Fermi Mixtures,"We reveal a quantum coherent state of composite bosonic trions, where paired fermions further pair with bosons, in a one-dimensional Bose-Fermi system featuring onsite boson-fermion attraction and pair hopping of fermions. Extensive density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations show that the quasi-condensation of the composite trions is established by algebraic decaying correlations of trions, gapped single-particle excitations, and suppressed correlations of fermion pairs. Negative binding energy also indicates a strong tendency to form trions. Furthermore, we conduct a phenomenological analysis based on a mean-field variational ansatz to interpret the emergence of composite trions. Additionally, We discuss feasible experimental methods for realizing this novel phase of matter in ultracold atom experiments.","References Yukawa (1935) H. Yukawa, Proc. Phys.-Math. Soc.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06756v1,Ro-vibrational Dynamics of the Neon Dimer,"Short intense laser pulses are routinely used to induce rotational wave packet dynamics of molecules. Ro-vibrational wave packet dynamics has been explored comparatively infrequently, focusing predominantly on extremely light and rigid molecules such as H{}_{2}^{+}, H2, and D2. This work presents quantum mechanical calculations that account for the rotational and the vibrational degrees of freedom for a heavier and rather floppy diatomic molecule, namely the neon dimer. For pumping by a strong and short non-resonant pump pulse, we identify several phenomena that depend critically on the vibrational (i.e., radial) degree of freedom. Our calculations show (i) fingerprints of the radial dynamics in the alignment signal; (ii) laser-kick induced dissociative dynamics on very short time scales (ejection of highly structured “jets”); and (iii) tunneling dynamics that signifies the existence of resonance states, which are supported by the effective potential curves for selected finite relative angular momenta. Our theory predictions can be explored by existing state-of-the-art experiments.","Ultrafast spectroscopy, including pump-probe and pump-dump-probe spectroscopy, is an extremely powerful tool that has provided insights into electronic correlations of atoms and molecules embedded into liquids or solids as well as isolated atoms and molecules. While the spectral response provides enormous insights, more recently direct imaging techniques have been developed for use, among others, in molecular beam experiments COLTRIMS ; COLTRIMS2 ; schouder2022 . The ability to record spatially and temporally resolved images experimentally with unprecedented precision opens the possibility to follow the pump-pulse induced dynamics of all degrees of freedom as a function of the delay time. Pump-probe spectroscopy has, e.g., allowed for the creation of rotational wave packets that display unique revivals as a function of the delay time RMP ; RMP2 ; seideman1999 ; corkum2003 ; rotational ; rotational2 . Such revivals have been observed in diatomic molecules as well as larger molecules for a wide range of pump pulse shapes and polarizations lin2020 . In addition to being of fundamental relevance for understanding light-matter interactions, laser-kicked molecules promise a rich foray of applications, including sensing and high-harmonic generation RMP . Comparatively few studies of vibrational wave packets exist. Early work investigated the spreading and recurrences of vibrational wave packets after electronic excitation or ionization baumert . Moreover, the distance-dependence of the ionization probability has been investigated in great detail distance-dependent-ionization ; distance-dependent-ionization2 . Vibrational or ro-vibrational wave packet dynamics have been studied in light molecules such as H{}_{2}^{+}, D{}_{2}^{+}, H2, and D2, where there exists an intriguing interplay also with the electronic degrees of freedom rovibrational ; rovibrational2 ; rovibrational3 . An interplay of rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom is also seen in heavier optically centrifuged super-rotors villeneuve ; centrifuge2 . Very recently, quantum control of the ro-vibrational dynamics has been investigated in the context of light-induced molecular chirality in comparatively heavy molecules koch2024 . This work considers a simple linearly polarized Gaussian pump-pulse with intensities and pulse length comparable to those used in many experiments over the past several decades, namely peak intensities I up to 1.2\times 10^{14} W/cm2 and pulse lengths up to 900 fs. As an example, we consider the neon dimer. Compared to the helium dimer ground state, which is a weakly-bound quantum halo, the neon dimer ground state is more strongly bound and more compact. Relatedly, the neon dimer possesses, unlike the helium dimer, several ro-vibrationally excited bound states. On the other hand, the characteristic rotational energy of the neon dimer is only about an order of magnitude smaller than the vibrational energy scale, i.e., the scale separation is much smaller than in heavier rare gas dimers hellmann_potential ; rotational ; heavydimer . This comparatively small scale separation is an important prerequisite for identifying several novel phenomena that depend critically on the internal dynamics of the molecule. A second ingredient decisive for the observed phenomena is the significant variation of the polarization anisotropy across the internuclear distances present in the neon dimer. Specifically, we identify several phenomena that are entirely absent in the rigid-rotor treatment rigidbody . We observe so-called Lochfrass, an effect that was first seen in seminal work on molecular hydrogen saenz , where the pump-laser triggers population transfer away from small internuclear distances, an effect that is absent in the rigid-rotor based description. Moreover, we observe unbound wave packet portions that fly away as “structured jets” with a speed of around a few Bohr radii per picosecond. Wave packet portions that travel at much smaller speeds are a signature of resonance states, which decay by quantum tunneling through the potential barrier created by the relative angular momentum of the dimer. Furthermore, we highlight the distance-dependence of the alignment. The remainder of this article is structured as follows.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06678v1,Stationary acoustic black hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis,"In this article, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with the idea of finding solutions that could possibly correspond to a so-called acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes. Those are flows with horizons where the speed of the flow goes from sub-sonic to super-sonic. This is because sound cannot go back from the supersonic to the subsonic region. The speed of sound plays the role of the speed of light in a gravitational black hole, an important difference being that there are excitations that can go faster than the speed of sound and therefore can escape the sonic black hole. Here, the motion of the BEC is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). More concretely, we discuss singular Stationary solutions of Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with Circular symmetry) and 3D (with Spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to study the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity of the condensate to see whether they cross, indicating the potential existence of a sonic analog of a black/white hole. We discuss numerical techniques used and also study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions to see how well they agree with numerical solutions. We also study how the resurgent transseries plays a role in these solutions.","The main purpose of this paper is to study solutions to a differential equation that appears in the context of black holes simulations using supefluids. In [PhysRevLett.46.1351] Unruh proposed the idea of studying acoustic black holes as a way to bring quantum phenomena such as Hawking radiation [HawkingS.W.1975Pcbb] closer to experimentation. This challenge was subsequently taken up by various experimental groups, for example [Steinhauer2014] and [MunozdeNova2019], and more recently [Tamura:2023mby]. A setup where one expects to see such quantum phenomena is in acoustic black holes produced by the motion of a superfluid (Bose-Einstein condensate) at ultra-cold temperatures. In this work, we consider the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with coupling g and without an external potential [NozieresPinesBEC], that describes the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)}{\partial t}=-\frac{% \hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}\psi\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)+g{\lvert\psi\left(% \vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)\rvert}^{2}\psi\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right) (1.1) Small perturbations follow a dispersion relation [NozieresPinesSound]: E=\hbar\omega=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar^{2}\lvert\vec{\mathbf{q}}\rvert^{2}}{2m}\left(% \frac{\hbar^{2}\lvert\vec{\mathbf{q}}\rvert^{2}}{2m}+2gn\right)} (1.2) where, n is the density, \vec{\mathbf{q}} is momentum, and \omega is the frequency. From equation (1.2), we get E\approx c\hbar\lvert\vec{\mathbf{q}}\rvert when \frac{\hbar^{2}\lvert\vec{\mathbf{q}}\rvert^{2}}{2m}<<2gn which is a long-wavelength approximation. In that case, the excitations are phonons with speed of sound c=\sqrt{\frac{ng}{m}} (1.3) Now if we write the current density \vec{\mathbf{j}}\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)=-\frac{i\hbar}{2m}\left({\psi}% ^{*}\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)\vec{\nabla}\psi\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t% \right)-\psi\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)\vec{\nabla}{\psi}^{*}\left(\vec{% \mathbf{r}},t\right)\right) (1.4) from (1.1) and substitute \psi\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)=\sqrt{n\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)}{% \mathrm{e}}^{i\theta\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)}{\mathrm{e}}^{-i\mu t} into it as in [NozieresPinesVelocity], we get the fluid velocity as \vec{v}\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)=\frac{\vec{\mathbf{j}}\left(\vec{% \mathbf{r}},t\right)}{n\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)}=\frac{\hbar}{m}\vec{% \nabla}\theta\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right) (1.5) Our main focus is to find stationary solutions to the equation (1.1) corresponding to acoustic black holes in two (and three) spatial dimensions. We assume an infinite-size fluid that undergoes an inward radial flow with a magnitude of radial velocity v(r). The magnitude of the inward velocity vanishes at infinity and increases as r decreases. If, below a certain radius r_{h}, the magnitude of inward velocity is larger than the speed of sound (v(r<r_{h})>c) then r_{h} acts as an acoustic horizon [PhysRevA.99.023850], and sound waves cannot escape from that region. In principle, the flow can again become subsonic at even smaller radius. In addition, the density will become singular (\rho\rightarrow\infty) at some point r=r_{0}\geq 0. In practice, when the density is large, the fluid is removed by atomic collisions so that \rho remains finite. A similar problem is discussed in [PhysRevA.109.023305], wherein the singularity is removed by including a three-body recombination term and an external potential. However, our study focuses on singular solutions as an approximation to non-singular ones. We do not expect to find analytical solutions and therefore we employ a combination of asymptotic series expansion and numerical techniques. When the series expansion alone does not contain all the information about the system, more advanced mathematical techniques are required to extract the information about non-perturbative corrections. These non-perturbative corrections show up when the asymptotic perturbative series has factorially divergent coefficients. Furthermore, when the differential equation is nonlinear in the dependent variable, non-perturbative corrections keep appearing with increasing powers and also bring in their own factorially divergent perturbative series multiplying them. This is known as a transseries ([10.1155/S1073792895000286], [10.1215/S0012-7094-98-09311-5]) that needs to be resummed using the Laplace-Borel transform to get the most general solution. The phenomenon of resurgence in the transseries is also required for the most general solution ([Aniceto2015], [DORIGONI2019167914], [Costin_2019], and [PhysRevD.92.125011]) to be real. This allows us to check properties of the numerical solutions that can be obtained with standard methods such as Newton iteration with Chebyshev collocation. Resurgent transseries and its Borel summation have been used for various problems such as the nonlinear equation for Bjorken flow in conformal hydrodynamics [PhysRevD.92.125011], Painlevé equation [Costin_2019] and many others."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06619v1,Engineering Ponderomotive Potential for Realizing \pi and \pi/2 Bosonic Josephson Junctions,"We study the ponderomotive potential of a bosonic Josephson junction periodically modulated by a high-frequency electromagnetic field. Within the small population difference approximation, the ponderomotive drive induces the well-known Kapitza pendulum effect, stabilizing a \pi-phase mode. We discuss the parameter dependence of the dynamical transition from macroscopic quantum self-trapping to \pi-Josephson oscillations. Furthermore, we examine the situation where the small population difference approximation fails. In this case, an essential momentum-shortening effect emerges, leading to a stabilized \pi/2-phase mode under certain conditions. By mapping this to a classical pendulum scenario, we highlight the uniqueness and limitations of the \pi/2-phase mode in bosonic Josephson junctions.","The superconducting Josephson effect was first predicted in 1962 [1], showing that the cooper pair can tunnel through a thin insulator between two superconductors. The tunneling supercurrent depends on the phase difference across the tunneling barrier. Over past decades, a variety of current-phase relations in Josephson junctions have been theoretically discussed and experimentally observed [2]. For example, under certain conditions, a Josephson junction could sustain a phase difference of \pi between the two superconductors in its ground state, a configuration known as a “\pi- Josephson junction” [3]. Other types of nontrivial Josephson junctions, including \pi/2-phase junction, junctions exhibiting 0-\pi transitions, and tilted topological junctions were later studied in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) offer a charge neutral platform to explore the Josephson effect, where neutral atoms replace electrons in the current. It was first proposed in two weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in a double-well trap [11], known as the Bose-Josephson junction (BJJ) or the bosonic Josephson junction. A macroscopic number of bosons condensate in the two wells, and the weak coupling between them gives rise to the quantum tunneling phenomenon. Furthermore, interactions between bosons induce nonlinear effects, often described by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation or Gross–Pitaevskii equation. The physics of a classical pendulum is often used as an analogy for understanding different dynamic modes in the BJJ, including the traditional Josephson tunneling, self-trapping and \pi-phase oscillations [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. In experiments, a single bosonic Josephson junction was first realized in the optical lattice [17]. Later the d.c. Josephson effects [18], interatomic interactions [19], phase-locking [20, 21] and spin squeezing [22] were also investigated in experiments. When some parameters are periodically modulated in the BJJ, different phenomena can arise [23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. For example, by oscillating the energy bias between the two traps with the high frequency, phase-locking [28, 29] and quasienergies [30] have been studied. Moreover, research shows that the time-dependent nonlinear interactions may drive the system into chaos through period doubling bifurcations [31]. The periodically driven Josephson coupling energy can be associated with chaos [32, 33], quantum metrology [33], ring structures [34] and Landau-Zener tunneling [35, 36]. And if the modulation originates from an external pulse field, the system resembles the nonlinear Rosen-Zener model [37, 38]. Experimentally, Floquet engineering of a one-dimensional BJJ has been achieved in a tilted double-well potential [39]. There is a non-intuitive phenomenon resulting from the external modulation in classical mechanics, showing that an upside-down pendulum could be stabilized by a vertical high-frequency force. This physical phenomenon is known as the Kapitza effect [40]. Applying the Kapitza effect to the BJJ, the collective dynamics under a fast driving field with a noisy component was studied and a stabilized \pi-phase state was predicted [41] using the master equation. However, in previous works, the effective stationary potential and its parameter dependence of this \phi=\pi coherent state were not fully explored. In this paper, instead of using the master equation, we introduce the ponderomotive potential [42, 43] to reveal the dynamics for a large time scale without noise. Ponderomotive potential, or ponderomotive force, appears widely in laser physics, describing the motion trend of charged particles in an inhomogeneous oscillating electromagnetic field [43, 44]. Now this notion has been extended to quantum many-body physics [45, 46, 47, 48, 49] according to the similar physical picture that a system undergoes an inhomogeneous periodic driving field and exhibits distinct behaviors across different time scales. By using the ponderomotive potential, we investigate how the periodic modulation of Josephson coupling induces transitions between different dynamic modes. First, we apply periodic modulation to the BJJ and show the time-dependent equations of motion under the two-mode approximation [12], using the macroscopic wave function. For a small population difference, the analytically calculated effective potential reconfirms the energy minimum with a phase difference of \pi. We analyze the parameter dependence to understand how the dynamic modes are regulated by the driving frequency and amplitude, causing the dynamical phase transition. In addition to \pi-modes, \pi/2-modes are more intriguing because, in superconductor Josephson junctions, time-reversal symmetry breaking needs to be broken to form a \pi/2-junction. In our setup, the periodic driving field to the BJJ provides the necessary time-reversal symmetry breaking to form \pi/2-modes. We go deep into the unique momentum-shortening effect of the BJJ and reveal the possibility of stabilized \pi/2-phase dynamic modes, where the small population difference approximation is no longer available. Analytical results of relative phase behavior in the vicinity of \pi/2-phase region are derived under a driving field, and these findings are supported by numerical simulations. Finally, we reveal the dependency of the \pi/2 modes’ lifetime on the time-averaged tunneling energy."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06585v2,Double-target BEC atomtronic rotation sensor,"We present a proof-of-concept design for an atomtronic rotation sensor consisting of an array of “double-target” Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). A “target” BEC is a disk-shaped condensate surrounded by a concentric ring-shaped condensate. A “double-target” BEC is two adjacent target BECs whose ring condensates partially overlap. The sensor consists of an n\times m array of these double-target BECs. The measurement of the frame rotation speed, \Omega_{R}, is carried out by creating the array of double-target BECs (setup step), inducing one unit of quantized flow in the top ring of each member of the array (initialization step), applying potential barriers in the overlap region of each member (measurement step), and observing whether the induced flow is transferred from the top to the bottom ring in each member (readout step). We describe a set of simulations showing that a single instance of a double-target BEC behaves in a way that enables the efficient operation of an n\times m array for measuring \Omega_{R}. As an example of sensor operation we present a simulation showing that a 2\times2 array can be designed to measure \Omega_{R} in a user-specified range.","I Atomtronic Sensor for Precision Navigation Inertial navigation systems (INS), which include gyroscopes and accelerometers, are used in many applications such as commercial aircraft and ocean-going vessels Grewal et al. (2013). These systems enable moving vehicles to determine their position and orientation using the method of “dead reckoning.” In this method, the vehicle’s location and orientation are determined relative to a known reference point by integrating the vehicle’s acceleration and angular velocity since it left the reference point. This method enables one to determine position and orientation continuously without needing to receive external signals from satellite navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) Grewal et al. (2013); Pai and Marakala (2016). The ability to navigate without outside help is valuable because systems like the GPS can be jammed or spoofed by bad actors. Furthermore, GPS is not always available as, for example, deep under the ocean. Thus, the development of on-board inertial sensors that can operate for times long compared to trip times in the absence of external signals, such as GPS, constitutes a important research problem. It would be a significant achievement if sensors were capable of operating accurately for long periods of time El-Sheimy and Youssef (2020). All inertial navigation systems have parameters that must be calibrated. These parameters include biases, scale factors, and misalignment of their various components Grewal et al. (2013). The values of these parameters are not always constant and can slowly change over the operating period of the INS device. This is referred to as “parameter drift.” Parameter drift leads to errors in the measurement of accelerations and rotation velocities and this is a particular problem for navigation systems that are based on dead reckoning. Since position and orientation are determined by integrating rates of change over time, parameter drift causes the position and orientation errors to grow with time. It is therefore useful for the INS to include a secondary system for measuring acceleration and rotation angular velocity more accurately, but at a lower sample rate to correct for errors incurred by parameter drift Grewal et al. (2013). In this work, we propose a rotation sensor design based on an “atomtronic” system as a possible secondary measurement system. An atomtronic system is loosely defined as an ultracold gas manipulated by laser light so that its behavior is analogous to an electronic system, except that it has a current of neutral atoms rather than electrons. Such gases are generally cold and dense enough to be put in the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state. Recent advances in the optical manipulation of neutral atoms Pasienski and DeMarco (2008); Gaunt and Hadzibabic (2008); Henderson et al. (2009); Bowman et al. (2017) have sparked experimental and theoretical interest in systems of Bose-Einstein-condensed atomic gases confined to a thin sheet in a horizontal plane. Cases where the BEC is confined within this plane to a closed-loop channel potential can be roughly analogous to electronic circuits. These systems are sometimes referred to as “atom circuits” and their study is part of the emergent field of atomtronics Amico et al. (2017). Interest in atom circuits derives in part from their potential for use in devices such as rotation sensors Amico et al. (2017) suitable for precision navigation. Proposed examples include devices that sense rotation via Sagnac interferometry Moan et al. (2020); Gustavson et al. (2000), and those that act as analogs of Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs), where rotation takes the place of magnetic flux Ryu et al. (2013); Mathey and Mathey (2016); Wang et al. (2015); Safavi-Naini et al. (2016). Some implementations of these types of interferometers include a BEC confined in a ring geometry Bell et al. (2016); Murray et al. (2013); Gallucci and Proukakis (2016); Aghamalyan et al. (2016); Navez et al. (2016); Ramanathan et al. (2011); Wright et al. (2013); Kumar et al. (2016); Eckel et al. (2014a); Jendrzejewski et al. (2014). In this work, we present a different idea for measuring frame rotation speed. This work was inspired by earlier work in double-ring geometries that showed that persistent currents could exist in a single ring without transferring to the other ring Bland et al. (2020) and that such currents are dependent on the rotation and acceleration of the rest frame of the double ring Bland et al. (2022). We also note that there an idea for measuring frame acceleration using the motion of vortices has been proposed Chaika et al. (2024). Here we consider a particular implementation of the general setup depicted in Fig. 1. A gas of sodium atoms is squeezed into a horizontally oriented thin sheet by laser light. It is then subjected to a 2D potential within the plane that is arbitrary in space and time. A laser beam, whose photon energy is tuned to the blue of an atomic transition, acts as a repulsive potential on the center-of-mass motion of the atom. The potential is proportional to the laser intensity, which can vary in space and time. When the laser is tuned to the red of the transition, the laser intensity acts as an attractive potential Pethick and Smith (2008). Thus, as can be seen in the figure, two parallel, horizontal, blue-detuned light sheets squeeze the gas into the space between the sheets and support the gas against gravity. A two-dimensional potential is projected onto the space between the light sheets by focusing an image created by a digital micromirror device (DMD). A DMD is a rectangular array of tiny mirrors, each of which contributes a pixel of the image by either reflecting laser light or scattering it away. Laser light is shined on the mirror array and the reflected light is imaged into the space between the light sheets as shown in Fig. 1. Given the 20 kHz mirror array refresh rate, a nearly arbitrary 2D potential can be applied to the atoms in the gas trapped between the sheets. Such setups now exist in many labs around the world Gauthier et al. (2016); Amico et al. (2021). Figure 1: The general setup of the atomtronic system. A gas of neutral sodium atoms is confined to a thin sheet in the horizontal plane by a pair of blue-detuned light sheets Pethick and Smith (2008). Within this plane an arbitrary 2D optical potential can be applied to these atoms using a digital micromirror device (DMD). This figure is drawn after Fig. 2(a) of Ref. Kumar et al. (2016) . We assume here that the gas of atoms has been confined as described above. We furthermore assume that this gas has been cooled such that a Bose-Einstein condensate has formed and that all of the gas atoms are in the condensate. The potentials we refer to here are the 2D potentials created by the image projected by the DMD device. The full potential experienced by the atoms, and that governs the center-of-mass motion of the atoms, is this 2D potential plus a harmonic oscillator potential in the vertical (z-axis) direction."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06507v1,One-Dimensional Quench Dynamics in an Optical Lattice: sine-Gordon and Bose-Hubbard Descriptions,"We investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional interacting bosons in an optical lattice after a sudden quench in the Bose-Hubbard (BH) and sine-Gordon (SG) regimes. While in higher dimension, the Mott-superfluid phase transition is observed for weakly interacting bosons in deep lattices, in 1D an instability is generated also for shallow lattices with a commensurate periodic potential pinning the atoms to the Mott state through a transition described by the SG model. The present work aims at identifying the SG and BH regimes. We study them by dynamical measures of several key quantities. We numerically exactly solve the time dependent Schrödinger equation for small number of atoms and investigate the corresponding quantum many-body dynamics. In both cases, correlation dynamics exhibits collapse revival phenomena, though with different time scales. We argue that the dynamical fragmentation is a convenient quantity to distinguish the dynamics specially near the pinning zone. To understand the relaxation process we measure the many-body information entropy. BH dynamics clearly establishes the possible relaxation to the maximum entropy state determined by the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices (GOE). In contrast, the SG dynamics is so fast that it does not exhibit any signature of relaxation in the present time scale of computation.","Ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices offer a well known laboratory system with unprecedented control over experimental parameters. It has emerged in the last two decades as an ideal test bed for the study of complex many-body quantum phenomena [1]. Experimentally it became quite straightforward to tune the lattice depth of the optical potential and study different dynamical regimes and physical phenomena, such as quantum phase transitions [2] and Josephson dynamics [3], see more references in [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Quantum many-body systems may exhibit quantum phase transitions at zero temperature, where thermal fluctuations are frozen out, but strong quantum fluctuations drive the system from one phase to another [9]. Across the phase transition two competing energy terms in the many-body Hamiltonian may determine the presence of a critical value in the ratio of the system parameters. A major example of quantum phase transition is the one from a superfluid (SF) phase to Mott insulator phase (MI)–also referred to as the Mott-Hubbard quantum phase transition [2, 10]. The Mott transition in dimension larger than 1 takes place for interacting bosons in deep lattices, and it is driven by the competition between the interaction strength (U) and hopping term (J). In the experiments reported in [2, 11], Rb atoms loaded in optical lattices demonstrated phase transition to insulating Mott phase at a critical value J/U [11] and a periodic series of collapse and revival in the dynamical evolution of the matter-wave interference pattern was observed [11]. On the theoretical side, it is well known that the lattice model-Bose Hubbard (BH) captures the relevant physics and the SF to MI transition is well studied in all dimensions [6]. In the SF phase, the effective dynamics is described by the classical version of the BH model, that is the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation [12, 13]. The study of the properties of strongly interacting bosons confined in one-dimension is particularly interesting as the effects of quantum fluctuations and correlations are enhanced. Especially, the extreme case of the Tonks-Girardeau gas when the strongly correlated bosons minimize their spatial overlap and acquire fermionic properties [14, 15]. In the limit of vanishing periodic potential, a remarkable quantum phase transition is observed–pinning the system by an arbitrarily weak lattice leads to sine-Gordon (SG) phase transition from SF Luttinger liquid to Mott insulator [16]. In a shallow potential, the MI transition is basically controlled by the strong interaction. Experimentally this Mott transition has been observed through modulation spectroscopy and transport phenomena [17]. The pinning transition in the vanishing lattice is described by (1+1) sine-Gordon model [18, 19]. Despite of the existence of outnumbering research work to understand the Bose-Hubbard physics in deep lattices [20, 4, 5, 6, 7, 21, 1, 22], the existing literature are relatively less developed for strongly interacting bosons in shallow lattices. The latter is a challenge as the BH model is restricted to cases in which one can define site localized Wannier functions [23]. To address strongly correlated bosons in shallow lattices, it is necessary to go beyond the BH model [24]. Mott transition for strongly interacting bosons in shallow lattices was studied in [25, 23] using quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the continuum space. The main motivation was to precisely determine the phase diagram in plane \gamma-V_{0}, where \gamma is the dimensionless Lieb-Liniger coupling constant [26, 27], proportional to the strength of the two-body \delta interparticle potential [28] and V_{0} is the strength of the periodic potential. It was confirmed that the line separating the SF and the MI phases is giving a finite value of \gamma in the limit V_{0}\to 0 for commensurate filling. It was also found a significant deviation from the perturbative sine-Gordon theory, and the regimes of validity of BH and SG models were also discussed [25, 23]. We finally mention that the effects of deviations from commensurate filings were also studied [29, 30]. In this paper, we address the two experimental situations: a) pinning transition in shallow lattices [17]. b) the collapse revival dynamics in deep lattice [2]. The quench dynamics of strongly interacting superfluid in the shallow lattice is termed as SG dynamics and the same for weakly interacting superfluid in deep lattice is termed as BH dynamics. The main motivation is to clarify the intermediate correlated dynamics both in the SG and the BH regimes. The time evolution of the many-body Schrödinger equation is computed by the ab initio many-body method MCTDHB (multiconfigurational time dependent Hartree for bosons) [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37], which calculates the many-body wave function numerically exactly. We observe that the system exhibits rich and distinguishable many-body dynamics at different time scales in both regimes. We present and discuss the one- and two-body correlation functions and prescribe some key quantities to understand the difference of SG and BH dynamics. We find that the dynamical fragmentation plays the key role to distinguish SG dynamics from BH dynamics, especially in the pinning zone of sine-Gordon regime. We establish that the time required for first entry in the Mott state, natural occupation, Shannon information entropy and the local density-density correlation are the important measures to distinguish the SG and BH dynamics. For the SG regime, where the initial state is fragmented and strongly correlated due to strong interatomic interaction, upon quench it enters fast to the Mott phase. Whereas in the BH regime, the initial state is a non-fragmented and less correlated superfluid, upon quench it enters the Mott phase at a time which is significantly larger than the time scale in SG regime. We numerically calculate many-body information entropy in the long-time dynamics to understand the possibility of statistical relaxation in both cases. For the BH dynamics, after the initial SF-MI collapse-revival, the system exhibits some modulated oscillations in entropy, presenting signatures of a possible relaxation at much longer time. At variance, for the SG dynamics we observe unmodulated collapse-revival phenomena in the maximum time period achieved in the present set of computation (of course, it may eventually relax at a very long time which is out of scope of the available simulation). The paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II, we introduce the theoretical framework and the quantities of interest. Sec.III presents the initial set up and quench protocol. Sec.IV presents the first-order Glauber correlation function both in the SG and BH dynamics. Sec.V presents the second-order Glauber correlation function. Sec.VI deals with the several measures used to distinguish the SG dynamics from the BH dynamics. Sec.VII concludes the summary. Appendix A discusses the main results for larger system size and Appendix B summarizes the units used in the numerical computation."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06275v1,Polarons and bipolarons in Rydberg-dressed extended Bose-Hubbard model,"Impurities immersed in hard-core Bose gases offer exciting opportunities to explore polaron and bipolaron physics. We investigate the ground state properties of a single and a pair of impurities throughout the superfluid and insulating (charge density wave) phases of the bosonic environment. In the superfluid phase, we demonstrate that the impurity undergoes a polaron-like transition, shifting from behaving as an individual particle to becoming a dressed quasiparticle as the coupling with the bath increases. However, in the insulating phase, the impurity can maintain its individual character, moving through a potential landscape shaped by the charge density wave order. Moreover, we show that two impurities can form a bound state even in the absence of an explicit impurity-impurity coupling. Furthermore, we establish the stability of this bound state within both the superfluid and insulating phases. Our results offer valuable insights for ongoing lattice polaron experiments with ultracold gases.","Polarons arising from the interaction between mobile impurities and their host environment have provided valuable insights into quantum many-body systems [1, 2], offering simple yet accurate descriptions of a wide range of physical systems, including liquid helium mixtures [3, 4], ultracold atomic gases [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], doped antiferromagnets [10, 11], and hybrid light-matter materials [12, 13], among others. On the other hand, ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide a powerful quantum simulation platform for strongly correlated phenomena [14, 15], interestingly due to the translational breaking of symmetry, new phases arise when optical lattices are doped as the size of the polaron can be comparable with the lattice size [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. This includes the behavior of strongly interacting polarons in environments undergoing quantum phase transitions [21, 22, 23], impurity dynamics [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], the formation of bipolarons [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40], polarons in topological media [41, 42, 43, 44, 45], and the intricate interplay between kinetic energy and spin interactions in doped Mott insulators [46, 47, 48]. Figure 1: (a) Illustration of the system considered. Mobile impurities (red spheres) immersed in an interacting hard-core Bose gas (blue spheres) in a one-dimensional optical lattice. The tunneling amplitude for bosons and impurities are denoted by t_{B} and t_{I}, respectively. The interaction among bosons is represented by V_{B}, while the boson-impurity interaction is denoted by U_{BI}. (b) Binding energy E_{p} of a single impurity as a function of the density of the bath n_{B}. Markers are associated with DMRG calculations, whereas the dashed lines correspond to the mean-field prediction E_{p}\approx U_{BI}n_{B}. The gray line represents a guide for the eye for zero energy. We consider V_{B}/t=0. Recently, the one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model (eBHM) with nearest-neighbor interactions was successfully realized using Rydberg-dressed atoms [49]. Furthermore, the eBHM with longer-range interactions was implemented using magnetic atoms [50] and could potentially be realized with polar molecules in the upcoming generation experiments [51, 52]. These breakthrough experiments open up exciting new avenues for exploring impurity physics within an itinerant, long-range interacting quantum gas. Moreover, the eBHM exhibits a superfluid-to-insulator phase transition [53, 54], making it an appealing environment for studying the behavior of impurities across this transition. Understanding the underlying physics of impurities in insulating media has gained increasing relevance [55, 56], particularly in light of recent semiconductor experiments [57, 58, 59]. In this work, we study the quasiparticle properties of a single and a pair of impurities immersed in an interacting hard-core Bose gas on a one-dimensional lattice. Such a system can be realized by doping with impurities the Rydberg-dressed gas in Ref. [49]. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we first describe the ground-state properties of an impurity across the superfluid (SF) and charge density wave (CDW) phases of the bosonic medium. In contrast to the superfluid phase, where the impurity transitions from behaving as an individual particle to a dressed object as its coupling with the environment increases, in the CDW phase, the impurity retains its single-particle character but moves in a potential landscape shaped by the CDW order, which can be effectively described by an ionic Hubbard model [60, 61, 62, 63, 64] (IHM). For the case of two impurities, we numerically demonstrate that the impurities can form a bound state even in the absence of an explicit impurity-impurity coupling, and we establish the stability of this bound state within both the SF and CDW phases. This manuscript is organized as follows. We introduce the model under study in Sec. II. In Sec. III, we examine the binding energy, quasiparticle residue, and resulting spatial bath-impurity correlations for a single impurity. Section IV addresses the two-impurity problem, with a particular focus on bipolaron state formation. Finally, in Sec. V, we summarize our findings."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06163v1,Rotation quenches in trapped bosonic systems,"The ground state properties of strongly rotating bosons confined in an asymmetric anharmonic potential exhibit a split density distribution. However, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of this split structure remain largely unexplored. Given that rotation is responsible for the breakup of the bosonic cloud, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics by abruptly changing the rotation frequency. Our study offers insights into the dynamics of trapped Bose-Einstein condensates in both symmetric and asymmetric anharmonic potentials under different rotation quench scenarios. In the rotationally symmetric trap, angular momentum is a good quantum number. This makes it challenging to exchange angular momentum within the system; hence, a rotation quench does practically not impact the density distribution. In contrast, the absence of angular momentum conservation in asymmetric traps results in more complex dynamics. This allows rotation quenches to either inject into or extract angular momentum from the system. We observe and analyze these intricate dynamics both for the mean-field condensed and the many-body fragmented systems. The dynamical evolution of the condensed system and the fragmented system exhibits similarities in several observables during small rotation quenches. However, these similarities diverge notably for larger quenches. Additionally, we investigate the formation and the impact of the vortices on the angular momentum dynamics of the evolving split density. All in all, our findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of trapped interacting bosons under different rotation quenches.","Rotation has remarkable effects, influencing phenomena from vast astronomical bodies like galaxies and massive rotating stars rotation_ingalaxy1 ; rotation_ingalaxy2 to the intricate quantum domain of atomic nuclei rotation_nuclei . Ultracold bosonic gases under rotation offer a promising avenue for exploring various properties inherent in correlated quantum systems rotation_c1 ; rotation_c2 ; rotation_c3 ; rotation_c4 ; rotation_c5 ; gp2 . These include phenomena like quantized vortices rotation_quantized_vortex , vortex nucleation rotation_vortex_nucleation , the emergence of quantum fluctuations rotation_quantum_fluctuation1 ; rotation_quantum_fluctuation2 , and the manifestation of the fractional quantum Hall effect in weakly interacting quantum systems rotation_quantum_hall_effect . Numerous studies have investigated the properties of rotating quantum gases. For instance, experiments employing anharmonic potentials have revealed the emergence of superfluid flow in atomic physics rotation_superfluif_flow . Ring-shaped traps have proven especially valuable to induce and maintain persistent currents in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) rotation_superfluid_flow2 ; rotation_superfluid_flow3 ; rotation_superfluid_flow4 . On the theoretical front, investigations have explored the dynamics of rotating dipolar condensates, encompassing both three-dimensional configurations rotation_3d as well as in a rotating, asymmetric, pancake-like quartic-quadratic potential rotation_gammal . Studies have shown that rotation influences the breaking up of the ground state density of weakly interacting bosons rotation_gammal ; beinke_rotation2 ; sunayana_scirep . But the process of how angular momentum is acquired and ejected from the system after a quench remains largely unexplored. As the density of the system splits due to the influence of rotation, we are keen to explore how an abrupt change in the rotation frequency drives the dynamical evolution of such systems. The dynamics in the rotating systems are profoundly interesting as they exhibit intricate interplay between rotational effects and many-body correlations. Indeed, numerous studies have utilized many-body treatments to explore fragmentation and correlation in BECs both in non-rotating frames mctdhb_fragmentation1 ; rhombik_epjd ; mctdhb_fragmentation3 ; rhombik_quantumreports ; mctdhb_fragmentation4 and in rotating frames many-body-rotation1 ; many-body-rotation2 ; many-body-rotation3 ; many-body-rotation4 ; many-body-rotation5 ; rotation_budha . However, the investigation of many-body features in the rotating frame has received comparatively less attention. Typically, the investigation of rotating bosons often relies on the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) method, which considers only a single eigenvalue of the one-body reduced density matrix gp1 ; gp2 ; gp3 . According to Penrose and Onsager, interacting bosons are fully condensed if they exhibit a single macroscopic eigenvalue of the reduced one-particle density matrix penrose-onsager . Hence, the GP method treats bosons as condensed and overlooks the presence of correlations and fragmentation in the system. Consequently, the study of rotating bosons necessitates a dedicated many-body treatment to comprehensively understand the intricate dynamics, correlations, and fragmentation phenomena. In this study, we have explored the dynamics after a rotation quench in trapped bosons in two-dimensional anharmonic potentials. In a harmonic trapping potential, when the rotation frequency is comparable to the trapping frequency, the centrifugal force acting on the bosons due to rotation can surpass the trapping force, allowing the bosons to escape the potential angular_limit . To mitigate this, we have used anharmonic traps throughout our calculations asy_trap_1 ; asy_trap_2 . Rotation in trapped BECs can be controlled using rotating magnetic traps or laser stirring techniques, enabling the experimental exploration of rotation quench dynamics in these systems PhysRevLett.97.240402 . In our numerical calculations, the initial state is prepared with an initial rotation frequency featuring split density distribution. The rotation frequency is then abruptly lowered to observe the subsequent dynamics. Broadly, two scenarios are examined: bosons trapped in a symmetric potential and bosons trapped in asymmetric potentials. Due to angular momentum conservation, all observables exhibit monotonic behavior during the quench dynamics in the symmetric trap. However, when the rotational symmetry of the trap is broken and the trap is elongated along the x-direction, intriguing effects emerge following the rotation quench. These effects include the formation of vortices in the density distribution, oscillations in the angular momentum, its connection to the density dynamics, and, in some cases, the buildup or loss of coherence. The dynamics of the system in response to the rotation quenches after partially restoring the symmetry with respect to the elongated potential are also examined. We investigate the dynamics for both mean-field condensed and many-body fragmented systems and explore the regimes where the dynamics of the condensed systems significantly deviate from the fragmented systems. Overall, we provide insights into how the system of weakly repulsively interacting bosons trapped in anharmonic trapping potential responds to different rotation quenches. The multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB), a bosonic adaptation of the MCTDH family of methods cpl1990 ; jcp1992 ; mctdhb12 ; mctdhb16 ; mctdhb17 ; fischer_Metrology ; paolo_cavity ; paolo_ol ; rhombik_pra ; spin_axel ; elke , is widely recognized for its ability to deliver highly accurate results mctdhb_review . The many-body MCTDHB method can capture both the fragmentation of bosons and the correlations between them in a self-consistent manner MCTDHB1 , making it a valuable tool to explore intricate dynamical phenomena in the bosonic systems. In our numerical calculations, we employ the MCTDHB method to solve the many-body Schrödinger equation, enabling us to accurately capture the dynamics. The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the setup and necessary theoretical background. We also discuss the fundamental equations used to measure various quantities of interest. Section III presents our numerical results and interpretations for rotation quenches in three different trapping potentials. We investigate one case with a rotationally symmetric anharmonic potential and two cases introducing asymmetry: an elongated trapping potential and a four-fold symmetric trapping potential. Finally, Section IV summarizes our findings. The supplementary material includes the characterization of different rotation quench magnitudes, the numerical convergence analysis, and the discussion of the large rotation quench in the four-fold symmetric trap. It also provides full density dynamics movies calculated using both mean-field and many-body methods."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07219v1,Spin Squeezing with Magnetic Dipoles,"Entanglement can improve the measurement precision of quantum sensors beyond the shot noise limit. Neutral atoms, the basis of some of the most precise and accurate optical clocks and interferometers, do not naturally exhibit all-to-all interactions that are traditionally used to generate such entangled states. Instead, we take advantage of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction native to most neutral atoms to realize spin-squeezed states. We achieve 7.1 dB of metrologically useful squeezing using the finite-range spin exchange interactions in an erbium quantum gas microscope. We further propose and demonstrate that introducing atomic motion protects the spin sector coherence at low fillings, significantly improving the achievable spin squeezing in a 2D dipolar system. This work’s protocol can be implemented with most neutral atoms, opening the door to quantum-enhanced metrology in other itinerant dipolar systems, such as molecules or optical lattice clocks, and serves as a novel method for studying itinerant quantum magnetism with long-range interactions.","Entangled states allow quantum sensors to overcome the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), and have enhanced optical clocks [1, 2], atom interferometers [3], and gravitational wave detectors [4]. One prominent method to generate large-scale entanglement is spin squeezing, where uncertainty is redistributed between quadratures of the collective spin of an atomic, solid state, or molecular ensemble, improving metrological precision [5, 6, 7, 8]. In cold atom systems, spin squeezing generation has been extensively studied in the context of all-to-all interactions or measurements, such as in single mode cavities [9, 10, 11] and single mode Bose Einstein Condensates [12, 13]. Recently, it was predicted that scalable spin squeezing can be achieved with finite range interactions [14, 15, 16]. This is remarkable from a fundamental perspective, as the nonequilibrium squeezing dynamics may be linked to equilibrium symmetry-broken phases with long-range order [17]. Additionally, squeezing from finite range interactions is very attractive for metrological applications, as such interactions are inherently present in many cold atom, molecule, and solid-state systems [18, 19, 20, 21]. Recently, squeezing was realized through induced Rydberg interactions, of dipolar [22] or van der Waals [23, 24] nature, and in trapped-ion platforms with tunable power-law interactions [25]. In this work, we demonstrate spin squeezing through magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. Such interactions are available natively in most atomic species. The spin squeezing is carried out in an erbium quantum gas microscope, in which we prepare \approx 10^{3} itinerant XY interacting fermions in an optical lattice. First, we describe novel methods for generating and imaging magnetically insensitive dipolar interacting spin states in fermionic 167Er, inspired by Zou et al. [26]. While benchmarking the platform, we observe indications of the ferromagnetic ordering expected of the many-body ground state at high filling, predicted to lead to an extensive squeezed state [16, 14, 17, 27]. Next, we generate and directly measure metrologically useful squeezing up to \qty{7.1(1.0)}{dB} with no corrections for experimental imperfections. Finally, we introduce a new degree of freedom, itinerancy, which has recently been proposed to enhance squeezing in finite-range interacting systems [28, 29]. While finite lattice fillings impede the formation of an ordered ground state [30] and thus a squeezed state, tunneling was recently numerically shown to help overcome this effect [29]. However, it remains an open question whether this enhancement survives at finite temperature and finite tunneling, where the partial delocalization of defects may impede local ordering. Additionally, the study of the interplay between tunneling and power law interactions has been of substantial recent interest due to advances in ultracold molecule experiments [31, 32, 33]. Remarkably, we observe that in dilute systems where we observe no metrological gain when the spins are static, the introduction of itinerancy protects the long range order and leads to metrologically useful squeezing of \qty5.2(0.6)dB."
