https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10374v1,Remote-sensing based control of 3D magnetic fields using machine learning for in-operando applications,"In-operando techniques enable real-time measurement of intricate physical properties at the micro- and nano-scale under external stimuli, allowing the study of a wide range of materials and functionalities. In nanomagnetism, in-operando techniques greatly benefit from precise three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field control, enabling access to complex magnetic states forming in systems where multiple energies are set to compete with each other. However, achieving such precision is challenging and uncommon, as specific applications impose constraints on the type and geometry of magnetic field sources, limiting their capabilities.Here, we introduce an approach that leverages machine learning algorithms to achieve precise 3D magnetic field control using a hexapole electromagnet that is composed of three independent, non-collinear dipole electromagnets. In our experimental setup, magnetic field sensors are placed at a distance from the sample position due to inherent constraints, leading to indirect field measurements that differ from the magnetic field experienced by the sample. We find that the existing relationship between the remote and sample frames of reference is non-linear, thus requiring a more complex calibration method. To address this, we employ a multi-layer perceptron neural network that processes multiple inputs from a dynamic magnetic field sequence, effectively capturing the time-dependent non-linear field response. The network achieves high calibration accuracy and demonstrates exceptional generalization to unseen magnetic field sequences. This study highlights the significant potential of machine learning in achieving high-precision control and calibration, crucial for in-operando experiments where direct measurement at the point of interest is not possible.","In-operando measurement techniques have become extremely valuable for exploring how nanomaterials and devices behave in real-world conditions, generally providing deeper insights compared to ex-situ methods [1]. These techniques are employed to probe in real time the response of different materials subject to external stimuli, e.g., thermal catalysis assesment [2], lithium-ion battery development [3], X-ray tomography [4] or growth dynamics investigation [5]. In the realm of magnetism, in-operando techniques probe the live magnetic response of a system to, for instance, magnetic fields or currents. In particular, precise three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field control is essential for exploring in-depth the behavior of increasingly complex nanomagnetic devices such as the magnetic racetrack memory [6], magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) [7], or magnetic sensors employed in the automotive industry for accurate position and velocity measurements [8]. However, achieving such precise control is challenging, as the type of probe required for each application restricts the area around the sample, and consequently the geometry of the magnetic field source. Common probe examples include scanning tips for in-operando microscopy, electrical contacts for transport measurements, open space for optical components and light propagation, multi-axis stages, and temperature control devices. While these probes are generally compatible with dipole and quadrupole electromagnets, which can generate well-controlled variable 1D or 2D fields, extending this control to 3D while maintaining compatibility remains difficult. Figure 1: (a) Top view of the hexapole design, consisting of three pairs of dipole electromagnets. (b) Zoom-in view of the sample position and FOR, represented by (x, y, z) coordinates. (c) Likewise for the remote FOR, composed of three independent 1D Hall-probes, denoted by (A, B, C). (d) Performance of the linear calibration using a sinusoidal signal of 30 mT amplitude along x, highlighting the presence of stray components in the y and z directions. The black-dashed line denotes the gorund truth sequence, whereas the squares denote the measured signals obtained through the linear calibration. An effective implementation that offers optical access and the ability to apply 3D magnetic fields is the hexapole electromagnet design described in [9], used for magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements. It features three pairs of dipole electromagnets arranged in a non-collinear fashion [9] which enable to capture multiple reflected wave-vectors, for instance, to perform dark-field magnetometry of magnetic nanostructures [10]. The magnetic field in this setup is measured in a ”remote” frame of reference (FOR), i.e., separate from the ”sample” FOR at the center of the magnet where the sample is placed during experiments. We find experimentally that the relationship between the fields measured in both FORs is non-linear, demanding a non-linear calibration for accurate control of the field in the sample FOR. To model this relationship, we use a feed-forward multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network. The network receives a total of 9 inputs: the desired 3D magnetic field vector in the sample FOR, the 3D vector derivative representing its temporal evolution, and the previously reached maximum field 3D vector. After passing through the network’s layers, it outputs the 3D vector field in the remote FOR. If the network performs correctly, reaching the field predicted in the remote FOR should yield the desired field in the local FOR. We train the network on a set of magnetic field sequences that diametrically cross our FORs center, achieving a training error of 0.08 mT per component on average. Finally, we assess the network’s performance for magnetic field sequences exclusively generated for testing, finding an overall strong performance with an average testing error of 0.22 mT per component. This paper thus presents a novel approach to perform in-operando experiments, leveraging the strengths of machine learning to overcome the difficulties arising from remote magnetic field sensing in 3D. Our results highlight the potential of neural networks to deliver the fine control over complex experimental setups, pushing forward science and technology."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10361v1,Indium tin oxide combined with anti-reflective coatings with high transmittance for wavelengths < 400 nm,"The transparent and conductive properties of indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films, make them an attractive coating for optically integrated ion traps. However, the relatively low transmittance for wavelengths < 400 nm, high scattering and high production temperature limits the usability in trapped-ion-based quantum technologies. Here we present ITO coatings and a combined ITO + anti-reflective (AR) coating system optimized for an ion trap applied using ion beam sputtering (IBS). The coatings feature a high transmittance for wavelengths < 400 nm and additional wavelengths up to 1000 nm, low scattering and low production temperature < 150 \degreeC. The transmission, reflection and absorption spectra are simulated and the resistance, transmittance and scattering at 370 nm are measured for different ITO coating thicknesses and the ITO + AR coating system. For the ITO + AR coating system a resistance of 115 \pm 5 \Omega/\Box, transmittance of 80\% and scattering of 0.012 \pm 0.002\% at 370 nm is achieved.","Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is a transparent, conducting material that can be applied as a thin film coating. It is produced by doping indium oxide, a ceramic material that is transparent in the visible spectrum with the metal tin, creating a conductive coating with a high transmittance in the visible spectrum. The combination of electrical and optical properties of the coating makes it an attractive intermediator between electrical and optical interfaces [1]. As a result, ITO coatings are used in a wide variety of devices for example solar cells and LCDs [2, 3, 4]. With the rise of Quantum Technologies (QTs), the interest in ITO has increased since QTs often rely on both electrical and optical properties of materials [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. A promising platform in QTs is ion traps, where the coatings have been used for grounding of optics [7, 8] and as a transparent electrode material [9, 10]. However, ITO typically has low transmittance < 60\% for wavelengths < 400 nm [11, 12, 13, 14], high surface roughness > 1 nm [15, 16, 17, 18] and high production temperatures [19, 20, 21, 22, 23] > 150 \degreeC which limits the applications of ITO in ion trap experiments. In ion traps, the ion species determines the wavelengths necessary to control the system and wavelengths < 400 nm are common. Therefore, ITO coatings with high transmittance for these wavelengths are needed. High surface roughness can lead to increased scattering that could impair the state readout of the ions [24]. Ion trap experiments rely on the detection of the fluorescence light of single ions and scattered light increases the detection noise. Furthermore, ultraviolet (UV) light can charge up materials leading to a displacement of the ions [25]. A further issue when using ITO for ion traps is the high process or annealing temperatures. As an example, magnetron sputtering often requires a substrate temperature of about 200-300 \degreeC during the coating process or an annealing temperature of 350 \degreeC after the coating process [21, 17, 13], which can degrade or damage other materials. This creates a demand for ITO coatings with high transmittance and low scattering especially for wavelengths < 400 nm and low production temperatures. Here we present an ITO coating with high transmittance for wavelengths < 400 nm and additionally high transmittance at other technically required wavelengths up to 1000 nm. The coating is applied using IBS, a technique which uses temperatures that can stay below 100 \degreeC during the production process. IBS is known to create coating layers with lower optical scattering for oxide materials like Ta2O5 and SiO2 compared to for example e-beam deposition [26, 27]. Here we investigate, if using IBS for the production of ITO layers also achieves low optical scattering. The transmittance of the ITO layers is increased by an antireflection (AR) coating at application requested wavelengths. Here we report the design of the ITO+AR coating and the measurement of the transmittance and optical scattering of the coatings at 370 nm. The achieved properties make these ITO layers particularly suitable for the use in ion traps with ytterbium (Yb+), calcium (Ca+) or strontium (Sr+) ions. In this work, we characterize the ITO coatings for the transition wavelengths of Yb+ ions. In particular the coatings are used within the BMBF-project IDEAL [28]. The IDEAL project develops an ion trap with integrated gradient index (GRIN) lenses for addressing Yb+ ions. The integrated GRIN-lenses are used to focus laser light onto the ions in the trap and to collect the light from the fluorescing ions. In this project, ITO coatings are used for the grounding of GRIN-lenses integrated in the ion trap."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10208v1,Quantum sensing with duplex qubits of silicon vacancy centers in SiC at room temperature,"The silicon vacancy center in Silicon Carbide (SiC) provides an optically addressable qubit at room temperature in its spin-\frac{3}{2} electronic state. However, optical spin initialization and readout are less efficient compared to those of spin-1 systems, such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, under non-resonant optical excitation. Spin-dependent fluorescence exhibits contrast only between |m=\pm 3/2\rangle and |m=\pm 1/2\rangle states, and optical pumping does not create a population difference between |+1/2\rangle and |-1/2\rangle states. Thus, operating one qubit (e.g., \left\{|+3/2\rangle,|+1/2\rangle\right\} states) leaves the population in the remaining state (|-1/2\rangle) unaffected, contributing to background in optical readout. To mitigate this problem, we propose a sensing scheme based on duplex qubit operation in the quartet, using microwave pulses with two resonant frequencies to simultaneously operate \left\{|+3/2\rangle,|+1/2\rangle\right\} and \left\{|-1/2\rangle,|-3/2\rangle\right\}. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach doubles signal contrast in optical readout and improves sensitivity in AC magnetometry compared to simplex operation.","Spin qubits in color centers exhibit considerable quantum-sensing capabilities because of their unique combination of high spatial resolution, sensitivity, and operability under ambient conditions[balasubramanianNanoscaleImagingMagnetometry2008, mazeNanoscaleMagneticSensing2008, rondinMagnetometryNitrogenvacancyDefects2014, degenQuantumSensing2017, barrySensitivityOptimizationNVdiamond2020]. The signal contrast of spin-dependent fluorescence is a critical parameter for optimizing sensitivity. Sensitivity scales linearly with contrast, whereas other parameters, such as spin coherence time or fluorescence intensity, show square-root scaling[phamEnhancedMetrologyUsing2012, rondinMagnetometryNitrogenvacancyDefects2014, barrySensitivityOptimizationNVdiamond2020]. Although various applications have been demonstrated using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond[wrachtrupProcessingQuantumInformation2006, balasubramanianNanoscaleImagingMagnetometry2008, mazeNanoscaleMagneticSensing2008, rondinMagnetometryNitrogenvacancyDefects2014], color centers in Silicon Carbide (SiC) are attractive because of mature material and device technologies. High-quality SiC wafers and power electronic devices are commercially available and are used in industrial and consumer products. Several color centers in SiC are room-temperature spin qubits, i.e., optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is observable at room temperature and coherent manipulation of the spin state is possible [koehlRoomTemperatureCoherent2011, widmannCoherentControlSingle2015, wangCoherentControlNitrogenVacancy2020, sonDevelopingSiliconCarbide2020, castellettoQuantumSystemsSilicon2023]. Among them, the silicon vacancy (\mathrm{V_{Si}}) center[widmannCoherentControlSingle2015, carterSpinCoherenceEcho2015, tarasenkoSpinOpticalProperties2018] is one of the most established options because its structure and physics are understood, and it can be created reproducibly in a controlled manner. In 4H-SiC, the negatively charged \mathrm{V_{Si}} at the cubic (k) site, the V2 center, functions as a room-temperature qubit[ivadyIdentificationSivacancyRelated2017]. This specific color center is denoted as \mathrm{V_{Si}} in this paper. Notably, the spin-optical dynamics of \mathrm{V_{Si}} have been studied comprehensively[liuSiliconVacancycenters2024]. Moreover, in terms of materials engineering, \mathrm{V_{Si}} can be reproducibly created in SiC by irradiations with electrons, neutrons, or ions[krausThreeDimensionalProtonBeam2017, ohshimaCreationSiliconVacancy2018, kasperInfluenceIrradiationDefect2020]. Furthermore, the affinity for electron device technology has already been demonstrated through electrical detection of spin states[niethammerCoherentElectricalReadout2019] and device thermometry[hoangThermometricQuantumSensor2021]. However, the \mathrm{V_{Si}} qubit has a significant drawback due to its low ODMR contrast at room temperature. The contrast of a few percent is an order of magnitude lower than that of NV centers in diamond[rondinMagnetometryNitrogenvacancyDefects2014, barrySensitivityOptimizationNVdiamond2020] or divacancy-related centers in SiC[liRoomtemperatureCoherentManipulation2022], which typically exhibit contrasts of 20-30\%. Although the spin-\frac{3}{2} nature of \mathrm{V_{Si}} enables unique sensing capabilities such as vector magnetometry[leeVectorMagnetometryBased2015, niethammerVectorMagnetometryUsing2016] and all-optical metrology using level anti-crossing[siminAllOpticalDcNanotesla2016, anisimovOpticalThermometryBased2016, soykalQuantumMetrologySingle2017], it also imposes a problem in sensing techniques based on pulse ODMR. Spin state initialization and readout are not as convenient as those of its spin-1 counterpart under non-resonant optical excitation. That is, the optical spin polarization and ODMR contrast are only available between |m=\pm 3/2\rangle and |m=\pm 1/2\rangle states in the quartet (Fig. 1 (a)). After optical excitation from the ground state (GS) to the excited state (ES), inter-system crossing and non-radiative decay through metastable (MS) doublet states occur at certain rates[widmannCoherentControlSingle2015, dongSpinPolarizationIntersystem2019, liuSiliconVacancycenters2024]. Optical spin polarization and readout is possible because the rate of this decay path is higher for |\pm 1/2\rangle than |\pm 3/2\rangle. However, a method is yet to be devised for creating the rate difference between |+1/2\rangle and |-1/2\rangle (or |+3/2\rangle and |-3/2\rangle). Thus, the spin is polarized into equal superposition of |\pm 1/2\rangle by optical pumping, and we cannot optically detect population difference between |+1/2\rangle and |-1/2\rangle (or |+3/2\rangle and |-3/2\rangle). The limited number of sensing demonstrations using \mathrm{V_{Si}} based on pulse ODMR in the literature may be attributed to these issues[castellettoQuantumSystemsSilicon2023]. A method to overcome these problems is necessary to make \mathrm{V_{Si}} as practical as the NV center in diamond. To mitigate these problems, we propose a simple technique for simultaneously operating duplex qubits inside the quartet, that is, \left\{|+3/2\rangle,|+1/2\rangle\right\} and \left\{|-1/2\rangle,|-3/2\rangle\right\} as illustrated in Fig. 1 (b). If we drive only one qubit of \left\{|+3/2\rangle,|+1/2\rangle\right\} with a microwave (MW) at resonant frequency f_{+}, the remaining state |-1/2\rangle is unaffected and becomes background on the optical readout, degrading ODMR contrast. If both qubits are operated to emit the same signal using two resonant frequencies f_{+} and f_{-} (f_{-} is for \left\{|-1/2\rangle,|-3/2\rangle\right\}), the total ODMR signal is doubled. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate doubled contrast in pulse ODMR measurements and evaluate its sensitivity in AC magnetometry. A dense \mathrm{V_{Si}} ensemble in 4H-SiC was used in our experiment. However, the proposed method can be used for other spin-\frac{3}{2} color centers[krausMagneticFieldTemperature2014]. Figure 1: (a) Energy levels of \mathrm{V_{Si}} in 4H-SiC. (b) Schematic of duplex qubit operation. Initialization with non-resonant laser pulse populates |\pm 1/2\rangle. A qubit operation with MW (\pi pulse) inverts the population between |\pm 3/2\rangle and |\pm 1/2\rangle. Optical readout is enabled by stronger fluorescence when spin state is in |\pm 3/2\rangle."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10054v1,The Performance of Seeded Free-Electron Lasers Through Dispersion Strength Tuning,"Over the last decade, external seeded free electron lasers (FELs) have achieved significant advancements across various disciplines, progressively establishing themselves as indispensable tools in fields ranging from fundamental science to industrial applications. The performance of seeded FELs is critically dependent on the quality of the frequency up-conversion process. Optimized conditions for seeded FELs are typically considered as the maximization of the bunching factor. This paper discusses alternative perspectives on the optimization criteria for seeded FELs by analyzing the impact of dispersion strength on their overall performance. We investigate the relationship among the required dispersion strength for achieving the maximum bunching factor, maximum pulse energy, and optimal energy stability through theoretical analysis, simulation calculations, and experimental explorations. Additionally, the direct observation of pulse splitting emphasizes the consideration of trade-off between pulse energy and temporal coherence in seeded FELs. These results provide valuable insights and practical guidance for controlling the pulse characteristics of seeded FELs, contributing to the tuning and optimization of FEL facilities.","The revolutionary changes introduced by Free-electron Lasers (FELs) have significantly enhanced our ability to explore complex materials and biological systems with unprecedented precision and versatility, paving the way for groundbreaking discoveries across multiple fields, including medicine, materials science, and fundamental physics [1, 2, 3]. Currently, several FEL facilities have been constructed worldwide [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], serving as dispensable tools for a wide variety of scientific research. Of particular interest among these studies is the experiment implemented at seeded FELs, which has the major advantage of full coherence, precise control over arrival time, and a uniform longitudinal profile. The capability to produce stable, fully coherent radiation pulses has garnered sustained attention for external seeded FELs, which employ optical-scale electron beam manipulation with external seed lasers. The typical operation modes of external seeded FELs are high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) [11, 12, 13] and echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) [14, 15, 16]. In the HGHG scheme, an external seed laser interacts with the electron beam in the modulator, imprinting a sinusoidal energy modulation onto the longitudinal phase space. After passing through a dispersion chicane, this energy modulation is converted into a density modulation (micro-bunching), which contains frequency components at high harmonics of the seed laser. The desired coherent radiation is then generated and amplified in the subsequent undulator by this micro-bunched electron beam. In the EEHG scheme, two modulation-dispersion sections induce successive transformations of the electron beam longitudinal phase space, accumulating electrons into fine energy bands and leading to multiple density spikes within each seed wavelength. Other proposals, such as phase-merging enhanced harmonic generation (PEHG) [17, 18] and direct-amplification enabled harmonic generation (DEHG) [19], have not been experimentally validated due to the complexity of their required machine architectures. Building on the above introduction, it is evident that the frequency up-conversion process, which dominates the generation of bunching factor, plays a crucial role in determining the performance of seeded FELs. Once temporal and spatial synchronization between the seed laser and the electron beam is established [20, 21, 22], adjusting the magnet currents in the dispersion chicane is generally required to optimize the electron beam bunching factor. Indeed, one generally identifies the optimized conditions for seeded FEL emission as those that maximize the bunching factor [23, 24, 25]. However, to ensure the stable operation of FELs and the successful execution of user experiments, it is more critical to meet stringent specifications, particularly in terms of pulse energy and its stability as well as the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics of the FEL pulses [26, 27, 28]. Therefore, optimizing the parameters of the harmonic conversion stage to maximize pulse energy or achieve optimal energy stability, rather than merely maximizing the bunching factor as suggested in Ref. [29, 30], appears to be a more significant issue for consideration. Meanwhile, the evolution of other radiation pulse characteristics, such as power profile, spectrum and time-bandwidth product (TBP), under these newly optimized parameters requires further investigation. This paper explores an alternative optimization criterion for seeded FELs by analyzing the impact of dispersion strength on the performance of FEL pulses. The study investigates optimal conditions and FEL performance with respect to the maximum bunching factor, pulse energy, and energy stability through theoretical calculations, numerical simulations, and experimental observations. Furthermore, the direct experimental observations reveal the phenomena of pulse splitting and corresponding spectral splitting [23, 31, 32, 33], which are subsequently explained through theoretical analysis. The results provide new insights into the efficient control of FEL pulse characteristics and contribute to the tuning and optimization of seeded FELs."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09304v2,Design and Process Analysis of a Split-Gate Trench Power MOSFET with Bottom-Trench High-k Pillar Superjunction for Enhanced Performance,"In this paper, we propose a simulation-based novel Split-Gate Trench MOSFET structure with an optimized fabrication process to enhance power efficiency, switching speed, and thermal stability for high-performance semiconductor applications. Integrating High-k pillars Superjunction beneath the Split-Gate enhancing breakdown performance by reducing critical field intensity by up to 35%, the device achieves a 15% improvement in Figures of Merit (FOMs) for \rm{BV}^{2}/R_{\rm{on,sp}}. Dynamic testing reveals approximately a 25% reduction in both input and output capacitance, as well as gate-drain charge (Q_{\text{GD}}). This reduction, coupled with an approximately 40% improvement in Baliga’s High-Frequency Figure of Merit (BHFFOM) and over 20% increase in the New High-Frequency Figure of Merit (NHFFOM), underscores the design’s suitability for high-speed, high-efficiency power electronics. Simulations examining the effects of High-k pillar depth indicate that an optimal depth of 3.5 \mum achieves a balanced performance between BV and R_{\text{on,sp}}. The influence of High-k materials on BT-Hk-SJ MOSFET performance was investigated by comparing hafnium dioxide (HfO2), nitride, and oxynitride. Among these, HfO2 demonstrated optimal performance across static, dynamic, and diode characteristics due to its high dielectric constant, while material choice had minimal impact, with variations kept within 5%.Index Terms—Breakdown Voltage, Figure of Merit, High-k Materials, Power Density, Specific On-resistance, SGT-MOSFET, Superjunction, Switching Time, TCAD.","Trench MOSFETs, as advancements over VD-MOSFETs, effectively eliminate the JFET effect, reduce conduction losses, and enhance current-handling capabilities, making them widely used in modern power electronics [1][2]. Their compact design and well-established fabrication processes make them ideal for a variety of power applications. To meet the demands of high-frequency operations, continuous improvements in key Figures of Merit (FOM) are essential for Trench MOSFETs. One significant enhancement is the Split-Gate design, which notably reduces Miller plateau capacitance and switching charge, thereby improving switching performance—crucial for high-frequency applications[3]. By minimizing Miller capacitance, the Split-Gate Trench MOSFET (SGT-MOSFET) achieves faster switching speeds and greater overall efficiency, making it particularly suitable for high-performance power devices. Despite these advantages, there remains room for further optimization of the SGT structure. Current Trench MOSFETs face limitations in manufacturability, parasitic resistance, high gate-drain capacitance, and reliability. These issues complicate high-volume production, reduce efficiency in high-speed applications, highlighting the need for design improvements[4]. In industrial applications, the trade-off between breakdown voltage (BV) and specific on-resistance (R_{\text{on,sp}}), alongside the need to minimize conduction and switching losses, is crucial. Therefore, our objective is to enhance the performance of SGT-MOSFETs by addressing these specific challenges and improving their design for greater efficiency. Figure 1: Vertical electric field and three dimensional electric field distribution of BT-Hk-SJ MOSFET and conventional SGT-MOSFET Typically, the space beneath the trench in SGT structures is underutilized, as shown in Fig. 1(a), with minimal current flow and no contribution to BV. This represents an opportunity for structural optimization in the unused region below the trench. Inspired by the Superjunction (SJ) structure, which enhances breakdown voltage through precise charge compensation and reduces R_{\text{on,sp}} via alternating highly-doped n- and p-pillars[5, 6], we aim to incorporate these mechanisms into the SGT-MOSFET design. Integrating SJ in the under-trench region of SGT-MOSFETs can potentially improve breakdown voltage and increase electric field concentration in the drift region due to the depletion effect[7]. However, achieving a conventional SJ approach by fabricating an under-trench p-pillar presents significant challenges, particularly in maintaining precise charge balance and controlling dopant diffusion in a desire shape within the device[5, 8]. Moreover, the presence of the p-pillar can introduce parasitic BJT effects ,illustrated in Fig. 1(b), which may lead to latch-up and subsequent premature breakdown of the device. To overcome these challenges, we propose using Bottom-Trench High-k pillars Superjucntion (BT-Hk-SJ) as an alternative ,shown in Fig 1.(c). These structure facilitates effective charge balancing by forming a High-k SJ structure. This also allows higher doping concentrations in the n-pillar, eliminating the need for a p-pillar, and enhances BV without compromising R_{\rm{on,sp}}. This could result in simplified fabrication, superior dynamic and breakdown performance[8, 9, 10]. Additionally, the absence of parasitic BJTs helps to prevent latch-up and premature breakdown. In general, BT-Hk-SJ MOSFET is expected to achieve higher breakdown voltage and improved power density with reduced fabrication complexities. In this study, we first present the fabrication process for our novel BT-Hk-SJ MOSFET, emphasizing process viability for integrating and fabricating High-k pillars in deep trenches using TSUPREME4 and MEDICI simulation. Next, we provide a comprehensive analysis of on the device structure and device performance, through various deep trench depths for SJ High-k pillars with optimized processes, showcasing a comprehensive examination of both static and dynamic performance. We also investigate the High-k pillar deposition using different materials, demonstrating the adaptability of the proposed fabrication method and the tunability of performance through material selection."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09103v1,Magnetic response of topological insulator layer with metamaterial substrate induced by an electric point source,"Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with unique surface conductive properties that distinguish them from normal insulators and have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in electronics and spintronics. However, their weak magnetic field response in traditional setups has limited practical applications. Here, we show that integrating TIs with active metamaterial substrates can significantly enhance the induced magnetic field by more than 10^{4} times. Our results demonstrate that selecting specific permittivity and permeability values for the active metamaterial substrate optimizes the magnetic field at the interface between the TI layer and the metamaterial, extending into free space. This represents a substantial improvement over previous methods, where the magnetic field decayed rapidly. The findings reveal that the TI-metamaterial approach enhances the magnetic field response, unveiling new aspects of TI electromagnetic behavior and suggesting novel pathways for developing materials with tailored electromagnetic properties. The integration of metamaterials with TIs offers promising opportunities for advancements in materials science and various technological applications. Overall, our study provides a practical and effective approach to exploring the unique magnetic field responses of TIs, potentially benefiting other complex material systems.","The study of topological insulators (TIs), materials with a unique topological order, represents a significant step forward in developing new electronics. These materials are insulators internally but have conductive surfaces [1, 2, 3, 4]. The ability to have conductive edge states without an external magnetic field, as demonstrated in the quantum spin Hall effect in two-dimensional TIs, highlights their potential for transforming electronic devices. The special properties of TIs have created novel applications that are not possible with conventional insulators. Qi et al. [5] demonstrated that an electric charge near a TI surface induces a magnetic monopole due to the topological magneto-electric effect. Martín-Ruiz et al. [6, 7] used the Green’s function method to study boundary effects and special electromagnetic properties in TIs with Chern-Simons extended electrodynamics. The research by Lai et al. [8] explored the tunability of plasmons in TIs, showing their potential in plasmonics and spintronics. Wang et al. [9] discussed intrinsic magnetic TIs, such as MnBi2Te4, which combine magnetism with topological properties, leading to new quantum phenomena. Meanwhile, synthetic topological insulator structures [10, 11], such as nanowires and nanoribbons, are being explored in field-effect transistors (FETs), optoelectronic devices, memory storage devices and magnetoelectric devices [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. These structures exhibit enhanced surface conduction due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and can improve the performance of devices like photodetectors, spintronic, and quantum computing systems [17, 18, 19] by leveraging their unique surface properties and quantum effects. The novel magnetic field response of TIs is an area of growing interest due to its potential applications in advanced technology. The unique topological electromagnetic properties of TIs are key to understanding their novel magnetic field responses, although these effects are usually small. To enhance their electronic and magnetic properties, the development of layered structures incorporating TIs has been proposed [20]. In 2011, Burkov and Balents [21] proposed Weyl semimetal states in TI multilayers to achieve unusual electronic states. Further studies explored TI-ferromagnet multilayers [22] for efficient spin-orbit torque [23, 24], highlighting practical applications in spintronic devices [25]. In 2020, An et al. [26] demonstrated significant polarization rotation in multilayer TI structures, enhancing optical applications. Additionally, Ardakani and Zare (2021) [27] showed strong Faraday rotation using dielectric multilayers with a single TI layer with improved magnetic field interactions. Most of the work reviewed above focuses on the dynamic effects. In this work, we explore the novel magnetic field response of topological insulators (TIs) when exposed to a static electric point source. This static response, which couples electric and magnetic fields, distinguishes TIs from normal insulators more significantly than their dynamic behavior. However, as demonstrated by Qi et al. [5], the induced magnetic field by a TI is very weak, making it challenging to harness for practical applications. To address this challenge, we explore the magnetic field response of TIs in composite layered structures, particularly with metamaterials. Metamaterials have been a significant area of research since the late 20th century, with their unique properties offering potential for various technological applications. The concept was first theoretically proposed by Victor Veselago in 1968 [28], who suggested that materials could exhibit both negative permittivity and permeability, resulting in a negative refractive index. This idea, though intriguing, remained largely theoretical until the development of practical metamaterials in the early 2000s [29]. In 2000, Smith and Kroll [30] demonstrated negative refraction in left-handed materials, a groundbreaking experimental validation that paved the way for further research and development. Following this, Shelby et al. [31] provided experimental verification of a negative index of refraction using a metamaterial constructed from an array of copper split-ring resonators and wires. Liu et al. [32] introduced dynamic and tunable metamaterials that can be electrically controlled, using vanadium dioxide to achieve multifunctional control. This marked a significant advancement, enabling the modulation of metamaterial properties through external stimuli, thereby enhancing their practical applicability. Most recently, Castles et al. in 2020 [33] explored active metamaterials with static electric susceptibility less than one. This work demonstrated that active metamaterials could manipulate static electric susceptibility, a property that had been theoretically suggested but never experimentally confirmed until then. In this work, we focus on the magnetic response of TIs by integrating them with multi-layer composite structures with metamaterials. By employing the unique electromagnetic properties of TIs and metamaterials, we investigate the magnetic response induced by an electric charge. This study explores a novel approach to enhancing the magnetic field response of TIs, highlighting unique electromagnetic interactions within TIs and opening new avenues for their practical application in advanced technologies."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08990v1,Perfect absorption of molecular vibration enabled by critical coupling in molecular metamaterial,"The absorption and emission spectrum arising from the vibrational motion of a molecule is mostly in the infrared region. These fingerprint absorptions of polar bonds enable us to acquire bond-specific chemical information from specimens. However, the mode mismatch between the atomic-scale dimensions of the chemical bonds and the resonance wavelength limits the direct detection of tiny amounts of samples such as self-assembled monolayers or biological membranes. To overcome this limitation, surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA) has been proposed to enhance infrared absorption directly via local field enhancement. Here, we report on the perfect absorption of molecular vibration enabled by critical coupling in the metamaterials. Our molecular metamaterial design consists of a thin polymer layer sandwiched between a structured metal layer on top and a continuous metal layer at the bottom that supports the gap plasmon mode. The measured and simulated infrared spectra of the molecular metamaterial show broad and narrow absorption bands corresponding to the metamaterial and molecular vibration modes. We show that by tuning the structure’s molecular film thickness and periodicity, vibrational absorption can be enhanced to near unity. We also show that for a particular periodicity of the array, metamaterial resonance can be completely suppressed, and only molecular vibrational absorption is excited, giving rise to an extremely narrow absorption band.Keywords: Metamaterials, perfect absorption, molecular vibration, critical coupling, antenna.","Metamaterials, which are composite mediums of artificially designed subwavelength resonant particles (sometimes called meta-atoms or nanoantennas), have revolutionized the study of light-matter interaction by providing a fully controllable platform for light manipulation[1, 2, 3]. One of the most sought-after applications of metamaterials is in light confinement and light harvesting, where high absorption of electromagnetic waves is required, e.g., molecular sensing, photocurrent generation, and photodetection[4, 5]. In metamaterials, near-perfect absorption is achieved by tailoring the electric and magnetic resonances of its inclusions in such a way that the effective index of the homogenized medium matches with the free space. The most popular and fabrication-friendly design of highly absorbing metamaterials is a tri-layer metal-insulator-metal design with the top metal layer structured to act as an electric dipole resonator that determines the electric resonance of the medium[6]. The magnetic resonance of the medium is excited with the help of image charges of an electric dipole formed in the bottom metal layer, which is also known as the ground plane. The resultant circulating currents yield a magnetic dipole character response that is associated with a reduction in radiation damping. At a critical spacing thickness d, the radiation from these two induced dipoles is perfectly out of phase [7], leading to the cancelation of reflection. This condition is called the critical coupling condition and can be understood with the help of cavity losses [8, 9]. The reflection coefficient of the tri-layer metamaterial can be expressed using the coupled mode theory as \centering r(\omega)=\frac{({\gamma_{\mathrm{rad}}-\gamma_{\mathrm{abs}}})-i({% \omega-\omega_{0}})}{({\gamma_{\mathrm{rad}}+\gamma_{\mathrm{abs}}})+i({\omega% -\omega_{0}})}\@add@centering (1) where \omega_{0} is the resonant frequency of the eigenmode and \gamma_{\mathrm{rad}}, \gamma_{\mathrm{abs}} represent the radiative and the non-radiative losses, respectively. In tri-layer metamaterials, the thickness of the spacer layer provides an easy method to precisely tune the radiative loss of the system and \gamma_{\mathrm{rad}} can be engineered to match \gamma_{\mathrm{abs}} of the composite medium such that r(\omega) goes to zero. Moreover, the ground plane, which is an optically thick metal film, prevents any transmission of radiation, and thus most of the electromagnetic energy is confined in the insulating medium. The fundamental mode of the metamaterial is characterized by confined electromagnetic fields within the gap, with an enhanced electric field near the edges and a maximum magnetic field at the centre of the cavity. This deep sub-wavelength confinement of energy gives rise to drastically enhanced electric and magnetic fields that can be exploited to study the strong light-matter interactions across the spectrum. In the mid-infrared range, field enhancement can be exploited to directly enhance the infrared absorption of molecular vibrations that depend on the coupling between enhanced local electric fields and the fingerprint vibrations of the molecules of interest[10, 11]. This is done by tuning the metamaterial resonances to overlap with the absorption bands of targeted molecules. In general, metamaterial resonances are quite broad compared to molecular absorption bands because of strong radiative and nonradiative losses. Thus, interference of broad-band and narrow-band resonances results in an asymmetric line-shaped resonance, known as the Fano resonance. In most cases, the molecules to be detected are placed on top of the metamaterial surface, where they interact with the localized field near the edges of the electric dipole resonators. However, as discussed before, the maximum field enhancement is inside the spacer, so one needs to place the molecules in the gap, which is not possible because the gap is occupied by the insulating spacer layer. However, the hotspots in the gap can be accessed by modifying the geometry of the trilayer structure using the pedestal geometry[12, 13]. In this case, the molecules can interact with the electric field with maximum enhancement, and the sensitivity of detection can be increased further. It is important to note that an array of electric dipoles maximally absorbs 50 \% of the impinging light[14]. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, perfect absorption of molecular vibrations has not been achieved so far. In this work, we numerically demonstrate perfect absorption of the C=O stretch mode of PMMA molecules by adjusting the periodicity of the array and the thickness of the polymer film to obtain the critical coupling condition. Figure 1: (a) Schematic cross-sectional view of the metamaterial perfect absorber made of antenna array on top of a metallic ground plate separated by a PMMA layer. Parameters of molecular metamaterial include patch width w, PMMA thickness d, and periodicity of the square array p. (b) Scanning electron microscopic image of the fabricated sample. (c) Experimental and simulated reflection spectra of molecular metamaterial with periodicity p = 2.8 {\mu}m, PMMA film thickness d = 160 nm and patch width w = 1.2 {\mu}m. The proposed molecular metamaterial consists of a PMMA layer sandwiched between a metal ground plane and a patterned array of metallic nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). The size of the square metallic patches, which define the resonant wavelength, is precisely controlled by electron-beam lithography. Experimentally, a 1 mm2 square array of nanopatches was patterned onto a CaF2 substrate by electron beam lithography, metal evaporation, and lift-off. We start the fabrication by spin-coating a layer of approximately 400 nm ZEP 520A to serve as a positive-tone electron-beam resist layer. A thin conductive polymer layer (E-Spacer 300Z) is further spin-coated to mitigate charging effects during electron-beam lithography. After the exposer, the resist was developed using a ZED-N50 developer for 60 s and rinsed in ZMD-B for 30 s. A 5-nm thick Cr layer and an 80-nm Au layer were deposited on the developed sample, followed by the lift-off to form a nanoantenna array. Au is used for both metal layers and its thickness is approximately 100 nm. The remaining resist is finally removed by rinsing the sample in acetone overnight. The SEM micrograph of the nanopatch array is shown in Fig. 1(b). In Fig. 1 (c), we plot the experimental and simulated reflectance spectra of the proposed molecular metamaterial. Reflection spectra are measured for unpolarized light with 4 cm-1 resolution using a FTIR spectrometer (VERTEX 70v, Bruker). The hybrid system shows two dips at 1900 cm-1 and 1732 cm-1 that are due to the excitation of the gap plasmon mode (refer to metamaterial resonance from hereafter) and the vibrational mode associated with the C=O stretch of the PMMA molecule (refer to molecular resonance from hereafter). The gap plasmon mode is characterized by the excitation of electric and magnetic dipole modes in the metal-insulator-metal cavity as shown in Figs. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b) [15]. The induced electric dipole moment \mathrm{p_{x}} in the nanoantenna is expressed as \centering\mathrm{\textit{p}_{x}}=\epsilon_{0}\mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{ee}}% \mathrm{\textit{E}^{inc}_{x}}\@add@centering (2) where \mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{ee}} is the effective electric polarizability and \epsilon_{0} is the free space permittivity. Similarly, the magnetic dipolar moment can be written as \centering\mathrm{\textit{m}_{y}}=\mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{mm}}\mathrm{\textit{H}% ^{inc}_{y}}\@add@centering (3) where \mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{mm}} is the effective magnetic polarizability. The expression for the magnetic polarizability of the metamaterial was analytically derived by Bowen et. al [16, 17], and it is given by \centering\mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{mm}}=\frac{8dc^{2}cos^{2}({sin(\theta})kw_{% \mathrm{eff}}/2)}{\omega^{2}_{0}-\omega^{2}+i\omega^{2}/Q}\@add@centering (4) where w_{\mathrm{eff}} is the effective width of antenna, d is gap thickness and \theta is the angle of the incident magnetic field. 1/Q=1/Q^{\mathrm{rad}}+1/Q^{\mathrm{abs}} is the Q factor of the mode due to both radiative and Ohmic losses. The Q^{\mathrm{rad}} is defined by \centering Q^{\mathrm{rad}}=\frac{kp^{2}cos(\theta)}{2d(1-r_{TM})A_{\mathrm{t}% }(\theta)}\@add@centering (5) where A_{\mathrm{t}}(\theta) is cos^{2}[sin(\theta)kw_{\mathrm{eff}}/2] and r_{\mathrm{TM}} is the reflection coefficient for a transverse magnetic (TM) wave. It has been shown that maximum absorption occurs when \mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{mm}} = \mathrm{\alpha^{eff}_{ee}}. This condition is called the balanced Kerker condition for effective polarizabilities[14]. As we can see from Equation 5, the radiative loss of the composite medium depends strongly on the periodicity of the array and the spacer layer thickness. This suggests that both periodicity and spacer layer thickness can be adjusted to obtain the critical coupling condition to achieve perfect absorption of radiation. Figure 2: Simulated electric and magnetic field in the molecular metamaterial at 1900 cm-1. The blue arrows in (a) show the incident electric field, while the red arrows show the field within the spacer layer. The electric field within the gap region shows the formation of two out-of-phase induced dipoles. These two dipoles lead to a magnetic moment, indicated with the color plot in Fig. (b). To understand the nature of metamaterial and molecular absorption modes and their dependence on different geometrical parameters, we performed comprehensive and parameterized electromagnetic simulations (COMSOL Multiphysics)[18] based on the Finite-Element Method (FEM). Periodic boundary conditions in the in-plane dimensions and perfectly matched layers in the out-of-plane dimension were used throughout with excitation due to a normally incident plane wave. The metallic parts of our metamaterial resonator were modeled using a Drude model with a plasma frequency of \omega_{\mathrm{p}}=2\pi\times2175 THz and collision frequency of \gamma=2\pi\times6.5 THz. The PMMA permittivity describing the C=O stretch was modeled as a Lorentz oscillator \varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}=\varepsilon_{\mathrm{b}}+f\omega_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}/(% \omega_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}-i\gamma_{\mathrm{m}}\omega-\omega^{2}), where the relative permittivity \varepsilon_{\mathrm{b}} is 2.2, the oscillator strength f is 0.01, the resonance frequency \omega_{\mathrm{m}} is 1732 cm-1, and \gamma_{\mathrm{m}} is 20 cm-1 [19]. We numerically calculated the S-parameter for all structures with normal incidence to obtain the reflectivity spectra. Figure 3: (a) Simulated absorption spectra plotted as a function of wavelength of molecular metamaterial with PMMA film thickness of 160 nm and variable lattice constant. The arrays lattice constant varies from 2.8 to 1.6 {\mu}m (bottom to top). (b) Absorption spectra with a fixed period of p = 2.8 {\mu}m and variable PMMA film thickness. The patch width was kept constant at w = 1.14 {\mu}m for both the cases. The spectra are offset vertically for clarity."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08938v1,Mathematical theory on multi-layer high contrast acoustic subwavelength resonators,"Subwavelength resonance is a vital acoustic phenomenon in contrasting media. The narrow bandgap width of single-layer resonator has prompted the exploration of multi-layer metamaterials as an effective alternative, which consist of alternating nests of high-contrast materials, called “resonators”, and a background media. In this paper, we develop a general mathematical framework for studying acoustics within multi-layer high-contrast structures. Firstly, by using layer potential techniques, we establish the representation formula in terms of a matrix type operator with a block tridiagonal form for multi-layer structures within general geometry. Then we prove the existence of subwavelength resonances via Gohberg-Sigal theory, which generalizes the celebrated Minnaert resonances in single-layer structures. Intriguingly, we find that the primary contribution to mode splitting lies in the fact that as the number of nested resonators increases, the degree of the corresponding characteristic polynomial also increases, while the type of resonance (consists solely of monopolar resonances) remains unchanged. Furthermore, we derive original formulas for the subwavelength resonance frequencies of concentric dual-resonator. Numerical results associated with different nested resonators are presented to corroborate the theoretical findings.","In recent decades, plasmonic resonant structures have been extensively studied and utilized as building blocks to make novel optical and acoustic devices [24, 48, 23, 54, 53, 39, 13]. These plasmonic materials are typically composed of noble metals, which may exhibit negative properties under specific conditions. It has been mathematically demonstrated that the plasmonic resonance can be formulated as an eigenvalue problem of the Neumann-Poincaré operator [2, 31, 30, 16, 5, 15, 1, 22, 38]. However, metallic structures inherently suffer from high losses and dissipation due to heating, which severely limits the efficiency and functionality of plasmonic devices. This limitation motivates the exploration of alternatives to metallic subwavelength resonators. Recent developments in microscale acoustic physics have led to a new branch of phononic crystal focused on the manipulation of acoustically induced subwavelength resonances in high-contrast resonators. Resonant high-contrast microstructures form new building blocks, which can be used to realize negative materials through homogenization theory in specific configurations [14, 11]. In particular, when bubbles are embedded in liquids, even a small volume fraction of bubbles can significantly impact the velocity of waves in liquids [19]. This phenomenon is mainly due to the high density contrast between the bubbles and the background liquid, causing the bubbles to oscillate vigorously. At a specific low frequency called the Minnaert resonant frequency, the bubbles can act as acoustic resonators [46]. While bubbly media composed of air bubbles in water exhibit intriguing properties for the creation of subwavelength metamaterials [3, 10, 14], such structures tend to be highly unstable [36]. Various strategies have been proposed to stabilize these structures. One approach involves encapsulating the bubbles in a thin coating (e.g., albumin, polymer, or lipid) with the aim of mitigating the rapid dissolution and coalescence of the bubbles [26]. Another approach is to substitute the background medium, water, with a soft elastic material. It has been demonstrated that this technique yields metamaterials with properties analogous to those of air bubbles in water [37]. Recently, several mathematical theories have been developed to enhance the understanding of the Minnaert resonance of bubbles. Due to the high density contrast between air bubbles and the liquid or elastic medium, the authors in [6, 7, 40] have conducted rigorous and systematic mathematical studies of Minnaert resonance for single bubbles encapsulated in thin coatings, immersed in liquids, and in soft elastic materials, respectively. Furthermore, when hard inclusions, such as rubber-coated epoxy spheres [52] or steel-coated soft silicone rubber [34], are embedded in soft elastic materials, dipolar resonance is induced within the subwavelength regime. This phenomenon has been experimentally realized [44] and mathematically derived for the first time in [43, 41]. As mention above, one significant application of subwavelength resonance and contrasting material structures is the effective realization of various metamaterials with negative material properties. Based on this realization, a class of phononic crystals, made from periodic arrangements of separated subwavelength resonators[8, 10, 9], that exhibits bandgaps and has been employed in advanced techniques for manipulating wave propagation at subwavelength scales. In most studies on phononic crystals, the structures are typically composed of single-layer (homogeneous) resonators. Due to their narrow bandgap width and poor wave filtering performance, such configurations are not readily applicable in practical engineering contexts [49]. This limitation has prompted the design and investigation of metamaterials with wider bandgaps. In particular, multi-layer high-contrast metamaterials have emerged as a popular choice for subwavelength resonators, owing to their high tunability and high quality resonance. Experimental and numerical observations [35, 17, 33, 50] indicate that multi-layer concentric radial resonators, at the subwavelength regime, can open multiple local resonance bandgaps. Meanwhile, by appropriately combining multiple multi-layer concentric radial structures, it is possible to overlap sharp dips (strong field concentration) and create a larger acoustic stop band. However, despite considerable evidence in the engineering and physics literature, the mathematical understanding of the origin of subwavelength resonance in multi-layer contrasting media and the mechanism underlying mode splitting (the separation of subwavelength resonant frequencies) remains limited, with no quantitative results available even for concentric dual-resonator. This prompts us to demonstrate the opening of multiple bandgaps in multi-layer subwavelength resonators. We consider multi-layer metamaterials characterized by a nested structure similar to Russian folk art dolls called Matryoshka dolls and exploit their subwavelength resonance. The number of layers can be arbitrary and the material parameters in each layer may be different, though uniform. High density contrast is crucial for achieving resonance at subwavelength scales. The wave propagation in the multi-layer structure is modeled by a high-contrast Helmholtz problem. It is noteworthy that, owing to advancements in 3D printing techniques [45, 47], the compositional structure of high-contrast materials has become increasingly diverse (e.g., resin materials [25], polymer materials [50], etc.), extending beyond the previously mentioned Minnaert cavities and associated stabilization strategies. Such multi-layer high contrast materials arise naturally when designing subwavelength metamaterials, however, due to the complex structure of multi-layer acoustic metamaterial systems, fully determining and rigorously demonstrating the mechanisms behind their acoustic properties is a rather challenging task. To establish the primary conclusion of this paper, we first make use of the layer potential techniques to reduce the acoustic scattering problem into a system of integral matrix type operator \mathcal{A}(\omega,\delta) (see (3.4)–(3.6)) having the block tridiagonal form in the N-layer structure with C^{1,\eta}\,(0<\eta<1) smooth interface. Secondly, by using the asymptotic perturbation and Gohberg-Sigal theory[9], we demonstrate that \mathcal{A}(\omega(\delta),\delta) has 2N_{\mathrm{r}} characteristic values that are symmetric about the imaginary axis, with \omega(\delta) depending continuously on \delta and \omega(\delta)\to 0 as the material contrast \delta\to 0. In fact, N_{\mathrm{r}}:=\left\lfloor(N+1)/2\right\rfloor here represents the number of resonator elements in the N-layer structure. In other words, the number of bandgap increases with the number of resonator-nested. It is worth noting that the primary reason for mode splitting lies in the fact that as the number of nested resonators increases, the degree of the corresponding characteristic polynomial also increases, while the type of resonance (which consists solely of monopolar resonances) remains unchanged. It is known that the resonant frequency is associated with the shape of the resonators [6]. However, the rotational symmetry breaking of the resonators does not lead to mode splitting. For this, based on Fourier series, we present an exact matrix representation of \mathcal{A}(\omega,\delta) in multi-layer concentric balls. By highly intricate and delicate analysis, we derive exact and original formulas for the resonant frequency of concentric balls with layers 2\leq N\leq 4. For structures with a large number of layers, we shall provide numerical computations of resonant modes. In practical applications, the multi-layer high contrast structure can serve as a fundamental building block for various material devices. Our analysis will provide a powerful and general design principle that can be applied to select appropriate material parameters, both qualitatively and quantitatively, guiding the design of resonator-nested and predicting their resonant properties. By adjusting the geometries and parameters of the materials, one can fine-tune the resonant frequencies to target specific acoustic applications. We shall investigate along this direction in our forthcoming work. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first present some preliminary knowledge on boundary layer potentials and then establish the representation formula of the solution of the acoustic scattering problem with multi-layer structures. Section 3 is devoted to the study of subwavelength resonance for multi-layer high contrast metamaterials by using the Gohberg-Sigal theory. In Section 4, the exact formulas of the resonant frequencies for single-resonator, dual-resonator models is given. In section 5, numerical computations are presented in finding all the resonance modes for fixed structures with a large number of layers. Moreover, the strong field concentration is observed. Some concluding remarks are made in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08125v1,Optimizing Phononic Crystal Waveguides for Acoustically Induced Spin Transport,"Through the use of strain and induced piezoelectric fields, surface acoustic waves have been shown to control quantum information processes, such as single photon emission and the coherent transport of electron spins. Regarding the latter, systems using plane surface waves have provided suitable demonstration systems, but to build complexity, more control over the acoustic wave may be required. One method for acoustic control is the use of phononic crystals consisting of periodic arrays of nanofabricated holes on the surface of a device. These inclusions form a metamaterial-like layer with properties different from the normal material to dictate the physics of wave motion. Exploiting these surface properties can lead to acoustic waveguides, which can be designed to control the path of the surface acoustic waves. The design parameters of a new type of phononic crystal waveguide is explored that uses 2-fold elliptical cylinder inclusions to create a slow region that also limits coupling and radiative loss to bulk acoustic modes. Such a waveguide would be the foundational piece in an acoustic circuit that could then mediate complex spin transport geometries.","The desire for scalability in quantum computation is illustrated by the fact that an estimated 2 million qubits are needed for computations in quantum chemistry [1]. To address this issue, groups have been developing ways to move quantum information around devices using ions[2], electrons[3], and spins[4]. The latter two studies use acoustic excitations in the form of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to confine and transport quantum states. SAWs are effective as their strain and piezoelectric fields can couple to semiconductor nanostructures and the charges and spins they contain. The high frequencies of the SAWs enables them to transport on the order of 1 billion individual electrons per second, therefore providing an interesting paradigm to study for quantum computation [5]. To this end, this ability of SAWs to couple to quantum states in semiconductors has lead to a number of interesting applications such as: the creation of single electron transistors[6]; control of single photons from quantum dots[7, 8]; opening additional band gaps in photonic structures[9] and inducing the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate[10]. In those studies using acoustically mediated charge transport, the electrons and holes are spatially separated by the piezoelectric electric field induced by the SAW and do not interact, allowing the ambipolar transport to extend up to millimeters due to the significant increase in their recombination lifetimes[11]. When a lateral confinement is applied (transverse to the direction of motion), the charges are then transported in fully 3-D confinement potentials, referred to as dynamic quantum dots (DQDs), that form a quantum conveyor belt and can be used to transport single electrons[6, 12, 13] or to coherently transport electron spins [4, 14]. However, previous work involving electron spins involved only simple, linear transport. To create non-trivial paths for the flying (as opposed to stationary) electron spins, a system for acoustic control could be based on controlling SAWs within phononic crystal (PnC) waveguide structures [15]. By creating acoustic circuits compatible with semiconductor nanostructures, complex, acoustically mediated circuits could be realized to control the flow of spin information. The proper design of a PnC structures is key as they cannot adversely affect the semiconductor nanostructure in an effort to control the SAW. For example, the transport of electron spins uses a GaAs quantum well as the transport layer, and a phononic crystal inclusion would require the use of shallow inclusions [16] that would not puncture the quantum well or resonant pillars on the surface [17]. Naturally, the confined acoustic mode must also generate a piezoelectric field in the region below the surface where the quantum well exists. Using shallow inclusions, a waveguide that simply consisted of the PnC metamaterial could confine a SAW and generate the requisite piezoelectric fields below the surface [18]. While being able to waveguide, that study still suffered from energy loss due to acoustic coupling to bulk modes. Recently, a new 2-fold symmetric inclusion geometry was proposed that lowers the mode frequencies below the sound line thus dramatically reducing energy loss while demonstrating an improved waveguide confinement [19]. Using this new inclusion design, the design and optimization of a waveguide will be examined with specific consideration made for the applications of acoustic circuits mediating spin transport in GaAs. In the original work using shallow inclusions as the phononic crystal waveguide in GaAs [18], it was found that a waveguide of four unit cells wide provide the best balance of lateral confinement while maintaining a core strain energy ratio above 0.6 and have the highest reciprocal attenuation. The original report of using elliptical cylinder inclusions replicated the four inclusion waveguide width for comparison [19], but a more detailed investigation was not completed. Building on that work, here we will explore the impact of waveguide parameters such as waveguide width, inclusion aspect ratio, and inclusion depth on key metrics characterizing surface acoustic wave (SAW) confinement, dispersion, and bandwidth within the waveguide, aiming to optimize waveguide performance for enhanced acoustic spin transport in GaAs."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08670v1,RSFQ All-Digital Programmable Multi-Tone Generator For Quantum Applications,"One of the most important and topical challenges of quantum circuits is their scalability. RSFQ technology is at the forefront of replacing current standard CMOS-based control architectures for a number of applications, including quantum computing and quantum sensor arrays. By condensing the control and readout to SFQ-based on-chip devices that are directly connected to the quantum systems, it is possible to minimise the total system overhead, improving scalability and integration. In this work, we present a novel RSFQ device that generates multi tone digital signals, based on complex pulse train sequences using a Circular Shift Register (CSR) and a comb filter stage. We show that the frequency spectrum of the pulse trains is dependent on a preloaded pattern on the CSR, as well as on the delay line of the comb filter stage. By carefully selecting both the pattern and delay, the desired tones can be isolated and amplified as required. Finally, we propose some architectures where this device can be implemented to control and readout arrays of quantum devices, such as qubits and single photon detectors.","Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) [1, 2] electronics and their energy efficient version (ERSFQ) [3, 4] are well developed technologies that are now being considered and implemented for the control and readout of quantum circuits such as qubits [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], and quantum sensors [10, 11, 12]. As a result, many of the bulky standard room temperature electronics are being replaced by RSFQ circuits that can perform the same quantum circuit manipulation, but with potentially better scalability from decreased system overheads, better integration for cryogenic temperatures due to the much lower power dissipation, and faster operation (up to hundreds of GHz [13]). Naturally, this leads to proposed architectures where a full manipulation of qubits and single photon detectors, such as Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors (SNSPDs), is done in a fully digital and, therefore, more scalable way [14]. One circuit of interest in this area is an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), which at its core consists of a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC), that can generate programmable arbitrary analogue signals. This is the quintessential device used in a myriad of control protocols, including standard microwave based single qubit gates [15] or time-domain measurements of RF-SNSPDs [16]. In particular, AWGs are able, and widely used, to generate multi-tone signals for use in frequency division multiplexing (FDM) control architectures [17, 18]. The RSFQ implementation of such a device usually consists of a digital pulse-based stage which encodes the analogue signal into a binary code that is then followed by a DAC stage, using voltage multipliers or SQUID stacks [19, 20, 21, 22]. The only demonstration of multi-tone signal generation using SFQ-based circuits has been recently achieved for metrology applications using the same architecture type mentioned before, with a DAC at the output [21]. Here we present an alternative way of generating programmable multi-tone signals with all-digital pulse based signals, which we name Digital Multi-Tone Generator (DMTG). Like the previously mentioned implementations of AWG-type RSFQ circuits, Circular Shift Registers (CSR) [23, 24, 25, 26] are at the core of this work too, since they can be used as pulse train generators and the type of pulse train is dependent on the initial pre-loaded data on the memory cells of the CSR. This property allows the creation of evenly and unevenly spaced patterns that can be controlled to generate the desired tones on the output signal. This is also an important property when trying to encode an analogue signal into a digital pulse train. The second important component is a Comb Filtering stage [27] like those seen in Cascaded-Integrator-Comb filters, both in classical and RSFQ applications, used for decimation and interpolation filter devices [28, 29]. This component is also seen in some pulse multiplier circuits [19]. In this work, comb filters are implemented to redistribute the power of the CSR output to frequencies that depend on the characteristics of the delay path. This improves the power of the desired tones and attenuates spurious tones if correctly tuned. A feedforward implementation is chosen to comply with RSFQ device restrictions, such as summation and multiplication of single SFQ pulses. Pattern ‘1111 1111’ Pattern ‘1001 1001’ Pattern ‘1001 1001’ & Comb Filter \tau(a)(b)(c) Figure 1: Example of pulse trains generated in an 8-bit CSR, with programmability focused on tones below f_{\text{clk}} = 10GHz: (a) Evenly spaced pulse train generates an evenly spaced frequency spectrum (frequency division patterns). (b) Uneven spaced pulse train generates a richer spectrum with more tones. Pattern ‘1001 1001’ generates tones at 2.5 and 7.5 GHz. All spectra from the CSR are periodic with period equal to f_{\text{clk}}. (c) Single stage comb filter applied on same pattern as (b), with delay \tau = 0.33 ns, tunes the spectrum in a way to amplify the 2.5 GHz tone and cut off the 7.5 GHz tone. FT is normalised for the maximum power in each system, which corresponds to the pattern ‘1111 1111’. FT scale different between plots for visualisation purposes. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section II explains the mathematics of pulse trains and their frequency spectra, and how the use of CSR can modify them in a programmable way. Here an analysis of comb filters is also shown, as a way to improve the final spectrum of the signal. Section III then presents the proposed implementation using RSFQ basic components, with special emphasis on the CSR, the clocking network, and the comb filter stage. Section IV shows the simulated results of a 8-bit DMTG using a superconductor circuit simulator, as well as a study of how SFQ pulse characteristics influence the final spectrum. In Section V, some applications envisioned for this device are presented. Finally conclusions are given in Section VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07629v1,Periodic phase diagrams in micromagnetics with an eigenvalue solver,"This work introduces an approach to compute periodic phase diagram of micromagnetic systems by solving a periodic linearized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation using an eigenvalue solver with the Finite Element Method formalism. The linear operator in the eigenvalue problem is defined as a function of the periodic phase shift wave vector. The dispersion diagrams are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for complex eigen frequencies and corresponding eigen states for a range of prescribed wave vectors. The presented approach incorporates a calculation of the periodic effective field, including the exchange and magnetostatic field components. The approach is general in that it allows handling 3D problems with any 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities. The ability to calculated periodic diagrams provides insights into the spin wave propagation and localized resonances in complex micromagnetic structures.","The study of micromagnetic systems is important for our understanding of the fundamental behaviors of magnetic materials and their applications. At the core of these studies lies the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, a fundamental tool for describing the dynamic evolution of magnetization in response to internal and external excitations. However, analyzing the dynamics of periodic micromagnetic structures remains a significant computational challenge due to the complexity of boundary conditions and the interactions between periodic elements. Periodic systems, such as magnetically large object and patterned nanostructures, exhibit unique properties arising from their symmetry and periodic boundary conditions. The linearized form of the LLG equation [1] provides a pathway to analyze the stability, resonance phenomena, and spin wave propagation in such systems, but it necessitates an accurate and efficient calculation of the periodic fields. Conventional periodic micromagnetic methods often encounter difficulties in handling the periodicity or with phase shift[2, 3, 4, 5], leading to challenges in the ability to calculate phase diagrams and eigenvalue spectra in general 3D structures with 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities[6, 7, 8]. In this paper, we propose an approach to solve eigenvalue problems using the linearized LLG equation with periodic boundary conditions in the Finite Element Method (FEM) framework. We consider general 3D periodic problems possibly with 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities (Fig. 1). A key aspect of our methodology is the precise computation of the periodic fields, which ensures compatibility with the micromagnetic framework while preserving the periodicity of the system. By employing this approach, we aim to construct periodic phase diagrams that capture the stability and dynamic (spin wave propagation) properties of micromagnetic systems under various conditions. We validate our method through applications to well-studied periodic micromagnetic systems, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in calculating the periodic problem with phase shift. We then demonstrate the power of the approach by calculating dispersion diagrams of 1D and 2D periodic problems. This work contributes a new computational framework for analyzing periodic micromagnetic structures, offering potential insights for researchers in dynamic magnetism, spintronics, and materials science.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07571v1,A Composite Hydrogel of Porous Gold Nanorods and Gelatin: Nanoscale Structure and Rheo-Mechanical Properties,"Incorporating nanomaterials into hydrogels allows for the creation of versatile materials with properties that can be precisely tailored by manipulating their nanoscale structures, leading to a wide range of bulk properties. Investigating the structural and property characteristics of composite hydrogels is crucial in tailoring their performance for specific applications. This study focuses on investigating the correlation between the structural arrangement and properties of a composite hydrogel of thermoresponsive polymer, gelatin, and light-responsive antimicrobial porous gold nanorods,PAuNR. The rheo-mechanical properties of the composite hydrogels are correlated with their nanoscale structural characteristics, investigated using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Analysis of SANS data reveals a decrease in the fractal dimension of PAuNRs incorporated hydrogel matrix, as compared to pure gelatin. Incorporating PAuNRs results in formation of softer composite hydrogel as evident from decrease in viscoelastic moduli, critical yield strain, denaturation temperature and swelling ratio. Our results demonstrates that the structural modulation at the nanoscale can be precisely controlled through adjusting PAuNRs concentration and temperature providing an fabrication mechanism for hydrogels with desired elastic properties. The reduced elasticity of the composite hydrogel and light sensitive/antimicrobial property of the PAuNRs makes this system suitable for specific biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, device fabrication and stimuli based controlled drug delivery devices respectively.","I INTRODUCTION Hydrogels, network of hydrophillic polymer chains cross-linked together, with their exceptional absorbency and flexibility, are particularly valuable in biomedical applications, printing, and wearable devices García-Astrain et al. (2015); Gubaidullin et al. (2022); Barrett-Catton, Ross, and Asuri (2021). Gelatin, a natural polymer obtained from denatured collagen Wang et al. (2021), has become a prominent choice in biomedical applications due to its excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability properties Liu et al. (2020); Bode et al. (2013a); Berts et al. (2013); Panda et al. (2024). Gelatin-based hydrogel exhibits mechanical and biochemical properties similar to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the body, making it the most popular choice for application in tissue engineering, cell differentiation, bio-printing, and so on Ma et al. (2021); Wang et al. (2022). The interesting thermo-responsive properties of gelatin arise due to a combination of interatomic interactions, including hydrogen bonding (H-bonding), hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces Van Den Bulcke et al. (2000); Wisotzki et al. (2017). This unique property makes them a versatile material in various biomedical and environmental applications. The physical properties of the gelatin hydrogel can be modified by incorporation of polymers, cross-linkers, nanoparticles, etc. By modifying hydrogels through cross-linking processes or by incorporating specific entities such as ions or nanoparticles into the hydrogel matrix, the structure and properties of the hydrogel can be precisely tailored to meet the requirements of specific applications Ma et al. (2021); Wang et al. (2022). Incorporating different ions and nanoparticles into gelatin hydrogels is a widely used strategy to tailor their properties and have shown significant development Qiao et al. (2021); Wu et al. (2018). The trend in hydrogel research is moving away from ion-based materials and towards nanoparticle-based ones. This shift is motivated by the enhanced capabilities that nanoparticles provide, including better control of drug release, stronger mechanical properties, and the ability to perform multiple functions. Nanocomposites allow for more precise, responsive, and versatile applications, making them better suited for advanced biomedical and technological uses. It has been shown that the young modulus of gelatin hydrogel is enhanced by 2.9 times after photocrosslinking of CTAB coated AuNRs (1mg/ml) with gelatin methacrylate. Electrostatic interaction between CTAB-AuNR and gelatin methacrylate responsible not only for higher gel strength but also smaller pore size of the composite hydrogelNavaei et al. (2016). Synergistic chemical and physical interactions between porous silica nanoparticles and a matrix of gelatin/aldehyde-modified xanthan lead to a tougher hydrogel structure Aghajanzadeh et al. (2024). Gelatin hydrogel matrix embedded with 30 wt \% of spindle-like hydroxyapatite (HA) exhibits a compressive modulus 30.6 lower than pure gelatin hydrogel. These electrostatic interactions between calcium and carboxylate groups limit the sites for cross-linking between polymer chains within the hydrogel network resulting in reduction of gel strength Raucci et al. (2018). There are several parameters that effect the macroscopic response of the nanoparticle composite gels. To understand how these gels work at a larger scale, we need to know what happens at a smaller, atomic level. Specifically, understanding the internal structure of particle-embedded gelatin hydrogels using techniques sensitive to nanoscale structure as such small angle neutron scattering which can reveal the internal structure of these gels at a very small scale and correlating the structure to bulk properties is desirable. Porous nanoparticle-based hydrogel composites have gained significant attention due to their ability to offer controlled and stimuli-responsive applications Rocha-García et al. (2016). These materials combine the unique properties of hydrogels (absorbency, biocompatibility) with the enhanced functionalities of nanoparticles such as antibacterial properties, electrical conductivity, or magnetic responsiveness Li et al. (2022); Myrovali (2022). In this study, we incorporate the freshly synthesized PAuNRs samples into gelation hydrogel matrix for formation of gelation-PAuNRs hydrogel composite. Gelatin composite hydrogel is synthesized by incorporation of Cysteamine-coated porous gold nanorods (PAuNRs) along with a fixed amount of tannic acid as cross-linkers. Tannic acid as a physical cross-linker is employed to enhance the mechanical, thermal, and antimicrobial properties of gelatin hydrogel Leite et al. (2021); Panda et al. (2024). Cysteamine-coated PAuNRs were chosen due to their inherent properties, including porosity, near-infrared (NIR) absorption, conductivity, and antibacterial activity. These properties endow the gelatin composite hydrogel with functionalities suitable for diverse applications, including drug delivery, photoacoustic imaging, computed tomography imaging, and even photothermal therapy Cai et al. (2018). This research investigated how the incorporation of PAuNRs with different concentrations and variations in temperature influence the architecture of gelatin composite hydrogels. We then explored the connection between these structural changes with its rheo-mechanical and thermal properties of the hydrogels. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) was performed on both pure gelatin and composite hydrogels at different temperatures to understand the resulting structural modulations. Additionally, rheo-mechanical testing, temperature sweep tests, and DSC measurements were employed to analyze the rheo-mechanical and thermal properties of the hydrogels. Understanding the effect of PAuNRs concentration and temperature on structural modulation of hydrogels, and how these structural changes impact macroscopic properties, is crucial for designing hydrogels with suitable characteristics for specific applications."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05940v1,A High-Power Microwave Limiter Using A Self-Actuated Plasma-Based EIT Topology,"This paper presents a novel metamaterial topology incorporating gas discharge tubes for high-power microwave protection. The design features two split ring resonators positioned side by side with their splits oriented orthogonally. When exposed to low-power microwaves, each split ring resonator induces a resonance that interacts to create a passband within a broad stopband, facilitated by a phenomenon known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). At high power levels, the integrated gas discharge tubes become ionized, forming plasma that acts as a switch to eliminate the EIT window, thereby reinstating the stopband for protection. Several prototypes have been developed for S-band operation based on this concept. Analytical, numerical, and experimental results are in complete agreement. The proposed device demonstrates superior protection with lower insertion loss in the OFF mode and higher isolation in the ON mode. Its strong ability to handle high-power microwaves is achieved using plasma-based switches instead of diodes, providing a reasonable response time and a straightforward design that enables rapid prototyping. Additionally, the device demonstrates frequency and power threshold tunability, highlighting its versatility as a microwave protection device.","High intensity electromagnetic waves [1] can disrupt the communication systems, interfere with critical electronic equipment, and cause malfunctioning, especially when the conductor’s length resonates with the incoming waves, causing power surges. Typically, the protection is achieved by shielding through metallic enclosures or using absorbers. However, both approaches affect the system’s ability to communicate with the outside world. To circumvent these issues, receivers are usually placed outside the shielding mechanisms. However, high-power microwaves still cause issues, especially when the received signal is amplified, which can severely damage the communication equipment. Power limiters are the standard backend components employed after the receiver antenna for in-band protection against high-power microwaves. The desirable features of the power limiters are the introduction of low insertion and high isolation for low- and high-power signals, respectively. The common topologies for these backend power limiters are based on ferrite materials[2], semiconductor components (i.e., diodes and transistors) [3], MEMS [4], and plasma[5, 6, 7]. However, there are several other scenarios where the high-power microwave can couple with the circuitry and cause a malfunction in the critical equipment. In that broad sense, metamaterials offer a front-end platform to effectively limit high-power microwaves. Numerous solutions based on active metasurfaces integrated with lumped elements, i.e., p-i-n diodes [8], varactors [9], resistors [10], field effect transistors [11], and MEMS [12] etc. have been proposed for such protection. These active metasurfaces require sensors to detect the power threshold and utilize the sensor output to shield the target by switching the active elements through a DC biasing scheme. However, the HPM duration can be very short, and any switching delay may fail to provide timely protection. To enable rapid protection, passive and adaptive protection techniques are desired. Passive/adaptive metasurfaces, on the other hand, utilize the incoming energy to trigger the protection mode by inducing a power-dependent nonlinear response. These passive solutions can be categorized as impedance surface- and frequency selective surface (FSS)-based solutions. For example, the impedance surfaces in [13, 14] employed four symmetrical p-i-n diodes placed in a waveguide to limit the high-power waves, in which the isolation increased with the number of unit cells. These impedance surfaces lower the cutoff frequency of the propagating mode by emulating the short patches to the larger ones through the conducting diodes. Similarly, a varactor diode-based impedance surface was proposed in [15], which induced the gradual isolation with the power. In [16], anisotropic impedance surfaces were utilized, and protection was achieved by redirecting the high-intensity energy through the anisotropic bandgap induced with diodes. Recently, a split ring resonator integrated with p-i-n diodes has been proposed in which bandgap is induced under high power when the diode is in the ON state [17]. So far, limited isolation has been realized with these impedance surface-based schemes. For the FSS-based solutions, the typical approach employs non-resonant meta-atoms using conductive strips integrated with p-i-n diodes on a multi-layer board [18, 19]. These strips are shorted under high power, forming a resonator to stop a particular frequency band. The non-resonant cases usually require a high level of microwave power to short the diodes, as the electric field is typically low. The resonant meta-atom requires at least two metallic layers separated by the spacers to induce electric and magnetic resonances for ideal transmission, increasing the overall thickness [20, 21]. A trade-off between thickness and the overall bandwidth is necessary for such metamaterials. The other way is to use complementary structures based on dipole resonances [22]. However, they typically require at least two switching elements for each polarization, i.e., four switches per unit cell. Although the protection is achieved in a particular band, the passband is shifted to a higher frequency depending on the conductivity of the switching elements, as slots are not entirely blocked. Moreover, all these schemes are based on p-i-n diodes as suboptimal switches because of their initial leakage current and because they can only withstand a small amount of power. Therefore, they are not suitable for very high-power scenarios. On the other hand, recently, plasma-based protection schemes have received more attention as they are naturally tailored toward high-power applications. In these schemes, hermetically sealed gas elements are typically integrated with resonant structures. The gas ionizes in response to a high electric field, acting as a high-power switch for protection. Several prototypes have been demonstrated, especially for backend protection, such as microstrip-based limiter [5, 23, 24] and cavity limiter [25, 7]. In the context of front-end application, a waveguide plasma limiter has also been proposed, which requires 40 kW of pulsed power to form plasma and merely provides 3 dB of isolation [26]. In this article, we propose a novel resonant meta-atom topology based on the unique physics of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [27, 28] to open up a passband inside a wide stopband. Since the experimental demonstration of the EIT phenomenon in electromagnetics in 2008 [28] and 2009 [27], several EIT-based designs have been investigated, particularly for slow-wave applications in optics and photonics. Most EIT applications in the microwave regime have been limited to sensing [29, 30, 31]. Here, for the first time, we utilize meta-atoms based on an EIT topology for high-power microwave (HPM) protection by incorporating a gas discharge tube. The meta-atom structure achieves HPM protection by incorporating a gas discharge tube (GDT). The enclosed gas undergoes breakdown under high-power microwave illumination, forming plasma as a switch, disrupting the passband introduced through the EIT mechanism. As a result, high isolation is achieved throughout the passband, which is non-linearly enhanced owing to the incident power intensity. The plasma-based switching topology combined with the EIT mechanism outperforms existing designs due to its ultra-thin profile, high power handling capability, low insertion loss, high isolation, fast switching, and simple structure, requiring only a few switches per unit, as shown in Table I."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07216v1,"Multifunctional spintronic transistors: Sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local GMR, and NDR in spin gapless semiconductor and/or spin gapped metal FETs","Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are emerging as a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, offering unique opportunities to realize novel functionalities beyond conventional electronics. In this work, we propose a novel concept of multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) by employing SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as the source and drain electrodes. These devices function similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (SGM) electrode and the intrinsic semiconducting channel. However, unlike metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, the proposed devices leverage the distinctive spin-dependent transport properties of SGS and/or SGM electrodes to enable sub-60 mV/dec switching, a significant improvement over the sub-threshold swing bottleneck of 60 mV/dec in conventional MOSFETs, facilitating low-voltage operation. Additionally, the incorporation of SGMs introduces the negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio, further enhancing the device functionality. The proposed spintronic FETs exhibit a remarkable combination of features, including sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect, and NDR effect, making them highly attractive for next-generation applications such as logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These functionalities open avenues for exploring novel computing architectures beyond the constraints of the classic von-Neumann architecture, enabling more efficient and powerful information processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials emerge as a promising platform for realizing these multifunctional FETs. In this work, we perform a comprehensive screening of the computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials for the proposed devices. For device simulations, we select VS2 as the SGS material. As a proof-of-concept, we employ a non-equilibrium Green’s function method combined with density functional theory to simulate the transfer (I_{\mathrm{D}}-V_{\mathrm{G}}) and output (I_{\mathrm{D}}-V_{\mathrm{D}}) characteristics of a vertical VS2/Ga2O2 heterojunction FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS2. Our calculations predict a remarkably low sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 108, and a significant non-local GMR effect demonstrate these devices’ potential for low-power and high-performance applications.","Modern charge-based electronics rely heavily on metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) as fundamental building blocks. Their remarkable scaling over the decades has revolutionized computing and communication technologies, enabling the development of increasingly powerful and compact devices. However, despite their widespread use and advancements, conventional MOSFETs face inherent limitations that challenge further progress in electronics scaling and energy efficiency. One such limitation is the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing (SS) imposed by thermionic emission, which has remained a persistent bottleneck [1, 2]. This limitation significantly hinders low-voltage operation, a critical factor for achieving energy-efficient devices in modern electronics. Lowering the operating voltage not only reduces static power consumption but also minimizes leakage currents, addressing a fundamental concern for battery-powered electronics and portable devices where energy efficiency is paramount. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore alternative transistor designs and materials that can overcome these limitations and pave the way for the next generation of energy-efficient electronic devices [3, 4, 5]. To overcome the 60 mV/dec SS limit, researchers have explored alternative transistor designs categorized as steep slope transistors. These devices aim to achieve a sharper transition between the on-state and off-state, leading to a lower SS value. Examples of such devices include tunnel FETs (TFETs), Dirac source FETs, and the recently proposed cold-metal source FETs [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. While these alternative designs offer lower SS compared to conventional MOSFETs, they often come with trade-offs. Tunnel FETs, for instance, rely on a tunneling mechanism for current flow, leading to significantly lower on-currents compared to MOSFETs. This drawback limits their applicability in many logic circuits where high on-currents are crucial for driving subsequent stages. In contrast, Dirac source and cold-metal source FETs generally exhibit much higher on-state current densities, making them more attractive alternatives for practical applications. Steep-slope FETs with Dirac source and cold-metal source electrodes are an area of active research and are being explored as a potential solution to overcome the limitations of traditional MOSFETs, especially for low-power and high-speed applications. However, a key limitation of these emerging transistor proposals is their reliance solely on the charge degree of freedom. They do not exploit the potential benefits offered by the electron’s spin, a valuable resource for future spintronic devices. Spin gapless semiconductors (SGSs) have shown promising potential in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), enabling functionalities beyond conventional MTJs based on Fe, Co, and CoFeB. While these traditional MTJs offer high tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) for memory applications, they lack current rectification, hindering their functionality as diodes for logic applications [13, 14, 15]. A recent proposal addressed this by introducing type-II SGSs and half-metallic magnets in MTJs, achieving both TMR and a re-programmable diode effect [16, 17], which is experimentally demonstrated in MTJs based on Heusler compounds [18]. Inspired by this progress, we propose a novel class of spintronic FETs utilizing SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes with an intrinsic semiconductor channel. This configuration overcomes the limitations of both conventional MOSFETs (restricted by the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing) and alternative steep-slope transistor designs. The key lies in exploiting the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS and SGM electrodes. The SGSs enable sub-60 mV/dec switching and introduce the non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect, absent in conventional charge-based FETs. Additionally, SGMs offer negative differential resistance (NDR) with a high peak-to-valley current ratio. This combination opens doors for next-generation applications like logic-in-memory computing, where data processing and storage occur on the same chip [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. In this paper, we present a comprehensive conceptual framework for novel multifunctional spintronic FETs. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials emerge as a promising platform for realizing these multifunctional FETs. These materials offer a promising pathway to overcome scaling challenges inherent to conventional FETs. Their atomically thin structure enables exceptional gate control and mitigates short-channel effects, essential for low-power, high-performance devices. Focusing on spintronic applications, we identify transition metal dichalcogenides and dihalides, such as VS2 and ScI2, as potential 2D candidates. Through a comprehensive screening of a computational 2D materials database, we select suitable SGS and SGM materials for our proposed devices. To demonstrate proof-of-concept, we employ ab initio quantum transport calculations to simulate a vertical VS2/Ga2O2 heterojunction FET based on 2D type-II SGSs VS2. Utilizing a non-equilibrium Green function method combined with density functional theory, our simulations predict remarkable device performance, including a subthreshold swing (SS) of only 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 108, and a substantial non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect. These findings underscore the potential of 2D SGSs for realizing our proposed multifunctional spintronic FETs, paving the way for a new generation of low-power, high-performance spintronic devices. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we introduce the concepts of SGSs and SGMs. Section III presents the design and operation principles of our proposed multifunctional spintronic FETs. The computational methodology employed in this study is detailed in Section IV. In Sections V.A and V.B, we present the results of our screening process for suitable 2D materials and the simulation results for a vertical VS2/Ga2O2 heterojunction FET, respectively. Finally, Section VI summarizes our key findings and discusses their implications.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06586v1,Combining Entangled and Non-Entangled based Quantum Key Distribution Protocol with GHZ state,"This paper presents a novel hybrid Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol that combines entanglement-based and non-entanglement based approaches to optimize security and the number of generated keys. We introduce a dynamic system that integrates a three-particle GHZ-state method with the two-state B92 protocol, using a quantum superposition state to probabilistically switch between them. The GHZ-state component leverages strong three-particle entanglement correlations for enhanced security, while the B92 component offers simplicity and potentially higher key generation rates. Implemented and simulated using Qiskit, our approach demonstrates higher number of generated keys compared to standalone protocols while maintaining robust security. We present a comprehensive analysis of the protocol’s security properties and performance characteristics. The results show that this combined method effectively balances the trade-offs inherent in QKD systems, offering a flexible framework adaptable to varying channel conditions and security requirements. This research contributes to ongoing efforts to make QKD more practical and efficient, potentially advancing the development of large-scale, secure quantum networks.","Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) [1] has emerged as a promising technology for secure communication in the quantum era. By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, QKD offers the potential for information-theoretic security, a feat unattainable with classical cryptographic methods. As we stand on the brink of a new technological paradigm, the importance of robust and efficient QKD protocols cannot be overstated. Traditional QKD protocols can be broadly categorized into two types: those based on entanglement, such as the E91 [2] protocol, and those that do not require entanglement, like the BB84 [3] or B92 [4] protocols. Each approach has its strengths and limitations. Entanglement-based protocols offer stronger security guarantees through quantum correlations but can be more challenging to implement and may have lower key generation rates. Non-entanglement based protocols, on the other hand, can be simpler to implement and potentially faster, but may be more vulnerable to certain types of attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both entangled and non-entangled QKD protocols. Specifically, we introduce a hybrid protocol that integrates a GHZ-state [5] based method (Entanglement-based protocol) with the B92 protocol (Non-entanglement-based protocol). The GHZ-state component leverages the strong correlations of three-particle entanglement, providing enhanced security, while the B92 component offers simplicity and potentially higher number of generated keys under certain conditions. The primary goal of this combined approach is to achieve a higher overall key generation rate while maintaining the high level of security afforded by entanglement-based methods. By dynamically switching between the two protocols based on a quantum superposition state, we aim to optimize the trade-off between security and efficiency. Our work builds upon the foundational research in quantum key distribution, including the seminal work of Bennett on B92, and the three-particle entanglement studies of Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger. We extend these ideas by proposing a unified framework that can adapt to varying channel conditions and security requirements. In the following sections, we will provide a detailed description of our combined protocol, analyze its security properties, and present simulation results using the Qiskit [6] quantum computing framework. We will demonstrate how this hybrid approach can potentially outperform single-protocol implementations in terms of key generation rate while maintaining robust security guarantees. Through this research, we aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts to make QKD more practical and efficient, bringing us closer to the realization of large-scale, secure quantum networks."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06480v1,Multifunctional 2d infrared photodetectors enabled by asymmetric singular metasurfaces,"Two-dimensional materials offering ultrafast photoresponse suffer from low intrinsic absorbance, especially in the mid-infrared wavelength range. Challenges in 2d material doping further complicate the creation of light-sensitive p-n junctions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a graphene-based infrared detector with simultaneously enhanced absorption and strong structural asymmetry enabling zero-bias photocurrent. A key element for those properties is an asymmetric singular metasurface (ASMS) atop graphene with keen metal wedges providing singular enhancement of local absorbance. The ASMS geometry predefines extra device functionalities. The structures with connected metallic wedges demonstrate polarization ratios up to 200 in a broad range of carrier densities at a wavelength of 8.6 \mum. The structures with isolated wedges display gate-controlled switching between polarization-discerning and polarization-stable photoresponse, a highly desirable yet scarce property for polarized imaging.","Methods Responsivity estimates. The power in the device plane was measured with a Thorlabs S302C thermal power head connected to a PM100D powermeter. We replaced the devices holder with the thermal head to preserve the optical path. The measured average laser power (50 % duty cycle) varies in the range P_{0}^{\rm avr}=1.52\dots 8.90~{}{\rm mW}, depending on the laser current, while the power amplitude is P_{0}=3.04\dots 17.8~{}{\rm mW}. The power per device area with dimensions L and W, illuminated by a Gaussian focused beam p(x)\propto e^{-(x^{2}+y^{2})/2\sigma^{2}} is P_{\rm dev}=\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{L}{2\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right)% \operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{W}{2\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right)P_{0}. (1) Our laser spot has \sigma = 20 \mum, thus the w-, t- and s-devices with L=W=30 \mum receive 30 % of total laser power. The amplitude of photovoltage under steady illumination V_{\rm ph} is calculated from lock-in readings V_{\rm LI} under meander-modulated illumination using V_{\rm ph}=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\,V_{\rm LI}, (2) The responsivities per total power (r_{\rm V}) and per power reaching the device (r_{\rm V,\,dev}) are r_{\rm V}=\frac{V_{\rm ph}}{P_{0}}\qquad{\rm and}\qquad r_{\rm V,\,dev}=\frac{% V_{\rm ph}}{P_{\rm dev}}. (3) Modeling. Electromagnetic modeling was implemented in Microwave Studio package with single-frequency finite element solver. The dielectric functions of contact metals and surrounding dielectrics were taken from refractiveindex.info database. Modeling of thermal transport is based on heat conduction equation for electron temperature T({\bf r}): -(\nabla,\chi_{e}({\bf r})\nabla T({\bf r}))=-\frac{C_{e}}{\tau_{\varepsilon}}% [T({\bf r})-T_{0}]+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{\rm opt}|{\bf E}|^{2}, (4) here \chi_{e} and C_{e} are the electronic thermal conductivity and heat capacity, respectively, \tau_{\varepsilon} is the energy relaxation time due to substrate phonons, T_{0} is equilibrium temperature. The last term in Eq. (4) is the Joule heating by electromagnetic field. Modeling of photo-thermoelectric response is based on continuity relation supplemented with microscopic expression for electron current. The latter includes thermal diffusion and drift components. The resulting equation on light-induced electric potential V({\bf r}) is (see Supplementary Information, Section II for derivation): (\nabla,\alpha_{e}({\bf r})\nabla T({\bf r})-\sigma_{e}({\bf r})\nabla V({\bf r% }))=0, (5) here \alpha_{e}({\bf r}) is the thermal diffusivity and \sigma_{e}({\bf r}) is the electron conductivity. The three functions \alpha_{e}, \chi_{e} and \sigma_{e} are bound by the Wiedemann-Frantz and Mott relations. Only one of them retains free, which we choose to be \sigma_{e}=\mu e(n+p). Equation (5) can be solved semi-analytically for the photocurrent I_{\rm ph} under assumption of uniform conductivity \sigma_{e}({\bf r})={\rm const}. The result reads as I_{\rm ph}=\frac{1}{V_{0}}\int{d{\bf r}({\bf E}_{0}({\bf r}),\alpha_{e}({\bf r% })\nabla T({\bf r}))}, (6) where {\bf E}_{0} is dc the electric field in the channel upon application of potential V_{0} to the drain (not to be confused with local radiation field {\bf E}({\bf r})). Eq. (6) shows that photocurrent sampling is most efficient from the points with strong local dc electric field, i.e. near the edges."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06124v1,Exploring Structural Nonlinearity in Binary Polariton-Based Neuromorphic Architectures,"This study investigates the performance of a binarized neuromorphic network leveraging polariton dyads, optically excited pairs of interfering polariton condensates within a microcavity to function as binary logic gate neurons. Employing numerical simulations, we explore various neuron configurations, both linear (NAND, NOR) and nonlinear (XNOR), to assess their effectiveness in image classification tasks. We demonstrate that structural nonlinearity, derived from the network’s layout, plays a crucial role in facilitating complex computational tasks, effectively reducing the reliance on the inherent nonlinearity of individual neurons. Our findings suggest that the network’s configuration and the interaction among its elements can emulate the benefits of nonlinearity, thus potentially simplifying the design and manufacturing of neuromorphic systems and enhancing their scalability. This shift in focus from individual neuron properties to network architecture could lead to significant advancements in the efficiency and applicability of neuromorphic computing.","Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have revolutionized data processing by emulating the intricate network of neurons in the human brain, enabling significant advances in fields ranging from robotics to healthcare [1, 2]. These systems process information through interconnected nodes or neurons that can learn to perform complex tasks, leading to improvements in decision-making and pattern recognition technologies. As the demand for these technologies grows, so does the interest in developing various hardware implementations to support them [3]. These hardware platforms include electronic-based systems, which leverage silicon-based technologies, and photonic systems, which exploit the interaction of light and matter to enhance speed and reduce energy consumption [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Another promising option is the use of exciton-polaritons, quasiparticles that combine the properties of light and matter. These are being investigated for their potential in neuromorphic computing, particularly because of their rapid operation times and potentially low power consumption [9, 10]. Each of these platforms aims to offer unique advantages, whether in scalability, speed, or energy efficiency, to meet the growing computational demands of modern ANNs. In light of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for foundational advances that have shaped the modern era of neural networks and machine learning, our exploration into polariton-based neuromorphic architectures gains added relevance. Hopfield’s seminal contributions to the physics of exciton-polaritons [11, 12] and neural network theory [13, 14] have inspired new approaches that blend these fields. This fusion of knowledge is at the heart of our study, underscoring the potential of exciton-polaritons in neuromorphic computing to push the boundaries of processing speeds and the inherent capability for parallel data handling. Binarized neural networks (BNNs) represent a specific approach to enhancing the computational efficiency of artificial neural networks [15, 16, 17]. By simplifying the weights and activations within the network to just two levels, typically 0 and 1, BNNs drastically reduce the computational complexity and memory usage required for neural processing. Although this simplification often results in lower accuracy compared to networks with full-precision weights, BNNs excel in scenarios where speed, power efficiency, and low resource consumption are more critical than achieving the highest possible accuracy, making them well-suited for applications in internet of things, edge computing, and other environments where autonomy and limited resources are key considerations [17, 18, 19]. Binarized neural networks have been effectively realized using exciton-polaritons. In the notable implementation described in Ref. [9], artificial neurons function as XOR gates. The used technique utilizes nonresonant laser pulses, acting as the input signals, to selectively excite spatially localized exciton-polariton condensates, that interact with each other. The resulting output signals vary in energy, reflecting the different combinations of the inputs. This approach has proven successful in pattern recognition tasks, achieving approximately 96% accuracy on the MNIST (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset, a standard benchmark in machine learning for handwritten digit recognition, under noisy conditions using a single-hidden-layer network. The impressive potential of this solution is further underscored by subsequent assessments of its remarkable energy efficiency, as reported in [10]. Nonlinearity is a cornerstone in the operational efficiency of neural networks, essential for executing tasks beyond the scope of linear computational models. This includes distinguishing overlapping data sets or solving inherently complex problems. The nonlinear activation function within each neuron exemplifies this intrinsic nonlinearity, defining how inputs are transformed into outputs in a way that linear operations cannot [20]. Exciton polaritons, known for their pronounced nonlinear properties due to polariton-polariton interactions, are especially valuable in this context. The distinctive nonlinearity of polaritons is the key element that drives the functionality of both continuous-weight networks [5] and binarized neuromorphic systems [9]. Recent research [21, 22, 23, 24] challenge the emphasis traditionally placed on the inherent nonlinearity in individual neurons within neural networks, see also [25, 26]. Studies have demonstrated that nonlinear computations can be realized using purely linear optical systems by adjusting the parameters of these systems. This development underscores that achieving nonlinearity does not necessarily rely on the physical nonlinearity of the system’s components. By encoding inputs as parameters rather than direct signals, a linear system can emulate nonlinear behavior. This approach shifts the focus from the inherent properties of the materials to the configuration of the system itself, which facilitates structural nonlinearity arising from the arrangement and interactions among its components. In our recent paper [27], we have theoretically proposed a binarized neuromorphic network architecture based on a lattice of pairwise coupled exciton polariton condensates. In this geometry, each pair of condensates, referred to as a polariton dyad [28], serves as artificial binary neurons functioning similarly to OR gates. Unlike XOR gate neurons utilized in work [9], the OR operation is linear. Nevertheless, in [27], we demonstrated that our proposed architecture effectively addresses the inherently nonlinear challenge of image classification, exemplified by the recognition tasks in the MNIST dataset. Our current study elucidates the role of structural nonlinearity in solving recognition tasks. We explore the potential for modifying the operation of polariton neurons proposed in [27] to function as both linear (NAND and NOR) and nonlinear (XNOR) gates. Through numerical experiments, we compare the image classification accuracies, allowing us to question whether the significance of inherent nonlinearity, typical of individual computational elements such as neurons, might be overstated."
