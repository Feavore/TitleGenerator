https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10445v1,Inverse Melting of Polar Order in a Ferroelectric Oxide,"In many condensed matter systems, long range order emerges at low temperatures as thermal fluctuations subside. In the presence of competing interactions or quenched disorder, however, some systems can show unusual configurations that become more disordered at low temperature, a rare phenomenon known as “inverse melting”. Here, we discover an inverse melting of the polar order in a ferroelectric oxide with quenched chemical disorder (BaTi1-xZrxO3) through direct atomic-scale visualization using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. In contrast to the clean BaTiO3 parent system in which long range order tracks lower temperatures, we observe in the doped system BaTi1-xZrxO3 that thermally driven fluctuations at high temperature give way to a more ordered state and then to a re-entrant disordered configuration at even lower temperature. Such an inverse melting of the polar order is likely linked to the random field generated by Zr dopants, which modulates the energy landscape arising from the competition between thermal fluctuations and random field pinning potential. These visualizations highlight a rich landscape of order and disorder in materials with quenched disorder, which may be key to understanding their advanced functionalities.",I Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10277v1,Bound states in one-dimensional systems with colored noise,"We investigate the phase transitions in a one-dimensional system with colored noise. Previous studies indicated that the phase diagram of this system included extended and disorder-induced localized phases. However, by studying the properties of wave functions, we find that this phase diagram can be further refined, revealing the existence of a bound phase for the large potential amplitude W and noise control parameter \alpha. In the bound phase, the wave function cannot extend throughout the entire chain, tails decay faster than exponentially and its distribution expands as the system size increases. By adjusting the potential amplitude to induce a transition from the extended phase to the bound phase, we find that bound states coexist with extended states in the spectrum. In contrast, when the system transitions from the Anderson localized phase to the bound phase, we do not observe the obvious coexistence of Anderson localized and bound states. Finally, by performing the time evolution, we find that the dynamic transition point of the bound phase is inconsistent with the static one for large \alpha.","White noise is commonly used in studies of Anderson localization, where it causes the wave function to decay exponentially in space [1]. Besides white noise, various other types of colored noise exist in nature, such as pink noise, blue noise, etc. The “color” of noise refers to its power spectrum, and different colored noise can be characterized by the power spectral density S(k)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}R(x)e^{-i2\pi kx}\,dx [2, 3, 4, 5], where R(x)=\langle W_{j}W_{j+x}\rangle is the autocorrelation function of colored noise between sites j and j+x. Different types of colored noise exhibit distinct decay forms as S(k)\propto k^{-\alpha}. Typically, white noise has a flat spectral density with \alpha=0, pink noise has \alpha=1, and red noise has \alpha=2 [2]. An important property of colored noise is that the correlation changes with the exponent \alpha [6, 7, 8]. For \alpha=0, the white noise manifests \delta-correlation \langle W_{j}W_{j^{\prime}}\rangle=\langle W_{j}^{2}\rangle\delta_{j,j^{\prime}} in space [6], which causes one-dimensional systems to form Anderson localized states for arbitrary potential amplitude [9]. As \alpha increases, the correlation of colored noise alters from short-range to long-range, and a transition from the Anderson localized phase to the extended phase is found in the middle of the spectrum [7, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Figure 1: The noise signals in space for different \alpha. (a), (b), (c), and (d) use the same random phase \phi_{k}. The amplitude interval is normalized to \varepsilon_{j}\in[-1/2,1/2] and L=1000. In the studies of Anderson localization, the localization length \xi is a crucial quantity, which identifies the exponential decay rate of the wave function \psi_{r}\sim e^{-r/\xi} [17]. The localization length of Anderson localized states can be calculated by the Lyapunov exponent \gamma in many systems with white noise or quasi-periodic potentials [18, 19]. This is due to the fact that the Lyapunov exponent is equivalent to the reciprocal of the localization length \gamma=1/\xi when a wave function obeys the exponential decay \psi_{r}\sim e^{-\gamma r} [19]. On the contrary, when the wave function does not follow exponential (Anderson-like) decay, the above relation \gamma=1/\xi is not strictly valid. Therefore, the localization length derived from the Lyapunov exponent may not accurately characterize states with non-exponential (non-Anderson-like) decay, e.g., Wannier-Stark states [20]. In previous works, the Lyapunov exponent is used to characterize the transition in one-dimensional systems with colored noise or long-range correlated disorder [7, 6, 8, 10, 11, 21, 22]. An important phase diagram shows that the system is in the localized phase for the large potential amplitude W/t>4 and 0\leq\alpha\leq 5 [7]. However, one can find that the randomness of the noise signal decreases as \alpha increases and the signal becomes smooth in the limit for \alpha\rightarrow\infty, as shown in Fig. 1. It raises an important question: are the states still Anderson localized states for large potential amplitude W/t>4 and large \alpha? In other words, could there be a phase different from the Anderson localized phase? In this work, our objective is to address this problem. By carefully studying the wave function and its characteristics, we confirm that a bound phase exists for large W and \alpha, in which the wave function does not obey exponential (Anderson-like) decay, suggesting that the Lyapunov exponent cannot accurately describe the properties of the system with long-range correlated disorder. Moreover, we also investigate the coexistence of different states in the spectrum and perform the time evolution to study the dynamical properties of the bound states for large \alpha."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10247v1,Anderson localization induced by structural disorder,"We examine the onset of Anderson localization in three-dimensional systems with structural disorder in form of lattice irregularities and in the absence of any on-site disordered potential. Analyzing two models with distinct types of lattice regularities, we show that the Anderson localization transition occurs when the strength of the structural disorder is smoothly increased. Performing finite-size scaling analysis of the results, we show that the transition belongs to the same universality class as regular Anderson localization induced by onsite disorder. Our work identifies a new class of structurally disordered lattice models in which destructive interference of matter waves may inhibit transport and lead to a transition between metallic and localized phases.","Introduction. The role of disorder in the localization of quantum systems continues to be a subject of extensive research to date [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The phenomenon of Anderson localization (AL) [8, 9, 10], wherein single-particle wave-functions of non-interacting quantum systems spatially localize in the presence of spatial disorder is fairly well understood [2] and has been demonstrated experimentally [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In lattice systems, the disorder is traditionally introduced locally by an onsite potential at each lattice site sampled randomly from a distribution whose width determines the disorder strength. While any amount of disorder localizes all the eigenstates in one-dimensional (1D) systems, disorder exceeding a critical strength is necessary to induce the AL transition in three-dimensional (3D) systems (see e.g. [16] and references therein). Two-dimensional (2D) systems present a marginal case where wavefunctions localize over a spatial extent increasing rapidly with the decrease of the disorder strength, rendering AL in 2D difficult to observe experimentally [17, 18] Figure 1: Destructive interference on a structural disorder if form of lattice irregularities results in AL transition between a localized phase (left panel, strong structural disorder) and a delocalized phase (right panel, weak structural disorder). Fundamentally, localized eigenstates result from the superposition of propagating wavefunctions with randomly distributed phases acquired from scattering off the random onsite potentials [17]. One can therefore envisage that the presence of onsite disorder is not a necessary condition for AL; random phases can also be acquired from scattering off irregular surfaces or edges of the system which we shall henceforth refer to as a structural disorder. This leads to the following questions: (i) can the structural disorder, analogously to the onsite disorder, lead to an AL transition that separates localized and delocalized phases, and (ii) if such a localization transition exists, does it belong to the same universality class as the regular AL in the presence of onsite disorder. In this letter, we demonstrate that a 3D AL transition can indeed be induced by a smooth increase of strength of the structural disorder. To this end, we examine a tight-binding lattice model with structural disorder introduced by removing lattice sites from a regular 3D honeycomb lattice, shown in Fig. 1. The process of removing sites is described by a classical statistical model defined on the chosen lattice. Focusing on a tight-binding Hamiltonian defined on the largest cluster of the remaining lattice sites, we show that the structural disorder strength can be increased by varying parameters of the underlying statistical model, leading to AL transition. We investigate the critical properties of the transition and consider an alternative 3D lattice with structural disorder to illustrate the robustness of our findings. Figure 2: (a) The averaged gap ratio \langle r\rangle captures the AL transition on \mathcal{C} for different system sizes L in the honeycomb model as a function of p, where p is the fraction of sites remaining in the lattice. The inset shows a critical scaling collapse with exponent \nu=1.57. (b) A similar AL transition is also observed for the link model in which case P_{link} represents the probability of added links in the random spanning tree."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10430v1,"Simulating the two-dimensional t-J model at finite doping
with neural quantum states","Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states—specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS)—to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the t-J model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as 6\times 10 sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.","References D.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10376v1,Soliton Dynamics over a Disordered Topography,"We report on the dynamics of a soliton propagating on the surface of a fluid in a 4-m-long canal with a random or periodic bottom topography. Using a full space-and-time resolved wavefield measurement, we evidence, for the first time experimentally, how the soliton is affected by the disorder, in the context of Anderson localization, and how localization depends on nonlinearity. For weak soliton amplitudes, the localization length is found in quantitative agreement with a linear shallow-water theory. For higher amplitudes, this spatial attenuation of the soliton amplitude is found to be enhanced. Behind the leading soliton slowed down by the topography, different experimentally unreported dynamics occur: Fission into backward and forward nondispersive pulses for the periodic case, and scattering into dispersive waves for the random case. Our findings open doors to potential applications regarding ocean coastal protection against large-amplitude waves.","References [1] W. H. Bragg and W. L.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10360v1,Anisotropic Field Theory of Wave Transmission Statistics in Disordered Media,"We present a field theory to characterize the mean distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation through a disordered medium. Unlike the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) theory, our approach does not rely on the isotropy hypothesis, which assumes uniform field intensity across scattering channels. As a result, it accurately predicts the transmission eigenvalue distribution both in the diffusive and quasiballistic regime. In addition, it proves to be more versatile than the DMPK theory, allowing for the incorporation of physical effects such as absorption or partial channel control with minimal adjustments to the formalism. Although these effects are commonly encountered in experiments on complex media, until now there has been no ab initio theory addressing them. Our predictions are numerically validated against transmission eigenvalue distributions computed from the microscopic wave equation.","References Mosk et al. [2012] A. P. Mosk, A. Lagendijk, G.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10355v1,Transmission eigenvalue distribution in disordered media from anisotropic field theory,"A field theory for the distribution of transmission eigenvalues through a disordered medium is developed in details. The central equation of this theory is a self-consistent transport equation for a \displaystyle 2\times 2 matrix radiance. This equation determines the transmission eigenvalue distribution not only in the diffusive regime but also in the quasiballistic regime, where the radiance is expected to be significantly anisotropic in the material bulk. We show that the matrix transport equation can be solved analytically in this regime. We also show that, in addition to the finite-width waveguide, our equation is able to predict the transmission eigenvalue distribution through an infinite slab.","The theoretical study of wave propagation in disordered media is crucial in fields ranging from optical and acoustical imaging to electron transport in mesoscopic conductors [1, 2, 3]. Among the analysis tools, the transmission matrix \displaystyle\mathsf{t}, which links input and output channels, provides detailed insights into coherent wave propagation through disordered materials. In particular, the eigendecomposition of \displaystyle\mathsf{t}^{\dagger}\mathsf{t} can be used to optimize the transmitted power by shaping the input wavefront. Indeed, the eigenvalues of \displaystyle\mathsf{t}^{\dagger}\mathsf{t}, which range from \displaystyle 0 to \displaystyle 1, represent the transmission probabilities of corresponding eigenmodes. Remarkably, in the diffusive regime, the distribution of these eigenvalues follows the bimodal law, \displaystyle\rho(T)=\bar{T}/(2T\sqrt{1-T}), \displaystyle\bar{T} being the mean transmission [4, 5, 6, 7]. The existence of quasitransparent channels (with \displaystyle T\simeq 1) as predicted by the bimodal law offers promising prospects for optimizing transmitted power, even in media much thicker than the scattering mean free path [8, 9]. The first theoretical approach addressing the distribution of transmission eigenvalues through a disordered medium is due to Dorokhov [10] later followed by Mello, Pereyra, and Kumar [11]. This approach is based on a perturbative treatment of an infinitesimal slice of disordered medium, and leads to a Fokker-Planck-type equation, known as the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) equation, for the joint distribution of transmission eigenvalues [7]. The DMPK theory has achieved great success due to the elegance of its formalism and the accuracy of its predictions in both the diffusive and the localized regime. However, this theory has a key limitation: it does not rely on a microscopic disorder model but instead relies on simplifying assumptions for the infinitesimal slice. In particular, it assumes that the transmission matrix of each slice is uniformly distributed in the ensemble of complex matrices, with the transmittance drop determined by the ratio of slice thickness to the mean free path. This assumption, often referred to as the isotropy hypothesis [11, 7], distributes flux uniformly across all outgoing channels. This assumption reduces the applicability of the DMPK theory in the quasiballistic regime, yet of great experimental interest. A promising approach to get rid of the isotropy hypothesis and thus regain control over the disorder model is to resort to field theory. Historically, this field-theoretical approach emerged in the late 1970s with the works of Wegner and Schäfer [12, 13] who were inspired by popular ideas at the time to address coherent electron transport in disordered conductors [14, 15, 16, 17]. This approach was later given a supersymmetric sector by Larkin and Efetov [18, 19, 20, 21] to include Anderson localization effects. The same authors pointed out [22] an interesting analogy between the field theory of disordered media and a similar approach used in nonequilibrium superconductivity. This approach goes back to the beginning of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory [23] when Gorkov [24, *Gorkov1959a, *Gorkov1959b], Eilenberger [27, 28], Usadel [29], Eliashberg [30], Larkin and Ovchinnikov [31, *Larkin1973, *Larkin1975, *Larkin1977] developed kinetic equations to describe type-II superconductors. In these latter, the disorder caused by impurities greatly affects superconductivity via the reduction of the superconducting coherence length. In the 1990s, Nazarov showed [35] that this analogy with superconductivity can be successfully exploited to determine the transmission eigenvalue distribution through a disordered conductor. His derivation of the bimodal law via field theory is an important result in the literature on complex systems and served as the basis for the formulation of his circuit theory [36, 37, 7, 38]. In modern terminology, his theory falls into the class of nonlinear sigma models [39, 40], and is therefore limited to the diffusive regime where the isotropy hypothesis holds. In this paper, we develop a field theory inspired by Nazarov’s technique but free from the isotropy hypothesis and thus valid in the quasiballistic regime. Our main result is a matrix transport equation very similar to the Eilenberger equation of superconductivity [28, 31, *Larkin1973, *Larkin1975, *Larkin1977, 29, 30, 41, 42, 38]. Using this theory, we obtain an analytical solution in the quasiballistic regime revealing the significant influence of the transverse boundary conditions on the transmission eigenvalue distribution. We also show that this theory unlocks the limit of infinitely wide waveguide which is not numerically tractable by other means. This theory is further extended in the Letter [43] to include other physical effects such as absorption [44] and partial channel control [45, 9]. This paper is organized as follows. The field theory for the transmission eigenvalue distribution is derived step by step in Sec. II. The relationship between this theory and the nonlinear sigma model is discussed in Appendix A. In Sec. III.1 and Appendix B, it is shown that the matrix field, the main variable of the theory, slowly varies at the wavelength scale, thereby making the semiclassical approximation of Sec. III.2 relevant. The result of this approximation is an Eilenberger-type matrix transport equation derived in Sec. III.2. The boundary conditions of this equation are obtained in Sec. III.3. The analytical solution in the quasiballistic regime is derived in Sec. III.4. Numerical results are presented in Sec. IV. The matrix transport equation is solved numerically in two geometries, the waveguide in Sec. IV.2 and the infinite slab in Sec. IV.3, using the integration method of Appendix C. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Sec. V. Since the equations of this paper are valid in a space of arbitrary dimension, the volume and surface area of the unit ball in the space \displaystyle\mathbb{R}^{d} frequently appear. They are respectively given by V_{d}=\frac{\pi^{\frac{d}{2}}}{\Gamma(\frac{d}{2}+1)}\>,\quad\text{and}\quad S% _{d}=dV_{d}=\frac{2\pi^{\frac{d}{2}}}{\Gamma(\frac{d}{2})}\>, (1) where \displaystyle\Gamma(z) stands for the gamma function [46]. Furthermore, regarding the notations, we will use the hat (\displaystyle\hat{A}) for operators acting in the position space and Dirac’s bra-ket notations for the corresponding vectors. In addition, \displaystyle\operatorname{Tr}(\cdot) will represent the trace over a continuous basis, and \displaystyle\operatorname{tr}(\cdot) the trace over a discrete basis."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09784v1,Reinforced Disentanglers on Random Unitary Circuits,"We search for efficient disentanglers on random Clifford circuits of two-qubit gates arranged in a brick-wall pattern using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm [1]. Disentanglers are a set of projective measurements inserted between consecutive entangling layers. An efficient disentangler is a set of projective measurements that minimize the averaged von Neumann entropy of the final state with the least number of total projections possible. The problem is naturally amenable to reinforcement learning techniques by taking the binary matrix representing the projective measurements along the circuit as our state and actions as bit-flipping operations on this binary matrix that add or delete measurements at specified locations. We give rewards to our agent dependent on the averaged von Neumann entropy of the final state and the configuration of measurements, such that the agent learns the optimal policy that will take him from the initial state of no measurements to the optimal measurement state that minimizes the von Neumann entropy. Our results indicate that the number of measurements required to disentangle a random quantum circuit is drastically less than the numerical results of measurement-induced phase transition papers. Additionally, the reinforcement learning procedure enables us to characterize the pattern of optimal disentanglers, which is not possible in the works of measurement-induced phase transitions.","Measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] is a relatively new class of phase transition observed in random quantum circuits when measurements are incorporated alongside unitary operations. In these circuits, random unitary operations generate entanglement across the system, while measurements tend to collapse quantum states, reducing the overall entanglement. The competition between these processes—entanglement generation and destruction—results in a critical transition. Specifically, as the measurement rate increases, the system undergoes a phase transition from a volume-law phase, where entanglement entropy or von Neumann entropy of a subsystem scales with system size, to an area-law phase, where entanglement entropy scales with the boundary of a subsystem. The volume-law phase represents a highly entangled quantum state, while in the area-law phase, frequent measurements collapse the quantum state, leading to low entanglement. The transition is non-thermal, emerging from the nature of quantum dynamics rather than thermal fluctuations, making it an example of a non-equilibrium phase transition. This critical point depends on the rate of measurements, and numerical techniques such as tensor networks and Monte Carlo simulations are often used to explore the phase diagram. MIPTs have been explored in various contexts, including random Clifford circuits, stabilizer circuits, and hybrid quantum systems. These transitions are significant for understanding the limitations of quantum error correction and how information scrambling behaves in quantum systems [7]. Li et al. (2018) [8] discussed how the quantum Zeno effect plays a role in this transition from volume to area law in random circuits. Skinner et al. (2019) [3] presented the numerical evidence for the existence of these transitions in entanglement dynamics. Chan et al. (2019) [9] extended the understanding of the entanglement dynamics in unitary-projective hybrid circuits. Together, these works lay the theoretical and numerical foundation for studying MIPTs. Even though great insight has been gained regarding entanglement properties of one-dimensional qubit systems through numerical simulations studying measurement-induced phase transitions, the probabilistic nature of the projections blur the essential properties of the disentanglers. To address that issue, we consider a bottom-up approach for constructing efficient disentanglers in random quantum circuits. In the MIPT literature, brick-wall circuits are composed of consecutive layers of projections and random two-qubit unitaries. In that sense, constructing efficient disentanglers can be framed as a game, in which the disentangler plays against the brick-wall structure, learning how to pick the positions of projections aiming to minimize the reward function consisting of averaged von Neumann entropy of the final state and a configuration of measurements on the circuit. To solve the disentangling problem, we can take inspiration from reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks [10]. In RL, an agent interacts with an environment and learns a policy to maximize a cumulative reward. For our case, the agent (the disentangler) would act within the quantum circuit (the environment), learning optimal strategies for placing projections to minimize the von Neumann entropy. This setup naturally fits the RL paradigm, where actions correspond to the placement of projections, and the reward could be inversely related to the final entropy of the state. In particular, policy-based methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have shown strong performance in complex, high-dimensional spaces, making them a suitable candidate for this task [1]. PPO operates by iteratively improving the policy based on the expected return while ensuring updates remain within a trust region to avoid overly large policy shifts, which can destabilize learning. The disentangler’s task can be framed as learning a policy \pi_{\theta}(a|s), where a are the actions (placement of projections) and s is the current state of the system, aiming to minimize the entropy after several layers of the quantum circuit. PPO’s key advantage is its balance between exploration and exploitation, allowing the disentangler to efficiently search for better placements without getting stuck in sub-optimal policies. Moreover, PPO’s clipped objective function ensures stable learning by penalizing drastic changes in the policy, which is particularly important in stochastic environments like random quantum circuits. Over time, the disentangler would learn a robust policy that can generalize across different configurations of the brick-wall circuit, leading to low-entropy final states with high efficiency. We organize this letter as follows. In section II, we review stabilizer states and random Clifford structures. Most importantly, the entanglement entropy can be calculated much more efficiently compared to direct diagonalization methods. We also introduce key reinforcement learning concepts and provide the essential features of the PPO algorithm while explaining the reward profile that we used in training efficient disentanglers. In section III, we present the result of our numerical simulations. Our results enable the understanding of the pattern for efficient disentanglers, which is currently unattainable with the current random projection models studied in the MIPT literature. We conclude the letter with section IV, where we discuss modifications to the reinforcement learning algorithms and reward functions and comment on possible applications."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09754v1,Coherent Magneto-Conductance Oscillations in Amorphous Topological Insulator Nanowires,"Recent experiments on amorphous materials have established the existence of surface states similar to those of crystalline three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) ([1, 2, 3]). Amorphous topological insulators are also independently of interest for thermo-electric and other properties. To develop an understanding of transport in these systems, we carry out quantum transport calculations for a tight-binding model of an amorphous nano-wire pierced by an axial magnetic flux, then compare the results to known features in the case of crystalline models with disorder. Our calculations complement previous studies in the crystalline case that studied the surface or used a Green’s function method ([4, 5]). We find that the periodicity of the conductance signal with varying magnetic flux is comparable to the crystalline case, with maxima occurring at odd multiples of magnetic flux quanta. However, the expected amplitude of the oscillation decreases with increasing amorphousness, as defined and described in the main text. We characterize this deviation from the crystalline case by taking ensemble averages of the conductance signatures for various wires with measurements simulated at finite temperatures. This striking transport phenomenon offers a metric to characterize amorphous TIs and stimulate further experiments on this class of materials.","Topological insulators (TIs) induced by spin-orbit coupling are of significant applied interest due to their potential utility in spintronics and novel quantum device applications [6, 7]. It is well known that TI surface states are robust in principle to the breaking of translational invariance through some amount of non-magnetic local disorder, including amorphous structure [8, 9, 10]. Recent experimental progress has demonstrated that an amorphous form of bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3), which is a well-studied TI in crystalline form, can have surface states that are visible in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and appear similar to those in the crystalline case.[1, 11] It is natural to ask whether other distinctive features that distinguish the topological insulator state from an ordinary insulator are present in the amorphous case. Aside from fundamental interest, this is of applied importance as amorphous materials can have practical advantages over crystalline ones, such as ready integration with conventional semiconductors. Here we are interested in characterizing a distinct transport phenomenon in an amorphous three-dimensional TI invariant under time-reversal (\mathcal{T}) symmetry. Such a state is characterized by a gapped bulk and a protected gapless surface state. The transport phenomenon we now explain has previously been studied in crystalline TIs[5, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15] and is a distinct, quantitative signature of the topological state. The surface state is modelled by a gapless Dirac fermion. However, if the system assumes the geometry of an infinite cylindrical wire then this mode is no longer protected and a gap emerges. This occurs due to the induced compatible spin structure on the cylindrical surface which encodes a \pi Berry flux and sets the fermion in the Ramond sector, that is, with periodic boundary conditions [16, 4, 17]. This implies that the fermionic modes occur in degenerate pairs while the \mathcal{T} symmetry protects only the parity of the number of surface modes. With these boundary conditions the modes are gapped. The protected gapless mode can be re-established by threading an additional \pi Berry flux through the bulk of the cylinder via a magnetic flux of magnitude h/2e. Such a wire thus exhibits conductance oscillations with period h/e, but with a half-period shift (a \pi phase shift) compared to conventional Aharonov-Bohm oscillations. This is also to be contrasted with the Sharvin-Sharvin [18] type weak localization oscillations of period h/2e [19]. Figure 1: (a) Cuboidal geometry of nano-wire with magnetic flux penetrating the bulk in the length of the wire. (b) The cubic unit cell for diamond used to assemble a crystalline wire. Figure 2: Oscillations of the conductance of the wire with a Fu-Kane-Mele type crystalline Hamiltonian for a sample of 5\times 5\times 40 unit cells with varying flux quanta. In [5], this effect was investigated by considering the effective theory of a 2D Dirac fermion in the presence of a Gaussian surface disorder potential. In Ref [4] a three-dimensional simulation of the effect was done with onsite surface disorder which also shows robustness of the conductance oscillations. The analysis there was done using a recursive Green’s function method. The conductance signal for a crystalline wire is reproduced in Figure 2. Experimentally, the predicted topological version of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations has been observed in topological insulator nanowires [12, 13, 14, 15] and provided a practical way to isolate effects of the topological surface states even when bulk conduction is nonzero, as is the case for most or all 3D TI materials as-grown. Since the bulk of the wire does not respond with the same period to the applied flux (indeed, as a continuous range of periods are present, the bulk contribution does not show regular oscillatory behavior), the oscillations are determined by surface state conduction. Among other generalizations, there is a superconducting version of the \pi-flux effect when the TI nanowire is proximitized by superconducting contacts.[20, 21] Here we investigate this effect for a 3D amorphous system using a scattering transport calculation. We use the geometry of a cuboid which is topologically equivalent to a cylinder as shown in Figure 1. We will start from the Fu-Kane-Mele [22] model for the 3D crystalline TI. Our method is to introduce connectivity defects into the lattice to ‘amorphize’ it. The amorphization procedure we employ locally preserves coordination number. We consider tight-binding models on these structures that have an exponentially decaying hopping amplitude, mimicking the dispersion of inter-atomic bonds. Models in this class conserve local order in the absence of long-range order. This is in contrast with the first models to predict topological phases in amorphous electronic systems, which do not conserve coordination number and construct hoppings between randomly arranged sites using the vector that connects them [9]. We choose to focus on models of the former type because they are more realistic [10] and have been invoked to find exact results on 2D amorphous systems. Results include proof of the persistence of spectral gaps in models of amorphous silicon [23, 24], prediction of a topological phase diagram for amorphous topological insulators [10], and the manifestation of flat band-like degeneracies in amorphous models of a platform relevant to topological photonics experiments [25]. In this work, we numerically investigate a 3D variation on these models hosted on an amorphized diamond structure. We first demonstrate the formation of the Dirac cone for an amorphous system by treating it as a super-cell, that is, imposing periodic boundary conditions in the long direction of the wire (see Figure 4) (henceforth {\bf\hat{z}}) and varying magnetic field. Then we use the Landauer formalism using the python package kwant [26, 27, 28] to find and characterize the conductance signatures of wires of these systems for different connectivity defect densities (as defined in the next section), sizes, and temperatures."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09687v1,"Superposition of plane waves in high spatial dimensions:
from landscape complexity to the deepest minimum value","In this article, we introduce and analyse some statistical properties of a class of models of random landscapes of the form {\cal H}({\bf x})=\frac{\mu}{2}{\bf x}^{2}+\sum_{l=1}^{M}\phi_{l}({\bf k}_{l}% \cdot{\bf x}),\,\,{\bf x}\in\mathbb{R}^{N},\,\,\mu>0 where both the functions \phi_{l}(z) and vectors {\bf k}_{l} are random. An important example of such landscape describes superposition of M plane waves with random amplitudes, directions of the wavevectors, and phases, further confined by a parabolic potential of curvature \mu. Our main efforts are directed towards analysing the landscape features in the limit N\to\infty,M\to\infty keeping \alpha=M/N finite. In such a limit we find (i) the rates of asymptotic exponential growth with N of the mean number of all critical points and of local minima known as the annealed complexities and (ii) the expression for the mean value of the deepest landscape minimum (the ground-state energy). In particular, for the latter we derive the Parisi-like optimisation functional and analyse conditions for the optimiser to reflect various phases for different values of \mu and \alpha: replica-symmetric, one-step and full replica symmetry broken, as well as criteria for continuous, Gardner and random first order transitions between different phases.","High-dimensional random landscapes play a central role in the description of many complex systems, ranging from spin-glasses to non-convex optimisation problems underlying inference and machine learning models, all the way to modelling biological fitness, see [1] for a review on this subject and further references. One of the central questions associated to these landscapes is to describe properties of its global minimum, also frequently called in the spin glass context the ground-state energy, and developing methods and/or algorithms to reach the ground-state configuration. Recent years have seen phenomenal progress in obtaining accurate approximate solutions of such problems via machine-learning algorithms, whose use has now become widespread. A detailed description of the arrangement and properties of critical points (maxima, minima and saddles) as well as understanding statistics of the ground state and associated Hessians in the simplest models of random landscapes already provided a deeper understanding of such non-convex optimisation problems and helped to create efficient algorithms, see [2, 3] for discussions of recent developments. A large body of literature in theoretical physics as well as in mathematics has been devoted in recent years to studying these questions in the framework of a few simple models, mainly with Gaussian disorder. Obviously, adding to the pool of analytically tractable models is of considerable interest both to get closer to realistic situations and to investigate questions of universality. In this article, we will analyse both the mean ground-state energy and the problem of counting the number of critical points and local minima for random landscapes {\cal H}({\bf x}) of a particular form {\cal H}({\bf x})=\frac{\mu}{2}{\bf x}^{2}+\sum_{l=1}^{M}\phi_{l}({\bf k}_{l}% \cdot{\bf x}),\,\,\mu>0 (1) defined on a continuous configuration space {\bf x}\in\mathbb{R}^{N}. Here the disordered part is the sum of M random stationary processes \phi_{l}(z) with zero mean \mathbb{E}\left[\phi_{l}(z)\right]=0, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) for different l, whose statistical properties remain invariant with respect to translations in the argument z\to z+a for any real shift a. Two explicit particular examples of such functions \phi_{l}(z) are described in more detail below, and we frequently concentrate on them in our exposition, but most of the obtained results remain valid for a larger class of functions satisfying the assumption of stationarity. 1. Our first example corresponds to Gaussian-distributed stationary random processes \phi_{l}(z) with zero mean, all the statistical properties being therefore controlled by the covariance, which is assumed to be of the form \mathbb{E}_{\phi}\left[\phi_{l}(z)\phi_{m}(z^{\prime})\right]=\delta_{lm}R% \left(|z-z^{\prime}|\right)\;,\;\;R(w)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{dq}{2\pi}% \tilde{R}(|q|)\cos(qw)\;. (2) Realisations of such random functions are most conveniently generated via introducing its Fourier transform \phi_{l}(z)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{dq}{2\pi}\,\left[u_{l}(q)\cos(qz)+v_{% l}(q)\sin(qz)\right] (3) with Gaussian-distributed delta-correlated Fourier coefficients \mathbb{E}\left[u_{l}(q_{1})u_{m}(q_{2})\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[v_{l}(q_{1})v_% {m}(q_{2})\right]=2\pi\delta_{lm}\tilde{R}(|q_{1}|)\delta(q_{1}+q_{2})\;,\;\;% \mathbb{E}\left[u_{l}(q_{1})v_{m}(q_{2})\right]=0\;. (4) One of the simplest representative of this class is the process \phi_{l}(z)=u_{l}\cos(z)+v_{l}\sin(z)\;, (5) where u_{l},v_{l} are i.i.d. standard real normal random variables (with zero mean and unit variance). In this particular case characterized by the covariance \mathbb{E}\left[\phi(z)\phi(z^{\prime})\right]=\cos(z-z^{\prime}) some properties of the arising random landscape Eqs.(1), notably its expected number of critical points, have been investigated in our earlier paper [4]. 2. Another class of random functions considered in our present paper corresponds to random fields explicitly constructed as \phi_{l}(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\gamma^{(n)}_{l}\cos\left(n\left(z+\theta^{(n)}% _{l}\right)\right)\;, (6) with phases \theta^{(n)}_{l}’s that are i.i.d. random variables for different n, uniformly distributed over [0,2\pi), which ensures stationarity of the process. The random amplitudes \gamma^{(n)}_{l} are independent of the phases \theta^{(n)}_{l}, independent between different n, and can be drawn from any distributions with a finite value of \mathbb{E}\left[\left|\phi_{l}(z)\right|\right]<\infty. Every realization of such processes is obviously 2\pi-periodic. The simplest example of such periodic random functions corresponds to including only the first harmonic (n=1) in the above sum \phi_{l}(z)=\gamma_{l}\cos(z+\theta_{l})\;. (7) Note that choosing in (7) \gamma_{l}>0 with the probability density p(\gamma_{l})=\gamma_{l}e^{-\frac{\gamma^{2}_{l}}{2}} makes this case equivalent to (5). In Eq. (1) the random functions \phi_{l}(z) are evaluated at random argument values z_{l}={\bf k}_{l}\cdot{\bf x} where {\bf k}_{l}’s are wavevectors taken either as i.i.d. random vectors uniformly sampled on the sphere \sqrt{N}{\cal S}_{N-1} or, alternatively, as vectors with N i.i.d. normally distributed entries, each with zero mean value and variance 1/N. It is worth noting that the random potential built by superposition of \phi_{l}(z) described in (7) has an interesting connection to the context of semiclassical chaos. In the latter framework one may consider a Riemannian manifold {\cal D} with strongly chaotic classical flow, and exploit the so-called Berry’s conjecture[5] for the eigenfunctions of the associated quantum Laplacian -\Delta\psi_{n}({\bf x})=E_{n}\,\psi_{n}({\bf x})\;,\;\;{\bf x}\in{\cal D}% \subset\mathbb{R}^{N}\;, (8) where \Delta is the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator together with appropriate boundary conditions. For the case of Euclidean space the latter is the usual Laplacian and the eigenfunctions can be expressed as a sum over plane waves with fixed length of the wave vectors: \psi_{n}({\bf x})=\sum_{l}\gamma_{l}\cos({\bf k}_{n,l}\cdot{\bf x}+\theta_{l})% \;,\;\;{\bf k}_{n,l}^{2}=E_{n}\;. (9) According to Berry such eigenfunctions for high enough eigenvalues E_{n} should be described in the form Eq. (9) with i.i.d. Gaussian amplitudes \gamma_{l} and taking the wavevectors {\bf k}_{n,l} independent and randomly equidistributed over the unit sphere of radius \sqrt{E_{n}}. The random part of the potential defined in Eq. (1) is then identical with a specific realisation of such semi-classical chaotic wave-function \psi_{n}({\bf x}), considering the number of contributing wavevectors to be essentially infinite: M=\infty. In that context the problem of analysing statistics of minima, maxima and saddles of arising wavefunctions and closely related random fields on two-dimensional manifolds N=2, as well as of topology of the associated nodal set was intensively studied over the years both in mathematical [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] as well as physical (see e.g. [11]) literature. The statistics of the height of the global maximum for such eigenfunctions has been addressed in that context as well [12]. In the present paper we analyse not dissimilar questions employing however a somewhat different limit N,M\to\infty\;,\;\;{\rm with}\;\;\alpha=\frac{M}{N}=O(1)\;. (10) Although we do not pursue this line explicitly in the paper, we believe some of our results may still be relevant for statistical properties of the chaotic semi-classical wave-functions on high-dimensional manifolds, after interpreting the parameter \mu as the inverse squared radius of the domain occupied by the wavefunction and further considering \alpha\to\infty. Whether our results for finite \alpha may still have some meaning in the context of semiclassical quantum chaos on high-dimensional manifolds remains an interesting open question. To put our research in a proper context let us recall that random potential landscapes of the form Eq. (1) but with random part replaced with a Gaussian-distributed function V({\bf x}) with zero average \mathbb{E}\left[V({\bf x})\right]=0 and covariance of the form \mathbb{E}\left[V({\bf x}_{1})V({\bf x}_{2})\right]=N\,F\left(\frac{({\bf x}_{% 1}-{\bf x}_{2})^{2}}{2N}\right)\; (11) have been attracting much of attention in the disordered systems’ literature since the 90’s as a toy model for an elastic manifold of zero internal dimension placed in a random potential. Its dynamical properties [13, 14], thermodynamic properties [15, 16, 17, 18, 19], the number of critical points [20, 21] and Hessian spectrum at the ground state [22] have all been studied extensively in the physical literature, predominantly by the heuristic replica approach. The rigorous mathematical studies of the toy model as well as its extensions to elastic manifolds of finite internal dimension have been very recently developed in greater generality as well[23, 24, 25, 26]. Most importantly, it has been established that this class of random landscapes displays a glass-like ergodicity breaking transition which translates into many observables of these disordered systems. The perhaps simplest characterisation for this transition is obtained by computing the so-called ""annealed complexity"" of critical points, defined in the high-dimensional limit N\to\infty as \Sigma_{\rm tot}(\mu)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\ln\mathbb{E}\left[{\cal N}_% {\rm tot}\right]\;, (12) where {\cal N}_{\rm tot} denotes the total number of stationary points of the random landscape. The topology trivialisation transition [20, 21, 27, 28] describes the transition in the number of critical points from exponential in N to sub-exponential beyond a critical value of the control parameters (in the present model its role is played by the curvature parameter \mu). The true location of the ergodicity breaking/topology trivialization transition should however be obtained from the point of vanishing of the associated quenched complexity, defined instead as \Xi_{\rm tot}(\mu)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1}{N}\ln{\cal N}_{% \rm tot}\right] and thus upper-bounded by the annealed complexity. Although in general the quenched and annealed complexities are expected to differ, they nevertheless were found to coincide in a few cases of the models of not dissimilar nature, see [29, 30]. Similar annealed complexities can be computed for the number of minima [31], as well as for critical points of any index conditioned on the height of the landscape, see [32, 33]. The latter is especially important as it allowed to relate the annealed complexities computations to the properties of the ground state, the ultimate goal of optimisation problems. An alternative characterisation of the ergodicity breaking transition in the landscape paradigm can be obtained by computing the mean (which is simultaneously typical) value of the ground-state energy e_{0}=\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\min_{{\bf x}}{\cal H}({\bf x})=\lim_{N\to%"
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09208v1,Spatial localization and diffusion of Dirac particles and waves induced by random temporal medium variations,"We investigate the consequences of temporal reflection on wave propagation and transformation in systems governed by a pseudospin-1/2 Dirac equation. These systems are spatially uniform but are subject to random temporal variations in mass, which correspond to the energy gap between the Dirac cones. By employing the invariant imbedding method on two complementary random models, we accurately compute all moments of temporal reflectance and derive their analytical expressions in short- and long-time regimes. In the long-time regime, the reflectance probability density is a constant equal to one, indicating uniform probability for any reflectance value. The group velocity of the wave decays to zero with time, signifying spatial localization induced by temporal variations. Numerical simulations of a wave pulse show that the initially narrow pulse evolves into a precisely Gaussian shape over time. In the long-time regime, the pulse center exhibits spatial localization, while its width shows ordinary diffusive behavior, increasing without limit. This behavior is universal, persisting regardless of the initial pulse shape or the probability distribution of the random mass. Our findings suggest that insulating behavior can be induced in Dirac materials by random temporal variations of the medium parameters. We discuss the possibilities of verifying our predictions in various experimental systems.","When waves encounter spatial variations in medium properties, as described by second-order differential equations in space, they may scatter at spatial boundaries, producing backward-propagating waves. Now, consider a wave propagating through a medium undergoing temporal variations. Even when the medium is spatially uniform, the wave can scatter backward if it follows second-order differential equations in time, such as those describing electromagnetic (EM), acoustic, and water waves [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Given the causality of time, these scattered waves travel in the opposite spatial direction. Although this phenomenon, known as temporal reflection, has long been recognized, there is currently a significant resurgence of interest in the propagation of waves in time-varying media [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. This renewed interest is primarily driven by the motivation to develop innovative methods for controlling wave-matter interactions and creating versatile active metamaterials. Many wave phenomena observed in spatially modulated systems find counterparts in temporally modulated cases. For instance, media with periodic temporal variations can exhibit a momentum gap [18, 19, 20]. Waves within this gap display exponential energy growth over time, contrasting with the exponential attenuation shown by waves within the frequency gap of spatially periodic media. The present paper focuses on the influence of random temporal variations on wave propagation, a subject recently explored for EM and water waves by several research groups [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. In these studies, there is a consistent observation that wave energy increases exponentially over time. Theoretical investigations of EM waves have revealed a vanishing group velocity, indicating spatial localization akin to Anderson localization in spatially random media. Furthermore, the probability distribution of wave energy has been demonstrated to follow a log-normal distribution after a sufficiently long time [21, 22]. Despite extensive studies of classical waves in time-varying media, research on analogous problems for quantum wave equations has been rare [26]. One of the main reasons for this rarity is that the Schrödinger equation is of first order in time and does not exhibit any temporal reflection effect. In our recent study, we investigated the propagation of waves governed by a generalized pseudospin-1/2 Dirac equation in the presence of various time-varying perturbations [27]. These systems are effectively governed by a wave equation with a second-order derivative in time and exhibit a temporal reflection effect. Intriguingly, we demonstrated that momentum gaps do not appear in such systems under periodic temporal variations. Additionally, unlike EM waves, we established that exponential growth of total wave energy does not occur under any temporal variation. Our primary objective in this work is to investigate the propagation and transformation of Dirac particles and waves under random temporal variations. Specifically, we explore cases in which the mass energy, governing the gap between the upper and lower Dirac cones, varies randomly over time. We analyze two complementary models using the invariant imbedding method (IIM) [28, 29]. This method enables us to calculate all moments of the temporal reflectance, the probability density of the reflectance, and the spatial distribution of the wave fields in a numerically precise manner. Our findings reveal that the group velocity for plane waves and pulses decreases exponentially over time, indicating spatial localization. We derive analytical forms for all reflectance moments in short- and long-time regimes. Notably, we observe that in both regimes, the probability distributions follow the beta distribution, with the long-time regime demonstrating that the probability density is a constant equal to 1. This implies that the reflectance can take any value between 0 and 1 with equal probability. Furthermore, we investigate the propagation of wave pulses with a nonzero central wave vector and finite pulse width through random temporal mass variations. Our findings reveal that the initially narrow pulse undergoes shape changes over time, transforming into a precisely Gaussian-shaped pulse. This pulse is a superposition of forward- and backward-propagating Gaussian pulses of identical shape. In the long-time regime, the pulse center exhibits spatial localization, while the pulse width displays diffusive behavior and increases without limit. This universal behavior persists irrespective of the initial pulse shape or the probability distribution of the random mass. Our results can be directly tested through experiments on EM and acoustic waves in metamaterials designed specifically to exhibit Dirac-type dispersion [30, 31, 32, 33]. In electronic systems that exhibit Dirac-type dispersion, such as graphene [34, 35, 36, 37], our findings indicate a fascinating phenomenon: insulating behavior, characterized by vanishing current and conductance, can be induced solely through the application of random temporal variations."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09067v1,Critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces,"The critical states of disordered systems are intriguing subjects within the realm of condensed matter physics and complex systems. These states manifest in materials where disorder plays a significant role, and are distinguished by their multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, accurately characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we argue that critical states exhibit a certain invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both domains. More specifically, it is expected that typical physical quantities characterizing critical states, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, should exhibit invariance in both position space and momentum space. Subsequent numerical simulations validate the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.","The concept of critical states Critical in various physical systems pertains to the behaviors and characteristics exhibited during phase transitions or as they approach critical points. The examination of critical states provides profound insights into the nature of order, disorder, and collective behavior across diverse disciplines Sachdev1 . These states are fundamental for comprehending a wide range of phenomena in statistical physics Critical0 , condensed matter physics Critical1 , and complex systems Critical2 . As a defining feature of critical phenomena Critical3 , fluctuations in critical states become correlated over large distances, with the system demonstrating self-similar behavior at different scales. Critical fluctuations have been observed in various systems, including phase transitions in ferromagnets-antiferromagnets Critical4 , percolation thresholds in complex networks Critical5 , and photonic quasicrystals photonic . As research continues to advance, the exploration of critical states holds promise for unveiling new phenomena and deepening our understanding of complex systems. Recently, significant advancements have been achieved in the investigation of critical states of wave functions, specifically focusing on critical states of quantum disordered systems Liu-self-duality ; Li1 ; Li2 ; You ; g1 ; g2 ; zhou ; Biddle ; Zhang ; Chen ; q1 ; q2 ; q3 ; q4 ; q5 ; q6 ; q7 ; q8 ; Yao1 ; Yao2 ; cai ; Slager ; SSHQ ; gg3 ; gg4 ; gg5 ; gg6 ; gg7 ; gg8 ; gg0 ; gg9 . Novel concepts and phenomena such as anomalous mobility edges Liu-Anomalous , the utilization of renormalization groups for critical states RG1 ; RG2 , real eigenvalues determined through recursion of eigenstates Liu-Real1 ; Liu-Real2 , critical states induced by coupling of two chains twochain , and critical states of two-dimensional quasicrystals Duncan are continuously emerging. Nevertheless, the primary challenge in comprehending critical states lies in determining the conditions under which they arise and accurately characterizing them. Bohr’s complementarity principle MQM provides us with inspiration to bridge this gap. According to the complementarity principle, it is impossible to simultaneously observe the wave nature and particle nature of matter under different representations, such as position space and momentum space. Matter exhibits different properties in these representations. The relationship between position space and momentum space is primarily established through the Fourier transform; position space serves as a mathematical framework for describing the location of particles or objects in physical space, while momentum space is perceived as the duality of position space QM . The critical state can be considered as a third state in addition to particle and wave properties, thus it can be reasonably inferred that the critical state may exhibit some invariance in both position space and momentum space. Figure 1: (Color online) (a) and (b) demonstrate an application of Bohr’s complementarity principle, showing that a localized state in position space must be delocalized in momentum space, and vice versa for an extended state. (c) and (d) illustrate that critical states can simultaneously exhibit delocalization, multifractality, and self-similarity in both position space and momentum space. Based on this duality perception, Liu and Xia propose an explicit criterion Liu-Critical for precisely characterizing critical states. They assert that the Lyapunov exponents of critical states should simultaneously be 0 in both position space and momentum space. The criterion definitively distinguishes critical states from extended and localized states, as the Lyapunov exponents of the latter two are not equal in position space and momentum space. If one exponent is 0, then the dual exponent must be greater than 0. In physics, this also implies that extended and localized states cannot simultaneously exhibit delocalization in position space and momentum space, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a) and (b). In contrast, critical states should demonstrate delocalization, multifractality, and self-similarity in both position space and momentum space, as depicted in Fig. 1(c) and (d). These findings clearly illustrate that critical states maintain a certain kind of invariance across two dual spaces. A natural question arises: can the invariance of the critical state extend beyond the Lyapunov exponent to include other physical quantities in both position and momentum spaces? This study demonstrates that the invariance of the critical state is universal, encompassing various physical quantities such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09388v1,A survey of probabilistic generative frameworks for molecular simulations,"Generative artificial intelligence is now a widely used tool in molecular science. Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: Neural Spline Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) Neural Spline Flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) Conditional Flow Matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models appears the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib9 peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.","In recent years, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to produce convincing images, text, audio, and videoRombach et al. (2022a); Achiam et al. (2023); Ho et al. (2022). The domain of applicability of generative AI has recently extended to the molecular sciences Tiwary et al. (2024), where generative AI has demonstrated the ability to predict protein tertiary structure from amino acid sequence Zheng et al. (2024); Jumper et al. (2021); Abramson et al. (2024); Krishna et al. (2024), protein-ligand complex tertiary structure from chemical identity Qiao et al. (2024); Corso et al. (2022) and the temperature dependence of the equilibrium distribution of solvated molecular systems Noé et al. (2018); Wang et al. (2022); Herron et al. (2023). While these methods differ in many aspects, all generative models share the common goal of sampling from an unknown underlying probability distribution based on an empirical dataset. While there are many classes of generative models, recently, probabilistic generative models have seen widespread usage. These models represent a framework that broadly encompasses flow-based Dinh et al. (2016); Tong et al. (2023a) and diffusion modelsSong et al. (2021). The probabilistic generative framework explicitly seeks to directly model the data distribution through a series of invertible transformations (in flow-based models) or by iteratively refining noisy samples back into data space (in diffusion models), providing a flexible method for generating new data points that obey the underlying distribution of the observed data. There is now a range of probabilistic generative models for use in different domains. Arguably, the most popular ones include Neural spline FlowsDurkan et al. (2019) (NS) models, Conditional Flow MatchingLipman et al. (2022a) (CFM) models, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic ModelsHo et al. (2020) (DDPM). All of these have already been used for exciting and novel applications, including sound field reconstruction Karakonstantis et al. (2024) (NS), zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis Kim et al. (2023) (CFM), and medical image segmentation Guo et al. (2023) (DDPM), demonstrating the utility of probabilistic generative models across different modalities. We describe these methods in Section III. However, the scientific literature in this field lacks a systematic comparison of these methods for benchmark problems with tunable complexities that could establish the conditions under which one particular framework out of NS, CFM, and DDPM might be advantageous. This is particularly true for applications to molecular systems. In this work, we address this gap by carefully applying NS, CFM, and DDPM to different benchmark systems. We realize that the field is moving extremely quickly, with new variants of flow and diffusion methods appearing regularly. In this vein, we expect that the datasets used here will serve as useful benchmarks for these new methods. Our systems include a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and an explicit water molecular dynamics trajectory for the Aib9 peptide Mehdi et al. (2022); Botan et al. (2007), where we collect information on the \{\Phi,\Psi\}_{i} dihedral angles for all 9 residues. For the Gaussian mixture model dataset, we are interested in how generative model accuracy scales with data dimensionality and with training dataset size and which model best estimates probability density differences between asymmetric modes in the training dataset. We also measure sample generation speed and model network size as data dimensionality varies. For Aib9, we are interested in model performance on molecular dynamics data at varying levels of complexity, which we tune by looking at different residues within the peptide. We also examine model accuracy in the low training data limit for the Aib9 dataset. Overall, our findings are: • NS exhibits superior performance estimating probability density differences. However, NS accuracy decreases for high-dimensional data. • CFM displays the highest accuracy at high dimensionality but diminished performance in the presence of complex, multiple modes. • DDPM most accurately models the complex, multimodal Aib9 dihedral angle distribution. However, DDPM is less accurate than other methods at high data dimensionality."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09309v1,A Krylov space approach to Singular Value Decomposition in non-Hermitian systems,"We propose a novel tridiagonalization approach for non-Hermitian random matrices and Hamiltonians using singular value decomposition (SVD). This technique leverages the real and non-negative nature of singular values, bypassing the complex eigenvalues typically found in non-Hermitian systems. We analyze the tridiagonal elements, namely the Lanczos coefficients and the associated Krylov (spread) complexity, appropriately defined through the SVD, across several examples including Ginibre ensembles and the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We demonstrate that in chaotic cases, the complexity exhibits a distinct peak due to the repulsion between singular values, a feature absent in integrable cases. Using our approach, we analytically compute the Krylov complexity for two-dimensional non-Hermitian random matrices within a subset of non-Hermitian symmetry classes including time-reversal, time-reversal†, chiral, and sublattice symmetry.","Although chaos is well-understood in classical systems, its definition in the quantum domain remains elusive, often relying on statistical correlations amongst the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H describing the system Haake (1991); Bohigas et al. (1984); Wigner (1955); Dyson (1962); Oganesyan and Huse (2007); Atas et al. (2013); Brézin and Hikami (1997); Cotler et al. (2017); del Campo et al. (2017). The eigenvalues E_{i} are obtained by standard diagonalization H=W\Lambda W^{\dagger}, where W is a unitary and \Lambda=\mathrm{diag}(E_{1},\cdots,E_{n}). Instead of diagonalization, it is often useful to consider tridiagonalizing the Hamiltonians, as an efficient alternative. This approach has two clear advantages. First, finding the eigenvalues through tridiagonalization is substantially faster, as demonstrated by the seminal work of Dumitriu and Edelman Dumitriu and Edelman (2002) in random matrix theory (RMT) Mehta (1991). Second, from a physics perspective, utilizing powerful recursion methods, this approach broadly aims to ‘reduce practically any problem to one dimension’, with a chain model represented by a Hamiltonian where only nearest-neighbor interactions are present Viswanath and Müller (2008). For Hermitian systems, tridiagonalization can be achieved as H=P\Lambda_{h}P^{\dagger}, where P is unitary and \Lambda_{h} is a tridiagonal matrix whose eigenvalues are identical to those of H. The tridiagonal matrix elements, known as the Lanczos coefficients, are straightforwardly obtained in the Krylov space approach Lanczos (1950); Viswanath and Müller (2008). These coefficients describe hopping amplitudes in a chain known as the Krylov chain 1d Krylov chain and are crucial for revealing how the eigenvalue correlations manifest in early and late-time dynamics of complex quantum systems. Understanding these dynamics for unitary evolution has been at the forefront of active research in recent years Parker et al. (2019); Barbón et al. (2019); Dymarsky and Gorsky (2020); Jian et al. (2021); Rabinovici et al. (2021); Cao (2021); Dymarsky and Smolkin (2021); Kar et al. (2022); Caputa et al. (2022); Rabinovici et al. (2022); Balasubramanian et al. (2022); Hörnedal et al. (2022); Bhattacharjee et al. (2022a, b); Balasubramanian et al. (2023a); Avdoshkin et al. (2024); Erdmenger et al. (2023); Craps et al. (2024a); Balasubramanian et al. (2023b); see Nandy et al. (2024a) for a comprehensive review. In certain scenarios, for instance, for a system interacting with a dissipative environment, the Hermiticity condition must be relaxed. Such a system is described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, leading to entirely new dynamics in Krylov space Bhattacharya et al. (2022); Liu et al. (2023); Bhattacharjee et al. (2023); Bhattacharya et al. (2023); Srivatsa and von Keyserlingk (2024); Bhattacharjee et al. (2024); Beetar et al. (2024); Bhattacharya et al. (2024a); Carolan et al. (2024); Bhattacharya et al. (2024b). Due to non-Hermiticity, the eigenvalues become complex and are distributed in the complex plane. This results in two-dimensional level statistics Mehta (1991); Hamazaki et al. (2020); Sá et al. (2020); Li et al. (2021). In such cases, the underlying physics often becomes obscure due to, for example, the cubic level repulsion irrespective of the universality classes Grobe and Haake (1989); Oas (1997); Hamazaki et al. (2020). Additionally, the parametrization in a two-dimensional plane Sá et al. (2020), the use of complex time coordinates in temporal evolution Li et al. (2021), and finite-size rescalings make the analysis challenging Luo et al. (2021). To address this, Ref. Kawabata et al. (2023a) proposed to consider the statistics of singular values of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian instead of its complex eigenvalues. Singular values are real and non-negative, simplifying the corresponding statistics to be one-dimensional. Singular values are derived from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians H=U\Sigma V^{\dagger} (see Table 1), where the unitary matrices U and V^{\dagger} are formed by the orthonormal eigenvectors of HH^{\dagger} and H^{\dagger}H respectively. The elements \sigma_{i} of the diagonal matrix \Sigma=\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_{1},\cdots,\sigma_{n}) are known as the singular values of H. Alternatively, they are equal to the eigenvalues of \sqrt{H^{\dagger}H} or \sqrt{HH^{\dagger}}, obtained by the Hermitization method Feinberg and Zee (1997) which involves embedding the Hamiltonian into a space of twice its original dimension. The singular value statistics have proven to be powerful enough Kawabata et al. (2023a) to probe the 38-fold symmetry classification Kawabata et al. (2019) in non-Hermitian random matrices, extending beyond the Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) tenfold symmetry classification Altland and Zirnbauer (1997) in the Hermitian case. Hamiltonian Diagonalization Tridiagonalization EVD H=H^{\dagger} H=W\Lambda W^{\dagger} H=P\Lambda_{h}P^{\dagger} SVD H\neq H^{\dagger} H=U\Sigma V^{\dagger} {\color[rgb]{0,0,1}\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,1}H=S\,\Sigma_% {h}T^{\dagger}} Table 1: The table illustrates the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) and singular value decomposition (SVD) for Hermitian and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A single unitary matrix suffices to diagonalize or tridiagonalize a Hermitian matrix, while two unitary matrices are required for non-Hermitian cases. The expression highlighted in blue is one of the main results of this paper. Compared to complex spectral statistics, this simplification through SVD allows Hermitian probes to be straightforwardly extended to non-Hermitian settings by substituting eigenvalues with singular values Kawabata et al. (2023a); Roccati et al. (2024); Hamanaka and Kawabata (2024); Nandy et al. (2024b); Tekur et al. (2024). In the Hermitian limit, singular values reduce to the absolute values of the eigenvalues. This raises several intriguing questions: Is it possible to tridiagonalize non-Hermitian Hamiltonians while preserving the singular values, in line with the vision of Dumitriu and Edelman Dumitriu and Edelman (2002)? Can we use this framework to distinguish the dynamics in integrable and quantum chaotic systems in the non-Hermitian case? The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the Krylov space approach to SVD to compute the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity using the singular value spectrum. In Sec. III, we explore three different examples, including Ginibre ensembles and the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and compute the Krylov (spread) complexity in these contexts. We discuss the emergence of the peak and its relation to the repulsion between singular values in the non-Hermitian setting. Section IV discusses the symmetry classification of non-Hermitian random matrices from the perspective of Krylov (spread) complexity, providing analytic examples in two dimensions and numerical results for the non-Hermitian SYK model. We conclude with the summary and a brief outlook in Sec. V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07771v1,Efficiency of energy-consuming random walkers: Variability in energy helps,"Energy considerations can significantly affect the behavior of a population of energy-consuming agents with limited energy budgets, for instance, in the movement process of people in a city. We consider a population of interacting agents with an initial energy budget walking on a graph according to an exploration and return (to home) strategy that is based on the current energy of the person. Each move reduces the available energy depending on the flow of movements and the strength of interactions, and the movement ends when an agent returns home with a negative energy. We observe that a uniform distribution of initial energy budgets results in a larger number of visited sites per consumed energy (efficiency) compared to case that all agents have the same initial energy if return to home is relevant from the beginning of the process. The uniform energy distribution also reduces the amount of uncertainties in the total travel times (entropy production) which is more pronounced when the strength of interactions and exploration play the relevant role in the movement process. That is variability in the energies can help to increase the efficiency and reduce the entropy production specially in presence of strong interactions.","Human everyday activities (e.g., commuting between home and workplace, or shopping) are specific kinds of recurrent diffusion process in which agents travel from one place to another and then return to their starting point after following a trajectory with a number of steps of various lengths Gonzalez ; Scafetta2011 ; Barbosa . An exploration and return (ER) strategy is usually used to model such movements in social and ecological systems song-2010 ; Majumdar2010 ; Benichou2011 ; Pappalardo ; wang2022 . This basic principle has been generalized in many studies to better describe for instance the social, economical, and geometrical aspects of these systems gonzalez-2015 ; vazifeh2021 . In the past few years, the emergence of location tracking devices (e.g., GPS navigator and smart phones), and location-based services (e.g., Foursquare, Yelp checkin and Google places) provides good opportunities to study human mobility patterns at very different spatial and temporal scales gallotti-2012 ; barthelemy-2019 ; bettencourt-2021 ; batty-2021 ; gonzalez-2022 : from mobility of individuals inside a city to mobility and transportation in an entire country Chowel ; Brockmann ; Vespignani ; gonzalez-2023 . As a consequence, important progresses have been made from reconstruction of population density, mobility patterns and flows Phithakkitnukoon ; Kitamura ; Peng , traffic forecasting and urban planning Nagel ; Wang ; Rozenfeld , marketing campaign and prediction of epidemics Fibich ; Pastor-Satorras , to designing of mobile network protocols Chaintreau . Efficiency of structure and dynamical processes is essential to maintain a sustainable system like a city horner-2002 ; newman-2006 ; dong-2016 ; latora-2018 ; indaco-2019 ; barthelemy-2022 . However, the majority of research on this subject have focused on simulating the statistical characteristics of human mobility, such as displacement and gyration radius. We know that energy, used by human body or vehicle, plays a key role in transportation and other forms of social activities Kolbl ; boyer-2009 ; Wang22 . It has been observed that the average travel times for different transportation modes (e.g. walking, cycling, bus, or car travel) are inversely proportional to the (physiological) energy consumption rates measured for the respective physical activities Kolbl . Interestingly, when daily travel-time distributions of different transport modes are appropriately scaled, they turn out to have a universal functional relationship Kolbl ; kolbl-2021 . In this work we are going to investigate the effects of energy consumption and limited energy budgets on a measure of efficiency and entropy production in a movement process which is based on the ER strategy. We see how constraints on energy budgets can influence the movements of these interacting and energy consuming agents, for instance resulting in a subdiffusion regime. In particular, we are interested in the efficiency of such a movement process and its relation to a measure of entropy or uncertainty production in such a process indaco-2020 ; indaco-2021 . We study the number of distinct locations visited by a person per the consumed energy. A greater number of demands are expected to be fulfilled during an urban exploration when a larger number of distinct sites are visited. A reasonable definition of efficiency should also take into account the energy consumed by the agent in this process. Additionally, we are interested in the uncertainty in the travel times which is generated by interactions between the agents. Smaller uncertainties in the travel times are expected to result in a better planning and therefore smaller dissipation. The paper is organized as follows. We start in Sec. II.1 with a definition of the model and the main parameters. In Sec. II.2 we study an effective one-dimensional model and write a master equation in the continuum limit which can easily be generalized to higher dimensions. A naive mean-field approximation to the equation is presented and the results are compared with the exact solutions of the master equation in one dimension. Section II.3 is devoted to the numerical simulations of the model in two dimensions. Concluding remarks are given in Sec. III."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07829v1,NVU view on energy polydisperse Lennard-Jones systems,"Lennard-Jones (LJ) systems exhibit strikingly invariant structure and dynamics when energy polydispersity is introduced [Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 2837 (2023)]. For instance, at a given state point the radial distribution function and the mean-square displacement as a function of time are virtually unaffected by energy polydispersity, which is in contrast to what happens when size polydispersity is introduced. We here argue – and validate by simulations of up to 30% polydispersity – that this invariance reflects an approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy hypersurface. NVU dynamics is defined as geodesic motion at constant potential energy; because this dynamics is equivalent to Newtonian dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy hypersurface implies virtually the same structure and dynamics of energy polydisperse LJ systems as for the single-component version. In contrast, the constant-potential-energy hypersurface is shown to be significantly affected by the introduction of size polydispersity.","The term polydispersity is typically used for models characterized by a continuous distribution of parameters in the interaction potentials. This is relevant for describing the jamming of granular media, e.g., sand, which can be modeled by introducing a distribution of particle sizes Dickinson (1978); Salacuse and Stell (1982); Frenkel et al. (1986); Evans (1999); Weeks et al. (2000); Fasolo and Sollich (2003); Abraham et al. (2008); Ballesta et al. (2008); Nguyen et al. (2014); Ingebrigtsen and Tanaka (2015). Polydispersity is also relevant in the modeling of glass-forming liquids by allowing for fast equilibration via swap dynamics Ninarello et al. (2017). Size polydispersity is typically introduced via a distribution of the size parameter of the pair potential. If the “size” of particle i is \sigma_{i}, the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rule states that the interaction with particle j involves the length parameter (\sigma_{i}+\sigma_{j})/2 Allen and Tildesley (1987). While size polydispersity is most commonly studied Dickinson (1978); Salacuse and Stell (1982); Gualtieri et al. (1982); Kofke and Glandt (1986); Evans (1999); Auer and Frenkel (2001); Fasolo and Sollich (2003); Wilding and Sollich (2005); Abraham et al. (2008); Ballesta et al. (2008); Jacobs and Frenkel (2013); Sarkar et al. (2013); Nguyen et al. (2014), a few publications have investigated the effects of energy polydispersity Shagolsem and Rabin (2016a); Ingebrigtsen and Tanaka (2016); Shagolsem and Rabin (2016b); Ingebrigtsen and Dyre (2023). Using the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rule for energies Allen and Tildesley (1987), Refs. Shagolsem and Rabin, 2016a and Shagolsem and Rabin, 2016b studied energy-polydisperse Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids in 2d and found only very small differences at a given thermodynamic state point between the average properties of polydisperse systems and those of the single-component LJ fluid with the same average interaction energy. This was recently confirmed in a study of 3d energy-polydisperse LJ mixtures, demonstrating virtually invariant structure and dynamics when varying the degree of polydispersity Ingebrigtsen and Dyre (2023). Energy-polydispersity invariance is robust; thus Ref. Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, 2023 demonstrated that, except for the case of extreme energy polydispersity, the invariance property is maintained when varying the state point, the mixing rule, the energy probability distribution, or the pair potential. The question we address in this paper is: Why does the introduction of energy polydispersity not affect the structure and dynamics to any significant degree? Before proceeding we note that the above-mentioned findings are consistent with the prediction of the so-called conformal solution theory Gubbins (2013) based on the idea that a mixture may be represented by a single-component liquid Mansoori (1993); Shell et al. (2006). This does not work well for size polydispersity, however Pond et al. (2011). According to the van der Waals mixing rule of conformal solution theory, the energy parameter of the one-component fluid representing the mixture is the average of the ij particle interaction energies \langle\varepsilon_{ij}\rangle. For the box distribution of particle energies \varepsilon_{i} studied in Ref. Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, 2023 this results in an average close to that obtained from the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rule (and identical if one uses a linear energy-mixing rule, which also leads to invariant physics Ingebrigtsen and Dyre (2023)). In order to throw light on the energy-polydispersity invariance of structure and dynamics this paper adopts an NVU point of view. NVU dynamics replaces Newton’s second law by Newton’s first law – the law of inertia – by considering geodesic motion on the constant-potential-energy hypersurface in 3N dimensions where N is the number of particles Ingebrigtsen et al. (2011a, b). In the thermodynamic limit (N\to\infty) this gives rise to a time evolution that result in the same structure and dynamics as standard Newtonian dynamics Ingebrigtsen et al. (2011a, b). In fact, when NVU dynamics is discretized for numerical implementation, this leads to the leap-frog algorithm with a varying time step the relative fluctuations of which go to zero for N\to\infty Ingebrigtsen et al. (2011b). The conjecture investigated in this paper is that energy-polydisperse LJ mixtures have approximately the same constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces as those of the single-component LJ system. If validated, this would explain the observed invariance of structure and dynamics upon the introduction of energy polydispersity. Figure 1: Average structure and dynamics of LJ systems of different energy polydispersity at the state point \left(\rho,T\right)=(0.85,0.70), which is close to the triple point of the single-component LJ system. (a) shows the average radial distribution function (RDF), g(r), for polydispersities up to 40%. (b) shows the average incoherent intermediate scattering function, F_{s}(q,t), where the solid lines represent data for the wave vector of the first peak of the static structure factor of the monodisperse system (q=7.2) while the dashed lines represent data for the wave vector corresponding to the box length (q=0.19). For both structure and dynamics we find results that are virtually independent of the degree of polydispersity. These findings confirm those of Ref. Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, 2023."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07646v1,Quantum combinatorial optimization beyond the variational paradigm: simple schedules for hard problems,"Advances in quantum algorithms suggest a tentative scaling advantage on certain combinatorial optimization problems. Recent work, however, has also reinforced the idea that barren plateaus render variational algorithms ineffective on large Hilbert spaces. Hence, finding annealing protocols by variation ultimately appears to be difficult. Similarly, the adiabatic theorem fails on hard problem instances with first-order quantum phase transitions. Here, we show how to use the spin coherent-state path integral to shape the geometry of quantum adiabatic evolution, leading to annealing protocols at polynomial overhead that provide orders-of-magnitude improvements in the probability to measure optimal solutions, relative to linear protocols. These improvements are not obtained on a controllable toy problem but on randomly generated hard instances (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and Maximum 2-Satisfiability), making them generic and robust. Our method works for large systems and may thus be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art quantum devices.","One of the current challenges for quantum combinatorial optimization presents itself like this: on one hand, even if there is a mild polynomial advantage of quantum algorithms over the best classical ones [1, 2], higher operating costs might still render this practically unviable. On the other hand, though it may take a fault-tolerant quantum computer to achieve, the prospect of having a “universal sampler”, capable of discovering unlikely low-energy states, is rather fascinating. Granted, we know that in worst-case scenarios, this will be exponentially unlikely [3, 4]. Still, it is simply not clear if there is an intermediate hardness regime where a quantum device could be capable of sometimes finding solutions that no other method can. This leads to a simple question: Are there ways to systematically increase the likelihood of optimal solutions? In this work, we present one such method. Progress in the use of large-scale quantum annealers [5] suggests that it might be possible to approach quantum advantage on certain types of combinatorial optimization problems [6]. Similar perspectives have been given in the context of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) [7, 8, 9]; multistage quantum walks, in turn, have been shown to be able to outperform the QAOA in certain cases [10]. All of these results, however, are put in perspective by recent investigations showing that noise effectively truncates quantum circuits to logarithmic depth [11]; it also rules out exponential speed-ups in expectation-value estimation [12]. Recent work has also reinforced the idea that the barren-plateau phenomenon will render variational quantum algorithms ineffective on large Hilbert spaces [13, 14]. Hence, finding useful variational annealing protocols (digital or analog) for quantum combinatorial optimization appears to be difficult. Naturally, one could in theory always reach the ground state thanks to the existence of the adiabatic theorem, were it not for the fact that, once again, hard problem instances, which are characterized by first-order quantum phase transitions [3], will require impractically long annealing times. While diabatic strategies, such as excitation followed by return to the ground state [15] or adiabatic gauge potentials [16], are known to sometimes help at least for small systems or short evolution times, respectively, it seems improbable that such effects will persist for large Hilbert spaces with complex energy landscapes. If we accept the outlook that optimal schedules for large, hard instances cannot be reached in practice, again the question becomes if there are other methods [17, 18] to obtain schedules that increase the likelihood of obtaining low-energy states. Our main contribution to the questions we have raised is the following. By combining the geometric approach to adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) [19] with the spin coherent-state path integral for quantum spin glasses [20, 21, 22], we show in detail how semi-classical observables can be used to systematically derive “adaptive” annealing schedules at \mathrm{poly}(N) overhead, where N is the problem size. Such schedules can lead to orders-of-magnitude improvements in the AQC probability P to observe the optimal solution of a given problem instance. We work with two established hard-instance data sets: one for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model as used in Ref. [22], the other for Maximum 2-Satisfiability (MAX 2-SAT) as introduced earlier by Shor et al. [15]. On the latter data, we improve the geometric mean success probability across all instances from 0.01\% in the linear-schedule case to 3.1\% with our method; for single instances, the improvement can reach more than four orders of magnitude (cf. section V.3). For the SK model, we find that our schedules are close to the “ideal” ones derived from the exact adiabatic bottleneck. We emphasize two points: First, the improvements we see are not obtained on a specific controllable toy problem, but on randomly generated hard instances of two different problems, which leads us to expect that these improvements are more generic and robust than could be deduced from the former. Second, our method works for large system sizes without modification, which means it is ready to be used to improve the results of state-of-the-art quantum devices with larger numbers of qubits. This article is organized as follows. After defining our framework for quantum optimization in section II alongside our semi-classical theory, we show how to combine it with the geometric approach to AQC in section III. The two data sets of hard instances to which these methods will be applied are then briefly described in section IV, after which we present our results in section V, followed by concluding remarks in section VI. All problem instances and the corresponding results are publicly available [23]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07388v1,"Firing Rate Models as Associative Memory: 
Excitatory-Inhibitory Balance for Robust Retrieval","Firing rate models are dynamical systems widely used in applied and theoretical neuroscience to describe local cortical dynamics in neuronal populations. By providing a macroscopic perspective of neuronal activity, these models are essential for investigating oscillatory phenomena, chaotic behavior, and associative memory processes. Despite their widespread use, the application of firing rate models to associative memory networks has received limited mathematical exploration, and most existing studies are focused on specific models. Conversely, well-established associative memory designs, such as Hopfield networks, lack key biologically-relevant features intrinsic to firing rate models, including positivity and interpretable synaptic matrices that reflect excitatory and inhibitory interactions. To address this gap, we propose a general framework that ensures the emergence of re-scaled memory patterns as stable equilibria in the firing rate dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the conditions under which the memories are locally and globally asymptotically stable, providing insights into constructing biologically-plausible and robust systems for associative memory retrieval.","The modelling of associative memory processes began in the early 1970’s and 1980’s with the mathematical formalization of Amari (Amari, 1972, 1977) and of Grossberg (Grossberg, 1983) and the elegant and explicit construction of Hopfield (Hopfield, 1982, 1984). The authors drew inspiration from the early successes of statistical physics in the description of glassy phenomena (Sherrington & Kirkpatrick, 1975; Mezard, Parisi & Virasoro, 1987), leveraging the average properties of simple interconnected units. The key idea was to define a network of neuron-like computational units, similar to those studied by McCulloch and Pitts (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943), and investigate memory retrieval as emergent processes. Within this context, the authors conceptualized associative memory networks as dynamical systems defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) having as stable equilibrium points the memory patterns to retrieve. The first key contribution was the definition of a Lyapunov function for the associative memory system that ensured global asymptotic convergence to the equilibria of the system. Thus, any initial condition for the system would lie in the basin of attraction of one of these equilibria, and the system trajectory will inevitably evolve towards it. The second key contribution was the explicit definition of the set of memory vectors as binary patterns taking values in \{-1,+1\}, analogously to ferromagnets in spin glasses. The binary representation of the memory vectors allowed for the explicit design of a synaptic matrix, that ensured the system’s equilibria precisely matched the intended memories. The effective combination of the two key contributions has catalyzed a wealth of subsequent research, both analytical and numerical, focusing on the fundamental properties of associative memory systems. Notably, many authors have studied the storage capacity (Amit, Gutfreund & Sompolinsky, 1987a, b; McEliece et al., 1987; Petritis, 1995) of associative memory systems, that is the maximum number of memories that can be stored in the synaptic matrix without compromising their stability. Subsequent works (Tsodyks & Feigel’man, 1988; Treves, 1990; Amit & Tsodyks, 1991) have extended beyond the binary spin structure proposed by Hopfield, enabling binary positive activations \{0,1\} and low levels of neural activity. These works retain the dynamic framework initially proposed by Grossberg and Hopfield, hereafter referred to as voltage equations, but apply non-negative activation functions to yield neuron firing rates. While positive activations allow interpreting synaptic matrix components as excitatory or inhibitory, the relationship between voltages and firing rates remains arbitrary and highly dependent on network parameters. This limitation has led associative memory researchers to explore models that directly connect empirically measurable quantities, like firing rates, with one another. Parallel to the advancements in the modeling of associative memory networks, detailed biophysical models of cortical circuits have received an increasing amount of attention due to their capability of generating synthetic data of EEG recordings, thus providing insight to experimentalists on the roots of the measured quantities. Beginning with the groundbreaking description of the neuron biochemical response by Hodgkin and Huxley (Hodgkin & Huxley, 1952), the characterization of neuronal properties by means of dynamical systems has become ever more pervasive. In the beginning, the mathematical characterization of neurons and neural processes focused on the extensive treatment of the microscopic properties, such as gating and diffusion of ions, and branched into the well known FitzHugh-Nagumo (FitzHugh, 1961) and Morris-Lecar (Morris & Lecar, 1981) models. However, the mathematical complexity of these models, combined with the computational limitations, constrained researchers to small-scale studies involving only a handful of neurons. To address these challenges, substantial efforts were devoted to the derivation of simplified mathematical models amenable to analytical treatment and large scale simulation. This effort led to the establishment of the class of models widely known as Integrate-and-Fire (Bresslof & Coombes, 2000; Brunel, 2000; Burkitt, 2006a, b). Despite their utility, using Integrate-and-Fire models for memory retrieval remains challenging due to the hybrid nature of their dynamics, switching between continuous dynamics and a hard reset to a given initial condition. The key idea for the formulation of biologically plausible associative memory systems was to consider an Integrate-and-Fire model and to average neural spikes over fixed time windows to derive a rate of firing (Ermentrout & Terman, 2010; Gerstner, 2014) for the neuron. The core of the newly proposed biologically plausible model, referred to as the firing rate model, lies in its use of a non-negative activation function that directly processes firing rates rather than membrane voltages. This approach effectively links two empirical observables across clusters of neurons. Despite its potential importance for neuroscience, designing firing rate systems—such as synaptic matrices and activation functions—so that specific memories appear as locally stable equilibria remains an underexplored area (Dayan & Abbott, 2005, Section 7.4). The primary contributions of this paper are (i) the design of a synaptic matrix that encodes memories as equilibrium points within the firing rate system, applicable to arbitrary activation functions, and (ii) an analysis of both local and global stability, building upon and expanding the foundational work presented in (Dayan & Abbott, 2005, Section 7.4). Specifically, we present a method to design a synaptic matrix of the firing rate model that guarantees the retrieval of a rescaled version of the prototypical memories. These prototypical memories are assumed to be equally sparse and equally correlated binary vectors, meaning that they share a common number of ones and of overlapping entries. In particular, our first theorem states the necessary and sufficient conditions that ensure the existence of the rescaled prototypical memories as equilibrium points for the firing rate dynamics. The proposed construction admits a biological interpretation of the synaptic components in terms of excitation, inhibition, and homeostatic regulation. Moreover, we frame the canonical prescription of Dayan & Abbott (Dayan & Abbott, 2005, Section 7.4) as a special case of our synaptic matrix construction. Additionally, we show that the emergence of “anti-memories” is possible only for pathological cases reducible to the use of Hopfield-type synaptic matrix, and explore the existence of spurious equilibria, particularly homogeneous ones. The second theorem goes on to establish sufficient conditions for the local asymptotic stability of the rescaled prototypical memories and, leveraging results from Grossberg (Grossberg, 1983) and Hopfield (Hopfield, 1984), we proceed by defining an energy function to analyze the global behavior of trajectories. Finally, we investigate numerically the tightness of these stability conditions and visualize the energy landscapes for two relevant examples. Notably, simulations reveal how the choice of a negative homeostatic strength results in wider stability regions over the space of parameters, compatibly with the canonical sign choice for the homeostatic term found in the literature. To enhance readability, the proofs of the technical results are deferred to the Appendix. Notation: We let n×m denote the set of n\times m matrices with real entries. The symbol \mathbbold{1}_{n} indicates an n-dimensional vectors of ones and I_{n} the n\times n identity matrix. Given a matrix A\in{}^{n\times m}, A^{\top} is the transpose of A. For a symmetric matrix A=A^{\top}, we write A\succ 0 (A\succeq 0) if A is positive definite (positive semidefinite, respectively). Moreover for two symmetric matrices A,B, we write A\succ B (A\succeq B) if A-B\succ 0 (A-B\succeq 0). Given a vector x\in{}^{n}, \mathrm{diag}(x) is the diagonal matrix with the entries of x as diagonal entries. If f(x) is a real-valued function, f^{\prime}(x) denotes the derivative of f. A function is weakly increasing if f(x_{1})\leq f(x_{2}) for all x_{1},x_{2}\in\real with x_{1}<x_{2} and strictly increasing if f(x_{1})<f(x_{2}) for all x_{1},x_{2}\in\real with x_{1}<x_{2}."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07319v1,Unsupervised Machine Learning Phase Classification for Falicov-Kimball Model,"We apply various unsupervised machine learning methods for phase classification to investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model in two dimensions. Using only particle occupation snapshots from Monte Carlo simulations as input, each technique, including a straightforward classification based on principal component analysis (PCA), successfully identifies the phase boundary between ordered and disordered phases, independent of the type of phase transition. Remarkably, these techniques also distinguish between the weakly localized and Anderson-localized regimes within the disordered phase, accurately identifying their crossover, which is a challenging task for standard methods. Among the machine learning approaches used, PCA based analysis outperforms more complex methods, such as neural network predictors and autoencoders. These results underscore the effectiveness of simple unsupervised techniques in examining phase transitions and electron localization in complex correlated systems.","Strongly correlated electron systems are renowned for rich phase diagrams. Due to their complicated nature, it is not uncommon for new phases to be identified in materials or even simple models that have already been investigated for decades. Often, the information about the new phase was already present in the old data, but conventional analysis may have overlooked it. In recent years, a promising solution to this problem has emerged through the application of unsupervised and preferably interpretable machine learning (ML) methods [1, 2, 3]. These techniques can autonomously explore a vast parameter space and identify regions exhibiting distinct features, effectively highlighting potential novel phases. Using well-established physical criteria, researchers can then rigorously analyze the properties of these parameter regions. However, despite the tremendous progress in this field, the methods are still in development. The ever-growing repertoire of techniques presents exciting opportunities, but their applicability to specific systems and tasks requires rigorous evaluation under controlled conditions. In this respect, the Falicov-Kimball model (FKM) [4, 5] assumes a significant role in the realm of correlated electron systems. The model is accessible to exact methods [6], such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) in the infinite-dimensional limit [7, 8] and sign-problem-free Monte Carlo techniques in finite dimensions [9, 10, 11, 12]. Simultaneously, it has complicated ground-state [13, 14] and finite-temperature [15, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18] phase diagrams, details of which are still in debate. FKM is routinely used for the investigation of a multitude of phenomena. For example, it has been applied in its several variations for the description of metal-insulator and valence transitions [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], formation of inhomogeneous charge and spin orderings [30, 31, 32, 33, 15, 14, 12, 34], ferroelectricity [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41], cold atoms in optical lattices [42, 43, 44, 45], transport through layered systems [46, 47, 48, 49, 50] and other non-equilibrium phenomena [8, 51, 52]. Crucial is also its role in the development and benchmarking of new methods for strongly correlated systems [53, 7, 8, 10, 12, 54]. In recent years, these include ML techniques of various kinds. Artificial neural network techniques have been used to boost the equilibrium [55, 56] as well as kinetic [57] Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of FKM. Fully interpretable unsupervised prediction-based methods built on deep learning, as well as on physically motivated mean-based strategies, have recently been introduced for the rich ground-state phase diagram of the FKM [58] and have paved the way for more general strategies [59]. Recently, Richter-Laskowska et al. [60] applied the Learning by Confusion (LbC) approach to investigate the critical temperature T_{c} between the ordered and the disordered phases of the half-filled spinless FKM. The authors have found that T_{c} is correctly determined by LbC only in the case of a continuous phase transition that takes place in the regime of medium and strong electron correlations. For a discontinuous phase transition, there is a large ambiguity. Arnold et al. [61] subsequently proposed a possible remedy to this problem, based on a modified indicator of phase transition. However, as we show in our work, several unsupervised techniques, some of which are simpler than LbC, can locate the correct position of the phase boundary between the ordered and the disordered FKM phase regardless of the type of phase transition. The identification of other phase boundaries, which further divide both ordered and disordered regions of the model, proved to be more challenging. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that unsupervised techniques based on principal component analysis (PCA) [62, 63] and to the same extent also the prediction-based method and autoencoder-based classification can automatically distinguish the weakly localized bad metal regime and the Anderson-localized insulator regime and locate their crossover. This is important because the problem of electron localization in two-dimensional systems is notoriously difficult to analyse [64, 65]. Considering the long history of FKM, this crossover was identified only recently. Its existence in finite-sized systems was proven by Antipov et. al [66] via investigation of the energy-resolved inverse participation ratio (IPR) and conductivity. Yet, unsupervised ML techniques can pinpoint this crossover directly from the particle occupation snapshots. These results highlight the potential of straightforward unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify phase transitions and address electron localization in correlated electron systems. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Sect. II.1 we introduce the spinless FKM at half-filling and briefly discuss its finite-temperature phase diagram. Sect. II.2 describes the Monte Carlo method used and the details of data production. In Sect. III we present the machine learning methods employed, including classification methods based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Sect. III.1, the prediction-based classifier with neural networks used as predictors in Sect. III.2, and the autoencoder method in Sect. III.3. The results of the corresponding automatically constructed phase diagram are provided in Sect. IV. The main conclusions are summarized in Sect. V. Additional technical details and supporting arguments are deferred to the appendices."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07298v1,Two-stage relaxation of operators through domain wall and magnon dynamics,"The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is a popular probe for quantum information spreading and thermalization. In systems with local interactions, the OTOC defines a characteristic butterfly lightcone that separates a regime unperturbed by chaos from one where time-evolved operators and the OTOC approach equilibrium. This relaxation has been shown to proceed in two stages. The first stage exhibits an extensive timescale and a decay rate known as the “phantom eigenvalue”, which is slower than the gap of the transfer matrix. In this work, we investigate the two-stage relaxation of the OTOC towards its equilibrium value in various local quantum circuits. We apply a systematic framework based on an emergent statistical model, where the dynamics of two single-particle modes – a domain wall and a magnon – govern the decay rates. We show that a configuration with coexisting domain wall and magnon modes generates the phantom rate in the first stage, while competition between these two modes determines the second stage. We also examine this relaxation within the operator cluster picture. The magnon modes translate into a bound state of clusters and the domain wall into a random operator, giving consistent rates. Finally, we extend our findings from random-in-time circuits to a broad class of Floquet models.","Classical chaos is characterized by its extreme sensitivity to the initial conditions, as illustrated by the “butterfly effect”, where small perturbations can lead to dramatically different phase space trajectories. In contrast, the linearity of quantum evolution precludes exponentially diverging trajectories in the full Hilbert space. However, in recent years, one successful probe of quantum chaos has been found in the form of an out-of-time-ordered correlation function (OTOC)larkin_quasiclassical_1969 ; roberts_diagnosing_2015 ; kitaev2015 ; roberts_localized_2015 ; shenker_stringy_2014 , from which a quantum analog of the butterfly effect can be extracted. It has gained traction in studying systems in both high energy and condensed matter physics. In certain holographic systems with black holes, the time scales of OTOCs are used to determine the bulk causal structure roberts_localized_2015 ; shenker_stringy_2014 ; qi_butterfly_2017 ; shenker_black_2014 . The rate at which the commutator increases is shown to be upper-bounded by the inverse temperature of the system maldacena_bound_2016 ; parker_universal_2019 ; murthy_bounds_2019 ; liao_nonlinear_2018 , which is saturated in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, a strongly interacting fermionic system in 0+1 dimension sachdev_gapless_1993 ; sachdev_bekenstein-hawking_2015 ; kitaev2015 . The time scales set by OTOCs and their saturation values are also used to diagnose phases of many-body physics PhysRevB.107.L020202 ; PhysRevB.95.165136 ; PhysRevB.99.224305 ; huang_out–time-ordered_2016 ; fan_out–time-order_2016 ; chen_out–time-order_2016 . More recently, operator spreading has been examined in various random circuit and Hamiltonian models with or without conservation laws hosur_chaos_2016 ; xu_accessing_2018 ; zhou_levy_flight_2020 ; xu_locality_2019 ; Khemani_operator_hydro_2018 ; 2018PRX_Rakovszky ; vonKeyserlingk2018operator ; chen_operator_2018 ; gu_energy_2017 ; nahum2018operator ; lucas_quantum_2019 ; aleiner_microscopic_2016 ; bertini_scrambling_2020-1 , revealing how the relaxation of conserved quantities introduces additional timescales for the spread of quantum chaos. The fundamental mechanism underlying the growth (or decay) of the OTOC is scrambling - the process by which quantum information spreads through interactions. This is often studied in the operator language, by tracking how an initially localized operator grows in time. To understand this precisely, we consider a spin chain and define the OTOC of two initially local operators V and W as the following infinite temperature average \displaystyle\text{OTOC}(x,t)=\langle V(0,t)W(x,0)V(0,t)W(x,0)\rangle (1) where \langle\cdots\rangle=\frac{1}{q^{L}}\rm Tr(...). The operators W at position x and V at position 0 appear in a non-time ordered sequence, hence ’out-of-time-ordered’ correlator. This allows us to compare two quantum states: one first perturbed by W(x,0) then by V(0,t), and another first perturbed by V(0,t) then by W(x,0). At t=0, the local operators W(x,0) and V(0,0) are spatially separated and commute, resulting in identical states. Consequently, \text{OTOC}(x,0) is a time-independent \mathcal{O}(1) constant. However, as the operator V(0,t) evolves and spreads, it ceases to commute with W(x,0), causing the overlap between these differently evolved states to decay. This decrease in overlap quantifies how much the W(x,0) perturbation affects the system when applied before or after V(0,t). The operator V(0,t) typically grows outward at a characteristic “butterfly velocity” v_{B}, making the OTOC a probe of quantum analog of the butterfly effectshenker_black_2014 ; kitaev2015 . The time at which V(0,t) has scrambled sufficiently to cause an \mathcal{O}(1) decrease in the OTOC is known as the scrambling timeshenker_black_2014 ; hosur_chaos_2016 ; susskind_switchbacks_2014 . Figure 1: (a) The OTOC is initially small and experiences a drastic growth at a time \sim x/v_{B}, and then saturates to an equilibrium value. We focus on how it converges to the saturation value after the time scale of \sim x/v_{B}. (b) The OTOC can show two-stage decay with rates r_{1} and r_{2} (r_{1} possibly ¡ r_{2}), where L is the system size. Our work focuses on how the OTOC converges to the steady-state value at long times beyond the initial operator spreading and how the OTOC relaxes to its saturation value. We consider models of local quantum circuits with a well-defined v_{B}. When t\geq\mathcal{O}(x/v_{B}), the operator V(0,t) becomes close to completely random at the location of W(x,0), which gives the saturation value of the OTOC. Interestingly, in a finite system, the relaxation process takes place in two stages, each characterized by different decay rates znidaric_phantom_2023 . In both random and non-random circuits, the relaxation in the first stage does not necessarily follow the gap of the transfer matrix of the OTOC evolution. Instead, the OTOC decays at the rate of “phantom” eigenvalueznidaric_phantom_2023 that lies within the actual gap of the transfer matrix spectrum. The duration of this first stage is characterized by a time scale of L/v_{B}, which indicates a failure to exchange the thermodynamic limits of L\rightarrow\infty and t\rightarrow\infty. The emergence of the phantom eigenvalue and the two-stage decay have also been observed in the relaxation of other quantities, the half-state purity being one of the earliest examples bensa_fastest_2021 ; bensa_purity_2022 ; bensa_two-step_2022 ; jonay_physical_2024 ; znidaric_phantom_2023 ; znidaric_solvable_2022 . To briefly recap, the half-system purity decays exponentially during a quantum quench with local interactions. This is consistent with the linear growth of entanglement entropy before the saturation time \mathcal{O}(L/v_{E}), where v_{E} is the entanglement growth rate. However, after \mathcal{O}(L/v_{E}), the purity can decay at a different rate, which can be slower or faster. In the case when the second stage decay is faster, the first stage decay is precsiely the phantom eigenvalue. Our previous work jonay_physical_2024 also identified a similar transition for the one-point correlation functions (to be discussed in Sec. VI in the cluster picture), as well as the relaxation of entanglement spectra toward its equilibrium distribution. There are generally two approaches for understanding the emergence of the phantom eigenvalue. The first involves the analysis of the pseudo-spectrum of a non-hermitian transfer matrix znidaric_solvable_2022 ; znidaric_phantom_2023 . The left and right eigenstates of a non-hermitian transfer matrix are mutually bi-orthogonal, but they are not necessarily simultaneously normalized. The norm of the left and right eigenvectors can be exponentially large in L but constant in t . The norm remains large when t\ll L, which shadows the true decay before t\sim L/v_{B} and gives rise to a phantom decay. This is an empirical picture explaing the phantom eigenvalue of the purity through the norm of the left and right eigenvector. We adopted a different perspective jonay_physical_2024 and interpret the relaxation rates as the free energies of two emergent modes in the effective purity dynamics - a magnon and a domain wall nahum_quantum_2017 ; zhou_entanglement_2020 ; zhou_nahum_emergent_stat_mech2018 ; vonKeyserlingk2018operator ; jonay2018coarsegrained , (Sec. III.2).This physical fremework precisely predicts the asymptotic rates of both stages and reveals a mechanism of geometric and dynamical nature leading to the rich phenomenology of two-stage thermalization. In this work, we extend our physical theory of two-stage decay to describe the relaxation of the OTOC. We find that the two modes – the domain wall and magnon – are sufficient to capture the trajectories of the system towards its saturation value. Our main result shows that the boundary conditions imposed by the OTOC in the effective model create a scenario where the first stage hosts a coexisting domain wall and magnon mode whose decay rate is a fraction of the magnon rate. The spreading of operators was initially described using the cluster picture, where Pauli strings are represented as expanding clusters under time evolutionnahum2018operator ; vonKeyserlingk2018operator ; nahum_real-time_2022-1 ; chen_operator_2018 ; qi_quantum_2018 ; roberts_operator_2018 . We apply the same framework to understand the relaxation of the OTOC. In this language, what we refer to as a magnon in the spin picture becomes a bound state of clusters whose decay rate can be directly read off from the two-body transfer matrix. Thus, this basis is particularly effective for predicting scenarios where magnon rates dominate. The domain wall corresponds to a random operator that is a superposition of occupied and unoccupied clusters. This viewpoint helps interpret the reverse transition observed in one-point functions. However, since the domain wall represents a superposition of states in the cluster picture, the classical configurations in OTOC relaxation are less intuitive. We conclude that the cluster picture is not a suitable basis when the domain wall dominates.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06843v1,Hidden self-duality in quasiperiodic network models,"Mobility edges (MEs), which separate the extended phases from the localized phases, are one of the most crucial concepts in Anderson localization. In one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, only a few models with exact MEs can be constructed using the generalized self-dual theory, the Avila’s global theory, or the renormalization groups method. Then, an intriguing question is that can we realize much more physical models with exact solvable MEs? Here we uncover the hidden self-duality in a class of quasiperiodic network models constituted by periodic sites and quasiperiodic sites. While the original models do not have self-duality, after integrating out the periodic sites, the effective Hamiltonian with energy dependent potentials will have this duality, yielding MEs. The mosaic models studied in the literature are the simplest quasiperiodic netowork models. For a long time the MEs in these models are believed to come from the absent of self-duality, and we show that they actually come from the hidden self-duality. Finally, we extend this idea to more network models and explicitly determine their exact MEs with the hidden duality. The predictions in these models can be realized using optical and acoustic waveguide arrays and electric circuits in experiments. The new models presented in this work can greatly advance our understanding of MEs in Anderson transition.","References Anderson [1958] P. W.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06732v1,Short-range depinning in the presence of velocity-weakening,"Phenomena including friction and earthquakes are complicated by the joint presence of disorder and non-linear instabilites, such as those triggered by the presence of velocity weakening. In [1], we provided a theory for the nucleation of flow and the magnitude of hysteresis, building on recent results on disorder-free systems described by so called rate-and-state descriptions of the frictional interface, and treating disorder perturbatively. This theory was tested for models of frictional interfaces, where long range elastic interactions are present. Here we test it for short-range depinning, and confirm that (i) nucleation is triggered by avalanches, governed by a critical point at some threshold force f_{c} close to the minimum of the flow curve and that (ii) due to an armouring mechanism by which the elastic manifold displays very little plasticity after a big slip event, very slowly decaying finite size effects dominate the hysteresis magnitude, with an exponent we can relate to other observables.","Elastic interfaces pinned by disorder are found in various systems, including crack fronts in fracture [2], frictional interfaces [3], domain walls in magnets [4, 5], sliding charge density waves [6] or vortex lattices in superconductors [7]. In the absence of temperature, the interface is pinned by impurities, but undergoes a depinning transition [8, 9, 10] at some critical force (or stress, or magnetic field). When inertia is not present, the physics is well-understood: the interface moves via large reorganizations called avalanches, and the velocity of the interface grows above the depinning threshold where it vanishes with some critical exponent. In other systems, such as frictional interface [11, 12], crack fronts in brittle materials [13] or wetting on rough solid surfaces [14, 15], a sufficient inertia or other effects can induce the flow curve to be non-monotonic [16, 17, 18]. Indeed, in the presence of inertial effects, flow generates acoustic waves, that can make it easier to jump over local barriers induced by disorder, in turn accelerating flow. Such positive feedback can lead to velocity-weakening as sketched in Fig. 1a, causing instabilities and stick-slip. How such instabilities are triggered as the force is slowly increased is a central question to various fields, including earthquake science and tribology. Understanding it remains a theoretical challenge, as one needs to deal both with disorder and the presence of non-linear instabilities. This question relates to what controls the magnitude of hysteresis effects apparent when comparing the starting point of the flow upon increasing the applied load to its stopping point upon decreasing it again. At least three scenarios have been proposed for how the depinning transition is affected by inertia: Scenario A: The depinning transition becomes first order as soon as inertia is present. For a finite amount of inertia, motion is triggered by small avalanches, and the hysteresis loop is of finite magnitude in the thermodynamic limit. This picture was obtained by treating inertia as a perturbation around the usual depinning behaviour [19]. It does not occur in mean-field [16] nor in more recent numerical observations [17, 18, 20, 21], where for mild inertial effects evidence of a continuous transition exists. Scenario B: For small inertia, the flow curve is still monotonic with some modified threshold force f_{c}^{\downarrow} [22]. Flow is critical at f_{c}^{\downarrow}, and in the same universality class as when inertia is absent. The hysteresis loop vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, but very slowly, due to a combination of two effects. First, nucleation of flow emerges from rare avalanches exceeding a size \ell_{c}\sim(f-f_{c}^{\downarrow})^{-\tilde{\nu}}, where \tilde{\nu} is a critical exponent characterizing the depinning transition in the absence of inertia. Second, only rare sites can yield under loading after a slip event and trigger an avalanche. Limitations of this approach are the following. Limitation B1: It was supported by an automaton model where inertia is modelled as a brief overshoot of the force change in sites surrounding rearrangements. In [23], it was argued that for more generic automaton models, a finite hysteresis should be present, while flow is still governed by a continuous transition at f_{c}^{\downarrow}. These results indicate the need to go beyond automaton models and model inertia more accurately. Limitation B2: This approach focused on small inertial effects, and did not capture macroscopic velocity weakening. Limitation B3: The nucleation picture could not be tested precisely because in systems of limited size, flow is triggered far from f_{c}^{\downarrow}. Scenario C: In a recent work [1], we addressed these limitations and focused on the case where velocity weakening is present (thus scenario C needs not contradict scenario B, as these could each apply at different levels of inertial effect or damping coefficient). We built on the rate-and-state description of homogeneous frictional interfaces which includes from the start velocity weakening of the interface [24, 25], and treat disorder pertubatively. A result of the rate-and-state literature [26, 27] central to our approach is pictured in Fig. 1: for a pure system, there exists a threshold force f_{c} (very) slightly above the minimum f_{\min} of the flow curve v(f), where a frictional interface can be destabilized and rupture – a result that holds both for short and long-range elastic interactions [27]. In [1], we argued that in the presence of disorder, f_{c} controls nucleation, triggered by avalanches whose extension goes beyond some length: \ell_{c}(f)\sim(f-f_{c})^{-\nu}. (1) The exponent \nu in the presence of velocity-weakening differs from \tilde{\nu} observed in its absence. Nucleation is revealed by a bimodal distribution of event sizes 111 Such a bimodal distribution for earthquakes on a single fault was argued based on seismic data in [28]. , corresponding of both avalanches and system-spanning events, as sketched Fig. 2c. Thus, nucleation from the static phase is controlled by a critical point at f_{c}, as pictured in Fig. 2. In this scenario, there exists a tiny finite hysteresis in the thermodynamic limit because f_{c}>f_{\min}, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The flow regime, by contrast, displays a first order transition when the load is reduced. In this scenario, the hysteresis magnitude displays very slowly decaying finite size effects, for reasons similar to those put forward in scenario B and [22] (except that hysteresis magnitude does not decay to zero as f_{c}>f_{\min}). In particular, after a large slip event, the system is depleted of weak regions about to trigger an avalanche (i.e. “yield”). The density of such regions was argued to vanish at a small local yield threshold x as a power law P(x)\sim x^{\theta^{\prime}} in [29, 30], an effect we called “armouring” of the interface. Such a power-law distribution is refereed to as pseudo-gap in the literature [31, 32]. It leads to a scaling law for the excess hysteresis magnitude as a function of system size. These results were tested in [29, 1] using a finite element model where inertia is treated by actually solving Newton’s equation, and where disorder is modelled with a random potential acting on each element, inspired by a previous model by Jagla [33]. A central idea to test this picture of nucleation was to trigger avalanches at various force levels 222 More precisely, stress levels. [29], as the spontaneous triggering of avalanches under loading around f_{c} is too rare to allow for statistical analysis. These studies focused on long-range interactions, where additional effects (such as “radiation damping”) make this scenario slightly more complicated to test. In the present work, we test scenario C for a one dimensional elastic line pinned by disorder, with short-range elastic interactions. We first verify our prediction on nucleation in Eq. 1, which requires both to access the non-monotonic flow curve, used to extract f_{c} (approximated as f_{\min}), as well as to study the statistics of avalanches artificially triggered at different forces along the stick-slip cycle. Secondly, we confirm our predictions for how the magnitude of the hysteresis cycle depends on system size. Thereto, we combine the avalanche and nucleation properties with the density of regions about to yield, P(x), through the associated pseudo-gap exponent. (a) (b) Figure 1: [Sketch] LABEL:sub@fig:nonmonotic:a When the flow curve (force f vs velocity v) is non-monotonic, with a minimum at f=f_{\min}, there exists a threshold force f_{c} beyond which the static phase is unstable to system-spanning events. LABEL:sub@fig:nonmonotic:b A finite hysteresis is predicted in the thermodynamic limit, such that a system driven quasi-statically through a weak spring displays stick-slip. Thereby, power law distributed avalanches protect the interface from building up a load f>f_{c} where it is unstable. After the instability, the interface unloads to f=f_{\min} while slipping (see corresponding cycle in panel LABEL:sub@fig:nonmonotic:a with the same colour coding). (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 2: [Sketch] (LABEL:sub@fig:pre:flow-LABEL:sub@fig:pre:stick-slip) In a quasi-statically loaded finite system with disorder, avalanches occur as the force increases. They nucleate slip once their extension \ell>\ell_{c}\sim(f-f_{c})^{-\nu} if f>f_{c}. The force at which nucleation occurs fluctuates, we denote by f_{s} its means (and study below how the magnitude of hysteresis \Delta f=f_{s}-f_{c} depends on L). LABEL:sub@fig:pre:bimodal The corresponding distribution of event extensions, P(\ell), during a quasi-static cycle is bimodal, with avalanches up to a scale \ell_{\max}(f_{s}), and system-spanning events (\ell=L). See Appendix B for numerical evidence of bimodality. LABEL:sub@fig:pre:ellc To study the properties of avalanches in an infinite system, and to quantify \ell_{c}, we trigger avalanches at different forces f. The distribution of their linear extension \ell is scale free at f_{c} while at f>f_{c} avalanches transition to system-spanning events if \ell>\ell_{c} (system-spanning events are excluded from the shown distributions)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06124v1,Exploring Structural Nonlinearity in Binary Polariton-Based Neuromorphic Architectures,"This study investigates the performance of a binarized neuromorphic network leveraging polariton dyads, optically excited pairs of interfering polariton condensates within a microcavity to function as binary logic gate neurons. Employing numerical simulations, we explore various neuron configurations, both linear (NAND, NOR) and nonlinear (XNOR), to assess their effectiveness in image classification tasks. We demonstrate that structural nonlinearity, derived from the network’s layout, plays a crucial role in facilitating complex computational tasks, effectively reducing the reliance on the inherent nonlinearity of individual neurons. Our findings suggest that the network’s configuration and the interaction among its elements can emulate the benefits of nonlinearity, thus potentially simplifying the design and manufacturing of neuromorphic systems and enhancing their scalability. This shift in focus from individual neuron properties to network architecture could lead to significant advancements in the efficiency and applicability of neuromorphic computing.","Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have revolutionized data processing by emulating the intricate network of neurons in the human brain, enabling significant advances in fields ranging from robotics to healthcare [1, 2]. These systems process information through interconnected nodes or neurons that can learn to perform complex tasks, leading to improvements in decision-making and pattern recognition technologies. As the demand for these technologies grows, so does the interest in developing various hardware implementations to support them [3]. These hardware platforms include electronic-based systems, which leverage silicon-based technologies, and photonic systems, which exploit the interaction of light and matter to enhance speed and reduce energy consumption [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Another promising option is the use of exciton-polaritons, quasiparticles that combine the properties of light and matter. These are being investigated for their potential in neuromorphic computing, particularly because of their rapid operation times and potentially low power consumption [9, 10]. Each of these platforms aims to offer unique advantages, whether in scalability, speed, or energy efficiency, to meet the growing computational demands of modern ANNs. In light of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for foundational advances that have shaped the modern era of neural networks and machine learning, our exploration into polariton-based neuromorphic architectures gains added relevance. Hopfield’s seminal contributions to the physics of exciton-polaritons [11, 12] and neural network theory [13, 14] have inspired new approaches that blend these fields. This fusion of knowledge is at the heart of our study, underscoring the potential of exciton-polaritons in neuromorphic computing to push the boundaries of processing speeds and the inherent capability for parallel data handling. Binarized neural networks (BNNs) represent a specific approach to enhancing the computational efficiency of artificial neural networks [15, 16, 17]. By simplifying the weights and activations within the network to just two levels, typically 0 and 1, BNNs drastically reduce the computational complexity and memory usage required for neural processing. Although this simplification often results in lower accuracy compared to networks with full-precision weights, BNNs excel in scenarios where speed, power efficiency, and low resource consumption are more critical than achieving the highest possible accuracy, making them well-suited for applications in internet of things, edge computing, and other environments where autonomy and limited resources are key considerations [17, 18, 19]. Binarized neural networks have been effectively realized using exciton-polaritons. In the notable implementation described in Ref. [9], artificial neurons function as XOR gates. The used technique utilizes nonresonant laser pulses, acting as the input signals, to selectively excite spatially localized exciton-polariton condensates, that interact with each other. The resulting output signals vary in energy, reflecting the different combinations of the inputs. This approach has proven successful in pattern recognition tasks, achieving approximately 96% accuracy on the MNIST (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset, a standard benchmark in machine learning for handwritten digit recognition, under noisy conditions using a single-hidden-layer network. The impressive potential of this solution is further underscored by subsequent assessments of its remarkable energy efficiency, as reported in [10]. Nonlinearity is a cornerstone in the operational efficiency of neural networks, essential for executing tasks beyond the scope of linear computational models. This includes distinguishing overlapping data sets or solving inherently complex problems. The nonlinear activation function within each neuron exemplifies this intrinsic nonlinearity, defining how inputs are transformed into outputs in a way that linear operations cannot [20]. Exciton polaritons, known for their pronounced nonlinear properties due to polariton-polariton interactions, are especially valuable in this context. The distinctive nonlinearity of polaritons is the key element that drives the functionality of both continuous-weight networks [5] and binarized neuromorphic systems [9]. Recent research [21, 22, 23, 24] challenge the emphasis traditionally placed on the inherent nonlinearity in individual neurons within neural networks, see also [25, 26]. Studies have demonstrated that nonlinear computations can be realized using purely linear optical systems by adjusting the parameters of these systems. This development underscores that achieving nonlinearity does not necessarily rely on the physical nonlinearity of the system’s components. By encoding inputs as parameters rather than direct signals, a linear system can emulate nonlinear behavior. This approach shifts the focus from the inherent properties of the materials to the configuration of the system itself, which facilitates structural nonlinearity arising from the arrangement and interactions among its components. In our recent paper [27], we have theoretically proposed a binarized neuromorphic network architecture based on a lattice of pairwise coupled exciton polariton condensates. In this geometry, each pair of condensates, referred to as a polariton dyad [28], serves as artificial binary neurons functioning similarly to OR gates. Unlike XOR gate neurons utilized in work [9], the OR operation is linear. Nevertheless, in [27], we demonstrated that our proposed architecture effectively addresses the inherently nonlinear challenge of image classification, exemplified by the recognition tasks in the MNIST dataset. Our current study elucidates the role of structural nonlinearity in solving recognition tasks. We explore the potential for modifying the operation of polariton neurons proposed in [27] to function as both linear (NAND and NOR) and nonlinear (XNOR) gates. Through numerical experiments, we compare the image classification accuracies, allowing us to question whether the significance of inherent nonlinearity, typical of individual computational elements such as neurons, might be overstated."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07233v1,Score-based generative diffusion with “active” correlated noise sources,"Diffusion models exhibit robust generative properties by approximating the underlying distribution of a dataset and synthesizing data by sampling from the approximated distribution. In this work, we explore how the generative performance may be be modulated if noise sources with temporal correlations—akin to those used in the field of active matter—are used for the destruction of the data in the forward process. Our numerical and analytical experiments suggest that the corresponding reverse process may exhibit improved generative properties.","In recent years the scientific and public interest in generative modeling has dramatically increased yang2023diffusion ; sohl2015deep ; ho2020denoising . Generative modeling techniques allow the sampling of complex, high-dimensional distributions from large datasets without explicit knowledge of the distribution’s analytical form. Image, video, and music generation tools such as as DALL-E Ramesh_2021_DALL-E have captured the public attention, while scientific aims have been advanced through new techniques for sampling of molecular structures and conformations to progress drug discovery and bio-informatics bilodeau2022generative ; Wang_Herron_Tiwary_2022 , sampling of Lagrangian turbulence to study fluid mechanics whittaker2024turbulence , and sampling of geological landscapes to study geophysics Lochner_2023_terrain_diffusion , to name just a few examples. Due to their wide-spread popularity, much research effort has been devoted to improving the trainability, evaluation speed, and expressivity of generative models kingma2021variational ; karras2022elucidating ; cao2023exploring ; haas2024discovering ; tzen2019theoretical ; chen2023speed ; phung2023wavelet . Here, we take inspiration from the field of active matter fodor2016far and propose a new variant of generative modeling that provides an orthogonal axis along which to tune hyperparameters and optimize training and sampling efficiency. A broad class of generative models used in many application domains is the class of score-based diffusion models Song_2021_SGM_SDE . In these models, samples from the training dataset are first transformed into multidimensional Gaussian distributions (with variance specified by the hyperparameters of the model) through a process analogous to overdamped Brownian diffusion in a harmonic potential sohl2015deep ; anderson1982reverse . During this “forward” phase, a neural network (NN) is trained to learn the distribution’s score function, which encodes information about how the data samples are progressively transformed into Gaussian white noise. Then, in a reverse-time diffusion process, new samples are constructed by effectively reversing the forward diffusion process using the trained neural network, through trajectories starting from points in the multidimensional Gaussian distribution Song_2021_SGM_SDE . This process, based on standard stochastic calculus techniques with inspiration from non-equilibrium thermodynamics sohl2015deep , is remarkably effective at parameterizing the unknown target distribution from which the training samples are drawn. Combined with machine learning architectures such as U-nets, this approach can produce new samples from a high-dimensional target distributions (e.g., images) that are strikingly similar to the original data biroli2023generative ; biroli2024dynamical . Despite the success of diffusion models, there is little reason a priori to expect that the simplistic setting of overdamped Brownian dynamics provides in all cases the optimal physical model on which to base the diffusion process. Altering the physical model of diffusion can provide a rich and potentially crucial set of hyperparameters, orthogonal to the standard ones such as neural network width, depth, and learning rate, that can allow for improved performance. To this end, some research effort has focused on constructing analogous diffusion models using, for example, critically-damped Langevin dynamics (CLD) dockhorn2021score and even electrodynamics Xu_Liu_Tegmark_Jaakkola_2022 , with promising results. Here, we add to this line of development by basing our physical diffusion process on active matter systems. Specifically, we introduce active (exponentially time-correlated) noise into the forward dynamics of generative diffusion models, replacing the Gaussian white noise. We find that this type of noise, in many cases, leads to better generative properties compared with existing schemes. The correlation time of the active noise represents a new hyperparameter which can be tuned to optimize training and sampling efficiency for different data distributions. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the analytical theory of reverse-time diffusion in the presence of active noise-assisted forward process. In Sec. III we present the various datasets to which we apply our novel diffusion scheme and analyze its performance. Finally, in Sec. IV we propose possible mechanisms through which the correlated noise sources might be helping improve the generative properties of the diffusion process."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07144v1,Autoregressive neural quantum states of Fermi Hubbard models,"Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful ansatz for variational quantum Monte Carlo studies of strongly-correlated systems. Here, we apply recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and autoregressive transformer neural networks to the Fermi-Hubbard and the (non-Hermitian) Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. In both cases, we observe that the convergence of the RNN ansatz is challenged when increasing the interaction strength. We present a physically-motivated and easy-to-implement strategy for improving the optimization, namely, by ramping of the model parameters. Furthermore, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the autoregressive sampling property of both network architectures. For the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model, we identify convergence issues that stem from the autoregressive sampling scheme in combination with the non-Hermitian nature of the model. Our findings provide insights into the challenges of the NQS approach and make the first step towards exploring strongly-correlated electrons using this ansatz.","The Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) describes itinerant, interacting spin-1/2 electrons hopping on a set of spatially localized orbitals. Despite its simplicity, it is paradigmatic for our understanding of electronic correlations in quantum materials in which strong Coulomb interactions play an essential role. Its importance lies in the fact that it accurately captures some of the key characteristics of strongly correlated materials. Numerous phases this model can display have striking similarities to the behaviors observed in a wide range of complex materials [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In recent years, neural network quantum states (NQS) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] have emerged as promising ansatz for variational wave functions. There are several remarkable aspects that make NQS attractive for use in the field of quantum many-body physics. First is the ability of the NQS to capture a wide array of quantum states important to the study of quantum many-body systems [13, 14]. It has been shown that they can encode volume law entangled states [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. The second feature is related to the scaling of computational resources with the system size. The optimization and evaluation of observables in NQS relies on sampling, typically using a Metropolis sampling algorithm, which can become computationally very demanding. Here, we show that autoregressive networks, with normalized wave function amplitudes that allow direct sampling instead of Metropolis sampling, can be very efficient for correlated electron systems. The autoregressive property refers to the use of a chain rule of probabilities to generate a sequence of data elements in which the probability of every element in the sequence depends only on the configuration of the set of elements that came before it. The scaling of the method with the system size can lead to a potentially huge advantage over conventional numerical treatment, such as the exact diagonalization (ED), density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), or quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) [22, 23, 24, 25], which suffer from either exponential scaling or other technical issues arising due to the fermion ‘sign problem’ [26, 27, 28]. Two prominent examples for autoregressive networks are recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [29] and transformer neural networks [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35] (although non-autoregressive versions of transformers are possible, see e.g. [36, 37]). RNNs were initially developed for natural language processing and are generative, i.e., they can be trained to infer the probability distribution of unlabeled data, which can then be used to generate more data. The final joint distribution of configurations in an RNN, P(\sigma), where \sigma represents a configuration in a complete set, is normalized. This is a powerful property; not only can one sample from a trained RNN, but also given a new configuration, the trained RNN can return the associated normalized probability. The same property can be enforced for a transformer neural network by masking out future inputs to the attention mechanism, see e.g. Refs. [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. In a pioneering work [29], Hibat-Allah et. al. showed that ground states of spin models can accurately be represented using a wave function based on an RNN with two output layers for amplitude and phase of the wave function. Namely, samples are drawn from the generative model, the energy is computed and averaged over many samples, and minimized with respect to the parameters of the RNN using the stochastic gradient descent. Weights and biases inside a shared RNN unit are among the quantities that form the optimization parameters. Since then, there have been several notable studies exploring aspects of the use of RNNs in quantum many-body physics, spanning representability, accuracy, performance [38, 39, 40, 41, 42], including through the use of symmetries of the Hamiltonian [43] or more advanced autoregressive architectures such as transformers [44, 32, 33, 34]. Neural network wavefunctions have also been used recently to study itinerant electron models at half-filling and beyond [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 41, 57]. In Ref. [41], the authors use RNNs to represent the ground state of the t-J, t-{XXZ}, and t-{J_{z}} models in one and two spatial dimensions. They present a novel technique for mapping out the dispersion relation of the single hole, complementary to other schemes [58, 59, 60], and show that their results compare well with DMRG. This is accomplished through computing the expectation values of the translation operator for periodic systems. However, they establish that the ground state uncertainties for these models are generally much larger than those for spin models studied previously. Here, we utilize RNNs as a variational ansatz to access the ground state of the FHM. We find that, as expected, a naive application of the technique results in accuracies that are less accurate than in the case of the t-J model. We then introduce a ramping mechanism, in which certain model parameters are gradually tuned from the initial values to the desired final values during the training process, and show that the scheme leads to orders of magnitude improvements in the ground state energy and other observables (this is also known as variational neural annealing [61]). We benchmark our results for the method applied to the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) FHM at half filling and find that the accuracy of ground state properties is generally independent of the system size for the same number of training steps, confirming that the computational resources will indeed grow linearly with system size. We then use the method to study a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in which the tunneling rates to the left and right are unequal [the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model (HNHM)], and discuss the limitations of current RNN architectures for such problems. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present the Fermi-Hubbard model, the observables computed, the details of the RNNs, and the training schemes used. In Sec. III we present our main findings, first for the 1D FHM, second for the 2D FHM, and third for the 1D HNHM. Section IV summarizes our findings and presents an outlook for future studies."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06802v1,Identifying the impact of local connectivity patterns on dynamics in excitatory-inhibitory networks,"Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pair-wise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in excitatory-inhibitory networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix, and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pair-wise motifs. In particular, an over-representation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses, where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.","Circuits of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons are believed to form the fundamental components of information-processing in the brain [1, 2, 3, 4]. Network models of recurrently-connected excitatory and inhibitory units have therefore become an essential tool for understanding neural dynamics and computation. Such models have helped uncover fundamental principles such as the role of excitation-inhibition balance for sustaining irregular activity [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], and the importance of inhibition for stabilizing neural activity [8, 10, 11, 12] and normalizing responses [13]. A phenomenon that has attracted particular attention are paradoxical responses, which refer to situations where an increase in the external input to the inhibitory neurons results in a decrease of their activity because of recurrent interactions [10, 11, 14, 13, 15, 16, 13, 12]. Recent theoretical analyses have argued that such paradoxical responses to external inputs can reveal the dynamical regime of the underlying excitatory-inhibitory network [14, 17, 18], and these insights have been used to interpret experimental measurements of responses to optogenetic perturbations [19, 20, 21]. These seminal theoretical results on excitatory-inhibitory networks however are derived via a key simplifying assumption. In standard models, the strength of the synaptic coupling between any two neurons depends on their types, but is otherwise assumed to be an independent random variable uncorrelated across synapses. This assumption is typically used to reduce a full network to a simpler circuit model that describes how the mean activities of different populations interact through averaged synaptic weights (Fig 1(a,b)). Recent synaptic-resolution experimental datasets from various species and brain areas have however revealed the prevalence of non-trivial connectivity patterns [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. In particular, a recently released dataset from mice and humans [23, 30] reported the prominence of second-order motifs - specific correlations between pairs of synapses, such as reciprocal, chain, convergent, and divergent motifs (Fig 1(c)) - that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections, and highlights the need for a theoretical understanding of the effects of such patterns. While the presence of reciprocal connectivity motifs has been long recognized and examined within network models [29], several studies have found their influence on recurrent dynamics to be relatively modest [31, 30, 32, 33]. Other studies have argued for the importance of several types of synaptic motifs working together to determine statistical properties of network activity, such as average synchrony or correlation among neurons and network-wide dimensionality [34, 35, 32, 30, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. In a general theoretical analysis [35], chain motifs were found to have a dominant role in determining population-averaged responses of networks to their inputs. Nevertheless, the impact of chain motifs on excitation-inhibition balance – including central issues of stability and paradoxical responses – as well as the general interplay among these motifs and structures established by cell-type specific connectivity, remain open and intriguing questions. Figure 1: Schematic of the multi-population network model. (a) The network consists of P populations, each represented by a different color. This population structure defines the statistics of synaptic connectivity. (b) The corresponding connectivity matrix consists of P^{2} blocks. Synaptic weights within each block share identical statistical properties. (c) Four different types of second-order motifs, corresponding to different pair-wise correlations between synaptic weights. (d) A low-rank approximation of the connectivity matrix can integrate both the population structure and the pair-wise motif statistics. In this study, we examine how the interaction between population structure and synaptic motifs influences recurrent dynamics and the presence of paradoxical responses. To this end, we expand a previously introduced theoretical framework that allows us to reduce large networks of multiple populations to a low-dimensional description that incorporates connectivity statistics beyond the mean via a low-rank approximation [33]. Applying this theory to excitatory-inhibitory networks with chain motifs, we demonstrate that these connectivity patterns significantly impact the eigen-spectrum of the connectivity matrix, and thereby the overall recurrent dynamics. Specifically, we found that chain motifs can create strong positive feedback even in inhibition-dominated networks, and are therefore a source of a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical conditions of excitation-inhibition balance. Moreover we show that chain motifs strongly influence the responses of different populations to external inputs, and can control whether the responses are paradoxical or not. These findings highlight the intricacy of the relationship between the responses to inputs and the underlying connectivity, and in particular sound a note of caution for interpreting results of experiments in terms of only average connectivity strengths among E and I cells. This manuscript is organized as follows. Sec. I defines the connectivity and the network model. Sec. II introduces the general theoretical framework based on a low-rank approximation of the connectivity, which allows us to analytically investigate the effects of local motifs, in particular chain and reciprocal motifs, on recurrent dynamics and responses to external inputs. Secs. III and IV apply this theory to fully-connected and sparse excitatory-inhibitory networks with chain motifs. In Sec. III we analyze the influence of chain motifs on the eigenspectra of these models. In Sec. IV, we use these results to study the responses to external inputs and under what condition they are paradoxical. Table 1: List of notations.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06566v1,A Fully Analog Pipeline for Portfolio Optimization,"Portfolio optimization is a ubiquitous problem in financial mathematics that relies on accurate estimates of covariance matrices for asset returns. However, estimates of pairwise covariance could be better and calculating time-sensitive optimal portfolios is energy-intensive for digital computers. We present an energy-efficient, fast, and fully analog pipeline for solving portfolio optimization problems that overcomes these limitations. The analog paradigm leverages the fundamental principles of physics to recover accurate optimal portfolios in a two-step process. Firstly, we utilize equilibrium propagation, an analog alternative to backpropagation, to train linear autoencoder neural networks to calculate low-rank covariance matrices. Then, analog continuous Hopfield networks output the minimum variance portfolio for a given desired expected return. The entire efficient frontier may then be recovered, and an optimal portfolio selected based on risk appetite.","Portfolio optimization involves creating an investment portfolio that balances risk and return. The objective is to allocate assets optimally to maximize expected returns while minimizing risk. Naturally, this problem is of great interest to financial organizations and is pivotal in risk management. However, the problem, formulated by Markowitz’s mean-variance model [1], must be solved in practice. Namely, it is well known that estimates of pairwise covariance between assets are notoriously poor [2]. A large financial company may have hundreds of thousands of assets n covering equities, bonds, derivatives, and more, but with only a small sample of observations over the desired timescale. The samples tend to include significant amounts of noise, distorting the underlying relationships between the assets. The symmetric covariance matrix has n(n+1)/2 total unique terms: n(n-1)/2 pairwise correlations and n variances. Hence, the number of unique terms behaves as \mathcal{O}(n^{2}), which leads to significant potential for an ill-conditioned covariance matrix [3]. To overcome this issue, factor models were introduced that vastly reduce the dimensionality, and thus the number of numerical estimates required [4]. Factor methods produce low-rank covariance matrices that retain only the largest eigenvalues and discard small eigenvalues associated with noise. Despite this development, the computation of optimal portfolios remains energy-intensive as the efficient frontier is mapped out in n dimensions. In high-frequency trading, this becomes a time-sensitive computation as assets are purchased and sold on microsecond timescales, and portfolios must be regularly rebalanced not to exceed risk appetites. Much attention has been focused on portfolio optimization in the high-frequency domain [5, 6, 7], including the use of evolutionary algorithms to update efficient frontiers [8]. By using such fundamental principles as minimizing entropy, energy, and dissipation [9], or, perhaps, incorporating quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement [10], we can advance and surpass the classical computations of these problems. At the forefront of this drive to alternate architectures is the integration of analog, physics-based algorithms and hardware, which involve translating complex optimization problems into universal spin Hamiltonians [11, 12, 13]. Indeed, the mean-variance portfolio optimization framework can be encoded into a Hamiltonian’s coupling strengths with the physical system recovering the Hamiltonian’s ground state, which corresponds to the optimal portfolio solution [14, 15]. Efficient mapping from the original problem description to spin Hamiltonian enables the problem to remain manageable despite increasing complexity [16]. In Section II, we introduce the mean-variance optimization framework for calculating optimal portfolios. Then, in Section III, we show that analog continuous Hopfield networks can solve portfolio optimization problems by evolving to the minimum of an energy function that encodes the problem parameters. In Section IV, we address the issues of estimating pairwise covariance by introducing the low-rank approximation that relies on a low-dimensional latent variable representation. In Section V, we show that calculating such a representation can be done using linear autoencoder neural networks, and in Section VI how these networks can be trained on analog hardware using equilibrium propagation. Section VII brings everything together, starting with raw data observations and working through the entire analog pipeline."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06461v1,A fast transferable method for predicting the glass transition temperature of polymers from chemical structure,"We present a new method that successfully predicts the glass transition temperature T_{\!\textrm{g}} of polymers based on their monomer structure. The model combines ideas from Group Additive Properties (GAP) and Quantitative Structure Property Relationship (QSPR) methods, where GAP (or Group Contributions) assumes that sub-monomer motifs contribute additively to T_{\!\textrm{g}}, and QSPR links T_{\!\textrm{g}} to the physico-chemical properties of the structure through a set of molecular descriptors. This method yields fast and accurate predictions of T_{\!\textrm{g}} for polymers based on chemical motifs outside the data sample, which resolves the main limitation of the GAP approach. Using a genetic algorithm, we show that only two molecular descriptors are necessary to predict T_{\!\textrm{g}} for PAEK polymers. Our QSPR-GAP method is readily transferred to other physical properties, to measures of activity (QSAR), or to different classes of polymers such as conjugated or bio-polymers.","Polymers are remarkably versatile materials, and the combined control of monomer chemistry and chain length allows for superior tuneability of physical properties. As a polymer melt is cooled, the time-scale \tau_{\alpha} characterising its structural (\alpha) relaxation increases dramatically, and in the absence of crystallisation the structure freezes into an amorphous solid, a glass, at the glass transition temperature T_{\!\textrm{g}} [1]. Since molecular motions are controlled by T_{\!\textrm{g}}, this is a key parameter for understanding and predicting material behaviour, and it is thus essential to develop methods for accurately predicting T_{\!\textrm{g}} directly from the chemical structure. For long-chain polymers, T_{\!\textrm{g}} is molecular weight (M) independent [2, 3, 4, 5], but strongly affected both by intramolecular dihedral barriers [6, 7] (chain flexibility) and intermolecular packing effects, both of which are chemistry-specific [5]. Importantly, it has been shown that the \alpha relaxation, which defines T_{\!\textrm{g}}, is linked to relaxations on a relatively ‘local’ sub-monomer length-scale [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], which in turn suggests that models that predict T_{\!\textrm{g}} from monomer structure should be achievable. In this paper we present such a model, and apply it to the poly(aryl ether ketone) (PAEK) family of polymers. Predictive models that relate structure-based properties and T_{\!\textrm{g}}, and are suitable for small data sets with low chemical variability, have been proposed for polymers [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 5, 20, 21]. For instance, an approximate correlation has been found between T_{\!\textrm{g}} and monomer-scale properties such as the molecular weight per conformational (or flexible) degree of freedom of the chain (M_{\phi}) [16, 18, 5, 15, 17], where M_{\phi} captures both chain flexibility and chain bulkiness (reflecting molecular packing). As one example, Schut et al. [18] correlated T_{\!\textrm{g}} with the mass per flexible bond for a data set divided into three polymer classes by introducing flexible groups into both the main chain and the side chains; an out-of-sample mean absolute error (MAE) for T_{\!\textrm{g}} of \lesssim 6\,\textrm{K} (per polymer class) was obtained. In another example, Xie et al. [19] assigned an ad-hoc mobility factor to each atom based on the chemical group it belongs to (e.g., alkyl, phenyl or thiophene). The monomer’s mobility was then averaged over the atomic contributions, followed by a regression of T_{\!\textrm{g}} on the monomer mobility. For a family of 32 conjugated polymers, a RMSE \simeq 13\,\textrm{K} was attained for in-sample T_{\!\textrm{g}} predictions. These methods are easily applicable and intuitive; e.g. by linking a relevant physical property, such as a molecular weight or volume, to each ‘flexible bond’, where ad-hoc rules are often introduced to quantify the influence of different bonds. However, the approaches are typically tailored to specific data sets and are not generalisable to a wider set of polymer structures [20]. Conversely, a more generalisable approach is the so-called group contribution, or group additive properties (GAP) method [22, 23, 24]. It assumes that a polymer property can be expressed by a composition-weighted average over contributions from sub-monomer motifs (fragments). The fragment contributions can be determined directly from data by a linear regression. van Krevelen [24] applied GAP to predict various polymer properties, such as transition temperatures, solubility, mechanical, optical and electrical properties; while Weyland et al. [23] quoted in-sample MAE \simeq 10\,\textrm{K} for predictions of T_{\!\textrm{g}}. Despite their broad applicability, a fundamental flaw of GAP models is that they cannot be used to make predictions for polymers containing fragments outside of the data sample [25, 26, 21]. A method that addresses some shortcomings of GAP models is the so-called quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) approach. QSPR-based methods use molecular descriptors [27, 28], which quantify electronic, topological or geometric properties that are calculated from atomistic representations of molecules. For polymers, QSPR methods are normally applied either to the monomer [21, 29, 25, 30] or to oligomers consisting of a few monomers [31, 32, 33], and statistical or machine learning (ML) techniques are used to determine the relationship between the descriptors and the investigated property (such as T_{\!\textrm{g}}) [34, 35, 30]. For QSPR methods applied to T_{\!\textrm{g}} predictions, RMSEs typically vary from \simeq 4-35\,\textrm{K} [21, 36, 37, 25], depending on the chemical variation within the data set. Models on larger data sets [38, 39], with higher chemical variation, typically yield prediction errors exceeding 25 K [36, 40]. A significant drawback of QSPR models is that accurate descriptor calculations can be computationally costly, especially for large monomers or oligomers. GAP and QSPR methods have usually been applied separately [21, 29, 19, 20]. However, Hopfinger et al. [26] proposed a linear regression-based model for predicting T_{\!\textrm{g}} based on a GAP-like averaging scheme, combined with associating physical properties (conformational entropy and mass) with individual bonds. Inspired by this approach, we suggest extending QSPR methods to a smaller structural scale than the monomer unit, assuming interactions between these sub-monomer motifs negligibly contribute to the property of interest. Here, we resolve the shortcomings of both the GAP and standard QSPR models, by developing a hybrid QSPR-GAP method: a molecule is divided into sub-monomer fragments for which molecular descriptors are calculated, and various linear regression methods are used to link T_{\!\textrm{g}} to the fragment structure. Our approach significantly accelerates the descriptor calculations and addresses the weakness of GAP methods, also providing accurate predictions for polymers containing fragments outside the data sample. We apply our new QSPR-GAP method to a data set of 146 linear homo- and copolymers of poly(aryl ether ketone) (PAEK) – an important class of linear polymers characterised by alternating stiff (aryls such as phenyls or biphenyls) and flexible linker (such as ethers or ketones) moieties, as shown in Fig. 1-A. The properties of PAEK polymers are highly tuneable by varying these moieties, making them suitable for a wide range of applications including smart-phone speakers, electrical insulation, automotive gears, medical implants and aircraft components [41]. To design PAEK polymers with optimised properties for specific applications, reliable structure-property relationships are essential. We use our QSPR-GAP method to predict T_{\!\textrm{g}} from the monomer structure, with an RMSE \simeq 5-12\,\textrm{K} (out-of-sample). In cases where the GAP model is known to fail (i.e., predicting polymers containing fragments outside of the training set), the model makes accurate predictions. Moreover, by identifying the molecular descriptors most important for predicting T_{\!\textrm{g}}, we reach new insights into how local molecular structure relates to the glass transition temperature in polymers. Our findings offer a pathway to predict the properties of highly complex polymer structures using small data sets, thus circumventing the need for more elaborate ML methods, which typically require larger data sets. Our method is readily generalisable to both a wider range of polymer properties (such as mechanical, optical, or electrical properties), and different classes of polymers."
