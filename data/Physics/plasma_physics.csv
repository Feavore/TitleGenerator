https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09270v1,Integrated Data Analysis and Validation,"A major challenge in nuclear fusion research is the coherent combination of data from heterogeneous diagnostics and modelling codes for machine control and safety as well as physics studies. Measured data from different diagnostics often provide information about the same subset of physical parameters. Additionally, information provided by some diagnostics might be needed for the analysis of other diagnostics. A joint analysis of complementary and redundant data allows, e.g., to improve the reliability of parameter estimation, to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of profiles, to obtain synergistic effects, to consider diagnostics interdependencies and to find and resolve data inconsistencies. Physics-based modelling and parameter relationships provide additional information improving the treatment of ill-posed inversion problems. A coherent combination of all kind of available information within a probabilistic framework allows for improved data analysis results.The concept of Integrated Data Analysis (IDA) in the framework of Bayesian probability theory is outlined and contrasted with conventional data analysis. Components of the probabilistic approach are summarized and specific ingredients beneficial for data analysis at fusion devices are discussed.","In present and future fusion devices huge amounts of measurements coming from many diagnostic systems have to be analyzed. The information obtained from these measurements are and will be used for machine control and safety as well as for physics studies. The goal of the Integrated Data Analysis (IDA) method is to integrate measured data and their analyses to optimize information available for plasma operation and physics studies. The measured data from diagnostics providing redundant or complementary information are combined, together with available physics knowledge and modelling information within a probabilistic framework. The Integrated Data Analysis and Validation specialist working group within the International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) Diagnostics Topical Group was founded in the year 2020. It was motivated by the usefulness of IDA applications at present day machines [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The goal of the Integrated Data Analysis and Validation specialist working group is to provide and apply an IDA framework for present and next generation fusion devices such as ITER and DEMO for self-consistent data analysis and validation procedures. A comparison of the concept of IDA with a traditional approach for data analysis, based on the analysis of individual diagnostics data and a subsequent combination of the results, can be found in [14]. IDA in the framework of Bayesian probability theory provides a concept to analyse a coherent combination of measured data from heterogeneous diagnostics and to combine them with physics knowledge and modelling information [15]. Since every piece of information from measurements and modelling are subject to uncertainties, quantification and processing of uncertain information is central to this probabilistic approach. Complex error propagation is obtained automatically combining data in a concise probabilistic one-step analysis. The extended set of measurements and modelling information allows for an improved treatment of ill-posed inversion problems of, e.g., profile reconstruction, tomography or equilibrium reconstruction. Different techniques for measuring the same subset of physical parameters provide complementary and redundant data for, e.g., improving the reliability of physical parameters, increasing the spatial and temporal resolution of profiles, resolving data inconsistencies, and for reducing the ambiguity of parameters to be estimated without employing non-physical constraints. IDA was developed and first applied to reconstruct electron density n_{\textnormal{e}} and temperature T_{\textnormal{e}} profiles from a probabilistic analysis of Thomson scattering (TS) data [16] in combination with interferometry and soft X-ray measurements at the W7-AS stellarator [1]. A corresponding application at the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak includes additionally to the TS and interferometry data also data from electron cyclotron emission (ECE) and the lithium beam (LIB) diagnostic for which an improved forward model was developed [17, 5]. This LIB forward model was additionally used in a probabilistic analysis of the JET LIB diagnostic [4]. At W7-AS, Bayesian graphical models were introduced for integrating diagnostic data analyses [18]. IDA was then applied at ASDEX Upgrade to reconstruct the effective ion charge Z_{\textnormal{eff}} profiles from various charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS) measurements [6]. A non-Maxwellian electron energy distribution function in the positive column of a neon dc-discharge was reconstructed from the visible emission spectrum using IDA [2]. At JET the Bayesian combined analysis of LIDAR, edge LIDAR and interferometry diagnostics provided n_{\textnormal{e}} and T_{\textnormal{e}} profiles [3]. At the TJ-II stellarator the n_{\textnormal{e}} profile was reconstructed in an IDA approach using data from interferometry, reflectometry, TS, and the helium beam [7]. At the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST) reversed field pinch (RFP) the T_{\textnormal{e}} profiles were estimated in the probabilistic framework from a combination of the double-foil soft X-ray system (SXR) and the TS diagnostic [8]. Additionally, at the MST RFP Z_{\textnormal{eff}} profiles were determined by the integration of soft X-ray tomography and charge exchange recombination spectroscopy impurity density measurements [9]. The ion temperature T_{\textnormal{i}} and rotation profiles v_{\textnormal{rot}} were reconstructed at ASDEX Upgrade in a probabilistic integrated approach from various charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS) measurements using Gaussian process regression [11]. Recent Bayesian analyses combining various diagnostics can be found at W7-X [12, 13], at ASDEX Upgrade and JET [10], and the MST RFP [19]. The present paper aims at showing the basic ingredients of Integrated Data Analysis in the Bayesian framework, reviewing the work previously done, and some examples highlighting typical realizations. More details of the implementation of IDA can be found in publications which are cited as appropriate. The references in this paper can not be exhaustive as they should only provide an entrance point for the interested reader. Section 2 compares IDA with a conventional data analysis approach for multiple-diagnostic data analysis and summarizes the main ingredients of IDA: Bayesian probability theory (section 2.1), forward models (2.2), uncertainty quantification (2.3), likelihoods (2.4), prior information (2.5), parameterization (2.6), methods for parameter and uncertainty estimation (2.7), validation (2.8) and numerical implementation (2.9). Section 3 addresses the ITER Integrated Modelling & Analysis Suite (IMAS) for physics modelling and data analysis as a standardized way to access and process data. Section 4 shows examples applying IDA to obtain synergistic effects (4.1), profile reconstruction (4.2), equilibrium reconstruction (4.3) and velocity-space tomography (4.4). Section 5 summarises."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09232v1,Spectrally Accelerated Edge and Scrape-Off Layer Gyrokinetic Turbulence Simulations,"This paper presents the first gyrokinetic (GK) simulations of edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) turbulence accelerated by a velocity-space spectral approach in the full-f GK code GENE-X. Building upon the original grid velocity-space discretization, we derive and implement a new spectral formulation and verify the numerical implementation using the method of manufactured solution. We conduct a series of spectral turbulence simulations focusing on the TCV-X21 reference case [Oliveira D. S. et al., Nucl. Fusion 62, 096001 (2022)] and compare these results with previously validated grid simulations [Ulbl P. et al., Phys. Plasmas 30, 107986 (2023)]. This shows that the spectral approach reproduces the outboard midplane (OMP) profiles (density, temperature, and radial electric field), dominated by trapped electron mode (TEM) turbulence, with excellent agreement and significantly lower velocity-space resolution. Thus, the spectral approach reduces the computational cost by at least an order of magnitude, achieving a speed-up of approximately 50 for the TCV-X21 case. This enables high-fidelity GK simulations to be performed within a few days on modern CPU-based supercomputers for medium-sized devices and establishes GENE-X as a powerful tool for studying edge and SOL turbulence, moving towards reactor-relevant devices like ITER.","Predicting turbulent transport in the edge and SOL regions is crucial to optimize fusion reactor performance, predict the divertor heat load, understand the L- to H-mode confinement transition, and design future magnetic confinement fusion devices, such as ITER [1] and DEMO [2]. Despite significant recent advancements in turbulent transport modeling [3], widely-used reduced turbulent transport (e.g., quasilinear) models and Braginskii-fluid simulations often fail to accurately capture edge and SOL turbulent transport due to, for instance, the importance of non-local effects and the fact that the edge is only marginally collisional. Therefore, because of the peculiar properties of the edge and SOL region, high-fidelity gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence simulations are necessary to overcome these difficulties and describe turbulent transport accurately. While global [4, 5, 6] and local [7, 8, 9] GK codes for core turbulence are well-established, GK turbulence codes for the edge and SOL region remain less mature. One of the main reasons for this is (i) the lack of a clear separation between fluctuations and equilibrium quantities requiring a full-f GK formalism and (ii) the complex magnetic geometry featuring open and closed field lines and X-points, which poses significant numerical challenges. In addressing this latter complexity, Braginskii-fluid turbulence codes such as GBS [10], TOKAM3X [11], and GRILLIX [12] have pioneered SOL turbulence, where the high-collisional assumption might be justified, in arbitrary magnetic configurations. Notably, the flux-coordinate independent (FCI) approach [13, 14], implemented in the GRILLIX fluid code [12, 15], has demonstrated promising performance in simulating turbulence in large devices [16], with flexible magnetic geometries [17]. Building on the experience gained from the GENE code [7, 4] and the flexibility of the FCI method, the GENE-X code [18] has been specifically designed to perform high-fidelity and high-performance GK turbulence simulations of the edge and SOL region with X-points. GENE-X is a full-f GK code, i.e., it does not split the distribution function between an equilibrium and fluctuating parts. More precisely, GENE-X solves the full-f electromagnetic and collisional GK Vlasov-Maxwell system and belongs to the continuum category of GK codes, where an Eulerian grid approach is utilized to discretize the velocity-space. Currently, GENE-X is one of the few GK codes able to perform edge and SOL turbulence with magnetic X-points. Among the other existing full-f GK codes designed for edge and SOL applications, we can cite GKEYLL [19] and PICLS [20], which focus on either open and closed the open-field line region, and XGC [21, 22] and COGENT [23], which can also include magnetic X-points. The GENE-X code has been validated against attached L-mode experiments in medium-sized devices such as in the ASDEX Upgrade [24] and TCV tokamak [25]. These validations demonstrate that GENE-X can provide predictions close to experimental measurements (e.g., OMP profiles, power balance, and divertor fall of length) in L-mode conditions. For instance, in the TCV-X21 reference case (L-mode discharge designed for code validation [26]), the GENE-X simulations have revealed the importance of the collisional cooling of trapped electrons in the edge to recover the correct electron temperature OMP profile within the experimental uncertainty, a kinetic mechanism that Braginskii-like fluid codes fail to capture due to the absence of trapped particles in these models. Despite these promising and encouraging results, the significant computational requirements of these first-principles grid GK simulations hinders the ability of GENE-X to simulate edge and SOL turbulence in reactor-relevant devices (such as ITER) and to explore high-performance and advanced experimental scenarios. Even for medium-sized devices, simulations frequently require several million CPU hours and span over several weeks to complete [24, 25]. Although GPUs and exascale HPC architectures offer potential, new numerical algorithms are needed to accelerate high-fidelity GK simulations. This paper presents the first implementation of a spectral approach in velocity-space in a full-f GK turbulence code such as GENE-X. The use of a spectral method is motivated by the fact that it can be particularly advantageous at high collisionality (e.g., in the SOL). The spectral method used in this work is based on a spectral expansion of the full-f distribution function onto a Hermite and Laguerre polynomial basis in velocity-space. Using this basis, we derive and numerically implement the spectral formulation of the edge and SOL GK turbulence model solved in GENE-X. The numerical implementation is verified using the method of manufactured solution (MMS) [27]. We present the first spectrally accelerated GK edge and SOL turbulence simulations of the TCV-X21 reference case using GENE-X. It is noteworthy that the TCV-X21 scenario represents an ideal reference case for assessing the performance of the spectral approach, given that turbulence is dominated by TEMs [25], which can present a challenge for a global velocity-space spectral approach [28]. We compare our spectral results with the ones of Ref. [25] obtained from grid simulations with GENE-X. We find that the spectral approach can reproduce the OMP profiles in both the collisional and collisionless cases, dominated by TEMs, with excellent agreement and with a small number of spectral coefficients. In addition, by further increasing the spectral resolution in our simulations, we demonstrate that the agreement between the grid and spectral results is improved. Finally, the computational cost of the spectral simulations is assessed. We demonstrate that the spectral approach implemented in this work achieves a significant speed-up of CPU-based GK simulations with GENE-X. For the TCV-X21 reference case, a speed-up of nearly 50 times is achieved compared to the previous grid simulations, allowing high-fidelity GK edge and SOL turbulence simulations to be conducted within a few days on current CPU-based supercomputers. This opens up new opportunities for studying edge and SOL turbulence through high-fidelity and high-performance GK simulations, which is crucial for the success of ITER and the design of future fusion power plants. This paper is structured as follows. First, we introduce the GK turbulence model for the edge and SOL used in GENE-X in Section 2. We then present the spectral approach considered in this work and derive the spectral formulation of the GK model in Section 3. The numerical implementation of the spectral approach in GENE-X is detailed in Section 4, while its verification is carried out in Section 5. The first spectrally accelerated turbulence simulations of the TCV-X21 reference case are reported in Section 6, including a comparison with the grid simulations from Ref. [25]. Finally, the performance and computational cost of the spectral simulations are evaluated in Section 7. The conclusions and outlooks are presented in Section 8."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09083v1,Mechanism of generating collisionless shock in magnetized gas plasma driven by laser-ablated target plasma,"Mechanism of generating collisionless shock in magnetized gas plasma driven by laser-ablated target plasma is investigated by using one-dimensional full particle-in-cell simulation. The effect of finite injection time of target plasma, mimicking finite width of laser pulse, is taken into account. It was found that the formation of a seed-shock requires a precursor. The precursor is driven by gyrating ions, and its origin varies depending on the injection time of the target plasma. When the injection time is short, the target plasma entering the gas plasma creates a precursor, otherwise, gas ions reflected by the strong piston effect of the target plasma create a precursor. The precursor compresses the background gas plasma, and subsequently, a compressed seed-shock forms in the gas plasma. The parameter dependence on the formation process and propagation characteristics of the seed-shock was discussed. It was confirmed that the seed-shock propagates through the gas plasma exhibiting behavior similar to the shock front of supercritical shocks.","While collisionless shocks have long been studied as powerful accelerators of cosmic rays, their acceleration mechanisms remain highly complex and largely veiled. Studies of collisionless shocks have traditionally employed various methods such as in-situ and remote observations in space, theoretical modeling, and numerical simulations. Recently, in addition to these methods, efforts to generate magnetized collisionless shocks using high-power laser facilities in laboratory experiments have garnered significant attention Matsukiyo et al. (2022); Yamazaki et al. (2022); Yao et al. (2021); Schaeffer et al. (2019, 2017); Kuramitsu et al. (2016); Schaeffer et al. (2015, 2014); Niemann et al. (2014). Among a number of methods of shock generation, Yamazaki et al. (2022)Yamazaki et al. (2022) and Matsukiyo et al. (2022)Matsukiyo et al. (2022) proposed a method to generate a shock in a homogeneously magnetized ambient gas plasma with uniform Alfvén velocity. In the experiment, a solid aluminum target irradiated with a laser is ablated and a surrounding nitrogen gas filling uniformly an entire chamber is ionized by the strong radiation emitted by the laser-target interaction. The ionized gas plasma initially at rest is uniformly magnetized in sufficiently large volume for a long time by using a Helmholtz-like coil. Although they observed developing shock (seed-shock hereafter), propagating in the gas plasma, detailed formation process of the seed-shock in this system has not been fully understood. The complexity arises from the highly intricate interaction between gas plasma and target plasma. Since it is nearly impossible to separately measure the two plasmas in experiments, comparison with numerical simulations becomes crucial. However, there has not been a well-established computational method that accurately replicates these early-stage shock formations. One commonly used numerical simulation in this field is the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulation (Birdsall and Langdon, 2004). A number of methods of shock generation using the PIC simulation have been proposed so far (e.g. Pongkitiwanichakul et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2021; Moreno et al., 2020; Schaeffer et al., 2020; Dieckmann et al., 2018 and reviewed in Ref. Burgess and Scholer, 2015). Normally, as enough time elapses, the influence of initial conditions and boundary conditions can be ignored, so differences in shock generation methods are not a concern. However, to accurately simulate the initial stages of shock generation observed in laser experiments, considerable attention needs to be paid to the initial setup of the calculations. Fox et al. (2013)Fox et al. (2018) introduced a localized heating operator to refine and incorporate the effects of laser ablation. This involves setting up a high-density region mimicking the target at one end of the system (with a constant density over time) and imparting a sufficiently high plasma temperature only to that specific area. This allows the target plasma to thermally expand into its surroundings. In their approach, it is necessary to handle a very high-density plasma in a narrow region, which results in high computational costs. Matsukiyo et al. (2022)Matsukiyo et al. (2022) employed a different method to reproduce similar effects in one-dimensional simulations. They injected a high-temperature, high-density target plasma into a system filled with uniform background gas plasma at a specific point for a finite duration. This eliminates the need to deal with target material that does not interact with the background gas plasma, thereby reducing computational costs. In the simulation they showed that injected target ions gyrate around ambient magnetic field in a gas plasma and turned back after a quarter of their gyro period. During this, a background gas ions are dragged (or accelerated) by the target ions so that the gas ions are gradually accumulated and compressed to form a shock-like steepened density profile afterwards. They called this steepened structure a developing shock. However, it is unclear how universal the process is. If the mechanism for generating a shock in experiments is elucidated, it would enable us to devise means to generate a shock in a short period of time, making it possible to measure a more developed shock. In this paper we use the same simulation method as Ref. Matsukiyo et al., 2022 to investigate the mechanism of shock formation in a magnetized gas plasma interacting with an ablated target plasma. We will show that the mechanism of shock formation changes depending on the injection time of target plasma. Moreover, it will be demonstrated that the time it takes to form a sufficiently steep density structure depends on the strength of the ambient magnetic field. To distinguish the structure we mainly discuss in this paper with usually discussed a well developed shock, we call the early stage steepened density or magnetic field structure discussed here a seed-shock, which does not accompany well developed steady and long enough downstream state. A seed-shock is equivalent to the structure named a developing shock in Ref. Matsukiyo et al., 2022. The paper is organized as follows. In section II simulation settings are explained. The mechanism of seed-shock formation is discussed in section III. The parameter dependence of seed-shock properties is shown in section IV. Then, discussions are given in section V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09078v1,Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at an oblique heliospheric termination shock,"Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at a heliospheric termination shock is investigated. Using two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation, accelerated pickup ions are self-consistently reproduced by tracking long time evolution of shock with unprecedentedly large system size in the shock normal direction. Reflected pickup ions drive upstream large amplitude waves through resonant instabilities. Convection of the large amplitude waves causes shock surface reformation and alters the downstream electromagnetic structure. A part of pickup ions are accelerated to tens of upstream flow energy in the time scale of \sim 100 times inverse ion gyro frequency. The initial acceleration occurs through shock surfing acceleration mechanism followed by shock drift acceleration mechanism. Large electrostatic potential accompanied by the upstream waves enables the shock surfing acceleration to occur.","A collisionless shock is ubiquitous in space. It is an energy converter formed in a supersonic plasma flow. A variety of explosive phenomena in space, stellar wind, astrophysical jet accompany collisionless shocks. One of the outstanding issues of collisionless shock physics is the mechanism of particle acceleration occurring around it. It is believed that cosmic rays are produced in a collisionless shock through the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism (e.g., Blandford & Eichler (1987)). In order for the DSA mechanism to work, preaccelerated nonthermal particles have to exist near a shock front. However, the mechanism producing such nonthermal particles, which should be dominated by complex microstructures of local electromagnetic fields, has been an open question for a long time. This is called the injection problem (Balogh & Treumann, 2013; Burgess & Scholer, 2015; Amano et al., 2022). The heliospheric termination shock (HTS) is thought to be an ideal laboratory to study the injection process, because the anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) having typically several tens of mega electron volts (MeV) are believed to be accelerated there (Chalov, 2006). However, the Voyager spacecraft observed only little amount of ACRs in the heliosheath, downstream of the HTS (e.g., Stone et al. (2005)). The reason for this was inferred by McComas & Schwadron (2006) as that efficient acceleration of ACRs occurs in the flank regions of the HTS, where geometrical condition of the local HTS is more suitable for particle acceleration than that of the HTS where the two Voyager spacecraft crossed. On the other hand, Giacalone et al. (2021) recently performed hybrid (kinetic ions with charge neutralizing electron fluid) simulations and showed that the acceleration rate of low energy (\lesssim 50 keV) pickup ions (PUIs) is more or less independent of the position in the HTS. The nonthermal particles in this energy range are expected to have their global map obtained in the near future through the IMAP (Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe) mission. In their simulation (Giacalone et al., 2021), turbulence in the solar wind is taken into account. Particles are expected to undergo scattering by the turbulent field, leading to some degree of acceleration, and there is a potential for these particles to be injected into the DSA process (Giacalone et al., 2021; Trotta et al., 2021; Pitňa et al., 2021; Zank et al., 2021; Trotta et al., 2022; Nakanotani et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). Another expected effect is the tilting of local magnetic field line. In oblique shocks particles reflected by the shock travel upstream, exciting waves themselves and generating mildly accelerated particles injected into the DSA process. Such a situation may occur in some specific regions of termination shock and perhaps locally everywhere when solar wind is turbulent. In this scenario, the generation of mildly accelerated particles needs to occur near the shock, but the detailed mechanism is not well understood. This study aims to validate the latter scenario. It is thought that initial acceleration sets in when a particle is reflected at the shock. In general shock potential strongly affects the reflection of PUIs. In a hybrid simulation, the electrostatic potential is typically derived from a generalized Ohm’s law, which includes a term proportional to the electron pressure gradient. Calculating this electron pressure gradient term requires assuming a specific equation of state for electrons. Consequently, the electrostatic field in a hybrid simulation becomes model-dependent. Swisdak et al. (2023) pointed out that fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation leads to higher fluxes and maximal energies of PUIs than hybrid simulation likely due to differences in the shock potential. Before the Voyager spacecraft crossed the HTS, the shock surfing acceleration (SSA) was widely accepted as a plausible mechanism of injection (Lee et al., 1996; Zank et al., 1996). However, the Voyager did not observe the expected amount of high energy particles when they crossed the HTS (Decker et al., 2008). This implies that the shock surfing acceleration mechanism did not work effectively either. The reason for that SSA does not work in the termination shock was explained by Matsukiyo & Scholer (2014) by using one-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of (quasi-)perpendicular shock that most of potential jump in a PUI mediated shock occurs in an extended foot produced by reflected PUIs so that the potential jump at a shock ramp is insufficiently small for the SSA mechanism to work. The shock potential in an oblique PUI mediated shock has not been extensively studied so far. Although the ab-initio PIC simulation is useful to reproduce complex multiscale electromagnetic structures responsible for injection processes, it requires large numerical cost. That is why PIC simulation of a collisionless shock in a plasma containing PUIs has been limitted mainly to the cases with one spatial dimension (e.g., Lee et al. (2005); Matsukiyo et al. (2007); Matsukiyo & Scholer (2011, 2014); Oka et al. (2011); Lembege & Yang (2016, 2018); Lembege et al. (2020)). Two-dimensional PIC simulations including PUIs are first conducted by Yang et al. (2015). They focused on the impact of PUIs on shock front nonstationarity of a perpendicular shock, \Theta_{Bn}=90^{\circ}, and energy dissipation up to t=8\Omega^{-1}_{i}, where \Theta_{Bn} denotes the shock angle, the angle between shock normal and upstream magnetic field, and \Omega_{i} is upstream ion cyclotron frequency. Kumar et al. (2018) performed longer simulation up to t\sim 30\Omega^{-1}_{i} for quasi-perpendicular shocks, \Theta_{Bn}=80^{\circ}. They paid more attention to energy distribution of PUIs and solar wind ions (SWIs) for different upstream velocity distribution functions of PUIs. A little longer calculation up to t\sim 40\Omega^{-1}_{i} was done with \Theta_{Bn}=70^{\circ} by Swisdak et al. (2023). However, since the shock angle is close to or equal to perpendicular in the above previous studies, significant acceleration of PUIs are not reproduced. Indeed, when considering the average values, the shock angle of the termination shock is nearly perpendicular. However, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, it is easy to predict that the local shock angle fluctuates significantly due to the effects of solar wind turbulence and unsteady solar activity. This fluctuation could have important implications for the ion injection process. In this study we focus the initial acceleration, which is often called injection process, of PUIs at an oblique HTS. The microstructures of a local oblique HTS with \Theta_{Bn}=50^{\circ}, and with 60^{\circ} and 70^{\circ} for comparison, mediated by the presence of PUIs and their impact on PUI acceleration are discussed by performing two-dimensional full PIC simulation with unprecedentedly long simulation time (t_{max}=125\Omega^{-1}_{i})."

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09375v1,Vibrational excitation and dissociation of deuterium molecule by electron impact,"A theoretical investigation on electron-D2 resonant collisions – via the low-lying and the Rydberg states of D{}_{2}^{-} – is presented for vibrational excitation, dissociative electron attachment and dissociative excitation processes by using the Local-Complex-Potential approach. Full sets of vibrationally resolved cross sections, involving the ground electronic state – \textrm{X}\,^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g} – and the first two electronic excited states – \textrm{b}\,^{3}\Sigma^{+}_{u} and \textrm{B}\,^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u} – of the D2 molecule, are given for fusion plasma applications in their technologically relevant partially dissociated, detached divertor regimes. In particular, transitions between electronic excited states are also considered. Comparisons are made with cross sections present in the literature, where available.","Electron-impact vibrational excitation and dissociation of deuterium molecules are of primary importance in many fields, ranging from astrophysics and plasma discharges to nuclear fusion, including fundamental physics Krishnakumar et al. (2018). Molecular hydrogen H2, deuterated hydrogen HD and deuterium D2, the simplest and at the same time the most abundant species formed in the pregalactic gas prior to structure formation, played an important role in the cooling of the gas clouds which gave birth to the first stellar generation Dalgarno (2005); Galli and Palla (2013). In this regard, it has been shown that the D/H ratio in giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, is a fundamental parameter to understand the formation of the solar system from the primitive nebula Lecluse et al. (1996). Moreover, electron-impact cross sections for HD, D2 and the corresponding ions are needed to explain certain phenomena occurring in the different planetary atmospheres and their ionospheres Kim et al. (2014). Among technological applications, electron-D2 collision cross sections are strictly related to the important problem of plasma interaction with the neutral gas component originating from surface recombination, from volumetric recombination channels, and/or from external gas puffing (plasma fuelling). This is of particular relevance for the so-called “detached divertor regime” in magnetic fusion devices Sang et al. (2020); Verhaegh et al. (2021), which is currently intensively studied in existing tokamaks and stellarators, and is also foreseen as the standard operational mode for the ITER fusion reactor under construction in Cadarache (South France). In this detached plasma mode of operation the hydrogenic plasma chemistry plays a key role for critical issues such as plasma energy and momentum dissipation, high heat flux component protection and particle (ash) removal. There molecular reaction kinetics comprises an important sub-model of the integrated multi-physics boundary plasma code systems, such as e.g. SOLPS-ITER, which was and still is heavily used for guiding the ITER divertor design Pitts et al. (2019), and future experimental campaigns. Powerful volumetric plasma-gas interaction mechanisms are known to be operative in fusion machine reactors, involving both resonant electron collisions – via resonant D{}_{2}^{-} anion states – and near resonant positive atomic ion (ion conversion, such as charge transfer channels) reactions. Such resonant processes are believed to be a key ingredient towards quantitative understanding of the near target divertor plasma dynamics, with their prominent effects also on dissociation degree, perhaps molecular-assisted additional volumetric recombination channels, but certainly for establishing the vibrational distribution of electronic ground molecules. Eliminating this latter from the unknown parts of fusion divertor models by a reliable cross section database can be expected to greatly improve the predictive and interpretative quality in current fusion reactor divertor models and spectroscopy interpretation tools. A recent account of the status of including such resonant channels in fusion relevant collision radiative models is given in the Ref. Sawada and Goto (2016), in which data for these resonant channels are deduced from Horáček et al. (2006). Another very important application in nuclear fusion field is related to negative ion sources for neutral beam injection (NBI) system. In particular, electron-D2 vibrationally resolved processes are paramount importance for kinetic models Taccogna and Minelli (2017) simulating the production, transport, extraction, acceleration and neutralization of negative ion beams to heat thermonuclear reactors. In this regard, a relevant result is that sources operated with deuterium could not achieve the same performances as a source operated with hydrogen, at the same power and pressure Bacal and Wada (2020), indicating a strong isotopic dependence from nuclear motion effects in these resonance channels, quite distinct from non-resonant electron collision systems. A recent detailed experimental study of this well established isotope effect in dissociative attachment resonance channels is given by E. Krishnakumar et al. Krishnakumar et al. (2011). A complete and updated set of deuterium cross sections is crucial to model the plasma of negative ion sources for fusion, which are currently routinely operated both with hydrogen and deuterium Serianni et al. (2020). Since the availability and access of plasma diagnostics in these devices is limited due to construction and operation constraints imposed by source optimization, it is difficult to precisely monitor plasma parameters in the entire source volume. A small size low pressure helicon plasma such as RAID Furno, Ivo et al. (2017), able to achieve high power hydrogen and deuterium discharges and mimic the electron temperature and density conditions of both the driver and the expansion region of large negative ion sources for fusion, represents a versatile testbench to validate numerical models. Dedicated Particle-in-Cell (PiC) and fluid modeling are currently underway to shed light on transport and chemistry of hydrogen RAID plasma discharges Fubiani et al. (2021). Aimed at supplying data for non-equilibrium plasma modeling applications Taccogna et al. (2012); Celiberto et al. (2017); Wünderlich and Fantz (2016), a large number of theoretical Meltzer and Tennyson (2020); Scarlett et al. (2021); Zammit et al. (2014); Tapley et al. (2018) and experimental Allan (1985); van Wingerden et al. (1977); Corrigan (1965); Wrkich et al. (2002) works, including a review Tawara et al. (1990), have appeared for H2 cross sections. Moreover, recently, results for H{}_{2}^{+} collisions with electrons Zammit et al. (2013); Iacob et al. (2019); DJUISSI et al. (2020), for the process of dissociative recombination, have become available. In spite of that, very little information exists in the literature about D2 excitation and dissociation and, more generally, for the nuclear fusion relevant D2, DT and T2 collision systems proceeding via their anion resonances. In order to fill the lack of data, in this paper, we will consider vibrationally-resolved resonant collisions by electron-impact, for the processes of vibrational excitation (VE), dissociative attachment (DA) and dissociative excitation (DE), reported in the Table 1, involving the ground electronic state – \textrm{X}\,^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g} – and the first two electronic excited states – \textrm{b}\,^{3}\Sigma^{+}_{u} and \textrm{B}\,^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u} – of the D2 molecule, which proceed through the low lying and the Rydberg states of D{}_{2}^{-} resonances. With regard to resonant scattering, it has been largely demonstrated that, for the collisions with electrons at low energy, it gives the dominant contribution in plasma kinetics Chen (2016); Smirnov (2007); Capitelli et al. (2000). The cross section calculations we will be performed in the so-called “Local-Complex-Potential” (LCP) approach Bardsley and Mandl (1968); Domcke (1991); Dubé and Herzenberg (1979); Houfek et al. (2006) and for the first time this methodology will be applied for vibrational transitions among excited electronic states. In this work, we are interested in resonant scatterings: the adiabatic nuclei (AN) approximation, often used to study electron molecule collision systems (see e.g., the molecular convergent close-coupling (MCCC) calculations in Ref. Scarlett et al. (2021) and references therein), cannot be applied in this context. While the Rydberg resonances – via high lying Rydberg states of the D{}_{2}^{-} anion – have received attention in recent literature, the hitherto poorly studied low lying resonances (via the \textrm{X}\,^{2}\Sigma^{+}_{u} state of D{}_{2}^{-}), are of particular relevance for the 0.5 to 5 eV electron temperatures in typical fusion detached divertor plasma scenarios. It is particularly this gap which we aim at in this paper with up to date and ab initio theoretical calculations.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09370v1,Vibrational excitation cross sections for non-equilibrium nitric oxide-containing plasma,"A full set of vibrationally-resolved cross sections for electron impact excitation of NO(X {}^{2}\Pi,v) molecules is calculated from ab initio molecular dynamics, in the framework of the Local-Complex-Potential approach. Electron-vibration energy exchanges in non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions are studied from a state-to-state model accounting for all electron impact excitation and de-excitation processes of the nitric oxide vibration manifold, and it is shown that the calculated vibration relaxation times are in good agreement with the experimental data. The new vibrational excitation cross sections are used in a complete electron impact cross section set in order to obtain non-equilibrium electron energy distributions functions and to calculate electron transport parameters in NO. It is verified that the new cross sections bring a significant improvement between simulations and experimental swarm data, providing an additional validation of the calculations, when used within the complete set of cross sections investigated in this work.","Nitrogen molecule (N2) and its oxide compounds (NOx), in particular nitric oxide (NO), comprise a significant fraction of the Earth’s atmosphere and they are of primary importance for life on Earth and for many human activities. The vibrationally excited levels of NO, for example, play a fundamental role in understanding the chemical processes occurring in the upper atmosphere. In fact, it has been proven that their distribution is very sensitive to the fast auroral electrons in ionosphere, which are directly connected to the solar activity Bouziane et al. (2022). As a second example, the vibrational excitation of NO molecule is also very relevant in hypersonic applications and in the atmospheric reentry problem of shuttle spacecrafts, where it is related to the contribution to radiation heating Sahai et al. (2020); Munafò et al. (2015); Panesi and Lani (2013). From the biological side, NO molecule is a metabolic nitrogen compound in gas form, and it plays an important role in the physiological regulation of the cardiovasculature in the human body Naseem (2005); Feng (2012). Moreover, in novel generation of biosensors for real-time bioimaging, NO is a key signaling molecule for vasodilatation and neurotransmission at low concentrations and a defensive cytotoxin at higher concentrations Moncada and Higgs (2006); Jeon et al. (2014). As another example, from a technological point of view, nitrogen fixation processes, which refer to the formation of compounds such as ammonia and nitrate from nitrogen molecules, is one of the most important industrial activities in agriculture Chen et al. (2021). The key point is that current ammonia synthesis methods make use of large amount of fossil fuels, which contribute to the global current human CO2 emissions. In this respect, a worldwide interest about the possibility to explore sustainable nitrogen fixation processes by using cold plasmas has been growing in the last years and new green technologies have been proposed very recently Vervloessem et al. (2020); Rouwenhorst et al. (2021); Jardali et al. (2021). In order to study the transport properties and chemistry of NO-containing systems, several kinetic models appeared recently in literature Bahnamiri et al. (2021); Bak and Cappelli (2015); Bouziane et al. (2022) and, at same time, new sets of cross sections and rate coefficients for chemical reactions for the NO molecule have been proposed Campbell et al. (2004); Song et al. (2019); Itikawa (2016), including for heavy particle collisions Armenise and Esposito (2021); Esposito and Armenise (2021). To this purpose, in this work, we present a novel study of NO molecules interacting with electrons, covering ab initio molecular dynamics and non-equilibrium kinetics modelling. The paper is organized as follows. In sections II and III, we use the theoretical framework employed in recent papers Laporta et al. (2020a, b) to calculate dissociative cross sections by electron-impact for NO molecule, to extend the calculations to the process of vibrational excitation (VE) i.e.: e(\epsilon)+\mathrm{NO}(\mathrm{X}\,^{2}\Pi;v)\to\mathrm{NO}^{-}\to e+\mathrm{% NO}(\mathrm{X}\,^{2}\Pi;v^{\prime})\,,\qquad v,v^{\prime}=0,\ldots 53\,; (1) a comparison with data available in literature and an update of the data presented in the Ref. Laporta et al. (2012) is also included. In section IV, we discuss a 0D model for the vibrational relaxation of NO molecules in chemical non-equilibrium conditions when electrons are described by a Maxwellian distribution. The non-equilibrium effects for electrons are taken into account in section V. Finally, section VI summarizes the main conclusions and closes the paper."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08789v1,Physics-Informed Transformation Toward Improving the Machine-Learned NLTE Models of ICF Simulations,"The integration of machine learning techniques into Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) simulations has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing computational efficiency. By replacing the costly Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) model with machine learning models, significant reductions in calculation time have been achieved. However, determining how to optimize machine learning-based NLTE models in order to match ICF simulation dynamics remains challenging, underscoring the need for physically relevant error metrics and strategies to enhance model accuracy with respect to these metrics. Thus, we propose novel physics-informed transformations designed to emphasize energy transport, use these transformations to establish new error metrics, and demonstrate that they yield smaller errors within reduced principal component spaces compared to conventional transformations.","A recent inertial confinement fusion (ICF) Nuckolls et al. (1972) experiment Zylstra et al. (2022) at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) achieved fusion ignition, obtaining a greater fusion energy yield than the input laser energy. Since then, ignition has been repeated several times Tollefson (2024), and it is expected that this result will soon become routine, allowing regular experiments to understand the physics of a self-heating high energy density plasma and to improve the energy gain. In order to optimize this gain with respect to the experimental configuration, many variations in design parameters must be made. Because each experiment is very expensive and time consuming to plan, simulations are used to develop optimum designs. Such simulations have a high computational cost, dominated by the Non-local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) model Scott et al. (2022); Frank and Scott (2022). While machine learning (ML) techniques have significantly reduced this computational cost by a factor of ten Kluth et al. (2020); Humbird et al. (2020); Lee and Carlberg (2020); Humbird et al. (2021); Vander Wal et al. (2022); Vander Wal et al. (2023a); Vander Wal (2022); Vander Wal et al. (2023b), it is unclear what the best data representation and error metrics are for fast and accurate ICF simulations. Researchers have employed various data processing techniques to enhance the robustness and scalability of models. One approach involves using a modified logarithmic transformation to reduce the dynamic range of NLTE data. Furthermore, Vander Wal et al. Vander Wal et al. (2022) further proposed replacing the logarithmic transformation with a cube root transformation to address the thresholding effect that artificially inflates low-opacity values for low-Z elements. However, the precise impact of these transformations on the final outcomes of ICF simulations has yet to be thoroughly investigated, and the potential of other transformations to further improve these outcomes has not been fully explored. A more critical issue is the lack of appropriate error metrics used in training ML models, which can result in the oversight of significant effects, physically relevant to ICF simulations. Kluth et al. Kluth et al. (2020) and subsequent studies Humbird et al. (2020, 2021); Vander Wal et al. (2022); Vander Wal (2022); Vander Wal et al. (2023b) have employed Rosseland and Planck means, as well as integrated emissivity, as physics-based error metrics. While these metrics are suitable for evaluating photon energy transmission in optically thick media, optically thin media, and total photon energy emission, respectively, they are not resolved by photon energy groups and are not directly applicable to systems without a well-defined radiation temperature, such as NLTE regions in ICF simulations. To address these issues, we introduce physics-informed transformations (PhITs) and corresponding error metrics. The PhITs are bijective data transformations of absorption and emissivity—two outputs of NLTE models—into variables that describe net energy exchange and photon mean free path, which are fundamental physical quantities. This approach enables the development of generalized models, as the transformed data should adhere to physical laws regardless of the conditions. Additionally, error metrics derived from these transformations allow for a quantitative analysis of how data processing affects radiation properties in ICF simulations, providing guidance for models to minimize these errors and emphasize the most important physical phenomena. In order to provide context for the PhIT transformation, we describe the radiation-hydrodynamics that motivates the development of the PhIT in Section II. Also, Section III details the process by which we generated our training data. In Section IV, we introduce the PhIT as a tool to support machine learning, highlighting its advantages for radiation hydrodynamics simulations. Section V offers a physical interpretation of errors generated through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and illustrates how the PhIT optimizes errors with respect to the dimensional size of the PCA space. Finally, in Section VI, we provide a summary and offer insights for further testing of the transformation."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08513v1,On the soliton solutions in a self-gravitating strongly coupled electron-ion-dusty plasma,"The effect of electrostatic strong-coupling of dust particles along with their self-gravitational force has been analyzed in a three component dusty plasma. The electrons and ions forming the charge neutral background where the electron distribution is assumed to be Maxwellian while the ion distribution is non-thermal. These days, one of the key topics in plasma physics is nonlinear waves in plasma. Thus using the reductive perturbation technique to the set of hydrodynamic equation considered for an electron-ion-dusty (e-i-d) plasma, a coupled KdV equation is derived. The impact of strong coupling and self-gravitation on the solitary wave profiles, nonlinear coefficient and dispersive coefficient are studied both analytically and by numerical simulation.","The studies of dusty plasma has become a crucial area of research due to the presence of dust in numerous natural environments, including radio-frequency discharges, near planets, and interstellar and circumstellar media. Due to its many applications to laboratory, space, and astrophysical plasma settings, such as asteroid zones, planatery rings, cometary tails, the interstellar medium, earth’s surroundings, etc., interest in the field of dusty plasma physics has been expanding quickly[1, 2, 3]. In reality, the charge on the dust grain varies with time and space because of electron and ion currents that flow into and out of the grain in addition to other processes like electron photoemission and secondary emission. This causes fluctuations in the dust charge. When these dust grains collide with other charged particles, such electrons, they get charged and become submerged in the surrounding plasma. In the majority of astrophysical scenarios, a grain becomes charged due to the radiative and plasma backdrop it is submerged in. The grains’ weights and sizes could very well be dependent on the same plasma environment, for instance. Larger and heavier grains could result from coulombic coagulation, but lighter and smaller grains could come from Maxwellian stress breaking apart the huge grains. These charged grains use electromagnetic (EM) forces to couple with the dynamics of the plasma. Low-frequency eigenmodes arise because the characteristic dust frequencies are significantly smaller than those of ions and electrons, due to the potentially very high effective charge and mass of these grains. Since each isolated dust grain has a mass that is typically between 10^{6} and 10^{12} times that of an ion[4, 5]. A new ultra low-frequency domain for the development of various acoustic mode types in dusty plasmas — which are absent in typical electron-ion plasmas — is created by the presence of such rather big particles. One such significant mode is the dust-acoustic mode, an Eigenmode of the dust-electron-ion plasma in which the restoring force is provided by the pressures of inertialess electrons and ions and the inertia is provided by the charged dust grains. As a result, in many laboratory studies, the dust-acoustic waves (DAW) have been seen with the unaided eye on a kinetic level[6, 7, 8, 9]. Dust acoustic waves, or DAWs, are the normal mode of a three-component dusty plasma made up of electrons, ions, and extremely huge micro-meter-sized charged dust grains. DAWs have a very low phase velocity (compared to the electron and ion thermal velocity). Star formation is one of the most significant of the many ancient issues that must be reconsidered in light of the many recent advances in our understanding of dusty plasma. The question of magneto-gravitational instability of stars is of great importance due to the competition between the gravitational and electromagnetic forces. Because of the increased mass of the grains, there is typically conflict between the gravitational and electromagnetic effects. Gravitational forces will prevail for very large grains, while electromagnetic and gravitational forces may compete for moderate-sized dusts. This equilibrium served as the foundation for the well-known Jeans instability, and serves as a standard for the disintegration of interstellar material. Interesting analyses of the modification of Jeans’ criterion resulting from the interaction of nonlinearity, gravitational force, and electromagnetic effect have previously been conducted by a few writers[10, 11, 12]. Naturally, the tale of dusty plasma is fairly ancient, with several models being postulated for various kinds of investigation[13, 14]. The electrostatic energy of the mutual interaction is unusually high due to huge charges carried by the grains (usually of the order of thousand elementary charges for a micron-size particle). Therefore, compared to the electron-ion subsystem, it is far easier to achieve significant electrostatic coupling in the dust subsystem. Transitions from a disordered gaseous-like phase to a liquid-like phase and the creation of organized structures from dust particles, known as plasma crystals, are observed in complex plasmas. In 1959, Wuerker et al.[15] reported the first experimental observation of the ordered (quasicrystalline) structures of charged microparticles formed in a modified Paul’s trap. It was Ikezi (1986)[16] who first hypothesized that dust subsystem crystallization may occur in a nonequilibrium gas discharge plasma. Because of its many applications, the physics of strongly coupled plasmas, where the average potential energy per particle predominates over the average kinetic energy, is of enormous interest. When such high coupling is present, the presence of a huge charged dust component in a typical electron-ion plasma can have a significant impact on the dynamics of the system. Recently, both theoretical and experimental investigations of complicated dynamics have been conducted in such a plasma system. The coupling parameter (\Gamma) is one of the essential features of a system where many particle interactions occur. The parameter ‘\Gamma’ is characterized as the ratio of the potential energy of interaction between the neighboring particles to their kinetic energy. The coupling parameter is expressed as \Gamma=\frac{q_{d}^{2}}{ak_{B}T_{d}}\exp[-\mathcal{K}], with \mathcal{K}=a_{d}/\lambda_{D}. The quantity ‘\mathcal{K}’ is known as the screening parameter. q_{{}_{d}} is the charge on each dust particle, a_{{}_{d}}(\approx n_{d}^{-1/3}) is the inter-dust particle distance, n_{d} and T_{d} are the dust density and temperature, \lambda_{D} is the plasma Debye length, k_{B} the Boltzmann constant. The possibility of a classical Coulomb plasma with a population of dust grains transitioning to a strongly coupled phase was first noted by Ikezi[16]. It had been nearly twenty-five years ago. The reason for this is that with high charge and low temperature, the coupling parameters approach or even surpass 1. In fact, the Debye-Huckel repulsive potential determines the way the negatively charged micro-particles interact with one another. It has been shown that a strongly coupled plasma can behave like a liquid or a solid, with viscosity and elasticity playing equally significant roles. Dust grains are known to have a quasi-crystalline structure, and these characteristics are referred to as visco-elasticity. Therefore, there should be strong correlation effects influencing the low frequency collective modes in such a new phase of plasma. Currently, there are two paths toward the development of a strongly linked plasma. Effective electrostatic force[17, 18, 19, 20] and visco-elastic effects[21, 22, 23] are the two types of forces. A number of these have applications in the study of charged particles in cryogenic traps[24], electrons trapped on the surface of liquid helium[25], and other astrophysical systems[26], including the ion-liquid inside white dwarf interiors, the crust of neutron stars, supernova cores, etc. As the diameters of the dust grains increase, the gravitational effects become significant. Similar to other plasma particles, trapping by magnetic field lines predominates for grains that are too tiny. Conversely, excessively big grains do not deviate from their gravitationally constrained orbits due to electromagnetic forces. There could be a struggle between the electrostatic repulsion and gravitational self-attraction of the grains in plasmas such as protostellar clouds. Dusty plasmas are susceptible to macroscopic instabilities of the Jeans type[27, 28, 29, 30], when self-gravitational interaction resulting from the behavior of dust component is taken into account. In contrast to the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force is solely attracting, which accounts for the Jeans instability of a huge system. El-Labany et al.[31, 32] recently obtained stationary modes, tiny amplitude DA solitons, and double layers while taking the dynamics of dust charge and trapped electrons/ions into account. It has already been demonstrated that the coexistence of rarefactive and compressive DA solitary structures and double layers is possible at the two-ion temperature. Nonetheless, these studies that disregard gravity are only applicable in the plasma phase, where the electrostatic force is significantly stronger than the gravitational pull. In many astrophysical environments, especially in dense regions like star-forming molecular clouds and accretion disks, dusty plasmas are both self-gravitating and can exhibit strong coupling. The interplay of gravity, electrostatic forces, and plasma dynamics can lead to complex behaviors, including clustering, filamentation, and large-scale structure formation[33]. Even in the laboratory, dusty plasmas are often studied under conditions where gravity can be minimized (such as in microgravity experiments aboard the International Space Station) to understand how dust particles behave in strongly coupled states[34, 35]. While several studies have examined the impact of trapped electrons or ions, variations in dust temperatures, and charge fluctuations, none have examined the consequences of electrostatic strong coupling in conjunction with self-gravitation. Using an appropriate reductive perturbation technique, we have analyzed both the linear and nonlinear regimes of a self-gravitating quantum dusty plasma in the current communication. Two coupled modified KdV equations have been derived in the nonlinear section, while a new dispersion relation providing precise information about different propagation modes is generated in the linear regime. The structure of our presentation is as follows: in Section II, we give the density distributions for the Maxwellian distributed electrons and non-thermal ions as well as the hydrodynamic equations for the strongly coupled as well as self-gravitating dust fluid. The goal of Section III is to derive the linear and nonlinear equations by analyzing different orders of perturbation terms that eventually makes us able to explain how large amplitude dust waves behave. The obtained results were discussed and explained precisely in SectionV as well."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08575v1,Multiscale simulation of neutral particle flows in the plasma edge,"The plasma edge flow, situated at the intricate boundary between plasma and neutral particles, plays a pivotal role in the design of nuclear fusion devices such as divertors and pumps. Traditional numerical simulation methods, such as the direct simulation Monte Carlo approach and the discrete velocity method, are hindered by extensive computation times when dealing with near-continuum flow conditions. This paper presents a general synthetic iterative scheme to deterministically simulate the plasma edge flows. By alternately solving the kinetic equations and macroscopic synthetic equations, our method substantially decreases the number of iterations, while maintains asymptotic-preserving properties even when the spatial cell size is much larger than the mean free path. Consequently, our approach achieves rapid convergence and high accuracy in plasma edge flow simulations, particularly in near-continuum flow regimes. This advancement provides a robust and efficient computational tool, essential for the advancement of next-generation nuclear fusion reactors.","The edge plasma generally refers to the outer layer of plasma in fusion devices (such as tokamaks), consisting of a mixture of plasma and neutral particles [1]. As shown in Fig. 1, the innermost layer is the inner wall surface of the device, with the majority of the poloidal magnetic field generated by the plasma current I_{p}, approximating a circular shape. An external coil with a current I_{D} is aligned in the same direction as I_{p} to create the so-called “poloidal divertor” structure. The magnetic fields produced by I_{D} and I_{p} cancel each other at the X-points. The magnetic surface passing through an X-point is called the separatrix. A solid plate intercepts the magnetic surfaces around the current I_{D}, transporting the high-temperature plasma from the core region to this solid plate via the magnetic field, and preventing direct contact with the inner wall. The region between the outer magnetic flux surface of the core and the separatrix is referred to as the edge plasma region [2, 3, 4, 5]. Achieving fusion necessitates heating plasma to staggering temperatures, far beyond hundreds of millions of degrees, and maintaining this high-density plasma for an extended period. This demanding criterion places extraordinary stress on the materials utilized in the plasma-facing components and the divertor target plates of fusion devices, given the immense heat and plasma flux that emanate from the device. Neutral particles are pivotal in mitigating the particle and energy flux directed towards the divertor target [6]. Under these conditions, a neutral buffer layer emerges in front of the divertor target, which enhances ion-neutral interactions and shields the target from the direct onslaught of high-energy plasma. Consequently, the accurate simulation of the plasma edge, encompassing both plasma and neutral particles, is indispensable for devising operational strategies and blueprinting the next generation of fusion reactors [7, 8]. Figure 1: A schematic of the edge region in the poloidal plane of a divertor tokamak. In the edge plasma, the plasma can be described by macroscopic fluid equations. For the neutral particles, regions with high collision rates approach the hydrodynamic limit and can be effectively described using macroscopic fluid dynamics equations. Conversely, regions with low collision rates, being far from thermal equilibrium, require kinetic equations for precise characterization [9, 10, 11]. This presents a challenge: relying solely on macroscopic fluid equations falls short in accurately depicting the low-collision regions, while an exclusive dependence on kinetic equations is computationally intensive and resource-demanding due to their inherent high dimensionality [12, 13]. Traditionally, the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has been employed for simulating rarefied gas dynamics. However, this approach can result in excessively long computation times and large consumption of computer memory due to the higher frequency of charge exchange collisions. That is, the time step and spatial cell size should be smaller than the mean collision time and mean free path of the neutral particles, respectively. Moreover, the inherent statistical noise in DSMC can impede convergence when dealing with neutral particle models integrated with plasma fluid equations. Consequently, it is imperative to develop an efficient and accurate computational method that possesses asymptotic preserving properties (enabling the use of fewer spatial cells) and rapid convergence characteristics (allowing for a reduced number of iteration steps). Such a method is essential for the design of next-generation nuclear fusion reactors, as indicated by recent studies [14, 15]. As detailed in the review article [16], a significant breakthrough in the efficient simulation of kinetic equations emerged in the field of neutron transport, where the kinetic equation is solved concurrently with the synthetic equation of the diffusion type. This coupling strategy has been successfully applied to specific rarefied gas flow problems, such as planar Poiseuille flow [17] where the flow direction is perpendicular to the computational domain, and has ultimately evolved into the general synthetic iteration scheme (GSIS) for general rarefied gas flows [18]. GSIS effectively spans the micro-macro gap by iteratively solving the kinetic equation and its corresponding synthetic equations. Within the synthetic equation, the linear Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations are integrated with higher-order terms (HoTs), which are directly derived from the velocity distribution function. These HoTs capture rarefaction effects and ensure the validity of the constitutive relations across all Knudsen numbers. In the continuous flow regime, where the Knudsen number is low, the higher-order terms diminish to zero, ensuring that GSIS asymptotically preserves the Navier-Stokes equations in the continuum limit. This preservation allows for the use of larger cell sizes and time steps, which is particularly beneficial for simulating edge plasma. Through rigorous mathematical analysis and extensive numerical testing [19, 20, 21, 22], GSIS has demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of iterations required and an enhancement in simulation efficiency by several orders of magnitude. This study will focus on developing a new GSIS algorithm for neutral particles in the plasma edge, aiming to achieve rapid convergence and asymptotic preservation. This approach is intended to reduce the number of spatial cells (simulation memory) and iterations (simulation time) required. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the kinetic model equations and hydrodynamic equations for neutral particles. In Section 3, we introduce the detailed numerical method to solve the GSIS. In Section 4, the effectiveness of the GSIS algorithm is validated in various numerical simulations. Finally, the conclusions are given in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08559v1,Nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production using polarized photons from inverse Compton scattering,"Observing multiphoton electron-positron pair production (the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process) requires high-energy \gamma rays to interact with strong electromagnetic fields. In order for these observations to be as precise as possible, the \gamma rays would ideally be both mono-energetic and highly polarized. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of an experimental configuration that accomplishes this in two stages. First, a multi-GeV electron beam interacts with a moderately intense laser pulse to produce a bright, highly polarized beam of \gamma rays by inverse Compton scattering. Second, after removing the primary electrons, these \gamma rays collide with another, more intense, laser pulse in order to produce pairs. We show that it is possible to measure the \gamma-ray polarization dependence of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process in near-term experiments, using a 100-TW class laser and currently available electron beams. Furthermore, it would also be possible to observe harmonic structure and the perturbative-to-nonperturbative transition if such a laser were colocated with a future linear collider.","Producing electron-positron pairs from the collision of photons is one of the most elusive processes in QED. Breit and Wheeler, in their seminal paper [1], were the first to consider two high-energy photons producing a pair as the inverse process of Dirac annihilation [2]. Realizing this pair production in the laboratory is extremely challenging because the centre-of-mass energy of the colliding photons has to exceed the rest mass energy of the pair, 2mc^{2}\approx 1 MeV. The scarcity of sources of high-energy photons with suitable flux led Breit and Wheeler to deem such an endeavour “hopeless” [1]. Pair production in the collision of a single high-energy photon (a \gamma ray) with an intense laser pulse, first studied in Refs. 3, 4, 5, 6, is called the “nonlinear” Breit-Wheeler (NBW) process, because the energy threshold can be overcome by absorbing many photons from the laser. This process becomes efficient if the quantum parameter \chi=|e|\sqrt{k_{\mu}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\nu\lambda}k^{\lambda}}/m^{3} reaches unity. Here k^{\mu} is the photon four-momentum, F^{\mu\nu} is the laser field strength tensor, e and m are the electron charge and mass, respectively. For more details on the theory of QED in strong laser fields and additional literature we refer to the recent reviews [7, 8, 9]. High-intensity lasers are now mature enough to make laboratory experiments on the Breit-Wheeler process feasible. The seminal SLAC E-144 experiment reported the production of \mathcal{O}(100) electron-positron pairs in collisions of TW laser pulse with the 46.6 GeV SLAC electron beam [10]. In this experiment, the high-energy photons that created the pairs were generated in same laser pulse (via nonlinear Compton scattering) as the pairs themselves. Separating the \gamma-ray and pair production stages, so as to obtain a pure light-by-light interaction, has been considered extensively in the recent literature [11, 12, 13, 14] and is now part of planned experimental programs [15, 16, 17]. In fact, a two-stage scenario for pair production was already planned at E-144 but was never realized [18]. Laser-based concepts for the direct observation of the linear Breit-Wheeler process have been considered both theoretically [19, 20, 21, 22] and experimentally [23, 24, 25]. Furthermore, an experimental signal of the linear Breit-Wheeler process was reported in heavy-ion collision experiments, where the pair production can be considered as being due to the collision of “quasi-real” photons from the ions’ Lorentz-boosted Coulomb fields [26]. A crucial aspect of the Breit-Wheeler process is the way it depends on the polarizations of the participating photons, as shown by Breit and Wheeler themselves [1]. If we consider pair production by a \gamma ray colliding with a linearly polarized laser, the probability depends on the relative orientation of the \gamma-ray and laser polarizations. The ratio of the pair-creation probability rates for a \gamma ray that is polarized parallel or perpendicular to the laser electric field, W_{\parallel} and W_{\perp} respectively, is shown in Fig. 1, where we introduce the laser normalized amplitude a_{0} and an energy parameter \eta=\chi/a_{0}. In the limit that a_{0}\gg 1, the probability rates are related as W_{\perp}=2W_{\parallel} for \chi\ll 1 [3] and W_{\perp}=\frac{3}{2}W_{\parallel} for \chi\gg 1 [4], showing that the probability is generally larger if the laser and \gamma-ray polarization are orthogonal. Observing this difference is a goal of experiments aimed at precision measurements of QED in the strong-field regime [15, 16] (see also Refs. 27, 28, 29). Figure 1: The ratio between W_{\perp} and W_{\parallel}, the pair-creation probability rates for a photon with energy parameter \eta=\chi/a_{0} that propagates through a linearly polarized plane electromagnetic wave with normalized amplitude a_{0}. The photon is either polarized perpendicular (\perp) or parallel (\parallel) to the electric field of the plane wave. The equivalent intensity and photon energy are calculated assuming a laser wavelength of 800 nm. In this paper we discuss the prospects of measuring the polarization dependence of NBW in a two-stage configuration where the high-energy \gamma-ray beam is produced via linear inverse Compton scattering (ICS) in a dedicated interaction point, separate from the strong-field focus. The \gamma rays from such a source can be highly linearly polarized, parallel to the laser electric field, which permits easy control of the relative polarization orientation of the \gamma rays and the second high-intensity laser. Using nonlinear Compton scattering as a source of polarized \gamma rays to study the polarization dependence of NBW has previously been considered in Refs. 30, 31. Our study is motivated by the prospects of accelerator-based strong-field QED experiments, such as LUXE [15, 16]. The distinguishing features of our considered scenario are the \gamma rays’ polarization and their quasi-monoenergeticity. Throughout the paper we use natural units with \hbar=c=1. Scalar products between four-vectors are abbreviated as k.p=k_{\mu}p^{\mu}. We employ the Minkowski metric g^{\mu\nu}=\text{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08492v1,Zones of Tayler Instability in Stars,"The Tayler instability (TI) of toroidal magnetic fields is a candidate mechanism for driving turbulence, angular momentum transport, and dynamo action in stellar radiative zones. Recently Skoutnev & Beloborodov (2024) revisited the linear stability analysis of a toroidal magnetic field in a rotating and stably stratified fluid. In this paper, we extend the analysis to include both thermal and compositional stratification, allowing for general application to stars. We formulate an analytical instability criterion for use as a “toggle switch” in stellar evolution codes. It determines when and where in a star the Tayler-Spruit dynamo may be responsible for angular momentum transport. We implement such a “toggle switch” in the MESA stellar evolution code and map out the stability of each mode of the TI on a grid of stellar evolution models. In evolved lower mass stars, the TI becomes suppressed in compositionally stratified regions, undermining the Tayler-Spruit dynamo as an explanation of the core-envelope coupling. In higher mass stars, the TI is active throughout the radiative zones, but at different wavenumbers than previously expected.","Angular momentum transport in the radiative zones of stars remains an important problem in stellar physics. Evolving stars experience structural adjustments and surface torques from winds that lead to differential rotation of their interiors (Maeder & Meynet, 2000; Maeder, 2008). Without redistribution of angular momentum, the compact cores of evolved stars would rotate orders of magnitude faster than their envelopes and leave behind rapidly rotating stellar remnants. By contrast, observations show relatively slow internal stellar rotation rates (Eggenberger et al., 2012; Ceillier et al., 2013; Marques et al., 2013; Den Hartogh et al., 2019; Ouazzani et al., 2019) and small initial spins of stellar remnants (Heger et al., 2005; Suijs et al., 2008; Kawaler, 2014; Hermes et al., 2017). This broadly suggests efficient transport of angular momentum in stellar interiors. The transport mechanism remains poorly understood (for a review, see Aerts et al. (2019)). Note that it has to be sustained in a broad range of radii without interruption; blocking it even in a narrow layer at some radius would isolate the core angular momentum, leaving the core with fast rotation. One possibility is turbulent transport,111Alternative processes include internal waves from nearby convection zones (Fuller et al., 2014) or large scale magnetic fields deposited from earlier stages of evolution (Kissin & Thompson, 2018; Takahashi & Langer, 2021). which operates in the presence of instabilities. However, hydrodynamic instabilities are typically inefficient and often inhibited in regions of strong compositional stratification present at the outer edge of evolving stellar cores (Heger et al., 2000). A more efficient mechanism likely invokes magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities. In particular, the Tayler instability (TI) of toroidal magnetic fields (Tayler, 1973; Spruit, 1999) is a promising MHD candidate because it develops in a stably stratified fluid more easily than other MHD instabilities (e.g. magnetic buoyancy (Acheson, 1979; Hughes, 1985; Spruit, 1999) and the magnetorotational instability (Wheeler et al., 2015; Jouve et al., 2020)). Differential rotation may naturally produce magnetic configurations prone to TI as it winds any existing radial magnetic field B_{R} into a much stronger toroidal magnetic field B_{\phi}. The instability is active in the polar regions of the rotating star, and the generated turbulence spreads from the poles toward the equatorial region along spherical shells of the fluid. It is unclear whether the generated turbulence supports a large-scale dynamo (i.e. whether it can amplify the large-scale B_{R}). However, this scenario, known as the Tayler-Spruit dynamo (Spruit, 2002), seems capable of explaining angular momentum transport. Its efficiency depends on the debated saturation level of the TI (Spruit, 2002; Fuller et al., 2019). Despite these uncertainties, angular momentum transport enabled by the TI is widely invoked as a leading explanation of the rotation rates measured in stellar interiors (Heger et al., 2005; Cantiello et al., 2014; Braithwaite & Spruit, 2017; Aerts et al., 2019; Ma & Fuller, 2019; Eggenberger et al., 2022; Schürmann et al., 2022; Rosales et al., 2024) . The linear stability analysis of the TI was recently revisited in our work Skoutnev & Beloborodov (2024) (SB24). We systematically examined each wave branch of the dispersion relation, which led to discovery of new unstable modes and revision of previously known modes. Our analysis also revealed the physical picture of the TI: instability of large-scale toroidal fields in rotating stars is mediated by microphysical diffusivities of the stellar plasma. While strong Coriolis forces hinder the TI, diffusive processes enable instability on length scales where diffusive and Coriolis timescales are comparable, allowing magnetic loops to rearrange and release magnetic energy. The TI can be enabled by the diffusion of the fluid momentum, magnetic field, temperature, and composition. The corresponding diffusivities will be denoted as \nu, \eta, \kappa_{\rm th}, and \kappa_{\mu}, respectively.222The diffusivities are determined by the local composition, temperature, and density. Generally, the thermal diffusivity (mediated by photons) is the largest, followed by the viscosity (mediated by ions and photons), and then by the compositional diffusivity (mediated by ions), so \kappa_{\rm th}>\nu>\kappa_{\mu}. The ratios Pm=\nu/\eta and Cm=\kappa_{\mu}/\eta can be smaller or larger than unity. SB24 extended the TI analysis to fluids with any magnetic Prandtl number Pm=\nu/\eta, including Pm\gg 1. The latter turns out to be the relevant limit for stars significantly more massive than the Sun, as will be shown in the present paper. In this paper, we complete the general analysis of TI in stars. First, we extend the results of SB24 to include both thermal and compositional stratification (only one type of stratification was considered in SB24) and summarize the instability criteria for each wave branch. The criteria are obtained by analytically solving for the growth rates and confirming with numerical solutions. The systematic analysis allows us to overcome some limitations of previous works. In particular, Spruit (1999) focused on stars with mass M\lesssim 1M_{\odot} where the magnetic diffusivity dominates over the viscous and compositional diffusivities. This limit is inapplicable in higher mass stars and in evolved low mass stars, where diffusivities vary by orders of magnitude across the wide range of temperatures and densities (Jermyn et al., 2022). Furthermore, the TI was previously treated with a heuristic approach based on a marginal stability calculation. It did not correctly distinguish the different wave branches of instability and, in some cases, led to incorrect identification of the wavenumbers of the most unstable modes. We also find that previous treatment of thermal+compositional stratification using an effective Brunt-Väisälä frequency (Spruit, 1999, 2002) is deficient. After formulating the new stability criteria (Section 2), we implement them in the MESA stellar evolution code (Paxton et al., 2010, 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019; Jermyn et al., 2023) and examine the onset of TI in stellar interiors (Section 3). The presence or absence of instability is of particular interest for the core-envelope transition in evolved stars. These transitional layers can act as a barrier for angular momentum transport because of strong compositional stratification left behind by nuclear shell burning. We find that TI remains unimpeded throughout stellar evolution only in sufficiently massive stars. In evolved low-mass stars, we find that the TI is inhibited by strong compositional gradients, contrary to previous expectations. This suggests that Tayler-Spruit dynamo may be unable to explain observations of strong core-envelope coupling on its own. Implications of the results are discussed in Section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08242v1,Viscous Heating and Instabilities in the Partially Ionized Solar Atmosphere,"In weak magnetic fields (\lesssim 50\,\mbox{G}), parallel and perpendicular viscosities, mainly from neutrals, may exceed magnetic diffusivities (Ohm, Hall, ambipolar) in the middle and upper chromosphere. Ion-driven gyroviscosity may dominate in the upper chromosphere and transition region. In strong fields (\gtrsim 100\,\mbox{G}), viscosities primarily exceed diffusivities in the upper chromosphere and transition region. Parallel and perpendicular viscosities, being similar in magnitude, dampen waves and potentially compete with ambipolar diffusion in plasma heating, potentially inhibiting Hall and ambipolar instabilities when equal. The perpendicular viscosity tensor has two components, \nu_{1} and \nu_{2}, which differ slightly and show weak dependence on ion magnetization. Their differences, combined with shear, may destabilize waves, though magnetic diffusion introduces a cutoff for this instability. In configurations with a magnetic field \bf{B} having vertical (b_{z}=B_{z}/|\bf{B}|) and azimuthal (b_{y}=B_{y}/|\bf{B}|) components, and a wavevector \bf{k} with radial (\hat{k}_{x}=k_{x}/|\bf{k}|) and vertical (\hat{k}_{z}=k_{z}/|\bf{k}|) components, parallel viscosity and Hall diffusion can generate the viscous-Hall instability. Gyroviscosity further destabilizes waves in the upper regions. These findings indicate that the solar atmosphere may experience various viscous instabilities, revealing complex interactions between viscosity, magnetic fields, and plasma dynamics across different atmospheric regions.","The dynamics of the partially ionized solar atmosphere, which govern the transport of mass, momentum, and energy across its stratified and magnetized layers, are notably complex. This complexity arises due to two primary factors. On one hand, the ionization state of the gas shifts from weakly ionized to partially ionized as we move from the photosphere through the chromosphere to the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona. On the other hand, the magnetic field strength varies dramatically, ranging from near zero to kG levels in both the quiet and active regions of the Sun (Sánchez Almeida & Lites, 2000; Dominguez Cerde\tilde{\mbox{n}}a et al., 2006). For instance, the photosphere, which comprises the visible (380-750\,\mbox{nm}) solar surface, extends vertically about 500 to 550 km. Here, the temperature decreases from around 6000\,K at the base to 4100\,K at the temperature minimum. In this layer, the plasma remains weakly ionized. Above the photosphere lies the chromosphere, named for its pinkish hue from the H\alpha (Balmer-\alpha) emission line at 656.3\,\mbox{nm}. The chromosphere, with a thickness of about 1-2\,\mbox{Mm}, starts from the weakly ionized temperature minimum and transitions to a partially ionized region at its top, where temperatures reach around \sim 2\times 10^{4}\,K. Throughout the chromosphere, temperature, density, ionization degree, and magnetic field strength vary significantly. A narrow transition region, only a few tens of kilometers thick, separates the chromosphere from the corona. In this region, the plasma temperature rises sharply to 10^{6}\,K, while the density drops from approximately 10^{11} to 10^{8-9}\,\mbox{cm}^{-3}. Consequently, the atmosphere transitions from partially ionized to almost fully ionized. With increasing temperature and decreasing density, the solar atmosphere also becomes optically thin in the transition region, though this may not always hold true, particularly during energetic and impulsive events like solar flares (Kerr et al., 2019). Moreover, relatively cool (T\sim 10^{4}\,\mbox{K}), dense (\sim 10^{10}-10^{11}\,\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}), large-scale (5-10^{2} Mm), and partially ionized (0.1-1) structures are also observed as \mbox{H}{\alpha}-emitting plasma embedded within the hotter corona. Our understanding of the solar magnetic field and its role in the transport of mass, energy, and angular momentum is still in its early stages. The magnetic field, generated in the Sun’s interior, is measured with the highest accuracy at the visible surface, the photosphere, and governs many of the physical processes in the solar atmosphere. Convective motions, both small- and large-scale, in the photospheric layers shuffle magnetic field lines, contributing to the buildup of magnetic energy in the corona (Parker 1987). While the small-scale dynamics of the photosphere are primarily driven by granular convection, the chromosphere is dominated by sound waves and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. For recent reviews on these processes, see Ballester et al. (2018); Srivastava at al. (2021); Soler & Ballester (2022); Soler (2024). In the partially ionized solar atmosphere, where the degree of ionization varies, the presence of neutrals leads to collisional momentum exchange with ions. This exchange can dampen waves and locally heat the plasma (Braginskii, 1965; Soler & Ballester, 2022). However, when the neutral-ion collision frequency is high compared to the signal frequency—i.e., when ions and neutrals are strongly coupled—ions acquire neutral inertia, leading to several important consequences (Pandey & Wardle, 2006, 2008; Pandey, 2013; Pandey & Wardle, 2022) (hereafter PW22) : 1. A single-fluid, MHD-like description of the partially ionized plasma becomes valid in this regime. 2. The phase speed of the Alfvén wave is reduced compared to the fully ionized case. 3. The ion-cyclotron frequency is re-scaled due to ion-mass loading and becomes a much lower Hall frequency. 4. The ion-Larmor radius is re-scaled and becomes significantly larger than in a fully ionized plasma. Although partially ionized solar plasma can be treated using an MHD-like, single-fluid framework, the magnetic field is not ”frozen” in the plasma. It slips through due to collisions between electrons, ions, and neutrals, manifesting as Ohm, Hall, and ambipolar diffusion in the induction equation. While Hall diffusion causes a dissipationless transport of the magnetic field, Ohm and ambipolar diffusion lead to energy dissipation. The role of ambipolar diffusion, in particular, has been a focus of recent research as a possible source of non-thermal heating in solar plasma (De Pontieu et al., 2011; Moll et al., 2011; Zaqarashvili et al., 2011a, b; Khomenko & Collados, 2012; Zaqarashvili et al., 2012, 2013; Leake et al., 2014; Gangadhara et al., 2014; Soler at al., 2009, 2015; Cally & Khomenko, 2015; Shelyag et al., 2016; Khomenko, 2017; Martínez–Gómez et al., 2017; Martínez–Sykora et al., 2017; Cally & Khomenko, 2018; Raboonik & Cally, 2019; Muthsam et al., 2021; Khomenko et al., 2021; Raboonik & Cally, 2021; Martínez–Sykora et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024; Masato et al., 2024). Magnetic field mediates vortex motion in the photosphere, chromosphere and lower corona (Tziotziou et al., 2023; Breu et al., 2023). Photospheric vortical motion can generate observable corotating structures in the chromosphere and corona, known as chromospheric swirls and magnetic tornadoes, spanning a wide range of spatial scales and extending from the upper convection zone to the transition region and lower corona (Kato & Wedemeyer, 2017; Kuniyoshi et al., 2023). Vortices and flows of various spatial and temporal scales are observed in both active and quiet phases of the solar atmosphere (Bonet et al., 2008; Wedemeyer-B\ddot{\mbox{o}}hm & Voort, 2009; Balmaceda et al., 2010; Bonet et al., 2010). Bright points associated with vortex motion in the intergranular lanes typically move at speeds of \lesssim 2\,\mbox{km}/\mbox{s} (Wedemeyer-B\ddot{\mbox{o}}hm & Voort, 2009). The formation of small-scale intergranular vortices suggests that vorticity arises from the interaction between photospheric plasma and the ambient magnetic field in intergranular lanes (Moll et al., 2011; Shelyag et al., 2011). Non-ideal MHD simulations indicate that Hall diffusion generates out-of-plane velocity fields with maximum speeds of \sim 0.1\,\mbox{km}/\mbox{s} at interface layers between weakly magnetized light bridges and neighboring strong-field umbral regions (Cheung & Cameron, 2012). In summary, both observational evidence and numerical simulations highlight the presence of shear flows at various spatial scales within the solar photosphere. The presence of large-scale shear flows can readily destabilize waves. For instance, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), which converts shear flow energy into vortex kinetic energy, has been proposed to explain the instability of flux tubes (Soler at al., 2010; Zaqarashvili at al., 2010; Kitiashvili et al., 2012). Additionally, magnetic field diffusion (Pandey & Wardle, 2012, 2013) and viscous momentum transport (PW22) can also drive non-ideal shear instabilities. This work presents a detailed investigation of various viscous instabilities, building upon our previous study (PW22) but with several key differences: (i) Unlike PW22, which assumed a vertical magnetic field and transverse fluctuations (vertical wavevector), the current study considers a more general magnetic field topology and oblique wavevectors. Overall, this study offers a broader and more general framework compared to PW22. It is worth noting that in this work, we describe the partially ionized solar plasma using an MHD-like framework. However, high-frequency, short-wavelength (on the order of a few meters) electrostatic waves can also be modeled using a multifluid approach (Gogoberidze et al., 2014). Given the current observational resolution of approximately 90 km, only MHD waves are directly relevant to observations. Nevertheless, electrostatic fluctuations may still have an indirect effect on the MHD waves propagating through the medium. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the basic set of equations and the dispersion relation. Subsection 2.1 describes the model solar atmosphere, followed by Subsection 2.2, which details the basic equations. In Subsection 2.3, the general dispersion relation is provided, along with an analysis of wave heating effects due to non-ideal MHD processes. Section 3 discusses the necessary conditions for the onset of viscous instabilities in the fluid and the role of magnetic diffusion in these instabilities. Section 4 addresses the application of the results, and Section 5 offers a brief summary of the findings."

During this flight it is possible to do other science measurements. One of these is an improved study of the solar wind particles through better particle identification and high resolution energy measurements. This study aimed to understand how well could the solar wind particles be identified using the planned detector but instead of using the veto array as an anti-coincidence it would be used as a \DeltaE energy sampling of a phoswich particle ID system.,"As a NASA Jump Start undergraduate at Wichita State University, double majoring in Aerospace Engineering and Physics, I am conducting research on the particle discrimination capabilities of the CubeSat detector using the \DeltaE-E method and measuring the energy spectrum. The focus of the \textnuSOL project is the detection and study of neutrinos, primarily from the Sun. The research goals of the \textnuSOL project is to utilize the 1/r^{2} neutrino flux with the Sun, determining the neutrino gravitational focus to the Sun, and observing dark matter candidates [1]. The CubeSat detector design features two different detector materials: Polyvinyltoluene (the Veto) and gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet (called GAGG). Both detector materials are scintillators. The whole detector includes four GAGG crystals that are enclosed within the Veto. The purpose of the GAGG is to measure the neutrino interaction on 71Ga that is characterized by a double pulse [1]. The purpose of the Veto is to act as a filter for the GAGG. Neutrinos likely will not interact with the Veto’s material, and in principle, any particles detected by the Veto should not be neutrinos. Therefore, any double pulse detected in the GAGG that occurs simultaneously with a pulse from the Veto is not considered as a neutrino interaction. The current plan is for the CubSsat detector prototype to go into low altitude Polar Earth orbit, with an orbital period of 90 minutes, attached to a CubeSat nanosatellite. The detector will be turned on in fifteen minute intervals while the CubeSat is oriented over Earth’s north and south poles. Eventually \textnuSOL plans to go into orbit around the Sun, within a distance of seven solar radii at perihelion. The purpose of the solar orbit is to take advantage of the higher flux of neutrinos at closer distances to the Sun. The overall goal of the \textnuSOL project is to present a new and innovative way of studying the Sun’s fusion core and the particle physics of neutrinos. The CubeSat is a test of the detector, but we can use it to study solar wind at Earth and near the Sun in final mission."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07881v1,Ion Temperature Measurements in the MAST-U Divertor During Steady State Plasmas and ELM Burn Through Phenomena,"This study presents ion temperature (T_{i}) measurements in the MAST-U divertor, using a Retarding Field Energy Analyzer (RFEA). Steady state measurements were made during an L-Mode plasma with the strike point on the RFEA. ELM measurements were made with the strike point swept over the RFEA. The scenarios are characterized by a plasma current (I_{p}) of 750 kA, line average electron density (n_{e}) between 1.6\times 10^{19} and 4.5\times 10^{19}\,\text{m}^{-3}, and Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) power ranging from 1.1 MW to 1.6 MW. The ion temperatures, peaking at approximately 10 eV in steady state, were compared with electron temperatures (T_{e}) obtained from Langmuir probes (LP) at the same radial positions. Preliminary findings reveal a T_{i}/T_{e} ratio in the divertor region less than 1 for shot 48008. High temporal resolution measurements captured the dynamics of Edge Localized Modes (ELMs) Burn Through, providing T_{i} data as a radial distance from the probe peaking around 20 eV.","The Retarding Field Energy Analyzer (RFEA) has proven to be a valuable diagnostic tool [1, 2] within MAST-U’s flexible divertor system, specifically integrated into the flat tile of the closed divertor chamber (Figure 1). This setup allows for the study of various advanced divertor configurations. The RFEA is used to measure the ion temperature (T_{i}) by analyzing the energy distribution of ions that pass through a series of biased grids. Transient power loading in divertor regions is a significant concern for the operation and longevity of future fusion reactors. The cyclic thermal stresses induced by these transients can lead to accelerated erosion or structural weakening of plasma-facing components (PFCs) [3]. Understanding and mitigating these effects are crucial for maintaining material integrity and ensuring the reliability of fusion devices. Accurate measurements of ion temperature (T_{i}) are essential for understanding these transient power loads, as they help characterize how energy is distributed and transferred within the divertor during events like ELMs, which are a major source of transient heat flux. A critical parameter in analyzing plasma behavior is the ion-to-electron temperature ratio (T_{i}/T_{e}). This ratio provides insights into the energy distribution between ions and electrons, impacting transport phenomena and stability within the plasma [4]. Accurate measurements of T_{i} and T_{e} are therefore essential for optimizing plasma performance and improving theoretical models. In this study, the RFEA was employed into the Divertor Science Facility (DSF), to conduct ion temperature (T_{i}) measurements under different plasma scenarios, focusing on two distinct shots. The first shot was an L-mode elongated divertor configuration where the plasma strike point was positioned consistently on the RFEA. This setup allowed for measurements of T_{i} using the RFEA and electron temperature (T_{e}) using Langmuir Probes (LPs)[5]. In the second shot, the plasma strike point was swept over the RFEA multiple times to capture the behavior of Edge Localized Modes (ELMs). During this shot, the RFEA recorded ion temperature data specifically during the ELM events. These ELMs represent bursts of energy that are significant in understanding transient power loads. The probe captured signals only during these events, which were associated with peaks in the D-alpha emission, as shown by the collector current and slit plate current signals (Figure 11). The measured signals correspond to ELM burn-through events, where the ELMs passed through the detachment layer and reached the probe surfaces. This behavior suggests that the plasma was in a detached state, and only the high-energy ELMs had enough energy to reach the probe through the neutral gas layer formed in the divertor Analyzing the interactions between these temperature profiles and other plasma parameters could provide deeper insights into the transient behaviors in tokamak plasmas. This paper discusses the results obtained from the analysis of this two shots using the RFEA data.

from Multiple Scattering Angles","Warm dense matter (WDM) plays an important role in astrophysical objects and technological applications, but the rigorous diagnostics of corresponding experiments is notoriously difficult. In this work, we present a model-free analysis of x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measurements at multiple scattering angles. Specifically, we analyze scattering data that have been collected for isochorically heated graphite at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Overall, we find good consistency in the extracted temperature between small and large scattering angles, whereas possible signatures of non-equilibrium may be hidden by the source function, and by the available dynamic spectral range. The present proof-of-principle study directly points to improved experimental set-ups for equation-of-state measurements and for the model-free study of relaxation times.","Acknowledgments This work was partially supported by the Center for Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS) which is financed by Germany’s Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and by the Saxon state government out of the State budget approved by the Saxon State Parliament.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06769v1,Landau Damping for Non-Maxwellian Distribution Functions,"Landau damping is one of the cornerstones of plasma physics. In the context of the mathematical framework developed by Landau in his original derivation of Landau damping, we examine the solutions of the linear Vlasov-Poisson system for different equilibrium velocity distribution functions, such as the Maxwellian distribution, \kappa distributions, and cut-off distributions without and with energy diffusion. Specifically, we focus on the full set of roots that the dispersion relation of the linear Vlasov-Poisson system generally admits, and we wonder if the full structure of solutions might hint at a deeper understanding of the Landau damping phenomenon.","Landau damping is the paradigmatic example of kinetic effects in plasma physics. It consists of an interaction mechanism between waves and particles in a collisionless plasma, which converts wave energy into particle kinetic energy. The damping phenomenon was mathematically predicted by Lev Landau in 1946 for one-dimensional electrostatic oscillations, and it was later identified in essentially all other modes of collective oscillations in plasmas. In this work, we study Landau damping for the linear Vlasov-Poisson system (LVP) in the context of Landau’s original initial value approach (Landau, 1946). Under the assumption of a uniform and static ion background, the linear Vlasov-Poisson system (LVP) describes high-frequency 1D electrostatic oscillations and it is given as \frac{\partial{f_{1}(x,v,t)}}{\partial{t}}+v\frac{\partial{f_{1}(x,v,t)}}{% \partial{x}}-\frac{e}{m}E(x,t)\frac{\partial{f_{0}(v)}}{\partial{v}}=0, (1) \frac{\partial{E}(x,t)}{\partial{x}}=-\frac{en_{0}}{\epsilon_{0}}\int\mathrm{d% }vf_{1}(x,v,t), (2) where E(x,t) is the electric field, e is the elementary charge, m is the electron mass and n_{0} is the equilibrium ion-electron number density. The function f(x,v,t)=f_{0}(v)+f_{1}(x,v,t) corresponds to the electron velocity distribution integrated over v_{y} and v_{z}, split into an equilibrium part f_{0}(v) and a perturbation part f_{1}(x,v,t). By following Landau and by assuming that f_{0}(v) is a Maxwellian distribution function, the evolution of the Fourier transformed electric field, E(k,t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}E(x,t)e^{-ikx}dx, is given as a linear combination of initial-value modes, E(k,t)=\sum_{n}A_{n}e^{-ip_{n}t}, (3) where p_{n}=\omega_{n}+i\gamma_{n} are the roots, with \gamma_{n}<0, of the dispersion relation k^{2}-{\omega^{2}_{p}\left[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\partial{f_{0}(v)}/% \partial{v}}{v-p/k}\mathrm{d}v+2i\pi\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial v}(p/k)% \right]}=0, (4) and \omega_{p}=\sqrt{e^{2}n_{0}/m_{e}\epsilon_{0}} is the plasma frequency. The present work is based on two interesting aspects related to the dispersion relation of (4): the total number of roots p_{n} and the generic evaluation of \partial f_{0}/\partial v at the complex value p/k. Firstly, (4) generally admits more than one root. However, in the literature it is common to focus solely on the root p_{n} with the largest imaginary part \gamma_{n}, as this root dominates the long-time behavior of (3). The aim of the present work is then to explore the multiple solutions that LVP admits and investigate how the structure of solutions is affected by equilibrium distribution functions f_{0}(v) that are not Maxwellian, such as the examples of Fig. 1. Figure 1: 1D distribution functions. See later sections for analytical definitions. Secondly, velocity distribution functions and their derivatives are generally defined as real-valued functions in the real variable v\in\mathbb{R}. Nonetheless, the term \partial f_{0}/\partial v(p/k) in (4), with p/k complex number, requires the redefinition of \partial f_{0}/\partial v as a complex variable function. For some distribution functions, e.g., Maxwellian, \kappa distributions (with integer \kappa), the redefinition can be performed naturally by simply replacing the real variable v\in\mathbb{R} with a complex one z\in\mathbb{C}. For others, e.g. incomplete distributions and \kappa distributions with non-integer \kappa, the redefinition can be performed neither continuously nor uniquely. The distinction between two groups of distribution functions, for which the term \partial f_{0}/\partial v(p/k) is either well or ill-defined, leads us to organize this work as follows. In Sec. 2 we follow the literature and provide the necessary mathematical background. In addition, we discuss how the assumption of Maxwellian f_{0}(v) can be relaxed and how the dispersion relation of (4) can be considered valid for non-Maxwellian distributions. In Sec. 3 we deal with the first group of distribution functions. Specifically, we show a simple argument to establish the number of roots, we describe analytically the strongly damped roots in the Maxwellian f_{0}(v) case, and we advance a tentative explanation for the physical meaning of the different solutions of LVP. In Sec. 4 we consider the second class of distribution functions. We mainly focus on the case of distribution functions with compact support, also known as cut-off distributions, that are defined through the Heaviside step function H(v) and that, as an example, are relevant for the description of non-thermal ions in fusion plasmas. We notice that different definitions are possible for the dispersion relation, and although this leads to the same E field evolution, we wonder if such an ambiguity might hide some deeper physical meaning. To investigate this, we employ different sigmoid functions to replace the Heaviside step function and observe how different root structures arise. Lastly, we briefly take two other cases into account, namely the slowing-down distribution function and \kappa distributions with non-integer \kappa parameters, and show the respective pole structures. As a final comment, it is worth mentioning that the plots of the dispersion relation in the form of (4) are the main investigation tool of this paper and, as analytical expressions are not always available, we heavily resort to the numerical scheme from Xie (2013), which allows the numerical evaluation of the integral in (4) for arbitrary distribution functions f_{0}(v)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06674v1,Z Pinch Kinetics II - A Continuum Perspective: Betatron Heating and Self-Generation of Sheared Flows,"Adiabatic compression of a self-magnetizing current filament (a Z pinch) is analyzed via the adiabatic invariants of its constituent cyclotron and betatron motions. Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) models are recovered for both trajectories but with distinct anisotropy axes, about the magnetic field for cyclotron fluid and about the electric current for betatron fluid. In particular, betatron heating produces agyrotropic anisotropy which balances with gyrophase mixing. A hybrid CGL model is proposed based on the local densities of cyclotron and betatron orbits, then validated by numerical experiments. The relation between anisotropy and shear is explored by constructing the kinetic equilibrium of a flow expanded in the flux function. Flow as a linear flux function is simply bi-Maxwellian, while higher powers display higher-moment deviations. Next, weakly collisional gyroviscosity (magnetized pressure-strain) is considered in a forward process (forced flow) and an inverse process (forced anisotropy). The forward process phase-mixes flow into a simple flux function, freezing flow into flux and inducing anisotropy. In the inverse process, betatron heating-induced anisotropy self-generates a sheared flow to resist changes in flux. This flow, arising from momentum diffusion, is concentrated in the betatron region.","The Z pinch is a quasineutral cylindrical filament of electric current conducted through a plasma, concentrating equilibrium plasma pressure energy in proportion to the self-magnetic energy of the current. The Z-pinch equilibrium was originally identified in 1934 by Willard H. Bennett, with the assistance of Llewellyn Thomas, as a hypothesis to explain the high-voltage breakdown of gases Bennett (1934), and termed “the magnetic pinch effect” in 1937 by Lewi Tonks Tonks (1937). The pinch as a fusion energy concept was extensively studied in the early, classified stage of fusion research Artsimovich (1962); Bostick (1977). Many works on pinch theory appeared at the time of fusion research declassification in 1958, at which time Lawson Lawson (1958) and Budker Budker (1956) independently explained how the concept of Bennett’s pinch also describes magnetically self-focused charged particle beams. A critical parameter of magnetic self-focusing was identified, now called the Budker parameter, given by Linhart (1959) \mathfrak{B}_{s}=N_{s}r_{s}=\frac{v_{ts}^{2}}{v_{s}^{2}}=\frac{I_{s}}{I_{A,s}}% =\frac{r_{p}^{2}}{4r_{L,s}^{2}}=\frac{r_{p}^{2}}{4\lambda_{s}^{2}}=\frac{(% \omega_{cs}\tau_{s})^{2}}{4}=\sigma_{s}\mathrm{Ha}^{2}. (1) The manifold nature of Eq. 1 is emphasized, as various authors use the same parameter under different names. Here N_{s} represents particles of species s per unit length, r_{s} the classical particle radius, v_{ts} species thermal velocity, v_{s} species partial drift velocity, I_{s} species partial current, I_{A,s} species Alfvén limiting current Alfvén (1939), r_{L,s} Larmor radius, \lambda_{s} skin depth, r_{p} the pinch radius, \omega_{cs} species cyclotron frequency, \tau_{s}=r_{p}/v_{ts} species thermal crossing time, \mathrm{Ha} the Hartmann number of the flow pinch, and the factors \sigma_{s} are \sigma_{e}=\sqrt{m_{i}/m_{e}} and \sigma_{i}=\sigma_{e}^{-1}. Additional key parameters of charge neutralization fraction f_{n} and relativistic \gamma-factor were noted in 1959 by Lawson Lawson (1959). The relations of Eq. 1 involving species velocity hold for both electrons and ions in the Lorentz frame where the two are counter-streaming and thus perfectly charge neutralized (for f_{n}=1). The relations of Eq. 1 are derived with commentary in the prequel Crews, Meier, and Shumlak (2024). The Budker parameter measures the ratios of: temperature to drift-kinetic energy, plasma current to Alfvén limiting current, characteristic Larmor radius/skin depth to pinch radius, the species dynamical Hall parameter, and the magnitude of electromagnetic to viscoresistive hydrodynamic forces. Perhaps most importantly, \mathfrak{B}_{s} measures the magnetization of orbits. When \mathfrak{B}_{s}\gtrsim 1, a non-negligible part of the canonical ensemble form cyclotron orbits, initially in the periphery where magnetic flux density is high. The remaining particles in the current-dense core follow betatron orbits, a radially bouncing, axis-encircling drift motion associated with magnetically self-focused but “unmagnetized” streams. The prequel Crews, Meier, and Shumlak (2024) shows that the ensemble-averaged canonical momentum P_{z} passes from an unbound state P_{z}>0 to a bound state P_{z}<0 through \mathfrak{B}_{s}=1, analogous to the positive and negative energies of gravitational or electrostatic binding Arnold (2013); Crews, Meier, and Shumlak (2024). The limit \mathfrak{B}_{s}\to 0 is the negligible self-field neutralized beam limit (typically with \gamma\gg 1), while \mathfrak{B}_{s}\to\infty is the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit Finkelstein and Sturrock (1959). For neutralized beams, MHD modes are thought to be stabilized by betatron orbit effects Bennett (1955); Finkelstein and Sturrock (1959), with a residual stabilizing effect when \mathfrak{B}_{i}>1 in the “large ion Larmor radius” (LLR) regime Haines (2001) (\mathfrak{B}_{i}\approx\mathcal{O}(10)). Interestingly, the terms “LLR Z pinch” and “neutralized ion beam above the Alfvén limit” are synonymous in the perfectly neutral Lorentz frame but not synonymous in the laboratory frame, distinguished by the laboratory-frame axial velocity of the ion betatron orbits. The term “neutralized beam above the Alfvén limit” is usually applied to electrons in the relativistic regime Santos et al. (2018). Betatron resonance is receiving increasing attention in the context of plasmas forced by lasers near the critical density Arefiev et al. (2024). The frame-dependent syzygy of neutralized ion beams and LLR Z pinches in the \mathfrak{B}_{i}\approx 1 regime is closely related to the notorious Z-pinch beam-target fusion mechanism Vikhrev and Korolev (2007). Experimental Thomson scattering measurements on the Fusion Z-Pinch Experiment (FuZE) Goyon et al. (2024) suggest that the deuterium Budker parameter \mathfrak{B}_{d}\approx 20 at the time of neutron radiation, while for the electrons \mathfrak{B}_{e}\approx 7\times 10^{4}. Neutron isotropy measurements on FuZE have been found to be inconsistent with typical Z-pinch beam-target fusion mechanisms Mitrani et al. (2021), suggesting LLR Z-pinch laboratory-frame ion dynamics and thereby motivating the present study of kinetic effects in flow pinches. In the prequel, the distribution of orbits was studied in the transitional magnetization regime (i.e., moderate ion Budker parameters, or the LLR regime). It was found that plasma species density is decomposable into betatron and cyclotron orbital densities, n_{s}=n_{\beta,s}+n_{c,s}. The net density n_{s} is fully composed of betatron orbits as r\to 0, fully of cyclotron orbits as r\to\infty, and partially of both at intermediate radii within a transition layer through which current conduction switches from betatron to diamagnetic cyclotron conduction. By considering the canonical distribution (the Bennett pinch), the location and thickness of this transition layer relative to the pinch radius was found to depend only on \mathfrak{B}_{s}, and lies close to the pinch radius in the LLR regime. This kinetic description of the Bennett pinch is a diffuse example of Kotelnikov’s theory of sharp diamagnetic layers in the Gas Dynamic Trap Kotelnikov (2020). Some current conduction by betatron orbits appears to be a necessary element of \beta\geq 1 plasma configurations Timofeev, Kurshakov, and Berendeev (2024). In this second work on Z-pinch kinetics, we apply the results of the prequel to the topics of collisionless adiabatic compression, kinetic equilibrium, and self-organization of sheared flows in the Z pinch. Collisionless momentum and heat fluxes in the intermediate magnetization regime are of particular interest to flow Z-pinch dynamics because Braginskii-type closures Braginskii (1965) do not describe the betatron-orbiting part of the plasma column even on moderately collisional timescales. On the weakly collisional timescales, phase-space mixing produces effective dissipation. While this allows hydrodynamic intuition to be applied somewhat to collisionless dynamics Du et al. (2020); Bandyopadhyay et al. (2023), kinetic effects can lead to unexpected phenomena such as flow-organizing and flow-generating viscosity Del Sarto, Pegoraro, and Califano (2016); Del Sarto and Pegoraro (2017). Collisionless momentum fluxes are often studied in the context of the magnetized pressure-strain (or Pi-D) interaction Yang et al. (2017), coinciding in the collisional limit with gyroviscosity Kaufman (1960). The collisionless viscosity associated with magnetized shear flows is observed to be an important element of astrophysical plasma turbulence at the ion scale Hellinger, Petr et al. (2024), for example in the magnetosphere Bandyopadhyay et al. (2020) and solar wind Pezzi et al. (2019). A thorough discussion of the pressure-strain interaction can be found in a series of articles by Cassak and Barbhuiya et al Cassak and Barbhuiya (2022); Cassak, Barbhuiya, and Weldon (2022); Barbhuiya and Cassak (2022). Because LLR Z pinches are themselves on the ion inertial scale, flow pinch physics naturally parallels the astrophysical studies. Notably, the phase space signature of the unmagnetized pressure-strain interaction has recently been studied and found to be closely related to the field-particle correlation Conley et al. (2024), suggesting a fruitful line of investigation for similar relationships in the kinetic theory of magnetized flows. This work makes several novel contributions to Z-pinch physics which should be of interest to the general fusion community, including: • An adiabatic model for anisotropic response to rapid fluctuations, applicable to both the cyclotron and betatron fluids (Section III, subsequently validated in Section VI), • A class of kinetic equilibria where axial flow is a power series in the flux function, demonstrating increasingly non-thermal features with higher powers in the flux (Section IV), • A study of dynamic kinetic gyroviscosity on weakly collisional timescales, in which gyro-phase mixing rapidly brings forced shear flows towards kinetic equilibrium (Section V.2.2), • Demonstration of spontaneous shear flow generation due to flux compression of the betatron fluid, exhibiting reactive resistance to rapid changes in magnetic flux (Section V.3), • An equivalence between the characteristic anisotropy of an Alfvénic sheared flow with the Budker parameter, indicating increased kinetic-instability-mediated viscosity in the low ion Budker regime (Section V.5), These results are developed as follows. First, Section II considers conditions for kinetic processes faster than the thermalization time, Section III develops a model for the anisotropy produced by fast compression, and Section IV presents a theory of kinetic flow-pinch equilibrium. Collisionless gyroviscosity (magnetized pressure-strain interactions) is discussed in Section V, while Section VI concludes with a numerical validation of the anisotropy model."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06669v1,Z Pinch Kinetics I - A Particle Perspective: Transitional Magnetization and Cyclotron and Betatron Orbits,"Single-particle orbits are investigated as the basis of a coherent kinetic theory. Analytic solutions including azimuthal circulation are obtained in elliptic functions, of which ideal cyclotron and betatron motions are limiting solutions. The elliptic modulus depends on a trapping parameter and an axis-encircling to axial-drift kinetic energy ratio. Large trapping parameters limit to guiding-center cyclotron motion, while small trapping parameters describe ideal betatron motion. The analytic solutions inform a separation of phase space into trapped and passing trajectories, with which the Bennett solution is decomposed into cyclotron and betatron distributions. The two partial densities are computed to reveal a transitional magnetization layer the extent of which depends only on an ensemble-averaged trapping parameter, equivalent to: the Budker parameter, the pinch-to-Alfvén current ratio, the Larmor radius parameter squared, the Hall parameter squared, the drift parameter squared, and the Hartmann number squared. The interplay of diamagnetic current and axial betatron flux is clarified through partial current densities, and the radial electric fields of shear flows are observed to influence ion orbits particularly around unity Budker parameter.","The Z pinch is a quasineutral plasma filament which conducts current along its axis, thereby confining pressure through its self-induced magnetic field. While Z pinches were one of the first plasma confinement concepts for a fusion reactor due to their simple linear geometry and high density Shumlak (2020), they are susceptible to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities that disrupt the current Kadomtsev (1966). Historically, Z-pinch experiments have focused on utilizing the unstable Z pinch as a neutron and x-ray source Vikhrev and Korolev (2007). Recent years have seen significant progress in stabilizing the Z pinch by the use of sheared flows to mitigate the MHD instabilities Shumlak et al. (2001). Electron temperatures of multiple keV, measured via optical Thomson scattering Levitt et al. (2024), have been observed in flow Z-pinch experiments to be temporally coincident with measurements of neutron emission Zhang et al. (2019); Mitrani et al. (2021). The self-magnetic field of the Z pinch has an associated magnetic null on its axis. Magnetic flux density increases from zero on-axis up to a maximum around the pinch radius. For this reason, particles in a Z pinch display variable magnetization, orbiting around magnetic field lines in the magnetized periphery, orbiting through or about the \hat{z}-axis within the current-dense core, and displaying either kind of motion in-between, depending on particle energy and momentum, within a transitional magnetization layer. Through analysis of single-particle orbits, this article explores and clarifies the transitional magnetization regime of Z-pinch orbits. Kinetic theory, in which plasma is described statistically by a probability density in phase space known as the distribution function, is fundamental to an understanding of plasma properties outside of the MHD regime. The distribution function is used to calculate observables of a plasma species such as density, temperature, and pressure. Distribution functions are understood using kinetic theory, which studies the transport of particles, momentum, and energy at various degrees of collisionality and trajectory magnetization, but is high-dimensional and challenging to use for large-scale modeling, such as predictive whole device modeling used for fusion energy development Datta, Meier, and Shumlak (2024). Simpler hydrodynamic models obtained by kinetic-theory-informed closures are used for predictive and interpretive modeling of Z-pinch plasmas. Therefore, plasma kinetics is the starting point for more commonly used plasma models. The statistical description and single-particle dynamics are complementary approaches to understanding plasma behavior. Prediction of key observables is enabled by the ensemble-averaged statistics of the distribution function, while individual trajectories provide particular details. The dynamical equation for the distribution function unites these two perspectives, determining many-particle observables from the self-consistent dynamics of many trajectories. As plasma dynamics involves such collective, many-particle motions, a full understanding of kinetic theory therefore necessitates a deep understanding of the various trajectories in a plasma configuration. This work studies the single-particle orbits for varying degrees of magnetization, while a companion article (“the sequel”) considers the continuum, many-particle description Crews, Meier, and Shumlak (2024). Specifically, this study investigates and classifies orbits in the Z-pinch configuration using the effective potential energy method. The objective is to understand the conditions when ions are well-magnetized in the self-field of a pinched electric current, as ion magnetization is a fundamental property that has profound implications for collective plasma behavior, transport phenomena, wave propagation, instabilities, and the overall dynamics of plasmas on collisionless timescales. The magnetized orbit of a particle, known as cyclotron or Larmor motion, consists of a circular or helical trajectory of radius r_{L}, called the gyroradius, about a magnetic field line. Guiding-center theory, based on adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment Northrop (1961), describes the corrections to cyclotron motion in inhomogenous fields with a scale length L large compared to the orbital gyroradius (r_{L}\ll L). Most orbits in plasmas magnetized by external magnetic fields are well-approximated by guiding-center theory. A notable exception occurs for self-magnetized, current-carrying plasmas which are characterized by magnetic nulls where magnetic flux density is zero. Orbits in the vicinity of magnetic nulls are not adequately described by guiding-center theory. Such motions beyond the guiding-center approximation are referred to in the literature as non-Larmor orbits Che et al. (2018), large Larmor radius orbits Ripin et al. (1987), Speiser orbits George and Jahn (2020), or simply betatron orbits Åkerstedt (1990). Non-Larmor magnetic orbits are of central importance in charged particle beams and particle accelerators Davidson and Qin (2001). Early studies of electric currents in the magnetosphere and laboratory plasmas identified the importance of magnetic null regions within magnetized plasmas, which were originally known as neutral surfaces Alfvén (1968). These neutral surfaces may separate regions of oppositely directed magnetic fields (thus supporting planar current sheets or X-points) or may be found at the center of current-carrying filaments (for cylindrical current pinches). Such magnetic null surfaces associated with current-carrying self-magnetized plasmas are the source of a multitude of instabilities which are studied under the umbrellas of magnetic reconnection and the stability of current pinches. An important element in understanding these neutral surfaces is the analysis of single-particle orbits in the vicinity of the magnetic null. Historically, non-Larmor orbits occuring in magnetic reconnection have received the most attention, usually in the context of understanding particle energization by the Earth’s magnetotail. In 1957, E. N. Parker studied orbits around the null point of planar current sheets, identifying classes of orbits and obtaining some analytic results in elliptic integrals Parker (1957). T. W. Speiser (1965), interested in particle energization in the magnetotail, built on Parker’s results and considered orbits near the magnetic null in the presence of current-parallel electric fields Speiser (1965, 1967). B. U. Ö. Sonnerup (1971) notably built on both previous works by analysis of the orbital adiabatic invariants and further developed the results in elliptic integrals Sonnerup (1971). An important later work by Büchner and Zelenyi (1989) described orbit energization beyond adiabatic invariance via determininstic chaos and stochasticity Büchner and Zelenyi (1989). Stochasticity of non-Larmor orbits became recognized as critical for the so-called diffusion region of a reconnecting current sheet Hesse et al. (1999), which subsequently took on a more nuanced perspective as a competition between Fermi and betatron acceleration mechanisms Dahlin, Drake, and Swisdak (2014), with non-Larmor curvature drifts also found to drive heating Alves, Zrake, and Fiuza (2019) and scattering Lemoine (2023). TenBarge, Juno, and Howes (2024) recently utilized continuum kinetic simulation capabilities to directly study electron energization in reconnection and focused on the way in which non-Larmor orbits control the process TenBarge, Juno, and Howes (2024). Beyond heating, non-gyrotropic pressure anisotropy resulting from magnetized pressure-strain interactions has been recognized to play an important role in the reconnection process through the modification of transport coefficients Che et al. (2018). A. J. Brizard (2017) built on the earlier work of Parker, Sonnerup, and others by presenting a solution in elliptic functions for trajectories in a linearly varying magnetic field, with the motivation of studying the applicability of guiding-center theory Brizard (2017). Single-particle orbits in the area of current pinches has its origin in the Alfvén current limit Alfvén (1939) (1939), beyond which a stream of non-neutralized electrons turns around in its self-field. W. H. Bennett (1934) determined the kinetic equilibrium and the well-known Bennett pinch profiles occuring in quasi-thermal equilibrium, but did not consider orbits Bennett (1934). In summarizing the Bennett pinch, O. Buneman (1961) noted that particle orbits could be found in principle but did not go farther than describing the method of invariants Buneman (1961). P. Gratreau (1978) made a comprehensive analysis of pinch orbits while describing a class of generalized Bennett equilibria. M. G. Haines (1978) explained how “singular orbits” about the magnetic axis (Sonnerup’s “meandering orbits”) displayed an ion flux from anode to cathode (in the absence of bulk ion velocity) cancelled by an oppositely directed diamagnetic current Haines (1978). Haines emphasized the importance of betatron-type ion orbits throughout his career, utilizing them to theoretically explain the formation of ion beams in m=0 instabilities, among other aspects of Z-pinch physics Haines (1983, 2001, 2011). As a type of self-field current pinch, betatron-type orbits also play a key role in field-reversed configuration (FRC) plasmas Belova et al. (2003). Indeed, the FRC s-parameter, which measures the fraction of ion betatron orbits, plays the same role for FRCs as the Budker parameter determined in the present work for Z pinches; both are linked to the ratio of ion Larmor radius to plasma size. Notable contributions of this work to the study of magnetically self-focused plasmas include: • Demonstration of the equivalence between Speiser orbits and axis-crossing betatrons of the pinch, unifying reconnection and pinch orbit theories (Section II.4), • Development of complete analytic orbital solutions including azimuthal circulation, parametrized by a magnetic trapping parameter and kinetic energy anisotropy (Section II.7), • Formulation of a generic trapping criterion including axis-encircling motion (Section II.7.2), • Characterization of the betatron/cyclotron phase-space boundary (Section III.1), • Novel division of the canonical distribution into trapped and passing orbits (Section III.2), • Observation of a transitional layer between trapped and passing orbits (Section III.3), • Demonstration that the location and thickness of the transitional magnetization layer depends only on the Budker parameter (Section III.4), and its equivalance with: – an ensemble-averaged magnetic trapping parameter, – the finite Larmor radius (FLR) parameter (squared), – the characteristic Hall parameter (squared), – the Alfvén current scale, – the characteristic Hartmann number (squared), – and the inverse drift parameter (squared). • Discussion of counter-balancing betatron fluxes and diamagnetic fluxes (Section III.5). The flow pinch orientation \bm{j}\cdot\bm{v}<0 is observed to reduce the laboratory-frame ion betatron flux. These results are progressively developed from the orbital solutions in Section II, by fixing the electric fields and the frame of reference in Section II.1, followed by a description of the effective potential method in Section II.2 and a high-level description of orbits in Section II.3. The properties of orbits are studied analytically, first for axis-crossing trajectories without angular momentum in Section II.4 and later for non-zero angular momentum in Section II.7. Section III, informed by the analytic orbits, proposes a novel splitting of the distribution function based on its degree of magnetization and averages this splitting over the kinetic equilibrium distribution of the Bennett pinch. Finally, Section IV considers the influence of radial electric fields in radially sheared axial flows on the degree of orbit magnetization. The analytic properties of these orbits are applied in the sequel, which progressively treats Z-pinch kinetic theory topics from the continuum perspective Crews, Meier, and Shumlak (2024). The sequel discusses several topics mentioned in the historical survey above, specialized for the sheared-flow Z pinch: adiabatic and doubly adiabatic compression, anisotropy production, kinetic equilibrium of sheared flows, the magnetized pressure-strain interaction, and consequences of gyroviscosity in a magnetic field such as the self-organization and self-generation of flows. The discussion of collisionless adiabatic compression of a Z pinch utilizes the adiabatic invariants of betatron orbits (similar to Sonnerup’s analysisSonnerup (1971)), drawing heavily on the results obtained in this work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06644v1,Integrated modelling of equilibrium and transport in axisymmetric magnetic mirror fusion devices,"This paper presents the Hammir tandem mirror design based on Realta Fusion’s first-of-a-kind model for axisymmetric magnetic mirror fusion performance. This model uses an integrated end plug simulation model including, heating, equilibrium, and transport combined with a new formulation of the plasma operation contours (POPCONs) technique for the tandem mirror central cell. Using this model, it is shown that an end plug utilizing high temperature superconducting magnets and modern neutral beams enables a classical tandem mirror pilot plant producing a fusion gain Q > 5. The approach here represents an important advance in tandem mirror design. The high fidelity end plug model enables calculations of heating and transport in the highly non-Maxwellian end plug to be made more accurately and the central cell POPCON technique allows consideration of a wide range of parameters in the relatively simple near-Maxwellian central cell, facilitating the selection of more optimal central cell plasmas. These advances make it possible to find more conservative classical tandem mirror fusion pilot plant operating points with lower \beta, temperatures, neutral beam energies, and end plug performance than designs in the literature. Despite being more conservative, it is shown that these operating points can still form the basis of a viable fusion pilot plant.","1 The compact mirror approach to fusion Magnetic mirrors have several variants. This work will focus on the simple mirror and the ""classical"" tandem mirror. The simple mirror is a fusion configuration which confines plasma in a magnetic field well created by two large electromagnets using the magnetic mirror force, \boldsymbol{F}=-\mu_{m}\bnabla B arising from the conservation of the magnetic moment \mu_{m}=mv_{\perp}^{2}/B, where v_{\perp} is the perpendicular component of a particle’s velocity, m is a particle’s mass, and B is the background magnetic field. The ratio of the magnetic field at the center of the well B_{0} and at the edge of the well in the center of the electromagnet, sometimes referred to as the mirror throat B_{m}, is known as the mirror ratio R_{m}=B_{m}/(B_{0}\sqrt{1-\beta}). The factor of \sqrt{1-\beta}, where \beta=2\mu_{0}p/B_{0}^{2}, in the mirror ratio equation comes from plasma diamagnetism. Particles with low enough parallel velocity, v_{\parallel}\leq v_{\perp}\sqrt{R_{m}-1}, remain trapped in the magnetic mirror and leak out through collisions (and in some cases kinetic instabilities generated by the plasma’s distribution function). It is known that if high energy neutral beams are injected into a simple mirror particle confinement times \tau_{p}\sim 1~{}\mathrm{s} are achievable in theory (Post, 1987), but in practice under realistic engineering and physics constraints it is unlikely that a simple mirror can generate a fusion gain Q=P_{\mathrm{fus}}/P_{\mathrm{heat}}\gg 1 (Freidberg, 2007; Forest et al., 2024). The classical tandem magnetic mirror was designed to overcome this limitation (Dimov et al., 1976; Fowler & Logan, 1977). In a tandem mirror, a central cell consisting of a long solenoid is flanked by two simple mirror end plugs. Intense heating power is directed into the end plugs to create hot, dense, plasmas. This causes a large electrostatic potential drop between the end plugs and the lower density central cell. The potential difference confines an effectively Maxwellian ignited plasma in the central cell. Tandem mirrors can achieve very large confinement times in the central cell \tau_{p}\sim 10~{}\mathrm{s}, overall system gains much greater than unity, and operate in steady-state without the risk of destructive plasma disruptions. However, early analysis of classical tandem mirrors suggested that they would require very large ratios of end plug to central cell density, mirror ratios, and plasma temperatures that were outside of the capabilities of the technology available at the time (Dimov et al., 1976; Fowler & Logan, 1977). Because of this, other options for enhancing tandem performance such as ""thermal barriers"" were pursued in historical tandem mirror designs until the eventual discontinuation of the US mirror development program (Baldwin & Logan, 1979; Logan, 1983; Post, 1987). The new magnetic mirror development program being undertaken by Realta Fusion takes advantage of a number of key enabling technology and physics breakthroughs that can greatly enhance the performance of the magnetic mirror to revive the tandem mirror fusion plant concept: high-energy negative-ion neutral beams (Kashiwagi et al., 2021; Serianni et al., 2023), modern high-frequency gyrotrons (Rzesnicki et al., 2022; ARPA-E, 2023), HTS magnets (Michael et al., 2017; Whyte, 2019), and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stabilization of axisymmetric mirrors (Beklemishev et al., 2010; Ryutov et al., 2011; Endrizzi et al., 2023). These advancements allow less complex magnetic mirrors to be constructed with planar HTS coils that reach substantially higher fields and mirror ratios than previous magnetic mirror experiments and can dramatically improve tandem mirror performance (Fowler et al., 2017). Presently, Realta is sponsoring research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on the Wisconsin High-Temperature Superconducting Axisymmetric Magnetic Mirror (WHAM) experiment, an axisymmetric mirror using two custom 17~{}\mathrm{T} HTS magnetic field coils built by Commonwealth Fusion Systems. A comprehensive description of the WHAM experiment is available in Endrizzi et al. (2023). The next step device, Anvil, will be a large simple mirror constructed by Realta Fusion to serve as an end plug physics demonstrator and fusion technology test platform. Anvil will be a similar class of device to the break-even axisymmetric mirror (BEAM) described in Forest et al. (2024). The Realta Fusion tandem mirror pilot plant Hammir is the final step on Realta Fusion’s technology development roadmap and will be the focus of this paper. Hammir will be a smaller, more conservative, axisymmetric tandem mirror than those identified in the Fowler et al. (2017) analysis, which considered only axisymmetric tandem mirrors with \beta\sim 1, very high temperatures T_{i}=T_{e}=150~{}\mathrm{keV}, high energy 1~{}\mathrm{MeV} neutral beams, and large fusion power outputs P_{fus}>1~{}\mathrm{GW}. It will be shown in this work that smaller classical tandem mirrors with significantly lower \beta, temperature, beam energies, and fusion power are still competitive with other fusion concepts and compatible with the requirements for a commercial fusion plant identified by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) “Bringing Fusion to the U.S. Grid” report (Hawryluk et al., 2021), specifically: • Electrical gain: Q_{e}=P_{\mathrm{ele,out}}/P_{\mathrm{ele,in}}>1 • Continuous net electricity P_{\mathrm{ele,out}}>50~{}\mathrm{MWe} for at least 3 hours (or the process heat equivalent in the case of a industrial process heat use case) To simplify tandem mirror modelling, this work takes advantage of the properties of the classical tandem mirror to split up the modelling problem. The central cell and the end plug are handled using separate models that are then coupled together. The complicated non-Maxwellian end plug which undergoes intense heating is analyzed using a high fidelity integrated simulation model, whereas, the simpler near-Maxwellian central cell is extrapolated based on the end plug parameters using a novel version of the Plasma OPeration CONtour (POPCON) technique (Cordey et al., 1981; Houlberg et al., 1982). This approach allows larger parameter spaces to be considered and breaks the tandem mirror design problem down to a few key engineering and physics parameters which are important to design such as the plasma radius at the high field mirror coil throat a_{m}, the field at the mirror throat B_{m}, and the end plug density n_{p}. These are key steps to developing effective pilot plant designs, and successful tokamak designs also have used multifidelity models and identified analogous design parameters such as the minor radius a, major radius R, on axis field B_{0}, and plasma current I_{p} (Sorbom et al., 2015; Creely et al., 2020; Buttery et al., 2021; Frank et al., 2022b; The MANTA Collaboration et al., 2024). The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the new RealTwintm integrated model for a Hammir end plug. Section 3 determines what end plug parameters are required for a viable Hammir fusion power plant using a central cell POPCON. Section 4 identifies an optimal operating point for the Hammir end plug which satisfies the end plug requirements identified by the POPCONs in Section 3 under realistic physics and engineering constraints using the RealTwin model. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the work, identifying key capability gaps discovered during the Hammir design process and plans to address them in the future."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06547v1,Effects of Laser Polarization on Target Focusing and Acceleration in a Laser-Ion Lens and Accelerator (LILA),"We present the process of ion acceleration using ultra-thin foils irradiated by elliptically polarized, high-intensity laser pulses. Recently, efficient generation of monoenergetic ion beams was introduced using the concept of laser-ion lensing and acceleration (LILA) (Wang et al., 2021). LILA is an innovative technique where the target’s radially varying thickness enables simultaneous acceleration and focusing of a proton beam. In this work, we extend the LILA framework to incorporate elliptically polarized (EP) laser pulses. While it’s commonly assumed that EP lasers are unsuitable for radiation pressure acceleration (RPA) due to excessive electron heating that compromises ion acceleration, our multidimensional particle-in-cell simulations challenge this notion. We show that, with proper optimization of the target’s average thickness, EP laser pulses can successfully drive the LILA mechanism. We also demonstrate that with a non-uniform thickness target, even linearly polarized laser pulses can efficiently generate low-emittance focused ion beams, with the overall laser-to-ions energy conversion comparable to those predicted for circularly polarized laser pulses.","The generation of compact ion beams from laser- plasma interactions has garnered significant interest due to their low emittance and monoenergetic energy peak. These ion beams have a range of applications, including fast ignition of fusion targets (Tabak et al., 1994; Atzeni et al., 2002), hadron cancer therapy (Dyer et al., 2008; Patel et al., 2003; Kroll et al., 2022), and particle nuclear physics (Bulanov et al., 2002; Yogo et al., 2009; Bolton et al., 2010; Hannachi et al., 2007). These ion beams are generated using two widely popular schemes: Radiation Pressure Acceleration (RPA) (Esirkepov et al., 2004; Macchi et al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2008; Qiao et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2021; Jihoon Kim, 2023) and Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) (Wilks et al., 2001; Shen et al., 2021). In the RPA scheme, an electron sheath is driven forward by laser radiation pressure, inducing a charge-separation electrostatic field that drags and accelerates ions in the direction of the electron sheath. In TNSA, laser-heated electrons escape through the rear surface, generating an electrostatic sheath field that accelerates ions from the rear surface of the target. Both schemes act on opposite surfaces of a target and may function either independently (Kim et al., 2016) or synergistically (Qiao et al., 2009; Ziegler et al., 2024), depending on laser intensity and target geometry. A trivial target shape, viz. flat foil, is highly susceptible to the laser’s transverse spot size (Dollar et al., 2012) and polarization (Bulanov et al., 2015). The transverse spot size can cause the thin foil to expand in the transverse dimension, leading to relativistic self-induced transparency (RSIT) (Qiao et al., 2009; Kar et al., 2012; Scullion et al., 2017). While RSIT can accelerate ions to high energies (Ziegler et al., 2024; Gonzalez-Izquierdo et al., 2016a, b), it relies heavily on selective ion acceleration. Instead of accelerating the entire target foil, only a small overdense electron layer is accelerated via radiation pressure, which results in a localized ion layer with a broad, non-monoenergetic energy distribution. Therefore, it is crucial for the target to remain opaque during the laser-target interaction. Another challenge with a trivial target shape is the onset of instabilities, such as Weibel and Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabilities (Palmer et al., 2012; Khudik et al., 2014), which breaks the front surface and reduce ion acceleration efficiency. Some of these effects can be mitigated by shaping the target such that target density increases with acceleration, thereby preventing self-induced transparency. Based on TNSA, several studies have proposed ion focusing using a plasma-based microlens Toncian et al. (2006) or by shaping a thin foil into a hemisphere (Patel et al., 2003; Snavely et al., 2007; Offermann et al., 2011) with a guiding cone positioned behind it (Bartal et al., 2012; Qiao et al., 2013; McGuffey et al., 2020). Although TNSA is not significantly affected by Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabilities, it is less efficient for accelerating heavy ions and often requires post-acceleration energy selection to achieve the desired emittance, as its broad (exponential) energy spectrum can reduce overall efficiency. Recently, the Laser-Ion Lens and Acceleration (LILA) concept, based on light-sail radiation pressure acceleration, has been introduced to produce collimated, high-flux, high-energy ion bunches (Wang et al., 2021). LILA operates similarly to an optical lens; however, instead of focusing light, it focuses a matter target shaped like a lens to a dense focal point using intense photon radiation pressure. Figure 1 illustrates the interaction of a laser with a thin overdense target, whose thickness decreases from the center toward its edges in a parabolic profile (stage I). For a Gaussian laser pulse interacting with a parabolic target of radius R_{0}, the radially dependent thickness, d(r_{0}), of the target is defined as: d(r_{0})=d_{0}exp(-r^{2}/R_{c}^{2})exp(-r^{2}/\sigma_{L}^{2}), where r is the transverse coordinate, d_{0} is the target thickness at its center, R_{c} is the radius of curvature, and \sigma_{L} is the size of the laser’s focal spot. Due to this shape, the outer (thinner) regions of the target accelerate faster than the central (thicker) region, causing the initially flat target to curve forward (stage II; Fig. 1) and focus into a small volume (stage III; Fig. 1) at a designed focal length R_{c}. By simultaneously focusing and accelerating ions, the circularly polarized LILA target remains resistant to induced relativistic transparency over a wide parameter range. Figure 1: The schematic of the Laser-Ion Lens and Accelerator (LILA) illustrates the different stages of the process. Stage II represents the phase when the laser pulse begins to deform the target, causing it to bend forward as the laser radiation pressure builds. During this stage, the interaction between the laser and the target leads to ion acceleration as the target responds to the intense electromagnetic fields. Stage III occurs after the laser-target interaction has concluded. At this point, the target focuses, achieving maximum ion density as the ions are collimated into a compact beam. The effect of the laser-polarization on RPA is dramatic and important to understand because radial distribution of accelerated electrons has strong dependence on laser polarization (Gonzalez-Izquierdo et al., 2016b). The ponderomotive force when a linearly polarized laser pulse irradiates a solid thin target is given by (Rykovanov et al., 2008) f_{p}(x)=-\frac{e^{2}}{4m_{e}\omega_{l}^{2}}\nabla\left\langle E_{l}^{2}\right% \rangle\left(1-\left(\frac{1-\epsilon^{2}}{1+\epsilon^{2}}\right)\cos\left(2% \omega t\right)\right) (1) where e is the electron charge, m_{e} the electron rest mass, \omega the laser angular frequency and \epsilon=E_{y}/E_{z} is the laser polarization ellipticity (0\leq\epsilon\leq 1); where E_{y} and E_{z} are the electric field polarized in y and z-directions, respectively. Note that at relativistic intensities the force on the electrons arising from \bf J\times B term in the Lorentz equation is of the same order as that due to the electric field. The first term on the right hand side of ponderomotive force (equation (1)) pushes electrons from higher to lower electric fields. The second term is the \bf J\times B heating mechanism (Brunel, 1987, 1988) and excites electrons oscillation at twice the laser frequency (2\omega). For circular polarization \epsilon=1, the \bf J\times B heating component of equation (1) becomes zero, consequently, electrons are adiabatically pushed by radiation pressure as a single layer and ions are effectively accelerated in the non-oscillating charge separating field. For linear polarized pulses \epsilon=0, the ellipticity factor (1-\epsilon^{2})/(1+\epsilon^{2}) becomes 1. Unlike CP, in this case, oscillating component of \bf J\times B force drives the electrons in longitudinal motion back and forth through the thin target foil. Thus, electrons are heated by \bf J\times B component and leads to foil explosion rather than smooth localized ion acceleration. Laser polarization is thus highly important in defining the coupling of laser energy to target plasma electrons at relativistic laser intensities. Effect of laser polarization on radiation pressure acceleration with an overdense thin planar foil target has been studied and reported generation of hot electrons and exponential ion energy spectrum (Liseykina et al., 2008; Henig et al., 2009). We conclude that interaction of a linearly polarized laser pulse with a flatfoil target produces more energetic ions than a circularly polarized laser, albeit it has large emittance and broad ion energy spectrum. To the fore post-accceleration of selective energy selection is still required. Intuitively we ask the following question : can a laser-ion lens and accelerator generate low-emittance, monoenergetic compact ion bunches using elliptically and linearly polarized laser pulses? In this paper, we aim to address this question. Using ab-initio 3D first-principles particle-in-cell simulations, we present that LILA works efficiently when target thickness is optimized d_{opt}=(\lambda_{l}/\pi)(n_{c}/n)a_{0} (Macchi et al., 2009; Henig et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2016) for a peak laser electric field (a_{0}=eE/m_{e}\omega_{l}c) to avoid induced relativistic transparency (Vshivkov et al., 1998), where c being the speed of light. We demonstrate that the LILA target can generate collimated, high-flux monoenergetic ion bunches regardless of the laser pulse polarization. Additionally, we show that LILA can produce ion beams with energies comparable to those generated using circularly polarized lasers. We discuss 6 cases based on laser polarizations (3 types) and target shapes (2 types) of the target. The cases are following: (I) shaped target; CP pulse (\epsilon=1), (II) planar target; CP pulse (\epsilon=1), (III) shaped target; EP pulse (\epsilon=0.5), (IV) planar target; EP pulse (\epsilon=0.5), (V) shaped target; LP pulse (\epsilon=0), (VI) planar target; LP pulse (\epsilon=0). In Secion II we discuss cases I and II, in secion III we discuss cases III and IV, and in section IV we discuss cases V and VI. A comparative discussion is done in section V. We present conclusion in section VI.

The box length is L_{x}=20\lambda_{l} in laser propagation direction from x=-5\lambda_{l} to x=15\lambda_{l}, and L_{y}=L_{z}=12\lambda_{l} in transverse direction. The simulation box contains 150 cell in transverse direction and 2000 cells in x-direction. The simulation box has periodic boundaries in transverse direction and absorbing in laser propagation (x-) direction. Figure 2: Ion density, energy spectrum and energy density. All figures are plotted for CP laser pulse with a_{0}=80. Top Panel: Shaped Target.

(e) Ion energy spectrum and (f) Snapshot of Proton energy density at the time t=46.2\,fs. The fully ionized proton plasma foil of initial density n_{H^{+},e}=150n_{c} is kept at x=0, where n_{c} is critical density. The thickness at the center of the target is d_{0}=0.21\mu m, effective radius of curvature R_{c}=2.4\mu m and radius of the target is R_{0}=2.8\mu m. The laser pulse has a duration of 7\tau_{0}, consisting of a plateau region of 5\tau_{0} and rising and falling times of 1\tau_{0} each, where \tau_{0}=3.3fs. The intensity of the laser is I_{0}=1.7\times 10^{22}\,W/cm^{2}, which yields peak electric field a_{0} = 80 for the CP laser with the target radius R_{0}. To keep the intensity constant for different polarized laser pulse, we increase peak electric field from a_{0}=80 to a_{0}=112 for LP laser pulses. These parameters correspond to the estimated power P\simeq 4\,PW, which is readily available at facility (Kim et al., 2016). The shaped target areal mass density is kept same by choosing appropriate thickness for planar target. The radius remains same for all target. The radius of curvature and total radius is identical for all simulation runs for shaped targets, and the total radius is identical for all shaped and planar targets unless stated otherwise."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06544v1,Time delay estimation of coherent structure velocities from a super-position of localized pulses,"This study investigates a novel method for estimating two-dimensional velocities using coarse-grained imaging data, which is particularly relevant for applications in plasma diagnostics. The method utilizes measurements from three non-collinear points and is derived from a stochastic model that describes the propagation of uncorrelated pulses through two-dimensional space. This model builds upon a well-studied one-dimensional model used to analyze turbulence in the scrape-off layer of magnetically confined plasmas. We demonstrate that the method provides exact time delay estimates when applied to a superposition of Gaussian structures and remains accurate for various other pulse functions. Through extensive numerical simulations, we evaluate the method’s performance under different conditions, including variations in signal duration, pulse overlap, spatial and temporal resolution, and the presence of additive noise. Additionally, we investigate the impact of temporal pulse evolution due to linear damping and explore the so-called barberpole effect, which occurs with elongated and tilted structures. Our analysis reveals that the three-point method effectively addresses the limitations encountered with two-point techniques, particularly at coarse spatial resolutions. Although the method is susceptible to the barberpole effect, we analytically demonstrate that this effect does not occur when the elongated structures propagate parallel to one of their axes, and we establish bounds for the associated errors. We propose a series of safeguards to anticipate the applicability of the velocity estimation method, considering factors such as signal length, number of pulses, temporal and spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and pulse size. However, these safeguards do not ensure applicability in cases involving the barberpole effect or correlations between amplitudes and velocities. Overall, our findings provide a comprehensive and robust framework for accurate two-dimensional velocity estimation, enhancing the capabilities of fusion plasma diagnostics and potentially benefiting other fields requiring precise motion analysis.","The scrape-off layer (SOL), the outermost region of plasma in a magnetic confinement device, plays a critical role in determining the overall performance and stability of fusion reactors [1, 2, 3]. In this region, where the plasma interacts with the surrounding materials, various turbulence phenomena lead to the formation of coherent structures known as filaments or blobs. These blobs, characterized by their high-pressure nature and radial motion, dominate the cross-field particle and heat transport [4, 5]. Understanding the dynamics of plasma blobs is key for developing plasma regimes compatible with continuous, steady-state operation of fusion reactors. Stochastic modelling has become a commonly used tool to describe the complex dynamics in the SOL [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. These models have demonstrated significant utility in accurately capturing and interpreting experimental data, providing a framework to describe the statistical properties and turbulent nature of the plasma dynamics observed in the SOL [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. In this work, we extend a well-studied stochastic model to two spatial dimensions, capturing the more complex interactions and dynamics present in real experimental conditions. This is equivalent to the model presented in Ref. [31]. This model facilitates better descriptions of plasma behaviour and supports the development of more effective analysis tools for plasma diagnostics. In particular, we are interested in developing techniques for velocity estimation on coarse-grained imaging data, such as avalanche photodiode gas-puff imaging (GPI) [32, 33, 34, 35] or beam emission spectroscopy [36, 37]. This diagnostic is characterized by its high temporal resolution but relatively low spatial resolution. Some traditional velocimetry techniques are based on two-point time delay estimation [38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. These techniques lead to systematic errors when the velocity of the flow is not aligned with the two points used for the estimation [43, 44, 45, 46]. More advanced methods based on two-dimensional cross-correlation functions are typically applied when higher spatial resolution is available [47, 48, 49, 50, 51]. Other methods have been studied based on dynamic programming [52, 41] and blob tracking [53, 54, 55]. These methods are not applicable to the low spatial resolutions of avalanche photodiode GPI [46]. A three-point velocity estimation method has been demonstrated in the case of propagating waves [45, 56]. In this work, we apply a stochastic model to analytically demonstrate that the three-point velocity estimation technique gives exact results for a superposition of uncorrelated, Gaussian structures. We test this technique on synthetic data to study its limits of applicability and the effect of signal duration, degree of pulse overlap, spatial and temporal resolution, broad distributions of velocities, noise, elongated and tilted pulses, time-dependent amplitudes and correlations between pulse velocities and amplitudes. We show that this technique is not subject to the dimensionality limitation of two-point techniques and that it is applicable to coarse spatial resolutions. Another issue many velocity estimation techniques are subject to is the so-called barberpole effect. This effect appears when a structure such as a blob or a wavefront propagates in a direction not aligned with its normal. This effect can, for example, lead to spurious horizontal velocities even if the structures propagate only vertically [44]. The proposed three-point method is subject to the barberpole effect, however, we show that the errors associated with this are bounded and lower than those under traditional two-point techniques. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the two-dimensional stochastic model describing the fluctuations as a superposition of propagating and uncorrelated pulses including tilting is introduced. In Sec. III we derive the three-point velocity estimation method within the statistical framework provided by the stochastic model. In Sec. IV we test the method on synthetic data for a wide variety of scenarios. A discussion of the method and conclusions of these investigations are presented in Sec. V. Finally, Python implementations of both the velocity estimation methods and the synthetic data generation described in this paper are openly available on GitHub [57, 58]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06521v1,Temperature Relaxation Rates in Strongly Magnetized Plasmas,"Strongly magnetized plasmas, characterized by having a gyrofrequency larger than the plasma frequency (\beta=\omega_{c}/\omega_{p}\gg 1), are known to exhibit novel transport properties. Previous works studying pure electron plasmas have shown that strong magnetization significantly inhibits energy exchange between parallel and perpendicular directions, leading to a prolonged time for relaxation of a temperature anisotropy. Recent work studying repulsive electron-ion interactions showed that strong magnetization increases both the parallel and perpendicular temperature relaxation rates of ions, but in differing magnitudes, resulting in the formation of temperature anisotropy during equilibration. This previous study treated electrons as a heat bath and assumed weak magnetization of ions. Here, we broaden this analysis and compute the full temperature and temperature anisotropy evolution over a broad range of magnetic field strengths. It is found that when electrons are strongly magnetized (\beta_{e}\gg 1) and ions are weakly magnetized (\beta_{i}\ll 1), the magnetic field strongly suppresses the perpendicular energy exchange rate of electrons, whereas the parallel exchange rate slightly increases in magnitude compared to the value at weak magnetization. In contrast, the ion perpendicular and parallel energy exchange rates both increase in magnitude compared to the values at weak magnetization. Consequently, equilibration causes the electron parallel temperature to rapidly align with the ion temperature, while the electron perpendicular temperature changes much more slowly. It is also shown that when both ions and electrons are strongly magnetized (\beta_{i},\beta_{e}\gg 1) the ion-electron perpendicular relaxation rate dramatically decreases with magnetization strength as well.","Plasmas are frequently in a non-equilibrium state with electrons and ions at different temperatures. In magnetized plasmas, it is also common to have different temperatures parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field Ott et al. (2017). Here, we study how plasma equilibrates from this non-equilibrium state through Coulomb collisions when it is strongly magnetized. Strongly magnetized plasmas are defined by having an electron gyrofrequency that exceeds the electron plasma frequency Baalrud and Daligault (2017); Ott and Bonitz (2011); Kählert and Bonitz (2022, 2023), i.e., \beta_{e}=\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}>~{}1, where \omega_{ce}=eB/m_{e}c and \omega_{pe}=\sqrt{4\pi e^{2}n_{e}/m_{e}}. Understanding how temperature relaxation is modified by strong magnetization has applications in many experiments, such as antimatter traps Fajans and Surko (2020); Stenson et al. (2017); Ahmadi et al. (2017); Baker et al. (2021), magnetized dusty plasmas Thomas et al. (2012), non-neutral plasma Beck et al. (1992); Glinsky et al. (1992), magnetized ultracold neutral plasmas Gorman et al. (2022, 2021); Zhang et al. (2008); Sprenkle et al. (2022); Guthrie and Roberts (2021); Pak et al. (2024), and pinch experiments Bennett et al. (2021), in addition to being an interesting fundamental physics problem. For example, previous works studying pure electron plasmas have shown that strong magnetization significantly inhibits energy exchange between parallel and perpendicular directions, leading to prolonged time for the relaxation of temperature anisotropy Glinsky et al. (1992); Beck et al. (1992). Here, a recently developed kinetic theory for strongly magnetized plasmas Jose and Baalrud (2020) is applied to model the evolution of temperature and temperature anisotropy of an electron-ion plasma interacting through a repulsive Coulomb potential. It is found that when the electrons are strongly magnetized (\beta_{e}\gg 1) but ions are weakly magnetized (\beta_{i}\ll 1), the ion parallel and perpendicular energy exchange densities increase in magnitude compared to the weakly magnetized (\beta_{e}<1) limit. However, the electron perpendicular energy exchange rate is strongly suppressed by the strong magnetization of electrons. As energy conservation requires, the parallel electron energy exchange rate increases correspondingly to match the total ion energy exchange rate. This leads to a three step process in the total temperature evolution. The fastest timescale is associated with ion-ion interactions, which prevents any significant ion temperature anisotropy from forming. The second timescale is associated with the relaxation of the parallel electron temperature with the ion temperature. The third and much longer timescale is associated with the relaxation of the perpendicular electron temperature with the others. Because it is so slow, the perpendicular electron temperature relaxation sets the overall temperature relaxation rate. This analysis is relevant to modeling antiproton temperature evolution in the Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus (ALPHA) Ahmadi et al. (2017); Baker et al. (2021). The ALPHA experiment synthesizes antihydrogen from antiprotons and positrons and makes precision measurements of antimatter to test fundamental symmetries. Before antihydrogen can be synthesized, nonneutral plasmas must be prepared. In one stage of this preparation, antiprotons are cooled collisionally with electrons in a Penning trap. The magnetization of these plasmas corresponds to a \beta_{e} value of a few hundred, a regime in which the electrons are strongly magnetized but the ions are not. This work focuses on modeling the antiproton-electron temperature relaxation, so only repulsive interactions are considered. It should be noted that our previous work Jose et al. (2022); Jose and Baalrud (2023) showed significant differences between the attractive and repulsive cases. So the results shown here are not expected to apply directly to attractive electron-ion interactions, which will be the subject of future work. Traditionally, the temperature relaxation rate is computed from plasma kinetic theories such as those based on the Boltzmann equation Ferziger and Kaper (1972), Fokker Planck equation Rosenbluth et al. (1957), or Lennard-Balescu equation Lenard (1960); Balescu (1960). A result of these models that is that temperature relaxation is described by a single Coulomb collision rate. However, these are restricted to weakly magnetized plasmas because the expansion parameters they are based on are related to the gyroradius being larger than the Debye length. In this work, we use a recent generalized kinetic theory that treats strongly magnetized plasmas Jose and Baalrud (2020, 2021). This generalizes the Boltzmann collision operator to account for the gyromotion of particles during Coulomb collisions. It also accounts for aspects of strong Coulomb coupling by modeling interactions using the potential of mean force Baalrud and Daligault (2013, 2019, 2014). Here, Coulomb coupling strength is measured using the dimensionless parameter, \Gamma=(e^{2}/a)/(k_{B}T), where a=[3/(4\pi n)]^{1/3} is the Wigner-Seitz radius. A result of the generalized model is that there are several distinct Coulomb collision rates in strongly magnetized plasmas, which arise due to a dependence on the magnetic field in the binary collision process. This generalized kinetic theory was previously tested by computing the friction force on a test charge due to Coulomb collisions when moving through a strongly magnetized plasma, and comparing the results with first-principles molecular dynamics simulations Jose and Baalrud (2021). Novel behaviors were predicted to arise from the asymmetries in the Coulomb collision rate caused by strong magnetization. For example, the friction force on a test charge was found to no longer be antiparallel to its velocity, but instead to have an additional transverse component in the plane of the velocity and magnetic field Lafleur and Baalrud (2019, 2020); Bernstein et al. (2020). Later work showed that a third “gyro-friction” component in the Lorentz force direction also arises when the plasma is strongly coupled in addition to being strongly magnetized Jose and Baalrud (2021). These perpendicular forces lead to non-intuitive features in the trajectory, such as an increase in the gyroradius of a fast test charge Lafleur and Baalrud (2019); Jose and Baalrud (2021). It has also been shown that strong magnetization influences macroscopic transport coefficients, such as electrical resistivity and conductivity Baalrud and Lafleur (2021); Jose et al. (2022), and to cause a Barkas effect, where the transport properties depend on the sign of the charge of the interacting particles Jose et al. (2022). Other works calculating temperature relaxation rates for strongly magnetized plasmas employed perturbative methods Silin (1963), force correlation techniques Kihara et al. (1960); Kihara and Midzuno (1960), Fokker-Plank equations Ichimaru and Rosenbluth (1970), linear response theory Nersisyan et al. (2011), and binary collision models Dong et al. (2013a, b); Kihara (1959). However, the inherent assumption of small-angle collisions in these theories limits them to the weakly coupled regime and to regimes where the gyroradius is larger than the distance of closest approach. Here, we extend the parameter space to regimes where the gyroradus is smaller than the distance of the closest approach, and to regimes of strong Coulomb coupling (but with the limitation that \Gamma_{e}\lesssim 20). These extensions make the results applicable to experiments with strongly coupled components, such as ultra-cold neutral plasmas Guthrie and Roberts (2021), antimatter traps Fajans and Surko (2020), and non-neutral plasmas Beck et al. (1992). This work also extends the calculation of temperature relaxation to the extremely magnetized transport regime Baalrud and Daligault (2017) where the gyroradius is smaller than the distance of the closest approach. This is achieved by evaluating particle trajectories during interactions by numerically solving the equations of motion, instead of relying on a perturbative technique or weak interaction approximation. Our previous work Jose and Baalrud (2023) calculating the ion-electron temperature relaxation rate found that when the plasma is strongly magnetized, parallel and perpendicular temperatures no longer relax at the same rate, which can lead to the development of temperature anisotropy. It was also found that the combination of oppositely charged interactions and strong magnetization caused the ion-electron relaxation rate in the parallel direction to be significantly suppressed, scaling inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength. However, the theory assumes that the ions do not gyrate during the collision event and that the electrons act as a heat bath. Here, we extend our previous work by relaxing these assumptions. The general electron-ion temperature relaxation problem is found to be complicated in this situation, involving 11 independent Coulomb collision rate coefficients. Each of these coefficients is evaluated from the kinetic theory. When focusing on a regime of strong electron magnetization (\beta_{e}>1) but weak ion magnetization (\beta_{i}<1), the complexity is found to be reduced substantially, depending on just 3 collision rates: one associated with ion-ion collisions, one with electron-ion collisions in the parallel direction, and one with electron-electron temperature anisotropy relaxation. The outline of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II, a temperature evolution equation for ions and electrons is obtained. Section III discusses the relaxation rates for different magnetization strengths. Section IV discusses the parallel and perpendicular temperature evolution of ions and electrons collisionaly relaxing from a non-equilibrium state to equilibrium.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05940v1,A High-Power Microwave Limiter Using A Self-Actuated Plasma-Based EIT Topology,"This paper presents a novel metamaterial topology incorporating gas discharge tubes for high-power microwave protection. The design features two split ring resonators positioned side by side with their splits oriented orthogonally. When exposed to low-power microwaves, each split ring resonator induces a resonance that interacts to create a passband within a broad stopband, facilitated by a phenomenon known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). At high power levels, the integrated gas discharge tubes become ionized, forming plasma that acts as a switch to eliminate the EIT window, thereby reinstating the stopband for protection. Several prototypes have been developed for S-band operation based on this concept. Analytical, numerical, and experimental results are in complete agreement. The proposed device demonstrates superior protection with lower insertion loss in the OFF mode and higher isolation in the ON mode. Its strong ability to handle high-power microwaves is achieved using plasma-based switches instead of diodes, providing a reasonable response time and a straightforward design that enables rapid prototyping. Additionally, the device demonstrates frequency and power threshold tunability, highlighting its versatility as a microwave protection device.","High intensity electromagnetic waves [1] can disrupt the communication systems, interfere with critical electronic equipment, and cause malfunctioning, especially when the conductor’s length resonates with the incoming waves, causing power surges. Typically, the protection is achieved by shielding through metallic enclosures or using absorbers. However, both approaches affect the system’s ability to communicate with the outside world. To circumvent these issues, receivers are usually placed outside the shielding mechanisms. However, high-power microwaves still cause issues, especially when the received signal is amplified, which can severely damage the communication equipment. Power limiters are the standard backend components employed after the receiver antenna for in-band protection against high-power microwaves. The desirable features of the power limiters are the introduction of low insertion and high isolation for low- and high-power signals, respectively. The common topologies for these backend power limiters are based on ferrite materials[2], semiconductor components (i.e., diodes and transistors) [3], MEMS [4], and plasma[5, 6, 7]. However, there are several other scenarios where the high-power microwave can couple with the circuitry and cause a malfunction in the critical equipment. In that broad sense, metamaterials offer a front-end platform to effectively limit high-power microwaves. Numerous solutions based on active metasurfaces integrated with lumped elements, i.e., p-i-n diodes [8], varactors [9], resistors [10], field effect transistors [11], and MEMS [12] etc. have been proposed for such protection. These active metasurfaces require sensors to detect the power threshold and utilize the sensor output to shield the target by switching the active elements through a DC biasing scheme. However, the HPM duration can be very short, and any switching delay may fail to provide timely protection. To enable rapid protection, passive and adaptive protection techniques are desired. Passive/adaptive metasurfaces, on the other hand, utilize the incoming energy to trigger the protection mode by inducing a power-dependent nonlinear response. These passive solutions can be categorized as impedance surface- and frequency selective surface (FSS)-based solutions. For example, the impedance surfaces in [13, 14] employed four symmetrical p-i-n diodes placed in a waveguide to limit the high-power waves, in which the isolation increased with the number of unit cells. These impedance surfaces lower the cutoff frequency of the propagating mode by emulating the short patches to the larger ones through the conducting diodes. Similarly, a varactor diode-based impedance surface was proposed in [15], which induced the gradual isolation with the power. In [16], anisotropic impedance surfaces were utilized, and protection was achieved by redirecting the high-intensity energy through the anisotropic bandgap induced with diodes. Recently, a split ring resonator integrated with p-i-n diodes has been proposed in which bandgap is induced under high power when the diode is in the ON state [17]. So far, limited isolation has been realized with these impedance surface-based schemes. For the FSS-based solutions, the typical approach employs non-resonant meta-atoms using conductive strips integrated with p-i-n diodes on a multi-layer board [18, 19]. These strips are shorted under high power, forming a resonator to stop a particular frequency band. The non-resonant cases usually require a high level of microwave power to short the diodes, as the electric field is typically low. The resonant meta-atom requires at least two metallic layers separated by the spacers to induce electric and magnetic resonances for ideal transmission, increasing the overall thickness [20, 21]. A trade-off between thickness and the overall bandwidth is necessary for such metamaterials. The other way is to use complementary structures based on dipole resonances [22]. However, they typically require at least two switching elements for each polarization, i.e., four switches per unit cell. Although the protection is achieved in a particular band, the passband is shifted to a higher frequency depending on the conductivity of the switching elements, as slots are not entirely blocked. Moreover, all these schemes are based on p-i-n diodes as suboptimal switches because of their initial leakage current and because they can only withstand a small amount of power. Therefore, they are not suitable for very high-power scenarios. On the other hand, recently, plasma-based protection schemes have received more attention as they are naturally tailored toward high-power applications. In these schemes, hermetically sealed gas elements are typically integrated with resonant structures. The gas ionizes in response to a high electric field, acting as a high-power switch for protection. Several prototypes have been demonstrated, especially for backend protection, such as microstrip-based limiter [5, 23, 24] and cavity limiter [25, 7]. In the context of front-end application, a waveguide plasma limiter has also been proposed, which requires 40 kW of pulsed power to form plasma and merely provides 3 dB of isolation [26]. In this article, we propose a novel resonant meta-atom topology based on the unique physics of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [27, 28] to open up a passband inside a wide stopband. Since the experimental demonstration of the EIT phenomenon in electromagnetics in 2008 [28] and 2009 [27], several EIT-based designs have been investigated, particularly for slow-wave applications in optics and photonics. Most EIT applications in the microwave regime have been limited to sensing [29, 30, 31]. Here, for the first time, we utilize meta-atoms based on an EIT topology for high-power microwave (HPM) protection by incorporating a gas discharge tube. The meta-atom structure achieves HPM protection by incorporating a gas discharge tube (GDT). The enclosed gas undergoes breakdown under high-power microwave illumination, forming plasma as a switch, disrupting the passband introduced through the EIT mechanism. As a result, high isolation is achieved throughout the passband, which is non-linearly enhanced owing to the incident power intensity. The plasma-based switching topology combined with the EIT mechanism outperforms existing designs due to its ultra-thin profile, high power handling capability, low insertion loss, high isolation, fast switching, and simple structure, requiring only a few switches per unit, as shown in Table I."
