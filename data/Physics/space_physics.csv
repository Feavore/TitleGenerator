https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10380v1,Forecast of solar activity based on mean-field dynamo model and neural network,"We discuss a prediction of the solar activity on a short time-scale applying the method based on a combination of a nonlinear mean-field dynamo model and the artificial neural network. The artificial neural network which serves as a correction scheme for the forecast, uses the currently available observational data (e.g., the 13 month running average of the observed solar sunspot numbers) and the dynamo model output. The nonlinear mean-field \alpha\,\Omega dynamo produces the large-scale magnetic flux which is redistributed by negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI) producing sunspots and active regions. The nonlinear mean-field dynamo model includes algebraic nonlinearity (caused by the feedback of the growing magnetic field on the plasma motion) and dynamic nonlinearities (related to the dynamics of the magnetic helicity of small-scale magnetic field). We compare the forecast errors with a horizon of 1, 6, 12 and 18 months, for different forecast methods, with the same corrections on the current monthly observations. Our forecast is in good agreement with the observed solar activity, the forecast error is almost stably small over short-medium ranges of forecasting windows. Despite a strong level of chaotic component in the solar magnetic activity we present quantitative evidence that the solar activity on a short range can be stably well predicted, by the joint use of the physically based model with the neural network. This result may have an immediate practical implementation for predictions of various phenomena of solar activity and other astrophysical processes, so may be of interest to a broad community.","Predictions of the solar activity is a crucial problem related to a fundamental solar physics that have important applications. Various methods including the mean-field dynamo models have been applied to predict the solar activity (see, e.g., Dikpati & Gilman, 2006; Choudhuri et al., 2007a; Kane, 2007; Bushby & Tobias, 2007; Obridko & Shelting, 2008; De Jager & Duhau, 2009; Kitiashvili & Kosovichev, 2011; Pesnell, 2012; Tlatov, 2015; Kitiashvili, 2016; Usoskin, 2017; Safiullin et al., 2018). Besides that there are other numerous methods to predict the solar activity using various sets of data as precursors or signatures of the forthcoming solar activity level. Most of solar activity predictions are focused on the magnitude of the nearest solar cycle maximum, or the minimum, or even the magnitude of the further several cycles. However, in spite of the numerous studies, improvement of the solar activity forecast is still a subject of active discussions. Our approach is aimed for prediction of the 13-monthly running average mean solar sunspot number. We challenge our method for a predictions that is shifted a month ahead (or 6, 12, and 18 months ahead) with respect to the last available 13-month running mean average (i.e., with correction by up-to-date observations). Our method has been checked in real time with available observations over the last six years. The results and statistical data on the forecast since 2021 are available on the web111https://github.com/rodionstepanov/SolarActivityPrediction. In our approach to the forecast of solar activity, we take into account the following: • We use a nonlinear dynamo model (Kleeorin et al., 2016; Safiullin et al., 2018) that is able to reproduce properties and long-term dynamics of the mean magnetic field up to several hundreds of solar cycles. This model describes the main cyclic oscillations of the large-scale magnetic field with an intrinsic chaotic behaviour caused by the dynamics of the magnetic helicity of small-scale magnetic fields. The mean-field dynamo produces the large-scale magnetic flux (see, e.g., Moffatt, 1978; Parker, 1979; Krause & Rädler, 1980; Zeldovich et al., 1983; Moffatt & Dormy, 2019; Rogachevskii, 2021). • The redistribution of the large-scale magnetic flux by the large-scale negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI) results in formation of sunspots and active regions (Kleeorin et al., 1989, 1990). This instability has been investigated theoretically using various analytical approaches (Kleeorin & Rogachevskii, 1994; Kleeorin et al., 1996; Rogachevskii & Kleeorin, 2007) and detected in direct numerical simulations in various setups (see, e.g., Brandenburg et al., 2011, 2016; Warnecke et al., 2013, 2016). NEMPI has a threshold in the magnitude of the mean magnetic field. In the process triggered by this instability, no new large-scale magnetic flux is produced in contrast to the dynamo process. • There are three characteristic times of interest concerning the solar activity prediction: (i) long-term evolution of the mean magnetic field associated with the effect of magnetic helicity relaxation (Kleeorin & Ruzmaikin, 1982; Kleeorin et al., 1995); (ii) turbulent diffusion of the dynamo generated large-scale magnetic fields at the scale of the solar convective zone depth. These processes are described by the non-linear \alpha\Omega dynamo model which takes into account evolution of small-scale magnetic helicity. (iii) Short-term evolution at the scales of super-granulation related to formation of sunspots and active regions. This is entirely connected with NEMPI process. Decay of sunspots and active regions is included in this process, too. • To predict the solar activity on a short time-scale, we combine the two approaches of the numerical solution of the nonlinear mean-field dynamo equations and the artificial neural network. The latter serves here as a correction scheme for the forecast, which uses the currently available observational data (the 13 month running average of the observed solar sunspot numbers time series) and the dynamo model output. The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively analyse the results of several years of practical forecasting of solar activity by the novel method (Safiullin et al., 2018) which combines the solar dynamo model with magnetic helicity evolution and the neural network, estimate the errors of forecasting and demonstrate its capabilities through newly observable data in comparisons with other forecasting methods. Despite a strong level of chaotic component in the solar magnetic activity we will present quantitative evidence that the solar activity on a short range can be reliably predicted, and it would give a positive example of the joint use of the physically based model plus the neural network."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10215v1,Simulation of Thermal Nonequilibrium Cycles in the Solar Wind,"Thermal nonequilibrium (TNE) is a condition of the plasma in the solar corona in which the local rate of energy loss due to radiation increases to the point that it cannot be sustained by the various heating terms acting on the plasma, precluding the existence of a steady state. The limit cycles of precipitation and evaporation that result from TNE have been simulated in 1D models of coronal loops, as well as 2D and 3D models of the solar chromosphere and lower corona. However, a careful study of TNE in the solar wind has not been performed until now. Here we demonstrate that for suitable combinations of local and global heating rates it is possible for the plasma to exhibit a TNE condition, even in the context of a transonic solar wind with appreciable mass and energy fluxes. This implies limits on the amount of foot-point heating that can be withstood under steady-state conditions in the solar wind, and may help to explain the variability of solar wind streams that emanate from regions of highly concentrated magnetic flux on the solar surface. The implications of this finding pertain to various sources of high-density solar wind, including plumes that form above regions of mixed magnetic polarity in polar coronal holes and the slow solar wind (SSW) that emanates from coronal hole boundaries.","The condensation and precipitation of coronal plasma, commonly referred to as “coronal rain,” has been a ubiquitous feature in H-\alpha observations of the solar corona ever since the first birefringent filter telescope was designed and constructed by Evans (1949, 1958) at the High Altitude Obseratory in Boulder, CO. Initially this phenomenon was discussed in the context of coronal prominences (see, e.g., Newkirk, 1957; Kawaguchi, 1970; Leroy, 1972), but was later found in observations of coronal loops by such authors as Schrijver (2001), using the TRACE instrument (Handy et al., 1999), and De Groof et al. (2004), using SOHO/EIT (Delaboudinière et al., 1995) and, later, the Big Bear Solar Observatory (De Groof et al., 2005). In the era of AIA/SDO (Lemen et al., 2012) such observations have become common, particularly in coronal active regions where the stored magnetic energy is large. Recently, Mason & Kniezewski (2022) performed a survey of 241 solar flares from 2011 to 2018 and determined that most (>90\%) X-class flares and a majority (>70\%) of M-class flares exhibited coronal rain along the post-flare magnetic arcade over a period of several hours following the peak in flare brightness. This suggests that the conditions under which coronal condensates form are ubiquitous in the solar corona, especially where there is strong heating, as is common in solar active regions (Fisher et al., 1998). Additionally, there is evidence that coronal rain may occur preferentially near magnetic null points and along field lines that pass near to them. Mason et al. (2019) reported on observations of coronal rain along the separatrix surfaces of coronal null points above embedded magnetic bipoles observed by AIA/SDO. They even observed condensations forming above the (observationally inferred) location of the null point, along its open spine. This suggests that such condensates may not develop exclusively in the closed corona, as has typically been assumed. Some authors have even gone as far as to link the formation of coronal rain with the process of interchange reconnection (Li et al., 2020), although the causal mechanism underpinning this connection remains to be determined. The first computational model of coronal condensation was developed by Antiochos & Klimchuk (1991) to describe the physics of prominence formation. Building on previous results by Serio et al. (1981), they showed that for sufficiently strong foot-point heating rates the density at the apex of a coronal loop can increase to the point that the radiated power exceeds the power supplied by all other sources of heating, after which the plasma undergoes a localized thermal runaway that ultimately leads to catastrophic cooling and condensation. This phenomenon, which is now referred to as thermal nonequilibrium, or TNE, has since been confirmed in field aligned (1D) simulations by Antiochos et al. (1999), Antolin et al. (2008, 2010), Downs et al. (2016), Froment et al. (2018), Johnston et al. (2019), and others. Moreover, Klimchuk & Luna (2019) have developed scaling laws for determining the availability of steady state solutions on closed coronal loops with prescribed heating, and these have proven to be highly predictive of TNE conditions in numerical simulations. Although the majority of TNE studies have been performed in 1D models of closed coronal loops, the condensation of coronal plasma has also been observed in 2.5D and 3D simulations by Fang et al. (2015), Kohutova et al. (2020), Li et al. (2022), Antolin et al. (2022), and others. In a few cases, these have been observed to form along “open” field lines that extend from the model chromosphere to the top of the numerical domain. This suggests that TNE is insensitive to magnetic connectivity, meaning that it may occur in coronal holes or near coronal hole boundaries. However, because the spatial domains in these simulations typically don’t extend beyond about 50\,\rm Mm above the solar surface, they do not support an outward-flowing solar wind with a sonic point. As a result, the gas dynamics along open field lines in such models may not be representative of the conditions found in the regions whence the solar wind emanates. One exception is the study by Schlenker et al. (2021), who performed a 2.5D simulation of TNE conditions in a magnetic helmet streamer with a self-consistent, transonic solar wind in the adjacent coronal hole region. They found that certain values of the foot-point heating rate caused coronal condensates to form along the flank of the helmet streamer, and that the critical condition predicted by Klimchuk & Luna (2019) was approximately recovered when the loop length was replaced with the gravitational scale height to establish the natural length scale of the system. Notably, some of the condensates observed by Schlenker et al. (2021) appeared to be raining down along open field lines that were outside of the helmet streamer separatix surface (i.e., the open-closed boundary); however it was not clear from their simulations whether the condensates originated in the open field region or were released into it following magnetic reconnection at the helmet streamer apex. In this paper we report on the formation of coronal rain and the emergence of TNE-driven limit cycles of precipitation and evaporation (hereafter “TNE cycles”) in numerical simulations of the solar wind. Our model solves the time-dependent field-aligned Navier-Stokes equations from the chromosphere, through the transition region and lower corona, and into the extended corona and heliosphere, with empirical heating, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction. As this model explicitly assumes an open magnetic geometry, which naturally supports a transonic outflow, the condensates that form within the model, which are found in the subsonic region between the solar surface and the sonic point, are unambiguously embedded in and consistent with the conditions of the solar wind. In the following section (2) we briefly describe the design of our numerical model. Then, in sections 3 and 4, we describe the equilibrium conditions and subsequent loss of equilibrium as a consequence of enhanced foot-point heating. The TNE cycles that emerge following the loss of equilibrium are discussed in sections 5 and 6. In section 7 we discuss the implications of TNE cycles to heliospheric observations, before concluding with a summary discussion in section 8."

This paper investigates the relationship between different phases of solar activity and extreme precipitation events in Kerala, India. Sunspot number and rainfall data were analysed over 122 years (1901-2022) and separated into winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons on an annual scale. The study analysed climatic effects using 31-year mean values and conducted correlation and wavelet analyses (XWT and WTC). A negative correlation was observed in the winter and post-monsoon seasons, while positive correlations were seen in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, all of which were statistically significant. Using cross-wavelet transform (XWT), the temporal relationship between sunspot number and rainfall values was investigated, revealing significant cross-power at an 8-12 year scale across all seasons. Wavelet coherence between the two data sets demonstrated significant correlation at the 2-4 and 4-8 year scales throughout the four seasons. Strong connections were evident at higher periods, such as the 8-16 year scale in the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The results show that the seasonal rainfall over Kerala is related to solar activity.The solar phases of Solar Cycles 14-24 were determined for all seasons, and the years with excessive and insufficient rainfall were identified. It was observed that the descending phase had an impact on excess rainfall events during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons, while the ascending phase notably affected the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The study specifically examined the different magnetic polarities of sunspots in alternating solar cycles, focusing on even and odd cycles. It was found that extreme rainfall events were more frequent during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons in the even cycles, whereas in the odd cycles, they were more prevalent during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. These findings are presented for the first time and may offer new perspectives on how different phases affect rainfall. This study suggests a physical link between solar activity and extreme precipitation in Kerala, which could increase predictability.","Fig. 1: Location map of Kerala Global climate change poses a hazard to human existence. The sun and anthropogenic factors exert a significant influence on weather and climate. The Sun’s magnetic fields exhibit various spatial, temporal, and energetic phenomena. Sunspots, solar flares, solar wind, coronal mass ejections, etc., are all expressions of magnetic activity in the Sun, collectively known as solar activity (Usoskin, 2017). Sunspot number quantifies sunspots and is widely used because of its long-term availability. There has long been concern about how the sun affects precipitation on Earth. Precipitation in different parts of the world appears to be affected by the sun at various intervals. The effect of solar activity on rainfall varies with time scale and region, leading to both positive and negative correlations (Tsiropoula, 2003; Zhao et al., 2004; Wasko & Sharma, 2009; Mauas et al., 2011; Rampelotto et al., 2012). Recently, few studies have been conducted on the relationship between solar and precipitation in China (Zhai, 2017; Yu et al., 2019; Song et al., 2022), the United States (Nitka & Burnecki, 2019), Europe (Laurenz et al., 2019), Africa (Mohamed & El-Mahdy, 2021), Argentina (Heredia et al., 2019), Nepal (Tiwari et al., 2021), and Northeast Asia (Song et al., 2022). The economy, agriculture, and ecosystem in India could be seriously impacted by changing rainfall patterns (Doranalu Chandrashekar et al., 2017). Many researchers have looked into the potential of a connection between solar activity and rainfall throughout India or in various regions (Jagannathan & Bhalme, 1973; Ananthakrishnan & Parthasarathy, 1984; Hiremath & Mandi, 2004a; Bhattacharyya & Narasimha, 2005; Agnihotri et al., 2011; Badruddin & Aslam, 2015; Warrier et al., 2017; Thomas & Abraham, 2022b). The direct and indirect effects were studied, and the results were often localised and contradicted other authors (Jagannathan & Parthasarathy, 1973; Bhalme et al., 1981; Hiremath, 2006; Bhattacharyya & Narasimha, 2007; Lihua et al., 2007; Selvaraj et al., 2009; Selvaraj & Aditya, 2011; Selvaraj et al., 2013; Hiremath et al., 2015; Malik & Brönnimann, 2018; Thomas et al., 2023). Kerala is located at the southwest tip of India, bounded east by the Western Ghats and the west by the Arabian Sea. It extends between 8∘15′ and 12∘50′ north latitudes and between 74∘50′ and 77∘30′ east longitudes. It shares boundaries with Karnataka in the north, Tamil Nadu in the east, and the Arabian Sea in the west. Kerala has a wet and tropical climate, and the major contribution is from the southwest monsoon and post-monsoon. The diverse features of Kerala make it more susceptible to climate change. It is known as the ”Gateway of summer monsoon”. Studies of long-term rainfall variability revealed that rainfall during the southwest monsoon significantly reduced while rainfall during the post-monsoon rose (Krishnakumar et al., 2009; Kothawale & Rajeevan, 2017). Recently, few studies have reported the influence of sunspot number on the rainfall over Kerala (Thomas & Abraham, 2022a, b; Thomas et al., 2023). It is crucial to evaluate how solar activity influences rainfall patterns in various parts of the world as this helps comprehend regional variations, enhancing our knowledge of climate change and its localised effects helping in extreme weather events forecasts. In Kerala, recent extreme rainfall events have resulted in landslides or floods that have claimed lives and destroyed property. In India, several studies have linked solar activity to extreme weather events (see, e.g. Bhalme & Mooley (1981); Azad (2011)). However, research on the influence of different solar phases over rainfall is limited. Therefore, looking at extreme rain over the Kerala region during different solar phases will be interesting. This paper studies the possible relation of rainfall over Kerala with sunspot number using Cross-wavelet transform (XWT) and Wavelet coherence (WTC). The solar phases of Solar Cycles SC14 - SC24 are identified, and their relation with extreme rainfall events is evaluated. Section 2 discusses the data and methodology of analysis. Section 3 presents the results and discussion about the wavelet analysis and occurrences of extreme rainfall events during different solar activity phases during different seasons. Section 4 presents the conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09078v1,Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at an oblique heliospheric termination shock,"Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at a heliospheric termination shock is investigated. Using two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation, accelerated pickup ions are self-consistently reproduced by tracking long time evolution of shock with unprecedentedly large system size in the shock normal direction. Reflected pickup ions drive upstream large amplitude waves through resonant instabilities. Convection of the large amplitude waves causes shock surface reformation and alters the downstream electromagnetic structure. A part of pickup ions are accelerated to tens of upstream flow energy in the time scale of \sim 100 times inverse ion gyro frequency. The initial acceleration occurs through shock surfing acceleration mechanism followed by shock drift acceleration mechanism. Large electrostatic potential accompanied by the upstream waves enables the shock surfing acceleration to occur.","A collisionless shock is ubiquitous in space. It is an energy converter formed in a supersonic plasma flow. A variety of explosive phenomena in space, stellar wind, astrophysical jet accompany collisionless shocks. One of the outstanding issues of collisionless shock physics is the mechanism of particle acceleration occurring around it. It is believed that cosmic rays are produced in a collisionless shock through the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism (e.g., Blandford & Eichler (1987)). In order for the DSA mechanism to work, preaccelerated nonthermal particles have to exist near a shock front. However, the mechanism producing such nonthermal particles, which should be dominated by complex microstructures of local electromagnetic fields, has been an open question for a long time. This is called the injection problem (Balogh & Treumann, 2013; Burgess & Scholer, 2015; Amano et al., 2022). The heliospheric termination shock (HTS) is thought to be an ideal laboratory to study the injection process, because the anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) having typically several tens of mega electron volts (MeV) are believed to be accelerated there (Chalov, 2006). However, the Voyager spacecraft observed only little amount of ACRs in the heliosheath, downstream of the HTS (e.g., Stone et al. (2005)). The reason for this was inferred by McComas & Schwadron (2006) as that efficient acceleration of ACRs occurs in the flank regions of the HTS, where geometrical condition of the local HTS is more suitable for particle acceleration than that of the HTS where the two Voyager spacecraft crossed. On the other hand, Giacalone et al. (2021) recently performed hybrid (kinetic ions with charge neutralizing electron fluid) simulations and showed that the acceleration rate of low energy (\lesssim 50 keV) pickup ions (PUIs) is more or less independent of the position in the HTS. The nonthermal particles in this energy range are expected to have their global map obtained in the near future through the IMAP (Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe) mission. In their simulation (Giacalone et al., 2021), turbulence in the solar wind is taken into account. Particles are expected to undergo scattering by the turbulent field, leading to some degree of acceleration, and there is a potential for these particles to be injected into the DSA process (Giacalone et al., 2021; Trotta et al., 2021; Pitňa et al., 2021; Zank et al., 2021; Trotta et al., 2022; Nakanotani et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). Another expected effect is the tilting of local magnetic field line. In oblique shocks particles reflected by the shock travel upstream, exciting waves themselves and generating mildly accelerated particles injected into the DSA process. Such a situation may occur in some specific regions of termination shock and perhaps locally everywhere when solar wind is turbulent. In this scenario, the generation of mildly accelerated particles needs to occur near the shock, but the detailed mechanism is not well understood. This study aims to validate the latter scenario. It is thought that initial acceleration sets in when a particle is reflected at the shock. In general shock potential strongly affects the reflection of PUIs. In a hybrid simulation, the electrostatic potential is typically derived from a generalized Ohm’s law, which includes a term proportional to the electron pressure gradient. Calculating this electron pressure gradient term requires assuming a specific equation of state for electrons. Consequently, the electrostatic field in a hybrid simulation becomes model-dependent. Swisdak et al. (2023) pointed out that fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation leads to higher fluxes and maximal energies of PUIs than hybrid simulation likely due to differences in the shock potential. Before the Voyager spacecraft crossed the HTS, the shock surfing acceleration (SSA) was widely accepted as a plausible mechanism of injection (Lee et al., 1996; Zank et al., 1996). However, the Voyager did not observe the expected amount of high energy particles when they crossed the HTS (Decker et al., 2008). This implies that the shock surfing acceleration mechanism did not work effectively either. The reason for that SSA does not work in the termination shock was explained by Matsukiyo & Scholer (2014) by using one-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of (quasi-)perpendicular shock that most of potential jump in a PUI mediated shock occurs in an extended foot produced by reflected PUIs so that the potential jump at a shock ramp is insufficiently small for the SSA mechanism to work. The shock potential in an oblique PUI mediated shock has not been extensively studied so far. Although the ab-initio PIC simulation is useful to reproduce complex multiscale electromagnetic structures responsible for injection processes, it requires large numerical cost. That is why PIC simulation of a collisionless shock in a plasma containing PUIs has been limitted mainly to the cases with one spatial dimension (e.g., Lee et al. (2005); Matsukiyo et al. (2007); Matsukiyo & Scholer (2011, 2014); Oka et al. (2011); Lembege & Yang (2016, 2018); Lembege et al. (2020)). Two-dimensional PIC simulations including PUIs are first conducted by Yang et al. (2015). They focused on the impact of PUIs on shock front nonstationarity of a perpendicular shock, \Theta_{Bn}=90^{\circ}, and energy dissipation up to t=8\Omega^{-1}_{i}, where \Theta_{Bn} denotes the shock angle, the angle between shock normal and upstream magnetic field, and \Omega_{i} is upstream ion cyclotron frequency. Kumar et al. (2018) performed longer simulation up to t\sim 30\Omega^{-1}_{i} for quasi-perpendicular shocks, \Theta_{Bn}=80^{\circ}. They paid more attention to energy distribution of PUIs and solar wind ions (SWIs) for different upstream velocity distribution functions of PUIs. A little longer calculation up to t\sim 40\Omega^{-1}_{i} was done with \Theta_{Bn}=70^{\circ} by Swisdak et al. (2023). However, since the shock angle is close to or equal to perpendicular in the above previous studies, significant acceleration of PUIs are not reproduced. Indeed, when considering the average values, the shock angle of the termination shock is nearly perpendicular. However, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, it is easy to predict that the local shock angle fluctuates significantly due to the effects of solar wind turbulence and unsteady solar activity. This fluctuation could have important implications for the ion injection process. In this study we focus the initial acceleration, which is often called injection process, of PUIs at an oblique HTS. The microstructures of a local oblique HTS with \Theta_{Bn}=50^{\circ}, and with 60^{\circ} and 70^{\circ} for comparison, mediated by the presence of PUIs and their impact on PUI acceleration are discussed by performing two-dimensional full PIC simulation with unprecedentedly long simulation time (t_{max}=125\Omega^{-1}_{i})."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08612v1,"Simulating the Arrival of Multiple Coronal Mass Ejections that Triggered the Gannon Superstorm on May 10, 2024","The May 10, 2024 space weather event stands out as the most powerful storm recorded during the current solar cycle. This study employs a numerical framework utilizing a semi-empirical coronal model, along with HUXt (Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation with time-dependence) and cone-CME models for the inner heliosphere, to forecast solar wind velocity and the arrival of CMEs associated with this event. The simulations were also carried out using Space Weather Adaptive SimulaTion (SWASTi) and a drag-based model (DBM) for this complex event of multiple CMEs. Predicted arrival times and velocities from these models are compared with actual observations at the Sun-Earth L1 point. These simulations reveal that three coronal mass ejections (CMEs) reached Earth nearly simultaneously, resulting in the extreme space weather event, followed by the arrival of a few more eruptions. The simulations accurately predicted arrival times with a discrepancy of approximately 5 hours or less for these CMEs. Further, the ensemble study of DBM shows the sensitivity of the CME arrival time to the background solar wind speed and drag parameters. All three models have done fairly well in reproducing the arrival time closely to the actual observation of the CMEs responsible for the extreme geomagnetic storm of May 10, 2024. These rare solar storms offered a unique opportunity to thoroughly evaluate and validate our advanced models for predicting their arrival on the Earth.","Extreme space weather events, driven by intense solar activity, can be initiated by powerful solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at the Sun. The arrival of these transients from the Sun causes geomagnetic storms in Earth’s near-space environment, that have the potential to severely disrupt our technological systems. A notable historical example is the Carrington Event of 1859, which caused widespread telegraph failures and auroras at unusually low latitudes. Another case is the Halloween Storms which occurred during solar cycle 23. These were a series of intense solar storms between late October and early November 2003, driven by a series of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The Halloween storms caused widespread disruptions, including satellite anomalies, GPS navigation issues, and power system disturbances across various regions, exposing the vulnerability of modern technological infrastructure to such extreme space weather events. The intense storms also caused auroras to be visible at much lower latitudes than usual. In the current solar cycle (SC-25), a powerful solar storm impacted Earth in early May 2024. This event was triggered by the intense activity from the active region AR13664 of the Sun. This region unleashed a series of X-class flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during 8-9 May 2024, that were directed toward Earth. The resulting geomagnetic storm was very intense reaching extreme (NOAA G5) levels (Minimum Dst index \sim-412 nT). This is the biggest Geomagnetic storm since 2003 in terms of its strength, and the active region on the Sun was as big as the Carrington event. This series of events is now being called the ‘Gannon Superstorm of 2024 ’in honor of the space weather physicist Jenn Gannon (Yamazaki et al., 2024). Such extreme events underscore the importance of space weather forecasting, not only to the research community but also to the governments, space sector, and industry stakeholders (Schrijver et al., 2015). The models that predict the arrival of these events generally use Solar surface magnetic field observations as their basic input and use either empirical or semi-empirical methods, or magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) based simulations to arrive at solar wind parameters at different points in the heliosphere. Almost all models use a coupled two-domain procedure to arrive at solar wind parameters near the Earth and other planets. In this study, we use the WSA approach in the coronal domain and the HUXt (heliospheric upwind extrapolation with time-dependence) (Owens et al., 2020; Barnard & Owens, 2022) with CONE-CME model in the inner heliospheric domain, to arrive at the temporal variation of solar wind velocity for the period 9-15 May 2024. The predicted arrival times and velocities are compared with the ensemble drag-based model as well as actual observations at the Sun-Earth L1 point."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08686v2,The Lense–Thirring effect at work in M87,"Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87∗ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole’s spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole’s external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense–Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post–Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87∗. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense–Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of 0.56\pm 0.02 radians per year of the jet’s one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole’s spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole’s spin axis and the jet’s one stays constant over the years amounting to 1.16^{\circ}, in agreement with its measured value of 1.25^{\circ}\pm 0.18^{\circ}. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet’s angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense–Thirring precessional model.","The focus of this paper is on the so–called Lense–Thirring (LT) effect111In fact, recent historical studies 2007GReGr..39.1735P ; 2008mgm..conf.2456P ; Pfister2014 pointed out that it would be more correct to rename it as Einstein–Thirring–Lense effect; however, the name which has now entered into common use will be used throughout the paper. 1918PhyZ…19..156L ; 1984GReGr..16..711M , arising to the first post–Newtonian (1pN) order of the General Theory of Relativity (GTR), and its applicability to the context of the temporal evolution of the accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBH) lurking at galactic cores.

This paper will confirm it clearly and transparently in a way hopefully understandable to a broader audience not specialized in GRMHD nor in black hole (BH) astrophysics. The present work aims also to build a bridge that confidently unites, on the one hand, the community that deals with celestial mechanics and astrodynamics and, on the other hand, the one that studies astrophysics of compact objects by translating the language used by one into that adopted by the other and vice versa. This should make it easier for the two communities to read each other’s work, potentially stimulating new collaborations. The following physical and orbital parameters are used throughout the paper. G is the Newtonian constant of universal gravitation, while c is the speed of light in vacuum. Furthermore, M is the mass of a localized gravitational field source, whether it is a material body with a physical surface or not, such as a BH, acting as the primary in a gravitationally bound restricted two–body system made of itself and a test particle orbiting it, {\mathchoice{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}}:=GM, is its standard gravitational parameter, R_{\mathrm{g}}:={\mathchoice{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}}/c^{2} is its gravitational radius, \boldsymbol{J} is its spin angular momentum, J is its magnitude, and \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}:=\boldsymbol{J}/J is its spin axis arbitrarily oriented with respect to some asymptotic333It means that, in principle, its inertial nature may be limited by some residual tidal effects due to external gravitational fields; here, they will be considered negligible. inertial reference frame \mathcal{K} centered in the field’s source. For a rotating BH 1970Natur.226…64B , whose external spacetime is believed to be described by the Kerr metric 1963PhRvL..11..237K ; 2015CQGra..32l4006T , it is 1986bhwd.book…..S J=\chi M^{2}G/c, where \chi is a dimensionless number whose (absolute) value ranges from 0 (no rotation, static Schwarzshild BH) to444The aforementioned condition on the dimensionless spin parameter holds only for the Kerr metric. For material bodies, it is generally not satisfied. Suffice it to say that for, e.g., the Earth and Jupiter it is \chi_{\oplus}\simeq 738,\chi_{\jupiter}\simeq 860; for the Sun, it is \chi_{\odot}\simeq 0.2. 1 (maximally rotating BH, or extreme Kerr BH). If \chi>1, a naked singularity without a horizon would occur, implying the possibility of causality violations because of closed timelike curves. It may be worth of recalling that, although not yet proven, the cosmic censorship conjecture 2002GReGr..34.1141P states that naked singularities may not be formed via the gravitational collapse of a material body. The parameter \chi, which can also be viewed as the second characteristic length555Sometimes, the symbol a is used for J/\left(Mc\right) itself, in which case it is dimensionally a length. J/\left(Mc\right) occurring in the Kerr metric 1963PhRvL..11..237K ; 2015CQGra..32l4006T measured in units of the gravitational radius R_{\mathrm{g}}, is usually denoted with a in BH studies. The motion of an uncharged and nonspinning massive particle in the full Kerr metric was described in 1972ApJ…178..347B ; 1972PhRvD…5..814W . Ways to probe possible departures from the Kerr metric in the strong–field regime are discussed, e.g., in 2024arXiv240602454G. As far as the orbit of the test particle is concerned, the semimajor axis is half the sum of its maximum and minimum distances from the primary, so that it characterizes the orbit’s size. In celestial mechanics, it is commonly denoted with a; thus, caution is in order since it may be confused with the BH’s spin parameter. The eccentricity, which determines the shape of the orbit, is usually denoted with e, being 0\leq e<1. A circle of radius a\equiv r_{0} is obtained for e=0 (the maximum and the minimum distances from the primary are identical), while a highly eccentric orbit has e close to unity. In BH studies, e can reach very large values as for many S–type stars revolving around the SMBH in the Galactic Centre (GC) at Sagittarius A∗ (Sgr A∗) 2009ApJ…692.1075G ; 2010RvMP…82.3121G ; 2017ApJ…837…30G . On the other hand, if the test particle is representative of a fluid element of an accretion disk around a SMBH, e is assumed to be zero. The orientation of the orbital plane with respect to \mathcal{K}, or, equivalently, of the orbital angular momentum \boldsymbol{h} of the test particle, is fixed by two angles which, in celestial mechanics, are customarily denoted with I and \mathit{\Omega}. The former, called inclination, is the tilt of \boldsymbol{h} with respect to some direction of \mathcal{K} chosen as reference z axis, and ranges from 0^{\circ} to 180^{\circ}. The orbits characterized by 0^{\circ}\leq I<90^{\circ} are called prograde, while those with 90^{\circ}<I\leq 180^{\circ} are defined as retrograde. Orbits with I=90^{\circ} are said polar since they pass through the poles of the primary. In BH studies, I is usually denoted with \phi and called viewing angle, while the reference z direction is the line of sight (LOS), usually oriented towards the observer 2023Natur.621..711C . The other angle \mathit{\Omega} is the longitude of the ascending node. It lies within the fundamental plane \Pi of \mathcal{K}; the latter one is the reference plane perpendicular to the direction with respect to which I is reckoned; in general, it does not coincide with the primary’s equatorial plane. \mathit{\Omega}, ranging from 0^{\circ} to 360^{\circ}, is counted from the reference x direction to the point on the line of nodes crossed by the particle from below, where the upward direction is that of \boldsymbol{h}; such a crossing point is the ascending node, denoted with \ascnode. In turn, the line of nodes is the intersection of the orbital plane with \Pi. Stated differently, \mathit{\Omega} is the angle reckoned from the reference x direction to the projection of \boldsymbol{h} onto \Pi. In the BH literature, \Pi is the plane of the sky, while \mathit{\Omega} is called position angle (PA) of the sky–projected orbital angular momentum, being denoted with \eta 2023Natur.621..711C . Finally, the orientation of the orbit within the orbital plane itself, or, equivalently, of the line of apsides being the latter ones the pericentre and the apocentre, is determined by the argument of pericentre \omega. It is an angle which ranges from 0^{\circ} to 360^{\circ}, and is reckoned within the orbital plane from the line of nodes towards the ascending node to the point of closest approach. Figure \T@reffigure0 displays a generic Keplerian ellipse, arbitrarily oriented in space and within its orbital plane, with a massive spinning primary located at one of its foci; its spin axis \boldsymbol{\hat{k}} is not directed along any preferred direction. Figure 1: Keplerian ellipse followed by a test particle orbiting an object of mass M located at one of its foci at distance r\left(t\right). The fundamental plane \Pi of the asymptotically inertial reference system \mathcal{K} adopted is shaded in gray. The unit vector \boldsymbol{\hat{k}} of the primary’s spin angular momentum is arbitrarily oriented with respect to \mathcal{K}. The angles I,\mathit{\Omega} and \omega, are the inclination, the longitude of the ascending node and the argument of pericentre, respectively. The ascending and descending nodes are labelled with \ascnode and \descnode, respectively. The unit vectors \boldsymbol{\hat{l}},\boldsymbol{\hat{m}},\boldsymbol{\hat{h}} and \boldsymbol{\hat{P}}, given by Equations (\T@refelle)–(\T@refacca) and Equation (\T@refPi), are clearly visible. The lines of nodes and apsides are shown dashed. Also the true anomaly f\left(t\right), reckoning the instantaneous position of the orbiter with respect to the pericentre, is displayed for completeness. Figure \T@reffigure0b is focussed on the SMBH’s spin axis and the orbital angular momentum. For the sake of convenience, the notation of 2023Natur.621..711C is adopted for the angles determining their orientation in space. Figure 2: SMBH’s spin axis \boldsymbol{\hat{k}} and unit vector of the disk’s orbital angular momentum \boldsymbol{\hat{h}}. The notation of 2023Natur.621..711C is adopted for their angles whose numerical values were chosen here solely for illustrative purposes. If only the Newtonian mass monopole acceleration A_{\mathrm{N}}={\mathchoice{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}}/r^{2} acts on the test particle, where r is its instantaneous distance from its primary, all the aforementioned orbital parameters stay constant. Should some post–Keplerian (pK) accelerations A_{\mathrm{pK}} other than A_{\mathrm{N}} be present, altering the otherwise purely Keplerian motion, then (some of) the orbital parameters undergo steady temporal variations which manifest themselves cumulatively revolution after revolution. Such a picture, which can be traced back to a perturbative scheme, is valid to the extent that the other pK accelerations are sufficiently smaller than A_{\mathrm{N}}. The LT effect is a consequences of the so–called gravitomagnetic field arising from the off–diagonal components g_{0i},\,i=1,2,3 of the spacetime metric tensor g_{\mu\nu},\,\mu,\nu=0,1,2,3, which, in turn, are determined by the mass–energy currents of the source under consideration Thorne86 ; 1986hmac.book..103T ; 1988nznf.conf..573T ; 2001rfg..conf..121M ; 2001rsgc.book…..R ; Mash07 . For a localized rotating object, such as a star or a Kerr BH, the gravitomagnetic field is generated by its angular momentum \boldsymbol{J}. Basically, the LT effect consists of variations of the orientation of both the orbital plane and of the orbit within the orbital plane itself over time 1918PhyZ…19..156L ; 1984GReGr..16..711M ; 2024gpno.book…..I . Instead, the shape and the size of the path are left unaffected along with the time of passage at the pericentre. Attempts to measure them in the Earth’s field with some geodetic satellites 2019JGeod..93.2181P tracked with the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLT) technique SLR11 have been underway for almost 30 years 1996NCimA.109..575C . For different points of view on their reliability and actual accuracy, see, e.g., the reviews 2011Ap&SS.331..351I ; 2013NuPhS.243..180C ; 2013CEJPh..11..531R , and references therein. It should be said that the magnitude of the LT effect around the Earth amounts to a few tens of milliarcseconds per year (mas yr-1), while it is expected to be as large as a few tens of sexagesimal degrees per year ({}^{\circ}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) around M87∗, i.e., more than a million times larger than around our planet. On the other hand, the several competing physical effects of non–gravitational origin which act as sources of systematic bias are generally much more accurately known in the terrestrial scenario than around SMBHs. Other tests of the LT effect were performed also in the fields of Jupiter 2011AGUFM.P41B1620F ; 2024ApJ…971..145D and the Sun 2015IAUGA..2227771P ; Pav2024 ; RussiLT , but they proved to be inconclusive because of the resulting far too large errors and high correlations with other estimated parameters. The only known experiment that has successfully measured a gravitomagnetic effect and which, to date, has not been criticized in the peer–reviewed literature is that conducted by the Gravity Probe B (GP–B) mission Varenna74 ; 2001LNP…562…52E . Indeed, it detected, among other things, the gravitomagnetic Pugh–Schiff precessions Pugh59 ; Schiff60 of the spins of four gyroscopes carried onboard a drag–free spacecraft orbiting the Earth with a 19\% accuracy 2011PhRvL.106v1101E ; 2015CQGra..32v4001E compared to the \simeq 1\% initially expected Varenna74 ; 2001LNP…562…52E . The paper is organized as follows. Section \T@refsect:anal reviews the analytical model of the LT effect, expressed in terms of the both the Keplerian orbital elements and in vectorial form, for a generic orientation of the primary’s spin axis in space. In Section \T@refsec:M87, the results of the previous Section are successfully applied to the case of the measured precession of the jet emanating from M87∗. Section \T@reffine summarizes the findings and offers conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07903v1,Multi-spacecraft observations of the decay phase of solar energetic particle events,"Context. Parameters of solar energetic particle (SEP) event profiles such as the onset time and peak time have been researched extensively to obtain information on acceleration and transport of SEPs. Corotation of particle-filled magnetic flux tubes with the Sun is generally thought to play a minor role in determining intensity profiles. However recent simulations have suggested that corotation has an effect on SEP decay phases, depending on the location of the observer with respect to the active region (AR) associated with the event.Aims. We aim to determine whether signatures of corotation are present in observations of decay phases of SEP events and study how the parameters of the decay phase depend on the properties of the flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with the events.Methods. We analyse multi-spacecraft observations of SEP intensity profiles from 11 events between 2020 and 2022, using data from SOLO, PSP, STEREO-A, and SOHO. We determine the decay time constant, \tau in 3 energy channels; electrons \sim 1 MeV, protons \sim 25 MeV, and protons \sim 60 MeV. We study the dependence of \tau on the longitudinal separation, \Delta\phi, between source active region (AR) and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint on the Sun.Results. Within individual events there is a tendency for the decay time constant to decrease with increasing \Delta\phi, in agreement with test particle simulations. The intensity of the associated flare and speed of the associated CMEs have a strong effect on the measured \tau values and are likely the cause of the observed large inter-event variability.Conclusions. We conclude that corotation has a significant effect on the decay phase of a solar energetic particle event and should be included in future simulations and interpretations of these events.","Solar energetic particles (SEPs), accelerated by shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and during flares, in gradual and impulsive events respectively, are detected as sporadic increases of particle intensities up to and past 1 au from the Sun (Klein & Dalla, 2017) by spacecraft in interplanetary space. Typical SEP time-intensity profiles have a rise phase, a peak intensity, and a decay phase. Decay phases, from peak to background levels, can last anywhere between a few hours to several days (Van Allen & Krimigis, 1965). Historically, the analysis of SEP profiles has been based on one spacecraft observing many events from different source locations on the Sun. This allows investigation into how source location affects time profiles (Cane et al., 1988), however, this kind of study cannot separate differences caused by observer location from those caused by the fact that events are produced by different solar eruptions, and that solar wind conditions vary from event-to-event. Presently we are in a golden era of SEP research, with multiple spacecraft capable of taking simultaneous SEP measurements in different locations in interplanetary space. This allows us to compare profiles seen in different locations from the same source active region (AR), reducing effects from parameters which change event-to-event. Multiple spacecraft around the Sun also allows for more frequent particle observations as with more spacecraft there is a higher chance that an event will be observed. Decay phases of SEP events were originally thought to be indicative of the turbulence-induced scattering experienced by SEPs in interplanetary space before reaching the observer. It was thought that longer decay phases resulted from stronger scattering conditions, and shorter decay phases resulted from weaker scattering conditions. A value for the scattering mean free path was derived by fitting the intensity profile (Kallenrode et al., 1992) as modelled via 1D focussed transport. The gradual and impulsive scheme for events came about in the 1990’s, linking acceleration of SEPs to CME-driven shocks for gradual events. The duration of the decay phase for gradual events has since been thought to be related to time-extended shock acceleration, especially at low energies, such that a longer acceleration leads to a longer duration of the decay phase (Reames et al., 1996). In addition to turbulence and acceleration duration, solar rotation can also affect the temporal profile of an SEP event. The outward flow of the solar wind from the Sun generates magnetic flux tubes that are wound into the Parker spiral by the Sun’s rotation. As the Sun spins, the magnetic flux tubes also rotate with the Sun from the east to the west. This effect is referred to as corotation (McCracken et al., 1971). From an intuitive point of view, one would expect some effects of corotation on SEP intensity profiles. Neglecting significant cross-field diffusion, once SEPs are injected into space, corotation causes particle-filled magnetic flux tubes to be ‘pulled’ along towards the west over time, relative to an observer. This means that when an observer views an event from an eastern source region the filled flux tubes are rotating towards them, and when an observer views a western event the filled flux tubes are rotating away from them. This would affect the decay phase, with western events in particular being cut short. If corotation has a significant effect on decay phases of SEP events, this east-west difference should be visible in comparisons of decay phase duration against observer location. Some studies have included corotation such as Giacalone & Jokipii (2012) and Laitinen et al. (2018). Giacalone & Jokipii (2012) simulated impulsive events and included corotation through the movement of field lines over time. They stated that rotation of the field line, along with other transport effects, allows these compact events to be seen at wide longitudes. Laitinen et al. (2018) used a simple 1D diffusion model to simulate SEP propagation from a flare-like injection, and compared simulations with and without corotation. They concluded that corotation affects the event profiles, citing decay phase and intensity differences at different longitudes with respect to source ARs. Daibog et al. (2006) used single-spacecraft observations to investigate the effects of observer longitude on proton intensity profiles. They concluded that the trend they observed is due to the rotational effect discussed in McCracken et al. (1971). However, in the study and modelling of gradual SEP events the role of corotation is usually neglected. This is based upon the results of 1D focussed transport models that included corotation in an approximate way (Lario et al., 1998; Kallenrode & Wibberenz, 1997) and concluded it has negligible effects. Reames et al. (1997) also concluded it does not play an important role, by analysing a few SEP events displaying spatially and temporally invariant spectra. Recent 3D test particle modelling of SEPs injected by a wide shock-like source has suggested that corotation has a significant effect on the decay phases of SEP events. Hutchinson et al. (2023a) ran simulations of SEP propagation which modelled particle transport with and without corotation. They found that including corotation had a notable effect on decay phases with the decay time constant \tau displaying a dependence on the longitudinal separation between source active region and observer footpoint (their Figure 3). Lario (2010) used single-spacecraft observations to investigate decay phases of near relativistic electron events. Figure 10 in their paper analysed the dependence of \tau on source AR longitude. They did not find any dependence of \tau on source AR longitude in their dataset. This work aims to investigate SEP decay phases during 11 multi-spacecraft events. We use data from 4 spacecraft: Solar Orbiter (SolO), the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory - Ahead (STEREO-A). We analyse data for protons and electrons and fit the intensity profiles to obtain the value of the decay time constant \tau. We analyse the dependence of \tau on the relative location between observers and the source AR of the event, as well as the parameters of the solar events accelerating the particles. We aim to investigate possible signatures of corotation and compare any results to those of the simulations of Hutchinson et al. (2023a). In Section 2 we discuss the methodology used to find decay time constant values for the measured intensity-time profiles. In Section 3 we present our results, comparing \tau values with the locations of the observing spacecraft relative to the active region and the parameters of each event. In Section 4 we present our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07145v1,Transient Upstream Mesoscale Structures: Drivers of Solar-Quiet Space Weather,"In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that space weather disturbances can be triggered by transient upstream mesoscale structures (TUMS), independently of the occurrence of large-scale solar wind (SW) structures, such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Different types of magnetospheric pulsations, transient perturbations of the geomagnetic field and auroral structures are often observed during times when SW monitors indicate quiet conditions, and have been found to be associated to TUMS. In this mini-review we describe the space weather phenomena that have been associated with four of the largest-scale and the most energetic TUMS, namely hot flow anomalies, foreshock bubbles, travelling foreshocks and foreshock compressional boundaries. The space weather phenomena associated with TUMS tend to be more localized and less intense compared to geomagnetic storms. However, the quiet time space weather may occur more often since, especially during solar minima, quiet SW periods prevail over the perturbed times.","For decades, space weather phenomena have been thought to be strictly related to solar activity. This is mainly due to the fact that the strongest magnetospheric and ionospheric disturbances, geomagnetic storms and substorms [e.g., 2], occur during the passage of large-scale structures (of the order of \gtrsim1 a.u.) in the solar wind (SW), such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections, stream interaction regions and interplanetary shocks [e.g., 28]. During such events, most extreme conditions conducive for space weather, such as large southward IMF, high speed solar wind, and large dynamic pressure (Pdyn) fluctuations, may be met. This in turn drives strong magnetopause motion and reconnectiom. Geomagnetic storms and substorms have been a subject of extensive research for a long time because they can interfere with our technologies by disrupting the proper functioning of, for example, electric grids, GPS signals, and artificial satellites [e.g., 15]. However, in recent years it has become clear that some space weather phenomena, such as bursts of large-amplitude magnetospheric ultra-low-frequency (ULF) pulsations, transient (nonperiodic) geomagnetic disturbances, auroras, etc. may occur in the absence of known space weather drivers [71]. Since their origin is not related to solar disturbances, we here refer to them as solar-quiet space weather. Such phenomena may be caused by transient upstream mesoscale structures (TUMS). These form in the region upstream of the bow-shock of Earth. The term mesoscale refers to their typical scale sizes ranging form \sim2000 km to more than 10 Earth radii (1 R_{\mathrm{E}}\sim 6400\,km) [71]. The sizes of the largest TUMS are thus comparable to but smaller than the transverse diameter of the dayside magnetosphere [\sim30 RE 63]. TUMS owe their existence to the collisionless bow-shock that stands in front of our planet. The bow-shock dissipates some of the SW kinetic energy by deflecting and energizing a small portion of the incident particles (electrons, ions). At its Qpar section, where the angle between the upstream IMF and the local shock normal is less than 45∘, reflected particles may escape back upstream to large distances where they coexist with the incoming SW. Such non-Maxwellian particle distributions lead to different instabilities, forming a highly perturbed foreshock region [16]. The formation mechanisms for TUMS fall into three categories: (1) the interaction of IMF directional discontinuities in the SW [6] with the bow-shock or (2) with the reflected foreshock ions and (3) due to internal foreshock processes. The main reason why TUMS have such an impact on the near-Earth environment is the variation in magnetic field orientation and strength and the SW Pdyn inside them which lead to modifications of the total (dynamic, thermal and magnetic) pressure impinging upon the magnetopause [e.g., 4]. As has been shown in the past, upstream negative and positive pressure pulses excite toroidal and poloidal mode waves in the Pc5 frequency range [69, 72]. Even modest positive pressure pulses may also lead to an increase in temperature anisotropy of energetic protons which in turn results in ion-cyclotron instability and consequently in Pc1 magnetospheric waves [42, 1]. Pdyn variations have also been found to generate field aligned currents [FACs, 3, 39] and intensify whistler mode waves [33, 55]. FACs can lead to electron precipitation and discrete auroras, while the intensified whistler mode waves can scatter electrons into loss cones and induce diffuse auroras. Finally, it should be mentioned that various types of TUMS have been observed at other planets, [e.g., 43, 36, 47, 64, 11, 9, 8, 10, 65, 53, 40, 37], although their impact on the corresponding downstream regions has not been studied due to the lack of multi-spacecraft observations. It is the purpose of this mini review to summarize the impact of the largest-scale TUMS on the near-Earth environment. In the following sections we describe such effects caused by hot flow anomalies (HFA, section 2), foreshock bubbles (FB, 3), foreshock compressional boundaries (FCB, 4), and travelling foreshocks (TF, 5). The HFAs and TFs fall into the first category in terms of their formation mechanisms, FBs fall into the second category, while the FCBs occur due to internal foreshock processes. In section 6 we summarize these effects while in section 7 we list some of the future tasks needed to be done in order to deepen our knowledge about the subject."
