This TTL coupling is anticipated to be one of the primary noise sources in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, after Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) is applied. Despite the careful interferometer design and calibration on the ground, TTL is likely to require in-flight mitigation through post-processing subtraction to achieve the necessary sensitivity. Past research has demonstrated TTL subtraction in simulations through the estimation of 24 linear coupling coefficients using a noise minimization approach. This paper investigates an approach based on performing rotation maneuvers for estimating coupling coefficients with low uncertainties. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility and optimal configurations of such maneuvers to identify the most efficient solutions. We assess the efficacy of TTL calibration maneuvers by modulating either the spacecraft (SC) attitude or the Moving Optical Sub-Assembly (MOSA) yaw angle. We found that sinusoidal signals with amplitudes of around 30\text{\,}\mathrm{nrad}\text{/} and frequencies near 43\text{\,}\mathrm{mHz}\text{/} are practical and nearly optimal choices for such modulations. Employing different frequencies generates uncorrelated signals, allowing for multiple maneuvers to be executed simultaneously. Our simulations enable us to estimate the TTL coefficients with precision below 15\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\text{/}\mathrm{rad} (1-\sigma, in free space) after a total maneuver time of 20 minutes. The results are compared to the estimation uncertainties that can be achieved without using maneuvers.","LISA is a space-based Gravitational Wave (GW) detector that will operate within a measurement band ranging from approximately 0.1\text{\,}\mathrm{mHz}\text{/} to 1\text{\,}\mathrm{Hz}\text{/} [1]. The detector is composed of three SC, arranged in an almost equilateral triangle with 2.5 million \mathrm{km}\text{/} arm length, that will trail behind the Earth in a heliocentric orbit. The LISA mission is led by the European Space Agency (ESA) and was recently adopted for an expected launch in the 2030s. Each SC will host two MOSA, each comprising a telescope, an Optical Bench (OB) and a Test Mass (TM). Each MOSA will be pointed towards one of the two remote SC. The MOSA will be designated using the notation shown in Fig. 1, where MOSA ij refers to the assembly on SC i facing SC j. The lengths of the three arms of the LISA constellation will vary with time, unlike ground-based GW detectors. This leads to the interferometric measurements being highly affected by laser frequency noise. To mitigate this noise, the TDI [2] algorithm will be applied to generate TDI output variables, which mimic three virtual equal-arm interferometers. In this study we examine the second generation Michelson X,Y,Z combinations. These variables will be affected by TTL coupling, i.e. they contain error terms which depend on the MOSA tilt angles with respect to (w.r.t.) the incident beam. This TTL should be estimated and subtracted from the measurements in post-processing. In this paper we investigate the possibility of using rotation maneuvers to estimate the TTL coefficients, i.e. the parameters of the TTL model. By injecting a modulation signal into the angles that cause TTL, the signal for the fit is enhanced. This can reduce the uncertainty in the TTL coefficient estimation. This option could be used if TTL is less well separable from other noise terms or GW signals than anticipated. In such a case, the maneuvers could serve as a beneficial backup plan. It may also be decided to perform such maneuvers once within the commissioning phase. TTL maneuvers have already been performed in the LISA Pathfinder (LPF) mission, cf. [3, 4]. A comparable approach has successfully been used in the GRACE Follow-On (GFO) mission and is considered for future geodesy missions as well [wegener_phd, wegener_2020]. Other sources addressing TTL in LISA include [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Wanner et al. [5] provide a comprehensive analytical description of TTL in the individual interferometers of LISA as well as in the TDI Michelson variables. In [6] and [7], it is described how the TTL error can be estimated through noise minimization and subtracted from the TDI variables, utilizing pointing angles measured by Differential Wavefront Sensing (DWS) [11]. George et al. [8] apply a Fisher information matrix analysis to derive lower bounds for the uncertainty with which the TTL coefficients can be estimated and use these to analyze the residual TTL noise after post-processing subtraction. Figure 1: LISA SC constellation, MOSA index notation. Image credit: [6]. In [9], the observability of TTL in the TDI Michelson variables is shown by propagating the TTL contributions through the TDI algorithm. The two options of estimating the TTL coefficients with or without rotation maneuvers are discussed. Periodic maneuvers at frequencies outside the LISA measurement band are considered, in order not to degrade the science measurements. Thus, large amplitudes are required, however, the feasibility of such maneuvers is not discussed. This study is extended in [10] by additionally considering GW signals in the measurements and introducing a separation of TDI variables that allows performing TTL maneuvers without disturbing science operations. The maneuvers discussed in [10] are stochastically generated, instead of periodic stimuli. A quantitative analysis of the estimation error is performed, however, a rather long integration time of 15 hours was assumed. This paper follows a different approach of designing dedicated TTL maneuvers, focussing on sinusoidal stimuli at frequencies within the LISA measurement band. We investigate what angular amplitudes are achievable when implemented via SC or MOSA rotations. A detailed analysis of the estimation uncertainty shows a strong dependency on the maneuver frequency, which can be optimized subsequently. In order to maximize the efficiency, we develop a plan to perform several maneuvers simultaneously. This facilitates very good estimation of the TTL coefficients after an integration time of merely 20 minutes. With simulations we quantify the improvement that such maneuvers provide over the noise minimization approach. The notation and the TTL model are defined in Sec. II. In Sec. III, the simulator settings are specified. The parameter estimation method is briefly described in Sec. IV. Section V on the maneuver design is the main part of this paper. In particular, we discuss the optimal maneuver frequency, and how multiple maneuvers can be performed simultaneously. The simulation results are reported in Sec. VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10366v1,Numerical gravitational backreaction on cosmic string loops from simulation,"We report on the results of performing computational gravitational backreaction on cosmic string loops taken from a network simulation. The principal effect of backreaction is to smooth out small-scale structure on loops, which we demonstrate by various measures including the average loop power spectrum and the distribution of kink angles on the loops. Backreaction does lead to self-intersections in most cases, but these are typically small. An important effect discussed in prior work is the rounding off of kinks to form cusps, but we find that the cusps produced by that process are very weak and do not significantly contribute to the total gravitational-wave radiation of the loop. We comment briefly on extrapolating our results to loops as they would be found in nature.","Cosmic strings are one-dimensional topological defects formed in the early universe by a spontaneously-broken symmetry [1] with a non-simply-connected vacuum manifold. (See [2] for a review.) They are a generic prediction of grand unified models of particle physics [3], and can also arise from the collision of D-branes in a string-theoretic model [4, 5]. The symmetry-breaking endows the strings with a mass; depending on the details of the breaking, they might also carry currents [6] or be part of a hybrid network with other defects [7, 8, 9]. In addition, strings are called global or local (a.k.a. gauge) based on the kind of symmetry which is broken. Regardless of these details, it is generally accepted that the symmetry breaking produces a network of strings which fills the universe. While there has not yet been a detection of cosmic strings, predictions of detectable signals (and constraints based on non-observations) rely principally on the characteristics of this network and the loops within it. The detection of gravitational waves is one of the most promising channels for finding cosmic strings, particularly now that we are in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy, and many gravitational-wave observatories are searching for strings [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. In addition to sourcing gravitational waves that we might observe, gravitational effects of the string act on the loop itself in a process termed gravitational backreaction. This self-interaction changes the shape of the loop [18], in turn changing the pattern of gravitational waves emitted. Thus, an understanding of gravitational backreaction’s effects on loops is critical for making precise predictions about potentially-observable signals from cosmic strings. However, solving this problem analytically is intractable. Even for simple models of cosmic string shapes, exact solutions are known only for a few cases [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. In a realistic network, the typical loop’s shape is complex [24] and not easily described by simple mathematical functions. Any large-scale study of how loops in such a network evolve must be done computationally. This of course brings its own problems, namely computational time complexity, which require the development of specialized methods and codes [22, 25]. In this paper, we present the results of numerically evolving loops taken from large network simulations, under gravitational backreaction. We focus on gauge strings which are coupled only to gravity. In Sec. II, we review some useful properties of strings, discuss how we represent strings in our code, and introduce the corpus of loops we study in the remainder of the work. In Sec. III, we review how the numerical evolution is done, discuss the computational effort involved, and summarize the evolution of the realistic loops we studied. In Sec. IV, we discuss how we compute the gravitational radiation power from our loops. In Sec. V, we discuss backreaction’s effects on self-intersections (V.1), loop power spectra (V.2), the formation of cusps (V.3), and smoothing (V.4); in addition, we discuss how to extrapolate our results to loops as they might be found in nature (V.5). We conclude in Sec. VI. We work in units where the speed of light and \hbar are taken to be 1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10349v1,The Critical Role of LIGO-India in the Era of Next-Generation Observatories,"Multi-messenger astronomy, driven by gravitational-wave observations, is a rapidly evolving field poised for significant advancements over the next decade. This paper examines the role of the upcoming LIGO-India detector in enhancing multi-messenger efforts by comparing ten network configurations using key metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sky localization area (\Delta\Omega_{90}), and the precision of astrophysical parameter measurements. Our results show that a network with two L-shaped Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors and one triangular Einstein Telescope (ET) performs best, detecting nearly the entire annual binary neutron star merger population (\sim 16,000 events) up to a redshift of 0.5 with \acs{snr}\geq 10, and localizing over 10,000 events within 10\,\mathrm{deg}^{2}, including 146 events within 0.1\,\mathrm{deg}^{2}. It also detects over 9,000 events with relative luminosity distance errors \Delta D_{L}/D_{L}<0.1, including 110 events with sub-percent errors in D_{L}. Notably, replacing the 20 km CE detector with LIGO-India retains comparable performance, achieving a similar number of detections and localization of over 9,000 events within 10\,\mathrm{deg}^{2}, including 86 events within \Delta\Omega_{90}\leq 0.1\,\mathrm{deg}^{2}. This configuration detects over 5,700 events with luminosity distance errors under 10%, including 55 events with under 1% error in D_{L}. Both networks are capable of detecting \mathcal{O}(100) mergers up to 10 minutes pre-merger with localization areas \leq 10\deg^{2}, significantly outperforming a network of two CE detectors and LIGO-Livingston. Our findings highlight LIGO-India’s potential to improve source localization and extend early warning times, which is critical for advancing multi-messenger astrophysics.","\Acfp gw from inspiralling compact binaries offer a direct means to study compact objects like black holes and neutron stars. Predicted in 1915 by Einstein’s theory of general relativity (GR), gravitational-waves were first directly detected in 2015 by the Advanced LIGO detectors, marking the dawn of GW astronomy (Aasi et al., 2015; Abbott et al., 2016). In 2017, the Advance Virgo detector joined this international gravitational wave network (IGWN) (Acernese et al., 2014). Their first joint detection, GW170814—a binary black hole (BBH) merger, was localised to a 90% credible sky area of \Delta\Omega_{90}=60\deg^{2}, a significant improvement over the 1160\deg^{2} localization without Virgo (Abbott et al., 2017a). Notably, the precise localization of GW170817, the first binary neutron star (BNS) merger event, was made possible because it was detected when all the Advanced GW detectors were observing (Abbott et al., 2017b). This allowed for a \Delta\Omega_{90}=33\deg^{2}, enabling electromagnetic (EM) follow-up observations across the spectrum—from gamma rays to radio waves (Abbott et al., 2017c; Goldstein et al., 2017). These multi-messenger observations helped establish BNS mergers as major sites for r-process nucleosynthesis and progenitors of short gamma ray burst (sGRB). (Abbott et al., 2017d, e; Kasen et al., 2017; Goldstein et al., 2017). In contrast, GW190425, the second BNS event, was observed only by the Advanced LIGO detectors. As a result, it had a much larger localization uncertainty of \Delta\Omega_{90}\approx 8000\deg^{2}, nearly a quarter of the sky, making EM follow-up challenging (Abbott et al., 2020). This poor localization was due to the event’s lower SNR and the network configuration at the time. Therefore, improved detector sensitivity, wider baselines, and strategic network configurations are crucial for enhancing future localization accuracy. Ongoing efforts to upgrade current detectors and build new generation of observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) aim to address these limitations (Cahillane & Mansell, 2022; Acernese et al., 2023; Punturo et al., 2010; Evans et al., 2021; Iyer et al., 2011). LIGO-India, the third LIGO interferometer currently being constructed in Aundha, India, is poised to contribute significantly to this effort. Expected to be operational in the 2030s with A+ or A^{\sharp} sensitivity (see Fig. 1, this detector is projected to improve the localization accuracy of sources further as it will provide a wider baseline (Saleem et al., 2021; Shukla et al., 2024; Gupta et al., 2024). Previous studies have analyzed the performance of GW detector networks, demonstrating their potential to advance multi-messenger astronomy, precision cosmology, and tests of GR (Evans et al., 2021; Sathyaprakash et al., 2010; Schutz, 2011; Klimenko et al., 2011; Sathyaprakash et al., 2012; Maggiore et al., 2020; Adhikari et al., 2019; Hall & Evans, 2019; Borhanian & Sathyaprakash, 2024; Branchesi et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a).

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10315v1,Shadow and accretion disk images of Kerr-Newman black hole in modified gravity theory,"In this paper, we study the shadow and images of the accretion disk of Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole (BH) in modified gravity (MOG) theory by using backward ray-tracing method. And, the influence of spin parameter (a), charge (Q), and MOG parameter (\alpha) on the observed features of BHs are carefully addressed. Interestingly, as \alpha increases, the flat edge of the BH’s shadow gradually becomes more rounded, the size of shadow enlarges, and the deviation rate (\delta s) correspondingly decreases. By tracing the photon around BH, we observe that the trajectory of photon exhibits distortion behavior, i.e., the formation of two “tails” near the Einstein ring, which elongate as a increases. For the accretion disk, it shows that the inner shadow expands with \alpha, while decreases with Q. The increase of \alpha exhibits an increasing effect on redshift. At the same parameter level, \alpha has a more obvious effect on inner shadow and image of BH by comparing with that of Q. Our study implies that both \alpha and Q have relatively significant effects on the image of the KN-MOG BH with the thin disk accretion, but the influence of \alpha is much greater. So, this indicates that \alpha plays a dominant role in this spacetime.","Black hole (BH) is a type of dense celestial object predicted by general relativity, scientists have primarily focused on their theoretical study for decades. But in recent years, with advancements in technology, the Laser Interferometer Gravitation Wave Observatory (LIGO) has detected gravitational wave signals generated by the merger of binary BHs in 2015[1]. Later on, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) also captured the first image of a supermassive BH’s shadow in 2019[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This groundbreaking discovery holds significant implications for both observational astronomy and theoretical physics. The BH’s image reveals a bright ring encircling a dark region, identified as the photon ring and the BH’s shadow, respectively[8]. It is well-known that BH’s shadow can offer some deep insights into BH’s properties. The shadow formed by the deflection of light traveling from the distant region around the BH, which is the result of the BH’s intense gravitational field. As more and more researchers focus on optical observations of BHs, the methods for studying BH’s shadows are becoming richer and more diverse. In fact, long before the EHT captured images of BHs, many scientists had already conducted theoretical simulations of light trajectories and BH’s shadow images. In 1966, Synge studied the photon trajectory of a Schwarzschild BH[9]. In 1979, Luminet used computer simulations to predict for the first time that the gravitational field around a BH would bend light, causing BH’s shadow to form[10]. In 2005, Takahashi used BH’s shadows to constraint the electric charge of a BH[11]. And, the shadow can provide some strong evidences for distinguishing BHs in various gravitational theories or matter fields with astronomical observations. For instance, Zhong studied the shadow of a Kerr BH in the presence of a uniform magnetic field[12]; Wei studied the properties of Gauss-Bonner gravity using the shadows of four-dimensional rotating BHs[13]; Wang and Wei demonstrated that BH’s shadows can be used to test the Lorentz symmetry[14]; Yuan combined the first-order QED effect with the numerical inverse ray tracing method to study the shadow of a magnetic charged KN BH[15]. In addition, through the BH’s image provided by the EHT, it is found that the BH’s shadow is related to the BH’s mass, spin parameters, charge parameters, accretion disk and modified gravitational parameters[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 8, 23]. It is widely believed that BHs in the universe are always surrounded by the accretion flows due to strong gravity. Therefore, some researchers have studied the various energy fluxes and the emission spectrum of BHs, and regarded their accretion disk as a perfect black body radiator[24, 25, 26]. And some researchers have studied Schwarzschild BHs by considering spherically symmetric accretion[27]. It is gradually found that when the BH is surrounded by an optically and geometrically thin accretion disk, it can be observed that the BH’s image is composed of bright and dark regions, including direct emission rings, lens rings and photon rings[28]. Selecting different emission functions can also reveal interesting features in the shadows and rings. For thin accretion disk, the contribution of the brighter lens ring and the darker photon ring surrounding the BH’s shadow to the total observed intensity is always quite small, so their contributions to the total observed intensity can be ignored[29]. These features are significant for our study of the images and properties of BHs surrounded by thin accretion disks. Meanwhile other studies show that thin accretion disks have significant effects on BH’s shadow[18, 30, 31, 32, 33]. Through the tireless efforts of researchers, significant progress has been made in the theoretical study of BH’s shadows, accretion disks and BH’s images, making important contributions to astronomical observations[34, 35, 36, 37, 29, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 33, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. On the other hand, Moffat introduced a modified theory of gravity called the scalar-tensor-vector theory of gravity[60], also known as the MOG theory. MOG theory has successfully explained solar system observations, galaxy rotation curves and galaxy cluster dynamics[61, 62, 63, 64, 65]. Also, it gives data of matter power spectrum and cosmic microwave background sound power spectrum[66]. In the study of galactic rotation curves, people can choose modified gravity theory rather than general relativity[67, 68, 69]. In general, the two theories differ in key respects. Many studies have highlighted the difference between MOG and general relativity[70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80]. In 2014, Moffat et al. proposed static BH’s solutions and axisymmetric BH’s solutions in MOG theory[81]. Then, one has in MOG theories studied the thermodynamic properties, quasi-normal scale, shadows and accretion disks of BHs[82, 83, 84, 85]. Although the MOG theory has made great progress in constructing BH’s solutions and studying the physical properties of BHs, the properties of rotating charged BH’s solutions in MOG theory remain unknown. The most general axially symmetric BH solution to Einstein’s equations is the KN solution, which includes spin (a), charge (Q), and angular momentum. This solution in the MOG theory has already been confirmed by researchers[70, 86]. Therefore, it is of great significance to study BH’s shadows and the images of accretion disks in MOG theory. In particular, the shadow of the rotating BH in MOG theory and its observed image under a thin disk are still unclear. In view of this, the aim of this paper is to study the shadows and accretion disk images of rotating charged MOG BHs, with the goal of providing some astronomical observational insights into MOG theory. The structure of this paper is as follows: In section 2, we studied the spacetime properties of the KN BH in the MOG theory and analyzed its shadow images. Section 3, is to introduce the detail of the thin disk model. In section 4, we presented the images of the thin disk accretion, as well as its redshift and intensity distribution, and compared the effects of the MOG parameter on the observed images with that of charge. Finally, section 5 ends with a brief summary."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10098v1,"Gravitational Waves Emission in Quadratic Gravity: longitudinal
modes, angular momentum emission, and positivity of the radiated power","In this paper, the emission of gravitational waves in quadratic gravity theory is examined. The wave equations for massless and massive perturbations are derived, followed by the calculation of the energy and angular momentum radiated. In the quadrupole approximation, and taking into account only the transverse-traceless modes, it is shown that the theory avoids the issues generated by the Ostrogradsky instabilities and achieves positive energy and angular momentum emissions. As an example, a rotating ellipsoid with free precession is analyzed, and the effects of the massive perturbations on its rotation are highlighted.","Gravitational waves are certainly one of the most disruptive discoveries in astrophysics in the recent years. Although its prediction dates back to 1916 [1], the first evidence of its existence was only glimpsed in the 1970s by Hulse and Taylor [2], who observed that the system PSR 1913+16 lost energy and angular momentum in accordance with the theory of General Relativity (GR). It took another 40 years for the first direct detection of a gravitational wave (GW), due to the merger of two black holes, by the LIGO collaboration in 2015 [3]. This event marked the opening of a new window of observations, creating a new perspective for understanding astrophysical phenomena. Two years later, a major breakthrough was achieved with the observation of the merger of two neutron stars by the LIGO-VIRGO collaboration [4]. This was the first event in which both the GW and its electromagnetic counterpart were observed together, marking the beginning of the era of multimessenger astronomy. Besides allowing the comprehension of astrophysics phenomena from a broader perspective, GW is also a powerful tool for studying the gravitational interaction itself. Although GR is the standard theory for gravitation, with several successful predictions, it fails to describe galaxy rotation curves and the accelerated expansion of the Universe in the presence of ordinary matter [5, 6, 7, 8]; the consistent description of the early (inflationary) Universe is hardly achieved by GR without the presence of extra degrees of freedom [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Also, the non-renormalizability and the presence of singularities [16, 17] do not allow us to have a self-consistent quantum version of GR with the standard (perturbative) prescription of quantization. Due to these limitations, there is almost a consensus on the scientific community that GR should not be taken as the definitive theory of gravitation. This motivated the search for new theories of gravity. The proposition of new theories of gravitation can be done by a plethora of different approaches. They include the modification of the geometry [18, 19, 20, 21, 22], the modification of the gravitational action [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30] (in the Riemann manifold), and many others. Usually, all these proposals share one same concern: one should obtain GR (or GR-equivalent theories) as a limiting case. With this in mind, we can understand that one of the simplest extensions to GR, besides considering the cosmological constant, consists of considering contributions to the gravitational action integral of terms that are quadratic in the curvature (this is, for instance, the case of the Starobinsky model of inflation [9]). The presence of quadratic terms in the action (quadratic gravity), however, brings with them a significant modification of the dynamical equations: the field equations are of fourth order in the derivative of the metric tensor. Theories with higher order derivatives are quite appealing in the context of quantum gravity, and some of the problems of GR may eventually be worked around – for instance, it was shown by Stelle [17], that a renormalizable theory of gravity can be obtained for the quadratic Lagrangian. Despite being renormalizable, quadratic gravity exhibits Ostrogradski instability, which, when quantized, gives rise to ghost-like fields [31]. The quantization of these fields is a nontrivial task and often leads to issues with unitarity [32]. One way to address this issue is to recognize that ghosts are unstable and, as a result, do not contribute to the asymptotic spectrum of the theory [33, 34]. Alternatively, one could define a nontrivial norm for ghost states to restore their unitarity [35, 36]. While there is currently no consensus in the literature on how to handle the ghosts present in higher-order models, quadratic gravity and its extensions [37, 38, 33, 39] can be treated as effective theories that implement corrections to GR. The investigation of gravitational waves within the framework of quadratic gravity was particularly analyzed in Ref. [40].111See also Refs. [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46] for related works. In this study, a modification to the Einstein-Hilbert action was proposed, incorporating quadratic contributions from the scalar curvature and the Weyl tensor, i.e., R^{2} and C_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}C^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} terms, respectively. The GWs obtained in this work exhibited two spin-2 modes—one massive and one massless—along with a scalar (spin-0) mode. The emission of GWs from an inspiraling binary system composed of two black holes in the non-relativistic and circular orbit approximations was analyzed, and the parameters of the model were constrained by observational data. Although this work yielded interesting results, it neglected the contributions of spin-2 longitudinal polarizations. Additionally, it did not investigate the loss of angular momentum due to GW emission in the context of quadratic gravity. The present paper aims to address these two issues. The non-conservation of angular momentum in gravitational systems plays an important role both in the dynamics of the physical system that generates the GWs and in the dynamics of the GWs themselves. This is a key focus of the present paper: evaluating the effect of angular momentum transfer from the source to the GWs. This analysis requires careful consideration, as in the linear regime, quadratic actions behave like classical field theories with Lagrangians that present second-order derivatives. From this perspective, we cannot apply the known formulas for the angular momentum current usually derived in the first-order case. This will demand a proper extension, which will presented here. In the context of GWs, the term C_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}C^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}, associated with the massive spin-2 mode, encompasses five degrees of freedom: two transverse and three longitudinal. Furthermore, this term is also responsible for introducing the Ostrogradski instability, which is evident through a negative sign in the energy density carried away by the gravitational wave. Focusing on the specific case of binary systems in the circular orbit approximation, Ref. [40] demonstrated that it is possible to consistently manage this instability by restricting the analysis to the transverse degrees of freedom. However, does this consistency extend to more general scenarios that include longitudinal polarizations and/or account for angular momentum loss? Addressing this question is the main motivation for this paper. In the present paper, we intend to generalize the analysis of the emission of GWs in quadratic gravity are presented in Ref. [40]. We will start by presenting, in Section II, the linear approximation for our quadratic model and the resulting wave equations for the perturbations. Therein, we obtain the conserved currents for our system which are related to the energy-momentum tensor and angular momentum current, both for the GWs. Next, we evaluate the energy and angular momentum carried away by the GWs. In Section III, we restrict the analysis to the quadrupole approximation and consider the propagation of GWs in a generic direction. Then, we evaluate the power radiated and consider a first example of a binary system in circular orbit. This section also includes a detailed discussion of the Ostrogradski instability and a possible solution to this issue. In Section IV, the source of GWs is taken as a rotating ellipsoid with free precession, and the role played by the quadratic terms is analyzed in comparison with the predictions of GR. At last, in Section V, we present our final comments."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09980v1,Next-to-leading order corrections to scalar perturbations of Kerr-anti-de Sitter black holes,"The small Kerr-anti-de Sitter black hole demonstrates instability due to the superradiance of either a massive or massless scalar field. Previous leading-order approximations of the spectrum are inefficient. In particular, the leading-order real part of the eigenfrequency is insensitive to the spin of the black hole. In this work, we improve the analysis by including the next-to-leading-order contribution. Compared to the numerical calculation, the new spin-dependent real part presents significantly better agreement, and the error in the imaginary part is also reduced to less than 60% for most black hole spins.","Black hole (BH) superradiance is a phenomenon characterized by the amplification of perturbation under specific conditions, resulting from the extraction of rotational energy from BHs. This effect serves as a wave analog to the hypothetical Penrose process [1], where energy is extracted by a particle orbiting and decaying within the BH’s ergoregion. Superradiance finds application in diverse research domains, encompassing investigations into the stability of rotating BHs [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. We refer the interested readers to the comprehensive review Brito et al [10] and references therein. The phenomenon of superradiant scattering in BHs was first identified by Zel’dovich [11]. A Kerr BH can amplify an incoming scalar wave with frequency \omega under the condition that \omega<m\Omega_{H} [12, 13], where \Omega_{H} represents the angular velocity of the BH outer horizon and m is the azimuthal number. Press and Teukolsky [14] proposed that if the superradiantly scattered wave is reflected back onto the BH, continuous amplification can occur. This process leads to a reduction in the BH’s angular momentum and rotational energy, a phenomenon commonly referred to as the ”black hole bomb.” This concept is frequently used to illustrate the conditions that lead to superradiance instability [15, 16, 17, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. To enable this reflection process, a potential well near the BH’s event horizon is required to prevent the scattered wave from escaping to infinity. In Kerr spacetime, such a potential well naturally exists for massive bosonic fields. The phenomenon of superradiance of BHs in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space has been studied widely [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. Since the boundary of the AdS spacetime behaves like a well, Kerr-AdS BHs exhibit similar superradiance even for massless bosons. Notably, large AdS BHs are generally stable [38], but small rotating [39, 40] or charged [41] AdS BHs in four dimensions display instability due to superradiance. The computation of superradiance typically involves both numerical and analytical methods. The analytical approach was initially applied to Kerr BHs by Detweiler [42] and later generalized to Kerr-AdS BHs by Cardoso and Dias [39]. This methodology has also been utilized by Li [43], Delice and Durgut [36], Aliev [37] to Kerr-Newman and higher dimension AdS BHs. These studies clearly demonstrate that small Kerr-AdS BHs are unstable in the presence of ultralight scalar fields. However, the leading-order approximation yields eigenfrequencies that are independent of the BH’s spin, which contradicts numerical results [40]. Mathematically, this discrepancy arises from the use of asymptotic solutions in free AdS spacetime, which are applicable in regions far from the BH and fail to account for the BH’s spin. In this study, we incorporate the BH’s spin into the asymptotic solution far from the horizon and generalize the results to the next-to-leading order (NLO) of 1/\ell^{2} and M\mu. We also perform numerical calculations using the shooting method. The analytical and numerical results are then compared, showing good agreement. This paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the fundamental equations and discuss the superradiance condition of BHs. In Sec. III, we provide a brief review of the leading-order calculation. In Sec. IV, we present the results with the NLO correction. In Sec. V, we compare the NLO result with numerical findings. Finally, we summarize our conclusions in Sec. VI. Throughout this article, we adopt natural units with G=\hbar=c=1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09756v1,Cosmic inflation in an extended non-commutative foliated quantum gravity: the wave function of the universe,"We propose a novel extension to the recently developed non-commutative Riemannian foliated branch-cut quantum gravity (BCQG). Based on an extended Faddeev–Jackiw symplectic deformation of the conventional Poisson algebra, we investigate non-commutativity effects on a symplectic topological manifold that provides a natural isomorphic setting composed by a triad of canonically conjugate scalar complex fields which comprise quantum complementary dualities. The extended manifold developed here includes the canonical BCQG cosmic scale factor and its quantum counterparts. It integrates concepts from Hermann Weyl’s perfect fluid domain and introduces a scalar-complex field inspired by inflaton models. This extension allows the elaboration of a scenario where the branch-cut domain coexists with a scalar-complex inflaton-type field, settled on a plateau of a strong-gravity interacting structure, shaped by the primordial energy, radiation-, quintessence-, stiff-, baryon- and dark-matter, and spacetime curvature which would drive cosmic inflation. The resulting symplectic algebraic extension allows additionally a liaison with primordial cosmic density perturbation predictions based on heuristic derivations of the scale invariance of the primordial spectrum of the universe, as well as with eternal inflation and primordial chaotic cosmic mechanisms proposals. Given the peculiar characteristic of BCQG in overcoming the primordial singularity, the non-commutative symplectic extension proposal, due to the complex character of the constituent fields, additionally outlines the evolutionary process of the mirror universe that encompasses analytically continued complex conjugate equations of the Friedmann-type. This brings unique characteristics to the main scenario for the BCQG cosmic evolution, with a mirrored parallel evolutionary universe, adjacent to ours, nested in the structure of space and time. The evolutionary process of the mirror universe occurs in the negative sector of cosmological thermal time, and is characterized by a continuous cosmic contraction, with a systematic and continuous increase in temperature and a decrease in entropy before reaching the transition region to the current stage of the universe. In contrast, the subsequent present evolutionary stage of cosmic expansion is characterized by a positive complex cosmological-time sector, accompanied by a systematic decrease in temperature and increase in entropy. Based on a complementary analytically continued Friedmann-type equation, combined with a quantum approach based on the Hořawa-Lifshitz quantum gravity, we describe the dynamic evolution of the universe’s wave function, unfolding unprecedented predictions for the cosmic evolution and inflation. The non-commutative foliated quantum gravity approach offers a new perspective on explaining the accelerated cosmic expansion of the universe, strongly suggesting that non-commutative algebra induces the late accelerated growth of both the universe’s wave function and the corresponding scale factor, along with their quantum counterparts. In contrast to the conventional inflationary model, where inflation requires a remarkably fine-tuned set of initial conditions in a patch of the universe, non-commutative foliated quantum gravity, analytically continued to the complex plane, captures short and long scales of spacetime, leading to an evolutionary cosmic dynamic through a topological reconfiguration of the primordial cosmic matter and energy content. This result introduces new speculative framework elements regarding the reconfiguration of matter and energy due to an underlying non-commutative spatio-temporal structure as a driver of spacetime cosmic acceleration.","The chronological evolution of the universe comprises different phases, of which the recombination and decoupling periods stand out, as well as a ‘primordial’ era characterized by inflation, followed by the dominant phases of radiation, matter and, currently, a dark energy dominated period, which is widely assumed to be the main cause of the accelerated cosmic expansion. In this work, we focus mainly on the inflationary period, proposing a novel extended approach to the recently developed non-commutative Riemannian foliated branch-cut quantum gravity (BCQG) [1]. We investigate the effects of imposing an extended enhanced non-commutative symplectic deformation of the conventional Poisson algebra on a topological manifold that conveys a natural isomorphic setting of a canonically conjugate triad of dual vector spaces. The extended approach encompasses the cosmic scale factor of BCQG and complementary dual quantum counterparts, outlined in the perfect Hermann Weyl fluid domain and a scalar complex quantum field inflaton-inspired [2]. This scenario allows the coexistence of the quantum domain of branch-cut gravity with an inflationary mechanism that, although controversial for assuming an entire universe starting essentially from nothing, has had remarkable success in explaining relevant qualitative and quantitative properties of the universe [2, 3]. Furthermore, based on this extended scenario, additional conceptual elements, such as density perturbations, grounded on heuristic derivation of the scale invariance of the primordial spectrum of the universe, as well as predictions of an eternal inflation and even primordial chaotic mechanisms associated with the origin of the universe, contribute to broadening the descriptive basis of the original BCQG formulation in order to incorporate elements of standard inflation conceptions. Moreover, in view of the peculiar characteristics of BCQG in overcoming the primordial singularity, this formulation makes it possible, - due to the complex character of the non-commutative symplectic extended composition -, to make predictions about the evolutionary scenarios of the mirror universe by means of complex-conjugated Friedmann-type BCQG equations. This brings unique features to the main BCQG scenario of cosmic evolution, with a parallel, mirror-like, evolutionary universe adjacent to ours, nested in the fabric of space and time, with its evolutionary process in the negative sector of cosmological thermal time corresponding to a contraction process followed by a continuous expansion in its positive temporal sector. These characteristics open up a range of opportunities involving a reverse process to cosmic inflation in the mirror sector. Returning to the aforementioned scenario, the assumed continuous contraction of the mirror universe is accompanied by an increase in temperature and a decrease in entropy before reaching the cosmic transition region. In the subsequent domain to the transition region, the continuous expansion of the universe is accompanied by a systematic decrease in temperature and an increase in entropy corresponding to the positive sector of the complex cosmological time. This formulation allows us to describe the dynamical evolution of the universe’s wave function and the cosmic scale factor. We detail these along with their complementary quantum dual counterparts, achieving unprecedented results."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09748v1,Canonical analysis of unimodular Plebański gravity,"We present the canonical analysis of different versions of unimodular gravity defined in the Plebański formalism, based on a (generally complex) SO(3) spin connection and set of (self-dual) two-forms. As in the metric formulation of unimodular gravity, one can study either a theory with fixed volume form or work in a parametrised formalism in which the cosmological constant becomes a dynamical field, constrained to be constant by the field equations. In the first case, the Hamiltonian density contains a part which is not constrained to vanish, but rather constrained to be constant, again as in the metric formulation. We also discuss reality conditions and challenges in extracting Lorentzian solutions.","General relativity can be defined in terms of a number of different actions and using different dynamical variables. One can work with a spacetime metric as the field encoding spacetime curvature, or use an independent connection; one can introduce an additional local gauge symmetry and work with a tetrad and spin connection; or one can express the dynamics of gravity in terms of torsion or non-metricity. Many of these formulations are reviewed in Ref. Krasnovbook . The (chiral) Plebański formulation takes a slightly different viewpoint from other connection-based approaches by encoding the metric information not in a tetrad but in a set of complex 2-forms Plebanski . The formulation is fundamentally complex since both the 2-forms and the SO(3,\mathbb{C}) spin connection live in the self-dual part (under Hodge duality) in the complexified algebra \mathfrak{so}(3,1)_{\mathbb{C}}; since the Hodge dual squares to -1 in Lorentzian signature a complexification is required. The identification of solutions that correspond to Lorentzian signature solutions to general relativity then requires adding reality conditions to the theory. In Euclidean signature, one can work with self-dual real SO(3) variables instead. The Hamiltonian formulation of the chiral Plebański theory is equivalent to the complex Ashtekar formulation of Hamiltonian general relativity selfdual2forms , itself the basis for canonical quantisation in loop quantum gravity Ashtekar . The result is a simple and elegant version of Hamiltonian general relativity with polynomial constraints and structural similarities to Yang–Mills gauge theory. Again, one needs to add reality conditions which has proven to be very difficult in the quantum theory, so that alternative (non-chiral) real-valued formulations of Plebański gravity were introduced. The canonical analysis of these formulations is also known, and more involved RealPlebanski . In this article we focus on chiral complex formulations, and the Hamiltonian analysis will be more straightforward; we will discuss the issue of reality conditions. Our focus in this article is a canonical analysis of unimodular gravity in the Plebański formulation. Unimodular gravity is a term that can apply to a number of different versions of general relativity based on different actions and symmetry principles (see, e.g., Refs. UnimRefs ; Moreorless ), which are locally equivalent to general relativity but promote the cosmological constant from a constant of Nature to a global integration constant. Hence, these theories have one global degree of freedom in addition to those of standard general relativity. This can be achieved by restricting the diffeomorphism symmetry of general relativity by fixing a volume form RestUG , or by introducing additional fields representing a dynamical cosmological constant as done by Henneaux and Teitelboim in Ref. HenneauxTeitelboim . Both approaches can be implemented in the Plebański formalism as shown in Ref. UnimPleb ; a version based on the Henneaux–Teitelboim approach was already discussed in Ref. Smolin . We will present the canonical analysis of both approaches, including some results that can already be found in Ref. Smolin , while also discussing additional issues of imposing reality conditions and obtaining a metric of different types of Lorentzian signature. Most expressions will apply to both Lorentzian and Euclidean cases. We start in Sec. II by presenting the unimodular formulations of Plebański gravity proposed in Ref. UnimPleb . In Sec. III we will first give an extended summary of the canonical analysis of standard Plebański gravity, which will then facilitate the extension to various unimodular versions of theory given in Sec. IV. We conclude in Sec. V. In Appendix A we derive the transformation behaviour of Lagrange multipliers under gauge transformations, based on invariance of the action."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09742v1,Actions of spinning compact binaries: Spinning particle in Kerr matched to dynamics at 1.5 post-Newtonian order,"The motion of compact binaries is influenced by the spin of their components starting at the 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. On the other hand, in the large mass ratio limit, the spin of the lighter object appears in the equations of motion at first order in the mass ratio, coinciding with the leading gravitational self-force. Frame and gauge choices make it challenging to compare between the two limits, especially for generic spin configurations. We derive novel closed formulas for the gauge-invariant actions and frequencies for the motion of spinning test particles near Kerr black holes. We use this to express the Hamiltonian perturbatively in terms of action variables up to 3PN and compare it with the 1.5 PN action-angle Hamiltonian at finite mass ratios. This allows us to match the actions across both systems, providing a new gauge-invariant dictionary for interpolation between the two limits.","The relativistic two-body problem – and the relativistic problem of motion in general – are notoriously difficult, which was realized soon after the publication of the Einstein equations by the likes of Einstein, Lorentz, Droste, Infeld and Hoffmann [1, 2, 3]. Due to the non-linear nature of the Einstein equations, the field problem has to be tackled simultaneously with the motion of the sources. With physical boundary conditions, eternal bound motions do not exist; the binary systems emit gravitational waves, leading to orbital decay and eventual merger. Consequently, one often resorts to various analytical weak-coupling expansions [4, 5, 6, 7] or complex numerical-relativity setups to solve for the evolution [8, 9]. Furthermore, even for the simplest binary objects, such as black holes, one must consider not only the motion of their centers of mass but also their spin degrees of freedom [10, 11]. The historically first weak-coupling approach to the relativistic two-body problem is the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion, which deals with systems in the limit of low-velocities v and large-separations r [12, 4, 5]. It is optimal for bound systems where the virial theorem indicates that the dimensionless velocity squared scales inversely with separation v^{2}/c^{2}\sim GM/(rc^{2}), with c being the speed of light, G Newton’s constant, and M a characteristic mass. For compact binaries, it also allows to iterate from the well-understood Newtonian two-body problem. Specifically, the Newtonian problem of two compact objects represented as point masses has 6 degrees of freedom corresponding to their spatial positions. In PN theory, each binary member gains an additional spin degree of freedom, yielding a total of 8 degrees of freedom [10, 11]. This indicates that the dynamical system is not necessarily integrable based solely on the number of integrals of motion derived from the system’s rotational and translational symmetries. In general, these symmetries guarantee 6 mutually independent conservation laws, so another 2 have to be supplied for full integrability [10, 13]. Another weak-coupling approach suitable for bound systems is the post-geodesic or self-force expansion [6, 7]. This method starts with the motion of a free test particle, representing the lighter secondary member of the binary, in a given strong gravitational field such as that of an isolated Kerr black hole, representing the field of the heavier primary. The motion is then iterated by treating the ”particle” as a small mass that sources a metric perturbation, causing deviation from the original geodesic; this is the gravitational self-force. Even though the trajectory and the metric perturbation satisfy non-trivial field and evolution equations on a fully relativistic background, the motion and field equations decouple into a more manageable iterative scheme within the self-force expansion. This scheme is particularly effective for binaries with extreme mass ratios [14]. However, due to label-switching symmetries between the two bodies [15], its results can also describe binaries of comparable masses unexpectedly well [16, 17, 14, 18, 19]. How do the two aforementioned approximations relate when dealing with spins in the binary? In the PN scheme, the spins of the binary members are represented by two Cartesian-like 3-vectors \vec{S}_{1,2} attached to the center of mass of each body [11, 20]. Their dynamics are trivial at leading Newtonian order (the spin vectors are constant) and start to couple to the system only at the 1.5 PN order (\mathcal{O}(v^{3}/c^{3}) relative to Newtonian order). The dynamics are cast in a global inertial frame and both spins evolve. In contrast, in the post-geodesic expansion, each spin is treated very differently [7, 21]. The primary is so heavy that the inertial frame becomes fixed to its spin at zeroth order, and any dynamics of the primary spin vector are erased from the phase space. The spin of the secondary is represented by a covariant 4-vector s^{\mu}, fulfilling non-trivial parallel transport equations at zeroth order and back-reacting on the lighter object’s trajectory in the first-order mass ratio iteration. At first glance, relating the two formalisms is not straightforward. Capturing the invariant consequences of spin is challenging. The center of mass of spinning bodies is not defined uniquely. Different parts of rotating objects exhibit varying gravitational and/or inertial masses in different frames [22]. Typically, this frame is determined by a supplementary spin condition [23]. In numerical relativity, the computation of spin and center of mass is more direct and relies on the time slicing and a chosen quasi-local prescription for computation [24, 25]. Similar to gauge choices in field theory, these various options yield physically equivalent descriptions of spinning binaries, differing only in superficial variables [23, 26]. Moreover, the variables describing the motion can carry “pure gauge” degrees of freedom, causing the system to exhibit variability at new “Zitterbewegung” frequencies unrelated to the physical frequencies of the system (see e.g. [27]). We need to resolve these issues soon. With the increasing sensitivity and reach of current and near-future gravitational wave detectors [28, 29, 30, 31, 32], we will observe new types of binary inspirals with different mass ratios, spin configurations, and eccentricities. Maximizing the scientific yield of such observations necessitates significant improvements in the modeling of binary inspirals and the emergent waveforms [9, 33]. Further synergies among the various approaches listed above are also necessary. Establishing reliable links between PN, numerical relativity, and self-force formalisms will require focusing on carefully chosen observables, or gauge invariants, which is the focus of this work. How can we link the large mass ratio and PN pictures with general spin dynamics? At leading order, the dynamics are fully conservative and integrable both in the 1.5PN limit [10, 13, 34] and the spinning test particle limit [21, 35]. This allows a description via the geometric formalism of Hamiltonian mechanics of integrable systems [36, 37]. Specifically, we can compute the so-called actions of the system with nearly “topological”, gauge-invariant properties. Among other features, determining their functional form allows us to compute the fundamental frequencies of motion [38], an essential observable in gravitational wave science. Importantly, one set of actions can transform into another only via a discrete lattice transform that corresponds to switching between inequivalent homotopy classes of curves in phase space [36, 37, 39]. When computing actions in continuous parameter limits, they must reduce to each other up to discrete transforms. This is how we establish the correspondence between the post-geodesic and PN limits in this paper. Indeed, the direct matching of action variables between the Hamiltonian for nonspinning test particle motion in an effective metric and a PN Hamiltonian for nonspinning binaries was the one of the two main ingredients of the celebrated Effective one-body formalism [40]. The original Effective one-body model by Buonanno and Damour [40] matched the actions of the PN dynamics with those of a nonspinning test particle in an effective deformed Schwarzschild metric. The second step was identifying optimal candidates for matching the parameters of the two systems. The authors required the mass of the test particle m and Schwarzschild-like mass M to match the reduced mass m_{1}m_{2}/(m_{1}+m_{2}) and total mass m_{1}+m_{2} of the binary. This led to a mapping between the energies of both systems and a prescription for the effective metric in the test particle Hamiltonian. Consequently, this approach achieved a highly efficient resummation of the PN dynamics, smoothly connecting the plunge and merger phases to the inspirals, and thus provided one of the first qualitatively accurate models of the full coalescence process [40, 41]. The effective one-body formalism was later modified to include spin effects through various different approaches. Damour incorporated spins of the binary components by replacing the Kerr spin vector Ma\hat{z} with a non-trivial linear combination of \vec{S}_{1} and \vec{S}_{2} in the test particle Hamiltonian in a deformed Kerr metric [10]. Barausse & Buonanno offered an alternative approach, substituting the Kerr spin vector at leading order with \vec{S}_{1}+\vec{S}_{2}, and endowing the test particle with a leading-order spin \sim m_{2}/m_{1}\vec{S}_{1}+m_{1}/m_{2}\vec{S}_{2} [42]. Both approaches matched spin-like expressions with different Poisson brackets in each of the two systems. As such, the various spin-like vectors have different equations of motion on each side of the correspondence. In other words, the correspondence is well suited for the case of fully aligned spin vectors without precession, where the spin degrees of freedom are inactive. However, it cannot be expected to work well once the spins become dynamical. One of our goals in this paper is to also provide a basis for an improved Effective one-body formalism for spinning binaries in general dynamical states."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10181v1,Holographic striped superconductor with ionic lattice,"We construct a holographic model to study the striped superconductor on ionic lattices. This model features a phase diagram with three distinct phases, namely the charge density wave (CDW) phase, ordinary superconducting phase (SC) and the striped superconducting phase (SSC). The effect of the ionic lattices on the phase diagram is investigated in detail. First, due to the periodic nature of the background, different types of CDW solutions can be found below the critical temperature. Furthermore, with the increase of the lattice amplitude these solutions are locked in different commensurate states. Second, we find that the critical temperature of CDW phase decreases with the increase of the lattice amplitude, while that of the SC phase increases. Additionally, the background solutions are obtained for different phases, and it is verified that the SSC phase has the lowest free energy among all three phases.","The striped superconductor as a novel superconducting phase plays a vital role in understanding the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. This phase is characterized by a unidirectional pair-density-wave (PDW) PhysRevB.79.064515 ; Berg_2009 ; 2019arXiv190409687A ; annurev:/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-031119-050711 , which emerges as the result of the interplay between the SC and CDW order 2018NatCo…9.2796C . Fundamentally, the CDW phase is an insulating phase reflecting the instability of the Fermi surface due to the interaction between electrons and lattices, while the SC phase is metallic with a divergent DC conductivity due to the formation of Cooper pairs. Near the Fermi energy, these two orders often display complex relationships that can be competitive, cooperative, or both 2024PhRvM…8a4801L . In particular, due to the involvement of strong coupling in the system, it is widely believed that such relations may not be fully understood within the traditional Landau-Fermi liquid theory Liu:2009dm . The SSC phase as the product of the interplay of CDW order and SC order remains mysterious in the condensed matter theory PhysRevB.28.2855 ; osti_1357580 . Gauge/gravity duality provides powerful tools for studying the striped superconductor since this strongly coupling many-body system living on the boundary can be dual to a weakly coupled gravity system in the bulk Hartnoll:2016apf . Great efforts have been made to explore the novel properties of the striped superconductor using holographic approaches Flauger:2010tv ; Ganguli:2012up ; Donos:2013gda ; Erdmenger:2013zaa ; Donos:2013wia ; Withers:2013loa ; Ling:2014saa ; Kiritsis:2015hoa ; 2017PhRvD..95d1901C ; Cremonini:2017usb ; Cai:2017qdz ; Ling:2020qdd ; Ling:2015epa ; Baggioli:2015zoa ; Ling:2015exa ; Baggioli:2015dwa ; Baggioli:2016oju ; Cremonini:2016rbd ; Andrade:2017cnc ; Alberte:2017oqx ; Amoretti:2017axe ; Amoretti:2017frz ; Cai:2020nyd . However, early models are characterized by the emergence of both the CDW and SC phases with a single order parameter, implemented through the Stuckelberg mechanism. This approach implies that both phases would emerge simultaneously below the same critical temperature. This of course is not the case occurring in laboratory. Fundamentally, the CDW phase and SC phase should be independent and thus be described by different order parameters 2024PhRvM…8a4801L . In particular, from the symmetry perspective, the CDW phase arises from the spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry while the SC phase results from the spontaneous breaking of U(1) gauge symmetry. This distinction underscores the need for separate order parameters in accurate models. Until recently a holographic model with different order parameters for CDW phase and SC phase has been constructed in Ling:2020qdd , where a phase diagram has been obtained for the interplay of these three phases. It demonstrates that the critical temperature of SC increases with doping parameter while the critical temperature of CDW decreases, which mimics the behavior of some known materials PhysRevB.28.2855 ; osti_1357580 . In this paper, we extend the previous work by investigating striped superconductors in the presence of an ionic lattice. The motivations of this work are twofold. First, the lattice is an essential structure for any practical material to generate momentum relaxation, and thus leading to a finite DC conductivity at finite temperature Horowitz:2012gs ; Horowitz:2012ky ; Horowitz:2013jaa ; Ling:2013aya ; Ling:2013nxa . Thus, in contrast to the work in Ling:2020qdd , we will investigate the spontaneous breaking of the translation symmetry as well as U(1) gauge symmetry over an ionic lattice. In particular, we will focus on the impact of the lattice on the phase diagram and discuss its possible connection to the feature of real materials. Second, simulating Mott insulator in commensurate states is the key step to understanding the phase diagram of high temperature superconductivity. Recent progress in holographic duality reveals that it is essential to incorporate inhomogeneous lattices rather than homogeneous lattices into the bulk geometry to implement the commensurate lock-in effect Andrade:2015iyf ; Andrade:2017leb ; Andrade:2017jmt ; Andrade:2017ghg ; Krikun:2017cyw ; Ling:2023sop . Currently, the commensurate lock-in effect has been investigated only in several holographic models, where no superconducting phase is considered Andrade:2017leb ; Ling:2023sop . Therefore, in this paper, we intend to build a striped superconductor on an ionic lattice, which could be viewed as the extension of our work Ling:2020qdd , where the striped superconductivity is implemented but the lattice is absent. On the other hand, we intend to apply the ionic lattice as the typical inhomogeneous lattice to observe the commensurate lock-in effect in striped superconductor, which could be viewed as the extension of our work in Ling:2023sop , where the superconducting phase is absent. The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we introduce the holographic setup for the striped superconductor with ionic lattice and incorporate the concept of doping through the implementation of two U(1) gauge fields. In Sec. III, we study the CDW phase over the ionic lattice by considering the instability of the background via linear perturbation. The phase diagram is obtained by evaluating the critical temperature under different values of the doping parameter. More importantly, we demonstrate two distinct types of CDW solutions by numerically solving the equations of motion with full backreaction, and the feature of order parameter as well as the charge density is analyzed. In Sec. IV, we study the SC phase in parallel by considering the spontaneous breaking of U(1) gauge symmetry separately. In Sec. V, we investigate the SSC phase in detail by considering the interplay between the CDW order and the SC order. The background with full backreactions are obtained numerically and the behavior of the order parameters is demonstrated. We also justify that among all three phases the SSC phase exhibits the best stability by computing the free energy. We present the conclusions and discussions in the last section."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09992v1,Does the stability of f(R) theories implies the stability of the dual scalar-tensor theory ?,Higher curvature f(R) gravity theories are often plagued with Ostragadsky instability . In this work we show that such instability manifests itself in the corresponding dual scalar tensor theory in the scalar sector Lagrangian . We explicitly demonstrate the correspondence between the instabilities that appear in an f(R) model and its corresponding scalar tensor theory. Considering various forms of f(R) gravity this feature is illustrated for different choices of the parameters of the theory.,"The action of gravity requires to have diffeomorphism invariance and the simplest choice for this is the Ricci scalar [1]. However, it is also theoretically possible to use some function of the Ricci scalar, R, as the Lagrangian density. This leads to the concept of f(R) gravity which is considered to be one of the significant member among various classes of higher curvature gravity theories [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This theory gained significant attention through Starobinsky’s work on cosmic inflation [8]. By choosing an appropriate function of the Ricci scalar, f(R) gravity offers the potential to explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe and the formation of its structure without any need to invoke dark energy [9]. Such higher curvature action may have it’s origin from corrections arising from quantum gravity [2], making it a relevant and natural extension of general relativity. Though any correction of Einstein’s action with R^{n} ( n\geq 2) is suppressed by inverse powers of Planck scale and is therefore small compared to R in the present regime, for epoch of high value of the curvature such corrections would definitely play crucial roles. It is well-know that f(R) theory introduces terms containing higher derivatives of the metric leading to the appearance of unwanted Ostragadsky instability [10]. By appropriately choosing the f(R) model one can get rid of such instabilities. A salient feature of f(R) gravity theory is that by suitable conformal mapping of the metric function a higher curvature f(R) gravity model can be cast into an equivalent scalar tensor theory where the degrees of freedom from higher curvature is encapsulated in a scalar field with a suitable potential term for the scalar [11]. The form of the scalar potential of course depends on the structure of the underlying f(R) model. The corresponding action of a scalar in the background of Einstein’s gravity can be explored to study various cosmological/Astrophysical and other phenomenological features of the model without any complexities of the original action with higher derivative terms. However due to conformal transformation of the metric , the original f(R) model and the dual scalar tensor theory may yield physically inequivalent consequences. In this work we explore whether there exists any equivalence between the two models in the context of stability issues of the original f(R) model and that in the corresponding scalar tensor theory. In other words, how does the instability of the original f(R) originating from the higher derivative terms manifests itself in the scalar sector in Einstein’s gravity? It there any one to one correspondence ? This work reveals that by examining the properties of the potential of the scalar field as well as the nature of the kinetic term, it is possible to gain insights into the stability of the corresponding f(R) theory. This approach simplifies the stability analysis and provides a useful framework for understanding the dynamics and implications of various f(R) gravity models."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09814v1,Quantum Criticality in Black Hole Scattering,"The Teukolsky equation describing scattering from Kerr black holes captures a few important effects in the process of binary mergers, such as tidal deformations and the decay of ringdown modes, thereby raising interest in the structure of its solutions. In this letter we identify critical phenomena emerging in the corresponding phase space. One special point exists in this phase space, where the black hole is extremal and the scattered wave lies exactly at the superradiant bound, at which the physics simplifies considerably. We provide an indirect realization of a conformal symmetry emerging at this configuration, which leads to its interpretation as a critical point. Away from the critical point conformal symmetry is broken, but it is shown that critical fluctuations continue to be dominant in a wide range of parameters and at finite black hole temperatures. As in quantum many-body systems, the physics in this regime is described exclusively by the temperature and a set of critical exponents, therefore leading to robust predictions that are unique to the Kerr metric.","Over the past decade, a number of remarkable discoveries in black hole physics have been made. Since the first direct detection of gravitational waves emitted from a compact binary merger in 2015 Abbott et al. (2016), the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has cataloged about a hundred events. On a different front, in 2019 the EHT telescope captured the first-ever image of a black hole in the center of the M87 galaxy Akiyama et al. (2019), and a next-generation experiment is already underway Ayzenberg et al. (2023). The immense technological and experimental progress has led to a strong theoretical effort aiming to produce robust and qualitative predictions for black holes, a goal which remains a challenging problem despite a rich scientific history. Identifying symmetry breaking patterns has proven to be a very useful paradigm in addressing similar challenges in almost all areas of physics. Spontaneous symmetry breaking in particle physics and critical phenomena in condensed matter physics are some of the most well-known manifestations of this paradigm. In black hole physics, patterns of symmetry breaking have been studied with respect to ”regional” spacetime symmetries such as the near-horizon symmetries of (near-)extreme Kerr Bardeen and Horowitz (1999); Guica et al. (2009) and the near-ring symmetries associated with the black hole’s photon ring Hadar et al. (2022); Kapec et al. (2023), as well as hidden symmetries arising in different energy limits Maldacena and Strominger (1997); Castro et al. (2010); Charalambous et al. (2021, 2022); Hui et al. (2022a, b). In this letter we would like to report on a different type of symmetry breaking pattern that occurs in the space of configurations. Of particular interest in this context is the Teukolsky equation, which describes linear perturbations over the Kerr metric with mass M and angular momentum parameter a Teukolsky (1973). The Teukolsky equation captures a variety of effects involved in the dynamics of rotating black holes. Some examples include tidal effects during the inspiral phase of a binary merger and quasi-normal mode decay in its ringdown phase. In the eikonal limit, the Teukolsky equation also captures the physics of the photon ring. Figure 1: The phase diagram of perturbations around Kerr black holes. In the two-dimensional space of configurations spanned by the Hawking temperature and the parameter \displaystyle g\equiv a\omega, (1) there is a special point where the black hole is extremal and g is equal to \displaystyle g_{c}\equiv\frac{m}{2}, (2) corresponding to the superradiant bound. Here \omega and m are the energy and azimuthal number of the perturbation. At this point the radial part of the Teukolsky equation simplifies considerably as it reduces to the confluent hypergeometric equation Starobinsky (1973); Starobinskii and Churilov (1973); Teukolsky (1973); Press and Teukolsky (1973); Teukolsky and Press (1974); Bredberg et al. (2010); Hartman et al. (2010). We provide an indirect realization of a conformal SO(1,2) symmetry arising in this configuration. The emergence of conformal symmetry at zero temperature is reminiscent of the Quantum Critical Point (QCP) in quantum many-body systems Sachdev (2011); Hartnoll et al. (2018). At non-zero temperatures conformal symmetry is broken. However, the scaling behavior implied by the critical point gives rise to a wide range at finite temperatures in which the physics is dominated by critical fluctuations. This region is known in condensed matter physics as the Quantum Critical Regime (QCR). We depict the phase diagram describing these phenomena in figure 1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09732v1,The stress-energy tensor of an Unruh-DeWitt detector,"We propose a model for a finite-size particle detector, which allows us to derive its stress-energy tensor. This tensor is obtained from a covariant Lagrangian that describes not only the quantum field that models the detector, \phi_{\textsc{d}}, but also the systems responsible for its localization: a complex scalar field \psi_{\textsc{c}}, and a perfect fluid. The local interaction between the detector and the complex field ensures the square integrability of the detector modes, while the fluid serves to define the spatial profile of \psi_{\textsc{c}}, localizing it in space. We then demonstrate that, under very general conditions, the resulting energy tensor—incorporating all components of the system—is physically reasonable and satisfies the energy conditions.","In the formalism of quantum theory, measuring apparatuses play a special role. Serving as windows through which we can have glimpses of Nature at its most fundamental level, they lie at the interface between the quantum and the classical worlds. As such, going beyond their highly idealized descriptions and modeling their dynamics and behavior may help to investigate questions related to the quantum-classical frontier. In particular, when it comes to questions involving gravity and its quantum aspects, a model of the apparatus from which one can derive a sensible stress-energy tensor is essential, since this is the observable through which the background spacetime perceives the apparatus and the measuring process. In this direction, we propose a model for a finite-size particle detector which allows us to derive its stress-energy tensor. Since the dawn of classical physics, the concepts of energy and momentum have played a central role in our understanding of physical processes and fundamental principles. These concepts were eventually understood to be intimately related to (symmetries w.r.t.) the more basic notions of time and space, respectively. Special Relativity brought a paradigm shift where the relative notions of space and time were interwoven into an absolute four dimensional “arena”—the spacetime, on which physical processes unfold according to local laws. Energy and momentum were then combined into the stress-energy-momentum tensor (or simply stress-energy tensor, or energy-momentum tensor), a rank-two tensor which encodes how energy and momentum flow in the system and how they are exchanged with “external agents.” Then, a second paradigm shift, brought by General Relativity, took the connection between energy/momentum and time/space to a new level by attributing to the stress-energy tensor the fundamental role of sourcing deformations on the fabric of spacetime (i.e., gravity), elegantly making local energy-momentum conservation a direct consequence of the spacetime dynamics and general covariance. For this reason, the stress-energy tensor is the most important object of a system when it comes to its interplay with gravity. Although the picture above is complete at the classical level, the question of how the spacetime is affected by a quantum system—more precisely, a system in a quantum state with no well-defined energy-momentum distribution—lies beyond our current (theoretical and experimental) knowledge. In face of this, it is conceivable that following closely the “energetics” of the measuring process by which the quantum realm connects to the classical world—which is completely hidden in the highly idealized description of measurements in the usual formalism—may lead to interesting insights. And in order to accomplish this, a localized measuring apparatus must be modeled in a way that a sensible stress-energy tensor can be ascribed to it. One way of implementing quantum measurements in relativistic settings was put forward by Fewster and Verch [1, 2] and consists of a measurement theory entirely described in the context of algebraic QFT. Although this framework is fully covariant and mathematically consistent, it is not entirely clear how one applies it to describe a localized system. On the other hand, an operational approach to measurements in QFT was proposed in [3], describing the measurement apparatus as an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector [4, 5] that locally couples to a quantum field. This particle detector approach to measurements has the advantages of naturally describing localized systems and being in direct analogy with physical setups [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, these detector models are not fully compatible with relativity, displaying breakdown of causality [12, 13, 14] and/or covariance [15, 16] on length scales below the size of the detector. One way of connecting the Fewster-Verch framework with the particle detector approach is to notice that a UDW detector admits a quantum field theoretic description [4, 17], for instance as a discrete-energy mode of a quantum field \hat{\phi}_{\textsc{d}} confined by a prescribed classical potential V({\mathsf{x}}). Although this gives rise to a field-theoretic description of a localized measurement apparatus, a non-dynamical potential gives rise to a stress-energy tensor incompatible with general covariance, implying that models of this type are also unsuited to investigate some matters of principle. Here, we present, a relativistically-consistent particle detector, modeling all its “constituents” and deriving the corresponding stress-energy tensor. We build on the description of a UDW detector as a discrete-energy mode of a quantum field \hat{\phi}_{\textsc{d}} under the influence of a confining potential. However, in our framework, the confining potential is not prescribed as a function of the spacetime points but rather as due to interaction with a dynamical self-interacting (complex) field \psi_{\textsc{c}}. The spatial profile of \psi_{\textsc{c}} is then determined by its coupling with a perfect fluid. Although seemingly convoluted, this semiclassical description bears some analogy with, e.g., a second-quantized electron (here modeled by \hat{\phi}_{\textsc{d}}) bounded in an atom by the classical electromagnetic field (whose role is played by \psi_{\textsc{c}}) generated by the central nucleus (analogous to the perfect fluid). The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we review the standard UDW model (Subsec. II.1) and how it functions as a particle detector (Subsec. II.2). In Sec. III, we review how the stress-energy tensor is obtained for a field theory subject to an external potential. We discuss the necessity of including the source of the potential in the description. Then, in Sec. IV, we present our model, including in the Lagrangian of the theory the source of the confining potential for the detector field \hat{\phi}_{\textsc{d}} (i.e., the self-interacting field \psi_{\textsc{c}}) and the perfect fluid which can be seen as sourcing/confining the field \psi_{\textsc{c}}. In Sec. V, we present a concrete detector model by choosing a particular example of self-interacting potential for the field \psi_{\textsc{c}} and equation of state for the perfect-fluid. Finally, in Sec. VI, we obtain the stress-energy tensor of this concrete model. Sec. VII is dedicated to final comments and conclusions. Throughout the text we use metric signature (-,+,+,+) and natural units in which \hbar=c=1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09042v1,Excess Radiation from Axion-Photon Conversion,"Two notable anomalies in radio observations — the excess radiation in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background, revealed by ARCADE2, and the twice-deeper absorption trough of the global 21cm line, identified by EDGES — remain unresolved. These phenomena may have a shared origin, as the enhancement of the 21cm absorption trough could arise from excess heating. We investigate this scenario through the framework of axion-like particles (ALPs), showing that the resonant conversion of ALPs into photons can produce a photon abundance sufficient to resolve both anomalies simultaneously. Our model naturally explains the observed radio excess between 0.4 and 10GHz while also enhances the 21cm absorption feature at 78MHz. Furthermore, it predicts a novel power-law scaling of the radio spectrum above 0.5GHz and an additional absorption trough below 30MHz, which could be verified through cross-detection in upcoming experiments.","Appendix A In this appendix we derive the main formula of our paper. We consider an ALP-photon mixing system propagating along the l-direction in an perturbative magnetic background field \bm{B}(l)=(B_{x},B_{y},B_{z}). For highly relativistic axions m_{a}\ll\omega, the short-wavelength approximation can be applied and the ALP-photon mixing in the expanding universe reduces to a linearized system (Mirizzi et al., 2007) \displaystyle\left(\omega-i(1+z)\frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}l}+M\right)\left(% \begin{array}[]{c}A_{x}\\ A_{y}\\ a\end{array}\right) \displaystyle= \displaystyle 0,\qquad M=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}\Delta_{xx}&\Delta_{xy}&% \frac{1}{2}g_{a\gamma}B_{x}\\ \Delta_{xy}&\Delta_{yy}&\frac{1}{2}g_{a\gamma}B_{y}\\ \frac{1}{2}g_{a\gamma}B_{x}&\frac{1}{2}g_{a\gamma}B_{y}&\Delta_{a}\end{array}\right) (14) with the scale factor a and the spatial coordinate l in the comoving framework. Here the mixing matrix element reads \displaystyle\Delta_{xx} \displaystyle= \displaystyle\Delta_{pl}+\Delta_{CM},\quad\Delta_{yy}=\Delta_{pl}+\Delta_{CM},% \quad\Delta_{xy}=\Delta_{yx}=\Delta_{R},\quad\Delta_{a}=-m_{a}^{2}/2\omega,% \quad\Delta_{pl}=-\omega_{pl}^{2}/2\omega (15) where m_{a} is the ALP mass and g_{a\gamma} the ALP-photon coupling strength. The plasma effect arsing from photon refraction in the medium is characterized by the plasma frequency \omega_{pl}=\sqrt{e^{2}n_{e}/m_{e}} with free electron’s charge e, mass m_{e} and the number density n_{e}. In addition, the term \Delta_{CM} describe the CottonMouton effect, which originate from QED corrections for photon in a transverse magnetic field. As shown in Ref. (Ejlli, 2018), this effect is quadratic in magnetic strength and hence negligible in our analysis since we focus on the linear order of perturbative B field. The Faraday rotation term \Delta_{R} couples theA_{x} and A_{y} modes, which is relevant for analyzing polarized photon sources but irrelevant to this study. Thus, Eq. 14 simplifies as \displaystyle\partial_{l}\left(\begin{array}[]{c}A_{x}(\omega,l)\\ A_{y}(\omega,l)\\ a(\omega,l)\end{array}\right) \displaystyle= \displaystyle i\mathcal{K}\left(\begin{array}[]{c}A_{x}(\omega,l)\\ A_{y}(\omega,l)\\ a(\omega,l)\end{array}\right),\,\,\,\,\hfill\mathcal{K}=\frac{1}{1+z}\left(% \begin{array}[]{ccc}\omega+\Delta_{pl}&0&\frac{1}{2}g_{a\gamma}B_{x}(l)\\ 0&\omega+\Delta_{pl}&\frac{1}{2}g_{a\gamma}B_{y}(l)\\ \frac{1}{2}g_{a\gamma}B_{x}(l)&\frac{1}{2}g_{a\gamma}B_{y}(l)\hfill&\omega+% \Delta_{a}\end{array}\right). (25) We apply the perturbative approach by decomposing matrix \mathcal{K} into \displaystyle\mathcal{K} \displaystyle= \displaystyle\mathcal{K}_{0}+\delta\mathcal{K}=\frac{1}{1+z}\left(\begin{array% }[]{ccc}\omega+\Delta_{pl}&0&0\\ 0&\omega+\Delta_{pl}&0\\ 0&0&\omega+\Delta_{a}\end{array}\right)+\frac{1}{1+z}\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc% }0&0&\frac{1}{2}g_{a\gamma}B_{x}(l)\\ 0&0&\frac{1}{2}g_{a\gamma}B_{y}(l)\\ \frac{1}{2}g_{a\gamma}B_{x}(l)&\frac{1}{2}g_{a\gamma}B_{y}(l)&0\end{array}% \right). (32) Physically speaking, the evolution of ALP and photon free of external field is described by principle part \mathcal{K}_{0}, and their mixing through the magnetic background is encoded in perturbation matrix \delta\mathcal{K}. Note that \mathcal{K}_{0} implicitly depends on l from relation dl=dz/H in expanding universe. We arrange Eq. 25 into \displaystyle\partial_{l}\left(e^{-i\int_{l_{0}}^{l}dl_{1}\mathcal{K}_{0}\left% (l_{1}\right)}\mathcal{U}\left(l,l_{0}\right)\right) \displaystyle= \displaystyle ie^{-i\int_{l_{0}}^{l}dl_{1}\mathcal{K}_{0}\left(l_{1}\right)}% \delta\mathcal{K}(l)\mathcal{U}\left(l,l_{0}\right) (33) by introducing a conversion matrix \mathcal{U} defined by \left(A_{x}(l),A_{y}(l),a(l)\right)^{T}=\mathcal{U}\left(l,l_{0}\right)\left(A% _{x}(l_{0}),A_{y}(l_{0}),a(l_{0})\right)^{T}. One can iteratively solve Eq. 33 up to the first order \displaystyle\mathcal{U}\left(l,l_{0}\right) \displaystyle= \displaystyle e^{i\int_{l_{0}}^{l}dl_{1}\mathcal{K}_{0}(l_{1})}+ie^{i\int_{l_{% 0}}^{l}dl^{\prime\prime}\mathcal{K}_{0}(l^{\prime\prime})}\int_{l_{0}}^{l}dl^{% \prime}e^{-i\int_{l_{0}}^{l^{\prime}}d\ell^{\prime\prime}\mathcal{K}_{0}(l^{% \prime\prime})}\delta\mathcal{K}\left(l^{\prime}\right)e^{i\int_{l_{0}}^{l^{% \prime}}dl^{\prime\prime}\mathcal{K}_{0}(l^{\prime\prime})}+\mathcal{O}\left(% \left(\delta\mathcal{K}\right)^{2}\right). (34) Each component of \mathcal{U}\left(l,l_{0}\right) reflects the mode transitions btween ALP and photon states. For instance, photon generation at distance l can be read from the conversion matrix with A_{x}(l)=\mathcal{U}_{13}a(l_{0}) and A_{y}(l)=\mathcal{U}_{23}a(l_{0}), leading to the conversion probability \displaystyle\mathcal{P}(l) \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{|A_{x}(l)|^{2}+|A_{y}(l)|^{2}}{\left|a(l_{0})\right|^{2}}=|% \mathcal{U}_{13}(l,l_{0})|^{2}+|\mathcal{U}_{23}(l,l_{0})|^{2}. (35) From Eq. 34 one can obtain \displaystyle\left|\mathcal{U}_{13}\left(l,l_{0}\right)\right|^{2} \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{1}{4}g_{a\gamma}^{2}\int_{l_{0}}^{l}dl_{1}\int_{l_{0}}^{l}% dl_{2}\left(\frac{1}{1+z}B_{x}(l_{1})\right)\left(\frac{1}{1+z}B_{x}(l_{2})% \right)e^{i\int_{l_{1}}^{l_{2}}dl_{3}\frac{1}{1+z}(\Delta_{xx}(l_{3})-\Delta_{% a}(l_{3}))}, \displaystyle\left|\mathcal{U}_{23}\left(l,l_{0}\right)\right|^{2} \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{1}{4}g_{a\gamma}^{2}\int_{l_{0}}^{l}dl_{1}\int_{l_{0}}^{l}% dl_{2}\left(\frac{1}{1+z}B_{y}(l_{1})\right)\left(\frac{1}{1+z}B_{y}(l_{2})% \right)e^{i\int_{l_{1}}^{l_{2}}dl_{3}\frac{1}{1+z}(\Delta_{xx}(l_{3})-\Delta_{% a}(l_{3}))}. (36) Regarding the magnetic field, we assume it to be a statistically isotropic Gaussian distributed random field with correlation function defined by \displaystyle\left\langle\mathbf{B}_{i}(\mathbf{x_{1}})\mathbf{B}_{j}\left(% \mathbf{x}_{2}\right)\right\rangle=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{3}}\int_{k_{IR}}^{k_{UV}}d% ^{3}ke^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\left(\mathbf{x}_{1}-\mathbf{x_{2}}\right)}\left[\left% (\delta_{ij}-\hat{\mathbf{k}}_{i}\hat{\mathbf{k}}_{j}\right)P_{B}(k)-i\epsilon% _{ijm}\hat{\mathbf{k}}_{m}P_{aB}(k)\right], (37) where \hat{\mathbf{k}}=\mathbf{k}/k and \epsilon_{ijm} is the antisymmetric symbol. The P_{B}(k) and P_{aB}(k) are respectively the symmetric and antisymmetric components of the spectrum, whereas the latter is absent from the expression \displaystyle\left\langle\mathbf{B}_{x}(l_{1})\mathbf{B}_{x}\left(l_{2}\right)% +\mathbf{B}_{y}(l_{1})\mathbf{B}_{y}\left(l_{2}\right)\right\rangle=\frac{1}{(% 2\pi)^{3}}\int d^{3}ke^{ik\cos\theta\left(l_{1}-l_{2}\right)}\left(1+\cos^{2}% \theta\right)P_{B}(k). (38) Here \theta denotes the angle between propagation direction l and the wave-vector \bm{k} of the magnetic field. Combining Eqs. 35, 36 and 38, we obtain \displaystyle\mathcal{P} \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{3}{8(2\pi)^{3}}\left(1+z\right)^{2}g_{a\gamma}^{2}\int d^{3% }ke^{ik\cos\theta\left(l_{1}-l_{2}\right)}P_{B}(k)\int_{l_{0}}^{l}dl_{1}\int_{% l_{0}}^{l}dl_{2}\exp\left(i\int_{l_{1}}^{l_{2}}dl_{3}\frac{1}{1+z}(\Delta_{pl}% (l_{3})-\Delta_{a}(l_{3}))\right) (39) with approximate 1+\cos^{2}\theta\simeq 3/2 to simplify the calculation. In fact, we have checked that inclusion of exact term 1+\cos^{2}\theta yields a minor correction ( \sim 1.1 correction factor in overall amplitude) to this approximation. To perform the integral, we use a semi-steady approximation by discritizing the universe expansion into a decreasing sequence of redshifts [z_{1},z_{2},...z_{N}] with z_{1}\simeq 1100 marking the end of Recombination. A proper discretization scheme is given by the sequence z_{i+1}=z_{i}(1-\epsilon) , where \epsilon is a small parameter. Physically, for a proper small value of \epsilon, this scheme implies that the ALP-photon mixing propagation distance l\simeq\epsilon\mathcal{H}^{-1} remains well within the comoving Hubble radius \mathcal{H}^{-1}. Throughout the paper we set \epsilon=0.1. In each interval z\in[z_{i},z_{i+1}], we approximate \Delta(z) by a linear expansion centered at z_{c}=(z_{i}+z_{i+1})/2 as \displaystyle\Delta(z)\simeq\Delta(z_{c})+\Delta^{\prime}(z_{c}) \displaystyle(z-z_{c}), (40) where \Delta(z)=\Delta_{pl}(z)-\Delta_{a}(z), \Delta^{\prime}(z)=\Delta^{\prime}_{pl}(z)-\Delta^{\prime}_{a}(z) and prime is derivative with respect to the redshift. Then we substitute dl=dz/H and approximate Eq. 39 as \displaystyle\mathcal{P}(z_{i},z_{i+1}) \displaystyle\simeq \displaystyle\frac{3}{8(2\pi)^{2}}\frac{(1+z_{c})^{2}g_{a\gamma}^{2}}{H_{c}^{2% }}\int k^{2}P_{B}dk\int_{-1}^{+1}d(\cos\theta)\int_{z_{i}}^{z_{i+1}}dz_{1}\int% _{z_{i}}^{z_{i+1}}dz_{2} (41) \displaystyle\times\exp\left(ik\cos\theta\frac{1}{H_{c}}\left(z_{1}-z_{2}% \right)+i\int_{z_{1}}^{z_{2}}\frac{1}{\left(1+z_{c}\right)H_{c}}dz_{3}(\Delta_% {pl}(z_{3})-\Delta_{a}(z_{3}))\right) \displaystyle\simeq \displaystyle\frac{3}{8(2\pi)^{2}}\frac{(1+z_{c})^{2}g_{a\gamma}^{2}}{H_{c}^{2% }}\int k^{2}P_{B}dk\int_{-1}^{+1}d(\cos\theta)\int_{z_{i}}^{z_{i+1}}dz_{1}\int% _{z_{i}}^{z_{i+1}}dz_{2} \displaystyle\times\exp\left(i(z_{2}-z_{1})\left(\frac{\Delta^{\prime}(z_{c})}% {2\left(1+z_{c}\right)H_{c}}(z_{2}+z_{1}-2z_{c})+\frac{k\cos\theta}{H_{c}}% \right)\right) \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{3\pi}{16(2\pi)^{2}}\frac{\left(1+z_{c}\right)^{3}g_{a\gamma% }^{2}}{H_{c}\left|\triangle^{\prime}(z_{c})\right|}\int k^{2}P_{B}dk\int_{-1}^% {+1}d(\cos\theta) \displaystyle\times\left\{\textrm{Erf}\left(\left(-1\right)^{1/4}\sqrt{\frac{% \left|\triangle^{\prime}(z_{c})\right|}{2\left(1+z_{c}\right)H_{c}}}\left(z_{c% }-\frac{\left(1+z_{c}\right)k\cos\theta}{\triangle^{\prime}(z_{c})}-z_{i+1}% \right)\right)\right. \displaystyle\left.-\textrm{Erf}\left(\left(-1\right)^{1/4}\sqrt{\frac{\left|% \triangle^{\prime}(z_{c})\right|}{2\left(1+z_{c}\right)H_{c}}}\left(z_{c}-% \frac{\left(1+z_{c}\right)k\cos\theta}{\triangle^{\prime}(z_{c})}-z_{i}\right)% \right)\right\} \displaystyle\times\left\{-\textrm{Erf}\left(\left(-1\right)^{3/4}\sqrt{\frac{% \left|\triangle^{\prime}(z_{c})\right|}{2\left(1+z_{c}\right)H_{c}}}\left(z_{c% }-\frac{\left(1+z_{c}\right)k\cos\theta}{\triangle^{\prime}(z_{c})}-z_{i+1}% \right)\right)\right. \displaystyle\left.+\textrm{Erf}\left(\left(-1\right)^{3/4}\sqrt{\frac{\left|% \triangle^{\prime}(z_{c})\right|}{2\left(1+z_{c}\right)H_{c}}}\left(z_{c}-% \frac{\left(1+z_{c}\right)k\cos\theta}{\triangle^{\prime}(z_{c})}-z_{i}\right)% \right)\right\}, where H_{c}=H(z_{c}) and error function \textrm{Erf}(x)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^{x}e^{-t^{2}}dt. Thanks to the step-like shape of the error function, one can infer the integral over \cos\theta from its geometric meaning and find \displaystyle\mathcal{P}(z_{i},z_{i+1}) \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{3\pi}{4(2\pi)^{2}}\frac{(1+z_{c})^{3}g_{a\gamma}^{2}}{H_{c}% |\Delta^{\prime}(z_{c})|}\int dkk^{2}P_{B}(k)W(t_{1},t_{2}) (42) with \displaystyle t_{1} \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{\left(z_{c}-z_{f}\right)\Delta^{\prime}(z_{c})-\triangle(z_% {c})}{\left(1+z_{c}\right)k},\,\,\,\,\,\hfill t_{2}=\frac{\left(z_{c}-z_{i}% \right)\Delta^{\prime}(z_{c})-\triangle(z_{c})}{\left(1+z_{c}\right)k}, (43) and \displaystyle W(t_{1},t_{2}) \displaystyle= \displaystyle\begin{cases}|t_{1}-t_{2}|,&|t_{1}|<1\quad|t_{2}|<1\\ |t_{1}+1|,&|t_{1}|<1\quad t_{2}<-1\\ |t_{1}-1|,&|t_{1}|<1\quad t_{2}>1\\ |t_{2}+1|,&t_{1}<-1\quad|t_{2}|<1\\ |t_{2}-1|,&t_{1}>1\quad|t_{2}|<1\\ 2,&t_{1}<-1\quad t_{2}>1\quad or\quad t_{1}>1\quad t_{2}<-1\\ \simeq 0,&\textrm{others}\end{cases}. (44) Note that Eq. 42 holds under the linear expansion of \Delta-term (see Eq. 40) in [z_{i},z_{i+1}], which is valid given our choice of the discritization parmeter \epsilon=0.1 and parameter space considered in this paper. Let us apply our main formula Eq. 42 to analyze two limiting cases. The first case considers a mass-equal resonance in presence of the stochastic magnetic field. This resonance arises at a redshift z_{res} when the mass-equal condition \triangle(z_{res})=m_{\gamma}(z_{res})-m_{a}(z_{res})=0 is satisfied, producing a peak in the oscillation length profile (see Fig. 1). Assuming a monochromatic spectrum P_{B}(k)=\pi^{2}B_{0}^{2}\delta\left(k-k_{B}\right)/k_{B}^{2} and a constant re-ionization fraction X_{e}=10^{-4}, from Eq. 42 we derive the conversion probability over [z_{i}=z_{res}(1+\epsilon/2),z_{i+1}=z_{res}(1-\epsilon/2)] as \displaystyle\mathcal{P} \displaystyle\simeq \displaystyle 8.6*10^{-4}\left(\frac{g_{a\gamma}}{10^{-12}\textrm{GeV}^{-1}}% \right)^{2}\left(\frac{B_{0}}{\textrm{nGs}}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{\omega_{0}}{% \textrm{GHz}}\right)\left(\frac{m_{a}}{10^{-12}\textrm{eV}}\right)^{1/3}% \textrm{Min}\left(\epsilon z_{res}\left(\frac{\textrm{GHz}}{\omega_{0}}\right)% \left(\frac{\lambda_{B}}{\textrm{kpc}}\right),1\right). (45) One can see that the front factor is of similar magnitude and scaling on each variable as those obtained in Landau-Zener approximation (Marsh et al., 2022; Mirizzi et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2020; Mondino et al., 2024; Tashiro et al., 2013) or the same spirit but so called saddle-point approach (Chen and Suyama, 2013). Interestingly, our results introduce a Minimum function that highlight a novel suppression effect, which arises from the stochastic nature of the magnetic background. In fact, the \omega_{0}^{-2} scaling of the brightness temperature shown in Fig. 2 transits to \omega_{0}^{-3} at the higher frequency \omega_{0}\gtrsim 100GHz. Such a suppression is absent in commonly used domain-like model in literature. In domain-like model, the magnetic field is treated as constant over a domain patch in size of correlation length \lambda_{B}. Thus the Landau-Zener approximation is only valid when domain size exceeds the resonance width W_{res}, namely \lambda_{B}\gtrsim W_{res}. Our approach, however, is out of this limit and can extend to the case with small \lambda_{B}, where a suppression is revealed as a consequence of stochastic magnetic field and narrowness of the mass-equal resonance. The second case corresponds to a rather slowly varying oscillation length scale (in physical frame) with \Delta^{\prime}<<1. Again, we assume a monochromatic spectrum for stochastic magnetic field. When the condition -1<t_{1}\simeq t_{2}=\frac{-\triangle(z_{c})}{(1+z_{c})k_{B}}<1 is met, we find W(t_{1},t_{2})=\epsilon|\Delta^{\prime}(z_{c})|/k_{B} and hence the conversion probability reads \displaystyle\mathcal{P} \displaystyle\simeq \displaystyle\frac{3}{32}z_{c}^{2}g_{a\gamma}^{2}B_{0}^{2}\lambda_{B}\triangle l, (46) where \triangle l\simeq\epsilon z_{c}/H_{c} is approximately the comoving distance during [z_{i},z_{i+1}]. Under the condition \left|\frac{\triangle(z_{c})}{(1+z_{c})k_{B}}\right|<1, the conversion probability shows a linear growth with distance. This condition can also be expressed as \pi\lambda_{B}<l_{osc} given the definition of comoving oscillation length l_{osc}(z)=2\frac{1+z}{\triangle(z)}. Such a resonant condition associated with the stochastic magnetic field has also been identified in Ref. (Addazi et al., 2024). In this paper, we study two representative cases with m_{a}=3\times 10^{-14}\textrm{eV} and m_{a}=3\times 10^{-13}\textrm{eV}. As shown in Fig. 1, the oscillation curve consists of the peak at mass-equal resonance and relatively slow-varying region.We employ the semi-steady approximation across the entire post recombination epoch with redshift sequence [z_{1},z_{2},...,z_{N}] and have verified that the linear expansion condition holds as mentioned above. The total conversion probability from recombination up to z_{i} is simply the sum \mathcal{P}^{tot}(z_{i})=\sum_{j=1}^{j=i}\mathcal{P}(z_{j}). By interpolating \mathcal{P}^{tot}(z_{i}) (i=1,2,...) over the redshift sequence, one can obtain the total probability \mathcal{P}^{tot}(z) from recombination to any value of z."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09652v1,Strong Field Scattering of Black Holes: Assessing Resummation Strategies,"Recent developments in post-Minkowksian (PM) calculations have led to a fast-growing body of weak-field perturbative information. As such, there is major interest within the gravitational wave community as to how this information can be used to improve the accuracy of theoretical waveform models. In this work, we build on recent efforts to validate high-order PM calculations using numerical relativity simulations. We present a new set of high-energy scattering simulations for equal-mass, non-spinning binary black holes, further expanding the existing suite of NR simulations. We outline the basic features of three recently proposed resummation schemes (the \mathcal{L}-resummed model, the w^{\mathrm{eob}} model and the SEOB-PM model) and compare the analytical predictions to our NR data. Each model is shown to demonstrate pathological behaviour at high energies, with common features such as PM hierarchical shifts and divergences. The NR data can also be used to calibrate pseudo-5PM corrections to the scattering angle or EOB radial potentials. In each case, we argue that including higher-order information improves the agreement between the analytical models and NR, though the extent of improvement depends on how this information is incorporated and the choice of analytical baseline. Finally, we demonstrate that further resummation of the EOB radial potentials could be an effective strategy to improving the model agreement.","Further advancements in gravitational wave (GW) detector technology Reitze et al. (2019); Punturo et al. (2010); Amaro-Seoane et al. (2017) will enable high precision measurements of GW signals, such as those performed by the LVK collaboration Abbott et al. (2019, 2021, 2023); Nitz et al. (2023); Olsen et al. (2022). To decipher information from these signals, further theoretical developments are required to push the computational efficiency and accuracy of current waveform models beyond their capabilities. Successful characterisation of these events enable inference of astrophysical properties, as well as allowing strong-field tests of gravity. Numerical relativity (NR) simulations of compact binaries Pretorius (2005); Campanelli et al. (2006); Baker et al. (2006); Jani et al. (2016); Boyle et al. (2019); Healy and Lousto (2020); Ramos-Buades et al. (2022a); Hamilton et al. (2024); Bonino et al. (2024) provide a non-perturbative, numerical prediction for the gravitational waveform. Whilst NR simulations have played a key role in the rapid development of gravitational wave astronomy, there exist numerous technical challenges. Accuracy and run-time are currently limited by several factors: accuracy of initial data, robustness of gauge choices, efficient numerical methods, and so forth. In addition, NR simulations are poorly suited to GW data analysis due to the run time per simulation and the discrete coverage of the parameter space. To address these challenges, NR surrogate models Field et al. (2014); Blackman et al. (2017); Varma et al. (2019) have been created using a data-driven approach, whereby a basis is built directly from the NR waveforms. Upon coupling with interpolation methods, a waveform can be reconstructed at any point in the parameter space spanned by the NR data. However, surrogate models implicitly inherit restrictions due to the limited parameter space coverage and duration of the NR simulations. One way to overcome these limitations is to use a hybrid approach that combines analytical approximations with the numerical simulations, enabling a blend of perturbative and non-perturbative information. The most common analytical tool to date has been the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation Blanchet (2014), which consists of a perturbative expansion of the Einstein field equations in the small velocity [\epsilon\sim(v/c)\ll 1] and weak field [\epsilon\sim GM/(rc^{2})\ll 1] limits. Two families of models which have successfully built on the PN approximation are: i) effective one-body (EOB) models, e.g. Buonanno and Damour (1999, 2000); Damour (2001); Nagar et al. (2018, 2020a, 2020b); Pompili et al. (2023); Khalil et al. (2023), which are constructed from an NR calibrated EOB Hamiltonian containing PN information, and ii) phenomenological models Ajith et al. (2008, 2011); Pratten et al. (2021); García-Quirós et al. (2020); Pratten et al. (2020), which directly model the emitted GW signal by calibrating phenomenological coefficients against PN/NR or EOB/NR hybrid waveforms. An alternative scheme is provided by the post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation Blanchet (2014), which is valid in the weak field regime [\epsilon\sim GM/(rc^{2})\ll 1] but relaxes the low velocity restriction. Interest in the PM approximation was revitalized by the pioneering work of Damour (2016, 2018). In Damour (2016), it was realized that the usual EOB map between the PN description of two-body bound states and the bound states of a test particle could be replaced by a map expressed in terms of classical scattering states. In practice, this means that the classical scattering function can be used to inform the EOB Hamiltonian for two gravitationally interacting bodies. The map was further expanded in Damour (2018) to derive the 2PM Hamiltonian for point-masses, together with a route to connecting classical scattering calculations to the quantum gravitational scattering amplitude of two particles. This triggered significant activity, as the EOB framework could now leverage all the machinery that had been developed to calculate quantum scattering amplitudes at high perturbative orders, e.g. building on generalized unitarity Bern et al. (1994) or the perturbative duality between gravity and gauge theories Bern et al. (2008, 2010a, 2010b); Monteiro et al. (2014). The PM approximation is naturally suited to gravitational scattering at large separations, and many important physical quantities have now been computed in the PM framework using a range of theoretical techniques: scattering amplitudes Cheung et al. (2018); Guevara et al. (2019); Kosower et al. (2019); Bern et al. (2019a, b); Bjerrum-Bohr et al. (2020); Herrmann et al. (2021); Bern et al. (2021, 2022); Bjerrum-Bohr et al. (2021); Manohar et al. (2022); Saketh et al. (2022), worldline field theory Mogull et al. (2021); Riva and Vernizzi (2021); Jakobsen et al. (2021, 2022); Bini et al. (2021); Bini and Damour (2022); Bini et al. (2023); Driesse et al. (2024), effective field theory Kälin and Porto (2020a); Kälin et al. (2020); Mougiakakos et al. (2021); Dlapa et al. (2022a, b); Kälin et al. (2023); Dlapa et al. (2023) and eikonalization Koemans Collado et al. (2019); Di Vecchia et al. (2020, 2021a). Another important aspect is that the (n+1)PM order expansion inherently includes all nPN order information, together with additional information at infinitely high PN orders corresponding to high velocities. This makes the PM expansion particularly advantageous for systems where the component velocities can become large, such as binaries with significant eccentricity Chiaramello and Nagar (2020); Ramos-Buades et al. (2022a); Nagar et al. (2021); Ramos-Buades et al. (2022b) or hyperbolic encounters Cho et al. (2018); Albanesi et al. (2024). As such, there has been a dedicated effort in exploring how we can use the PM expansion to inform the properties of generic bound systems, e.g. Damour (2016, 2018); Kälin and Porto (2020b, c); Saketh et al. (2022); Khalil et al. (2022); Buonanno et al. (2024a). It is imperative to validate the PM information prior to its adoption in waveform models. That is, to understand how many PM orders are necessary for accurate waveform predictions throughout the parameter space. One route to do so is to use NR simulations to compare analytical predictions against non-perturbative information extracted from the simulations. Taking steps in this direction, Damour et al. (2014); Damour and Rettegno (2023); Rettegno et al. (2023); Buonanno et al. (2024b) have compared scattering angles from NR simulations of equal mass binary black hole scattering events (both spinning and non-spinning) to analytical predictions of the scattering angle using resummations of the current PM information. Building on this work, we significantly expand the suite of NR scattering simulations with a particular focus on exploring the high-energy behaviour in the equal-mass, non-spinning limit. Using these simulations, we present a detailed comparison of several approaches to resumming analytical PM information, highlighting the benefits and challenges posed by each of the schemes. The outline of this paper is as follows: In Sec. II we present new high energy NR simulations of equal mass, non-spinning binary black hole scattering events and outline a robust procedure for extraction of the scattering angles. In Sec. III, we recall general properties of unbound encounters before reviewing scattering angles in the PM and EOB frameworks. Sec. IV documents our results, whereby we review several attempts to resum the scattering angle and compare the analytical predictions against NR data. Following this, we suggest potential avenues of improvement where applicable. Notation Here, we outline a number of useful quantities and conventions used throughout the paper. Unless otherwise stated, we adopt geometric units in which G=c=1. The notation has been chosen to align with that adopted in, for example, Damour and Rettegno (2023); Rettegno et al. (2023). In this paper, we only consider non-spinning two-body systems with black hole masses m_{1} and m_{2}, such that the mass ratio is given by q=m_{1}/m_{2}\geq 1. Several useful mass parameters naturally follow \displaystyle M\! \displaystyle=m_{1}+m_{2},\!\! \displaystyle\nu\! \displaystyle=\!\frac{\mu}{M}=\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{M^{2}}, (1) where M is the total mass, \nu the symmetric mass ratio, and \mu the reduced mass. The total energy of the system will be denoted by E=E_{1}+E_{2} together with the corresponding dimensionless energy \displaystyle\Gamma \displaystyle=\frac{E}{M}=\sqrt{1+2\nu(\gamma-1)}. (2) Here we have introduced the relativistic Lorentz factor \displaystyle\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}, (3) in terms of the relativistic relative velocity v such that \gamma>1. The Lorentz factor is related to the dimensionless effective energy \hat{E}_{\rm eff}=E_{\rm eff}/\mu by \displaystyle\gamma \displaystyle=\hat{E}_{\rm eff}=\frac{E^{2}-m^{2}_{1}-m^{2}_{2}}{2m_{1}m_{2}}. (4) The dynamics of the binary can be described in terms of mass-rescaled coordinates and momenta \displaystyle r \displaystyle\equiv R/(GM), \displaystyle t \displaystyle\equiv T/(GM), (5) \displaystyle p_{\alpha} \displaystyle=P_{\alpha}/\mu, \displaystyle j \displaystyle\equiv J/(G\mu M), (6) where P^{\alpha} is the 4-momentum, R the separation, T the time, and J the total angular momentum. In the center-of-mass (c.m.) frame, the momentum at past infinity p_{\infty} is defined by Damour (2018) \displaystyle p_{\infty} \displaystyle=\sqrt{\gamma^{2}-1}, (7) noting that this differs by a factor of \mu from other conventions, e.g Buonanno et al. (2024a, b). The relative position and momentum vectors, \boldsymbol{r} and \boldsymbol{p}, describe the two-body dynamics following \displaystyle\boldsymbol{p}^{2} \displaystyle=p_{r}^{2}+\frac{\ell^{2}}{r^{2}}, (8) where p_{r}=\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}\cdot\boldsymbol{p} and \displaystyle\ell=\frac{L}{G\mu M} (9) is the rescaled orbital angular momentum. Note that as \ell\sim\mathcal{O}(G), we can express the perturbative PM expansion in terms of powers of G or, for example, in terms of inverse powers of the angular momentum. We define the critical angular momentum, \ell_{0}, as the value of \ell at which the two body system transitions from unbound (\ell>\ell_{0}) to bound (\ell<\ell_{0}) orbits. Below \ell_{0}, the black holes will emit radiation and eventually plunge. In the non-spinning limit, L is equivalent to the total angular momentum J and we will typically use the canonical definition of the orbital angular momentum, i.e. L=|\boldsymbol{r}\times\textbf{P}|, following the Newton-Wigner spin-supplementary condition Newton and Wigner (1949). However, it can also be convenient to work with the covariant angular-momentum L_{\rm cov}=b|\textbf{P}|, where b=\sqrt{-b^{\mu}b_{\mu}} denotes the impact parameter, following the Tulczyjew-Dixon spin supplementary condition Tulczyjew (1959); Dixon (1970). This is particularly true when considering the extension to spinning binaries."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09651v1,Classical characters of spinor fields in torsion gravity,"We consider the problem of having relativistic quantum mechanics re-formulated with hydrodynamic variables, and specifically the problem of deriving the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations from the Dirac equation. The problem will be answered on a general manifold with torsion and gravity. We will demonstrate that when plane waves are considered the MPD equations acquire the form given in Guedes:2022mdy , but we will also see that in such a form the MPD equations become trivial.","More than a century ago, the passage from classical to quantum physics marked the beginning of an era of unprecedented scientific and technological achievements that still continues today. The price we must pay for this revolution is the abandonment of the visualizability of physical concepts. In the passage from classical to quantum mechanics, our capacity to master the laws of nature has increased, but we have lost the ability to see what we are doing (this is the state of affairs that pushed famous figures of the past to say that no one really understands quantum mechanics). In such a situation, two philosophical currents arose: one suggesting to disregard any interest about the meaning so long as the correct numbers were computed (as exemplified by D. Mermin’s notorious ’shut up and calculate’); and one believing that our comprehension is improved if we can attribute an interpretation to those numbers. The adherents to the second philosophical current are those who advocate a return to the visualizability of classical concepts. Of all attempts to have quantum mechanics re-expressed with classical pictures, the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation222Recall that in dBB mechanics, hidden variables are non-local to be compatible with the violation of Bell-like inequalities [J. F. Clauser, M. A. Horne, A. Shimony, R. A. Holt, “Proposed experiment to test local hidden variable theories”, Phys. Rev. Lett. 23, 880 (1969)]. is the one that best implements the program by having quantum mechanics re-formulated in terms of hydrodynamic variables: the idea is that the wave function be re-written as the product of a module times a phase, which are then identified with density and velocity. The Schrödinger equation correspondingly decomposes into one Hamilton-Jacobi equation and one continuity equation, and the full hydrodynamic formulation is then accomplished. The extension to include spin and to enforce relativistic invariance has been source of debate between Bohm himself and Takabayasi in references b1 ; t1 ; b2 ; t2 . Mathematical details have been addressed in jl1 ; jl2 . See also Book for a more recent overview. Along this direction, the next step is to ask if, from the fundamental equations of relativistic quantum mechanics, we can derive the Newton equation. Or better, because relativistic quantum fields have spin, we should ask if we can obtain the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations M ; P ; D . As the MPD equations are obtained from the conservation laws of energy and spin, which naturally couple to curvature and torsion S ; K , it also becomes relevant to ask what happens when space-times possessing non-trivial structures are considered HKH . A first answer has been given in OK for the Weyssenhoff fluid. A more realistic answer was worked out in Guedes:2022mdy for Dirac fields in plane waves. Here, we will give the general answer to this problem for the case of Dirac fields without restraining ourselves to a plane wave solution. We will show however that when plane waves are considered the MPD equations as given in Guedes:2022mdy are recovered, although we will also see that in such a form the MPD equations reduce to be trivial."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09596v1,Toward the Observation of Entangled Pairs in BEC analogue Expanding Universes,"Pair creation is a fundamental prediction of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. While classical aspects of this phenomenon have been observed, the experimental confirmation of its quantum origin remains elusive. In this article, we quantify the entanglement produced by pair creation in a two dimensional Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) analogues of expanding universes and examine the impact of various experimental factors, including decoherence from thermal noise and losses. Our analysis evaluates the feasibility of detecting entanglement in these systems and identifies optimal experimental configurations for achieving this goal. Focusing on the experimental setup detailed in [1], we demonstrate that entanglement can be observed in these BEC analogues at a significance level of \sim 2\sigma with current capabilities, and at \gtrsim 3.3\sigma with minor improvements. Achieving this would provide unequivocal evidence of the quantum nature of pair creation and validate one of the most iconic predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.","The spontaneous creation of particle pairs triggered by the expansion of the universe was first identified by E. Schrödinger in the late 1930s, referring to it as an “alarming” phenomenon [2]. Schrödinger’s insights did not attract much attention at the time. This phenomenon was rediscovered by L. Parker about thirty years later, who, equipped with the modern language of quantum field theory (QFT), was able to firmly establish the phenomenon of spontaneous excitation of entangled pairs by the cosmic expansion [3, 4, 5]. These works laid the foundation for quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (QFTCS), a framework that has led to profound insights and predictions [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. As is often the case when discussing the intersection of quantum and gravitational effects, these phenomena are faint and difficult to be observable in the cosmos. Subsequently, Unruh proposed that similar effects might appear in other systems that can be recreated in the laboratory [14]. The key observation is that, although many of the predictions of QFTCS were first derived with gravitational backgrounds in mind, Einstein’s equations did not play any role, indicating that the fundamental predictions are universal aspects of quantum fields propagating on non-trivial effective geometries, regardless what the physical origin of the geometry is. Rapid progress in this field has led to outstanding experimental results that confirm classical aspects of QFTCS predictions in experimental analogues of the Hawking effect [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], superradiance [25, 26], pair creation in expanding universes [27, 28, 1, 29], and the dynamical Casimir effect [30]. These observations have been carried out on different physical platforms, confirming the universality of these phenomena [31]. Significant efforts are currently focused on detecting entanglement between the created quanta [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. This is of primary conceptual importance, because entanglement constitutes the core of pair creation in QFTs. Successfully observing entanglement would serve as a crucial benchmark, providing unambiguous confirmation of the quantum origin of the observed excitations. Observing entanglement, however, presents an extraordinary experimental challenge due to its inherently faint and fragile nature. Indeed, recent claims of observation in analogue spacetimes have been debated [44, 45, 46], and independent confirmation of this observation (see [47] for observation of quantum correlations in a related scenario, although without an analog background metric). Fortunately, technological advancements are progressing at a fast rate, making the observation of entanglement associated with spontaneous pair creation by dynamical backgrounds attainable in the near future [48]. Observing entanglement would rule out any classical explanation of the phenomenon [49, 50, 51, 52]. The goal of this article is to contribute to this exciting pursuit from the theoretical side. We aim at laying out effective tools for the quantification of the entanglement produced by pair creation, and of the way this entanglement is affected by various experimental factors, particularly by detrimental effects such as decoherence induced from thermal ambient noise and experimental losses. This quantification is of vital importance for the design of optimal experimental configurations. Although our approach is general and can be applied to a wide range of experimental setups (see, e.g., [39, 53, 54, 41]), in this article we apply it on a current experimental platform which utilizes quantum fluids—Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs)—to simulate a two-dimensional (2D) expanding universe [1]. Focusing on this particular experimental platform makes our analysis more concrete and tangible, allowing us to use realistic parameters in our calculations. But, most importantly, our focus is motivated by the fact that, as we discuss in this article, this platform is on the verge of observing entanglement originating from cosmological pair creation. Indeed, one of the key outcomes of our analysis is the identification of modest and achievable upgrades to the experiment aimed at reaching optimal configurations for detecting entanglement within the current capabilities and experimental constraints. The article is organized as follows. In section II we review the theory behind BEC analogs of expanding universes. In section III, we describe the experimental platform used in [1], in which classical aspects of acoustic waves compatible with the phenomenon of pair creation were detected after a single expansion ramp. In section IV, we present basic features of the Gaussian state formalism, and explain how to reconstruct the quantum state of the system from time-series measurements of density contrast correlations. We also discuss how to quantify entanglement in this setup. In section V, we discuss our modeling of the proposed experiment, and focus on quantifying the entanglement produced by pair creation. In section VI, we perform an optimization in experimental parameter space of expansion/contraction experiments aimed at maximizing entanglement detectability, showing how entanglement could be detected with current techniques. Finally, section VII provides a summary of the main results achieved and includes some discussions on potential future directions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09559v1,Modeling lunar response to gravitational waves using normal-mode approach and tidal forcing,"In the light of the recent advances in lunar space missions a great interest into using Moon as a future environment for gravitational waves (GWs) detectors has been initiated. Moon offers a unique environment for such detectors due to constrained noise sources, since unlike Earth it does not have ocean and atmosphere. In this paper, we further explore the idea of using Moon as a giant resonator of GWs, a proposal that was first introduced by Weber in 1969. This idea is relaying on the theory how GWs interact with free masses and finally elastic solids, such as is a planet to some approximation. We start by carefully setting up General Relativity (physics) and elastic theory (geophysics) background to be able to derive analytically the coupling between GWs and elastic solids through associated equations of motion. Once the analytical solution is derived, we explore the parameter space this interaction depends on. This eventually provides us with the transfer function, which defines the frequency band of the interest. We show how this interaction robustly depends on the regolith structure by altering the initial lunar model and exploring different regolith models. Our results show that detection might be troublesome in the high frequency regime between 0.1 and 1 Hz, without beforehand constraining the regolith structure with geophysical methods. Finally, we discuss what are the implications of detecting these signals with the future GW detectors build on the Moon.","Nine years after a first detection of gravitational waves (GWs) in 2015 [B\BPBIP. Abbott \BOthers. (\APACyear2016)], the groundbased detectors, LIGO and VIRGO, created numerous possibility of studying Universe by providing community with catalog of detections [R. Abbott \BOthers. (\APACyear2023)]. Up to this day, LIGO and VIRGO remain the only operating detectors of GWs. It is a well know fact that the sensitivities of these GW detectors are limited by a multitude of noise sources from the instruments themselves and their surroundings [Saulson (\APACyear2017)]. Thus, their exploitable frequency band is defined between 10^{1} and 10^{4} Hz. Although these instruments are decoupled by several orders of magnitude from the Earth’s seismic activity thanks to state-of-the-art isolation systems [Accadia \BOthers. (\APACyear2011)], seismic noise prevents any detection below a few Hertz. Furthermore, it is not possible to isolate these detectors from Newtonian noise, which is largely due to our planet’s seismic noise and the associated mass re-distribution and results in residual acceleration of the interferometer test masses, degrading performance below 8 Hz. Going in space with the LISA mission, scheduled for the early 2030s, will enable us to explore a lower frequency range from 10^{-4} to 10^{-1} Hz [Amaro-Seoane \BOthers. (\APACyear2017)]. This mission consists of a constellation of three satellites that will follow the Earth along its heliocentric orbit at a distance of 50\times 10^{6} km. These satellites shall maintain laser links between them to create three massive interferometers. Additional space-based concepts still under study have been suggested to further investigate frequencies in the milli- to micro-Hertz range [Harry \BOthers. (\APACyear2006), Kawamura \BOthers. (\APACyear2020), Lacour \BOthers. (\APACyear2019)]. During the Apollo missions, seismometers were deployed at the lunar surface which allowed transmitting data back to Earth about the Moon seismic activity from 1969 until September 1977. The analysis of the Apollo data showed that the Moon is extremely seismically quiet with an upper limit on the seismic background noise that is 3 order of magnitude lower than Earth one [Lognonné \BOthers. (\APACyear2009)]. For this reason, the Moon was and it is still considered as a unique environment for a gravitational astronomy. In addition, GWs are known to excite vibrations of any elastic body and many efforts has been made to study vibrations of various bodies, such as Earth [J. Weber (\APACyear1959), Dyson (\APACyear1969), De Sabbata \BOthers. (\APACyear1970), Ben-Menahem (\APACyear1983), Majstorović \BOthers. (\APACyear2019)], spheres [Ashby \BBA Dreitlein (\APACyear1975), Linet (\APACyear1984)], elastic solids [Dozmorov (\APACyear1976\APACexlab\BCnt2), Dozmorov (\APACyear1976\APACexlab\BCnt1)], stars [Burke (\APACyear1976), Walgate (\APACyear1983), Khosroshahi \BBA Sobouti (\APACyear1997), Siegel \BBA Roth (\APACyear2010), Siegel \BBA Roth (\APACyear2011), McKernan \BOthers. (\APACyear2014), Lopes \BBA Silk (\APACyear2015), Lopes (\APACyear2017), Lopes \BBA Silk (\APACyear2017)] and recently Moon [Kachelrieß \BBA Nødtvedt (\APACyear2024), Li \BOthers. (\APACyear2023), Yan \BOthers. (\APACyear2024), Bi \BBA Harms (\APACyear2024)]. Subsequently, Weber was the first one to suggest to employ Moon as a giant resonance oscillator of GWs [J. Weber (\APACyear1959)]. Following his idea a gravimeter was deployed at the lunar surface during Apollo 17 [Douglass \BBA Tyson (\APACyear1971), Giganti \BOthers. (\APACyear1973), Giganti \BOthers. (\APACyear1977)]. Unfortunately, due to a technical failure the data could not be used for the search of GWs. Recently, new interest in lunar exploration has led to novel project proposals to detect GWs from lunar surface in order to access the missing deci-Hertz frequency band [Harms (\APACyear2022), Branchesi \BOthers. (\APACyear2023), Cozzumbo \BOthers. (\APACyear2024)]. The Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna (LGWA) proposal consists of an array of four highend seismometers that shall monitor the Moon’s response in the frequency range between 10^{-3} to 1 Hz [Harms \BOthers. (\APACyear2021), van Heijningen \BOthers. (\APACyear2023)]. The Lunar Seismic and Gravitational Antenna (LSGA) proposal involves deploying an antenna configuration composed of two 10 km-long Engineered Fiber optic Distributed Acoustic Sensors (EFDAS) fiber cables arranged in an L-shape, in parallel with two laser strainmeters. The EFDAS cables are interrogated by a central interrogator unit, which utilizes a narrow band laser light source [Katsanevas (\APACyear2022)]. Gravitational-wave Lunar Observatory for Cosmology (GLOC) proposal discusses positioning three end-stations at the rim of a big lunar crater to create a triangle-shape detector (3 independent interferometers) like Einstein Telescope (ET) with arms of 40 kilometers [Jani \BBA Loeb (\APACyear2021)]. Laser Interferometer On the Moon (LION) proposal consists of a cryogenic triangular interferometer placed in a permanent shadowed region (PSR). Its is based on CE 2 proposal and technologies [Amaro-Seoane \BOthers. (\APACyear2021), Bailes \BOthers. (\APACyear2021)]. In the light of the new proposals that consider to establish GW detectors on the Moon surface, it is required to develop a Moon’s response to different sources of excitations, as well as Moon response to GWs. The frequency dependent response model to GWs could be used twofold. Either it can be considered as a noise signal that would be removed from the instrument’s output to increase instrument sensitivity. Or it could be considered as a signal that we want to measure. Also, depending on what type of measurement we are interested in, the Moon’s response should be calculated in carefully chosen coordinate system [Harms (\APACyear2022)]. Classically, the models of elastic bodies, such as the resonant bar and sphere detectors, are calculated in the proper detector frame, where the GW forcing is considered to be of tidal nature. However, the response of any elastic body can also be derived in the transverse traceless (TT) gauge, where the GW metric forcing is associated with the gradient of the shear modulus. The two approaches derive displacement variables that should be measured with different instruments [Ashby \BBA Dreitlein (\APACyear1975)]. The motivation of this paper is to focus on the tidal response of the Moon due to GWs, since this approach should be more general and applicable for different type of instruments. Thus, our paper goes into details of tidal response of the realistic lunar model, and completes some of the recently published papers on the same topic [Harms \BOthers. (\APACyear2021), Branchesi \BOthers. (\APACyear2023), Li \BOthers. (\APACyear2023), Kachelrieß \BBA Nødtvedt (\APACyear2024), Cozzumbo \BOthers. (\APACyear2024), Yan \BOthers. (\APACyear2024), Bi \BBA Harms (\APACyear2024), Ajith \BOthers. (\APACyear2024)]. This paper is organised as follows: first, we introduce the GW metric in TT gauges and the proper detector frame. Second, we discuss how the equations of motion of an elastic body are derived in these two gauges. Third, we show how displacements are derived from these equations for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating Moon in the proper detector frame using the Green tensor formalism. Fourth, we provide analytical radial and horizontal transfer functions. Fifth, we discuss the implications of altering the lunar models on the associated spectra. Finally, we consider the detectability of GWs in the context of the derived analytical solution, instrument sensitivity, and the lunar environment."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09528v1,Searching for quantum-gravity footprint around stellar-mass black holes,"According to the asymptotically safe gravity, black holes can have characteristics different from those described according to general relativity. Particularly, they are more compact, with a smaller event horizon, which in turn affects the other quantities dependent on it, like the photon ring and the size of the innermost stable circular orbit. We decided to test the latter by searching in the literature for observational measurements of the emission from accretion disk around stellar-mass black holes. All published values of the radius of the inner accretion disk were made homogeneous by taking into account the most recent and more reliable values of mass, spin, viewing angle, and distance from the Earth. We do not find any significant deviation from the expectations of general relativity. Some doubtful cases can be easily understood as due to specific states of the object during the observation or instrumental biases.","The description of all physical phenomena in the Universe in one unified theory is the ultimate dream of theoretical physics. Despite of decades of theoretical research [1, 2], little has been obtained on the observational/experimental side. Any experimental or observational evidence of quantum gravity remains elusive still today [3]. Today more than ever, it is necessary to find some observational constrain, to try stopping the uncontrolled proliferation of theories. Among the different available variants of quantum gravity theories, asymptotically safe gravity (ASG) could offer some interesting opportunities. First developed by Steven Weinberg [4], it has its pillars on quantum field theory and renormalization group [5, 6]. Most important, it is expected to have observational consequences on astrophysical and cosmological scales [7], and in particular around black holes [8, 9, 10, 11]. For large values of the distance r>>l_{\rm Planck}, where l_{\rm Planck}\sim 1.62\times 10^{-33} cm is the Planck length, the gravitational constant G(r) becomes [9]: G(r)\sim G_{\rm N}\left(1-\frac{\xi}{r^{2}}\right) (1.1) where G_{\rm N}\sim 6.67\times 10^{-8} cm3 g-1 s-2 is the classical gravitational constant, and 0<\xi<1 is the coupling coefficient. The main effect on black holes is a more compact object, although without curvature singularities [10]. A smaller event horizon affects also all the other related quantities such as the photon ring [10], the ergosphere [9] and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit r_{\rm isco} [11]. The effects of ASG should be larger for smaller masses, although the constraint of 0<\xi<1 sets severe limits on them. When the mass of the compact object is much larger than the Planck mass – which is any real case – the critical surfaces of an ASG black hole should not be distinguishable from the classical one according to [8] (see their Fig. 4 and 5). However, [11] suggested that differences up \sim 30% in the r_{\rm isco} are expected in the case of maximally rotating prograde black holes already with a small value of \xi (see his Table I). Moreover, the constraint on \xi was put to question in Eichhorn and Held [10], who claim that values greater than 1, which lead to larger deviations from GR, can be admitted within the framework of the ASG. The same authors also stress that “irrespective of theoretical considerations, any observational avenue to put constraints on deviations from GR, should be explored” [10]. This is also our philosophical approach to the problem, searching for any deviation from GR around black holes. Some attempts have been already made based on X-ray spectroscopy [12, 13, 14], but to date no deviations were found. We focus our study on the search for deviations from the value of the r_{\rm isco} in the case of stellar-mass black holes calculated according to general relativity. Since these objects are the smallest black holes (primordial black holes were never observed to date), the effects of ASG – if any – should be maximized. Anyway, it should be noted that the theoretical minimum mass of a black hole is estimated to be \sim 2.33M_{\odot} [15], which is still \sim 38 orders of magnitude greater than the Planck mass (but remind the above quote by Eichhorn and Held [10]). In addition, since the peak of the emission from the accretion disk is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the compact object, it falls in the X-ray energy band, where are less problems of contamination from the nearby environment. In the case of supermassive black holes, the disk emission peaks in the ultraviolet, where there are contaminations from emission lines of the broad-line region and the host galaxy. As a first step, since we need of observations of black holes in specific states (high/soft, see Sect. 3), we searched in all the available literature for measurements of the inner radius of the accretion disk. Then, we made all the values homogeneous to compare each other."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09513v1,Strong gravitational lensing of regular black holes in asymptotically safe gravity,"In this paper, we investigate the strong gravitational lensing effect around a spherically symmetric regular black hole, whose metric is derived from a non-singular collapsing dust ball model in asymptotically safe gravity. In this regular black hole spacetime, we obtain the analytical expression of the light deflection angle via calculating the strong field limit coefficients, and then evaluate the lensing observables in strong field regime by supposing the regular black holes as the candidate of M87^{*} and SgrA* supermassive black holes, respectively. In addition, we also in detail analyze the effects of the scale parameter \xi on the strong deflection angle and the lensing observables. We expect our results will be useful in the future to distinguish these non-singular black holes from their classical singular counterparts.","It is well-known black holes predicted by General Relativity (GR) Einstein1916 are the most fascinating one of celestial objects, describing regions of spacetime with intense gravitational fields and unique properties. More recently, there are already experiment observations that demonstrated the existence of black holes in our universe. For example, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration has successfully detected the gravitational waves from the merger of a binary black holes LIGO:2016aoc , and the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration directly observed the first images of the shadow of a black hole in the core of the galaxy M87^{*} EHT:2019dse ; EHT:2019ths ; EHT:2019ggy and SgrA^{*} EHT:2022wkp ; EHT:2022wok . Theoretically, if the Kretschmann scalar is divergence as the radial coordinate r\rightarrow 0, the spacetime singularity Penrose:1964wq ; Hawking:1970zqf concealed within the event horizon of black hole will occur, which results in a loss of causality and the breakdown of standard physical laws. Originally, according to cosmic censorship conjecture Penrose:1969pc , Penrose thought that the naked singularities should be hidden beneath the event horizon of a black hole. Latter, people have attempted different methodologies to resolve the spacetime singularity problem. One of the most widely investigative approaches is the regular black hole models Lan:2023cvz . Early research idea that the spacetime singularity was replaced by a regular patch of de Sitter space Frolov:1989pf . Bardeen implemented the first regular black hole model with the de Sitter core Bardeen1968 , which is called the Bardeen black hole. Ayon-Beato and Garcia interpreted the Bardeen black hole was a magnetic solution to Einstein equations coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics Ayon-Beato:2000mjt . Hitherto, a large number of regular black hole models have been given from a theoretical perspective in the literature Hayward:2005gi ; Bronnikov:2005gm ; Burinskii:2001bq ; Fan:2016hvf ; Ovalle:2023ref ; Mazza:2023iwv ; Modesto:2010rv ; Casadio:2023iqt ; Lewandowski:2022zce ; Carballo-Rubio:2019fnb . The regular black hole models have been got considerable attention in asymptotic safety gravity Bonanno:2000ep ; Torres:2017ygl ; Eichhorn:2012va ; Pawlowski:2023dda ; Stashko:2024wuq ; Spina:2024npx ; Bonanno:2023rzk . Recently, Bonanno et al. Bonanno:2023rzk presented a new model of regular black hole by generalizing an initial idea by Markov and Mukhanov Markov:1985py . It is based on the description of dynamically collapsing matter, and what is particularly interesting is that it directly predicts the formation of a regular black hole during the collapse process. According to gravity’s antiscreening behavior at small distances, the model operates under the assumption that black hole solutions observed in nature are sourced by a matter interior whose evolution is nonsingular. This mechanism is implemented starting from an effective Lagrangian that incorporates a multiplicative coupling with the matter component, distinguishing it from other models. Quasinormal modes and gray-body factors of regular black holes in asymptotically safe gravity have been investigated in Stashko:2024wuq ; Spina:2024npx . Gravitational lensing (GL) has been a well-known phenomenon that can be regarded as one of the most effective tools for investigating the spacetime geometry and testing gravitational theories. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate GL effects of regular black holes in asymptotically safe gravity. The light rays pass very close to the strong field regime around a compact object, i.e., like a black hole, they will be extremely deflected. This phenomenon is usually called strong gravitational lensing (SGL). Darwin first investigated the strong deflection angle of light near the Schwarzschild black hole Darwin1961 . Latter, Virbhadra and Ellis investigated the Schwarzschild black hole lensing, and found a sequence of relativistic images formed by light passing close to the black hole’s event horizon Virbhadra:1999nm ; Virbhadra:2002ju . Following developments by Fritelli, Kling and Newman constructed the exact lens equation in the Schwarzschild black hole spacetime, and gave the analytic expressions for magnifications and time delays of relativistic images Frittelli:1999yf . In a general static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black hole spacetime, Bozza demonstrated that the light deflection angle exhibits a logarithmic divergence as the light very closes to the photon sphere Bozza:2002zj . In this literature, Bozza also indicated that the positions and the magnifications of relativistic images around a photon sphere relate to the strong field limit coefficients Bozza:2002zj , which carry information of black holes. Thus, if they are given by the SGL experiment observables, we are able to identify the nature of the lensing black hole unambiguously. Recently, Tsukamoto provided an improved strong deflection limit analysis in a general asymptotically flat, static, spherically symmetric spacetime Tsukamoto:2016jzh . This technique has been extensively applied to different specific metrics, and for recent applications see Zhang:2024sgs ; Wang:2024iwt ; Gao:2022gbn ; QiQi:2023nex ; Furtado:2020puz ; Nascimento:2020ime ; Soares:2024rhp ; Kuang:2022ojj ; Kuang:2022xjp ; Gao:2021lmo ; Virbhadra:2024xpk ; Virbhadra:2022iiy ; Fu:2021fxn ; Zhang:2017vap ; Shipley:2019kfq . In this paper, we mainly have two goals. First, we calculate the strong deflection angle of light in the regular black hole spacetime in asymptotically safe gravity. Second, based on the analytical expression of the deflection angle in the strong field limit, we further study the observables related to the respective gravitational lensing, and evaluate them from the data of the supermassive M87^{*} and SgrA^{*} black holes. Our paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we first do a brief review on the logarithmic behavior of the deflection angle and the lensing observables in the strong field limit in a generic static, spherically symmetric spacetime. In Sec. III, following the technique introduced by Bozza Bozza:2002zj and improved by Tsukamoto Tsukamoto:2016jzh , we calculate the strong deflection angle around a regular black hole in asymptotically safe gravity, and then evaluate the lensing observables of the supermassive black holes in this gravity framework. Finally Sec. IV is for conclusion. Throughout this paper we use the geometric units with G=c=1 unless otherwise specified."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09447v1,Instability of nonlinear scalar field on strongly charged asymptotically AdS black hole background,"Conformally invariant scalar equation permits the Robin boundary condition at infinity of asymptotically-AdS spacetimes. We show how the dynamics of conformal cubic scalar field on the Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter background depend on the black hole size, charge and the choice of the boundary condition. We study the whole range of admissible charges, including the extremal case. In particular, we observe the transition in stability of the field for large black holes at the specific critical value of the charge. Similarities between Reissner-Nordström and Kerr black hole let us suspect that similar effect may also occur in rotating black holes.","The goal of this work is to investigate nonlinear dynamics of cubic conformal scalar field propagating on the Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter (RNAdS) background with Robin boundary condition. Therefore, it aims to generalise the results of [FFMM24] to charged black holes. Similarly to [FFMM24] we restrict the analysis to spherically symmetric solutions, and investigate how the dynamics depends on the properties of the black hole (radius and charge) and the Robin boundary parameter. We find that if the charge is not too big then we observe qualitatively the same behaviour as in [FFMM24]. Sufficiently large black holes dissipate the scalar field strongly enough and lead to nonlinearly stable trivial solution for defocusing nonlinearity and prevent blowup for small data for focusing nonlinearity. However, for black holes with charge above a certain critical value, we observe a transition to more unstable behaviour. Even in the regime of large black holes the trivial solution becomes nonlinearly unstable: for the defocusing case we observe convergence to a nontrivial static solution, for the focusing case any perturbation blows up in finite time. Notably, this transition occurs independently of the boundary condition. The described change in stability follows from the emergence of the growing mode in the perturbative analysis around zero solution. This effect has been recently observed for scalar fields on the near-extremal black hole background with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions [Zheng.2024]. On the other hand, an analogous phenomenon has been known to occur for the fields with specific Robin boundary condition on the uncharged black hole backgrounds [Holzegel.2014pzh]. Our results show that these two seemingly distinct observations come from a common mechanism. In addition, we also study the extremal RNAdS black hole. We observe there qualitatively similar behaviour as in the subextremal case. However, depending on the parameters in the model there are noticeable differences. In the defocusing case, the global attractor becomes singular at the horizon, thus any initial data leads to singularity formation at infinite time. For the focusing nonlinearity we also observe changes with respect to the subextremal black holes. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the model. In Section 3, as an important step before tackling the nonlinear problem, we investigate static solutions of the linearised equation. Such solutions were found in [FFMM24] to divide the parameter phase space into stable and unstable regions. Subsequently, in Sections 4 and 5 we discuss nonlinear equation with defocusing and focusing nonlinearities, respectively. Both sections are similarly structured, beginning with the discussion of the static solutions and then covering the dynamical behaviour. We end up with conclusions in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09374v1,Shadows of rotating black holes in effective quantum gravity,"Recently, two new spherically symmetric black hole models with covariance have been proposed in effective quantum gravity. Based on these models, we use the modified Newman-Janis algorithm to generate two rotating quantum-corrected black hole solutions, characterized by three parameters, the mass M, the spin a, and the quantum parameter \zeta. To understand the effects of the quantum parameter \zeta on these two rotating black holes, we investigate in detail the horizons and static limit surfaces. By constraining the possible range of the parameters, we study the shadows cast by these rotating black holes. The results indicate that for both rotating BHs, the parameter \zeta mainly affects the shadow size in the non-extremal case, while it deforms the shadow shape by arising a cuspy edge in the near-extremal case.","In recent years, the exploration of black holes (BHs) has been at the forefront of research in the field of theoretical physics. With breakthroughs in gravitational wave astronomy [1] and the rapid development of BH imaging technology [2, 3], we have gained a deeper understanding of these enigmatic celestial objects in the universe. Due to the fundamental conflict between the singularity theorems and quantum mechanics, it is widely believed that general relativity (GR) may not fully describe gravitational phenomena across all scales in the universe. Therefore, one aspires to solve this problem within the framework of quantum gravity theory. In the context of quantum gravity, the study on BH not only advances our understanding of the nature of BH but also provides a possible pathway to test the theory of quantum gravity. Many influential quantum gravity theories have been proposed, among which loop quantum gravity (LQG) has received extensive attention and in-depth research [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Recently, two new effective BH models motivated by LQG have been proposed in [21], which retain the general covariance of spacetime within the framework of the Hamiltonian approach to quantum gravity. General covariance is one of the core principles of GR, requiring that physical laws take the same form in all reference frames, thereby ensuring the consistency and universality of the theory. The models not only provide a platform for studying quantum gravity effects but also allow us to explore how these effects manifest without violating the fundamental principles of GR. Hence, the models have attracted attention [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. With the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) imaging the shadow of the supermassive BH at the center of the M87* galaxy [28], and the observations of Sgr A* at the center of the Milky Way [29], BH physics has entered into a new era. These observations not only confirm the existence of BHs, but also offer possibilities for exploring the strong gravitational fields of BHs. The central dark area of BH image is referred to as the BH shadow. By considering that the size and shape of BH shadow depend on the spacetime metric, the study of black hole shadow provides us an important way to extract very useful information about the BH spacetime, and helps us to distinguish various gravitational theories and even to investigate the quantum gravity effects. After the pioneering work by Synge [30], several studies on BH shadow have been made in various BH spacetimes, including quantum-corrected ones [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. Compared to the static spherically symmetric solution, the exact rotating solution is in general hard to obtain by solving the field equations. An effective method to get a rotating solution is the Newman-Janis algorithm (NJA), which was initially designed to generate the Kerr metric from the Schwarzschild metric in GR [44, 45]. However, this method encounters some issues. The first one is that complexification of the metric functions is not unique, and there is no rule for choosing the appropriate complexification. The second one is that the generated metric may not be a solution to the same field equations as the seed metric. To avoid introducing complex coordinates during the algorithm process, a modified NJA was proposed in [46]. The modified NJA makes it easier to obtain physically feasible solutions, and can be directly applied to more complex metric forms, including those obtained within the framework of LQG. Despite these progresses, the modified NJA introduces an undetermined function H to the resulting rotating metric, whose value should be determined by the field equations. Fortunately, the undetermined function H is an overall conformal factor appeared in the rotating metric. Moreover, it turns out that a rotating solution generated by the modified NJA always admits separability of Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics, irrespective of the ambiguity raised by the undetermined function [47]. Therefore, neither the causal structure nor the null geodesic depends on the choice of H [47]. Hence, both the shape and the size of shadow cast by the rotating BH obtained via the modified NJA do not depend on the precise value of H. The NJA and its modification have been widely used to generate the corresponding rotating solution from a static seed metric in alternative theories of gravity as well as in quantum gravity [48, 36, 49, 41]. In this paper, we will use the modified NJA method to generate the corresponding rotating solutions from the two static spherically symmetric quantum-corrected BH solutions proposed in [21], and study the effects of quantum gravity on the shadows cast by the rotating BHs. The structure of our article will be organized as follows. In Sec. II, we recall the two new spherically symmetric quantum-modified BH spacetimes. In Sec. III, we generate the corresponding rotating BHs using the modified NJA, investigate the horizons and the static limit surfaces of these rotating BHs, and analyze how the outer horizons and the static limit surfaces change with the quantum parameters \zeta and the spin parameter a. In Sec. IV, we discuss the geodesic equations of photons, and study the shadows of the rotating BHs, focusing on the quantum gravity effects. A summary is presented in Sec.V. Throughout this paper, we adopt the geometric unit G=c=1, and set the BH mass M=1 in numerical calculations."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09327v1,Slowly rotating and charged Black-holes in Entangled Relativity,"Entangled Relativity is a non-linear reformulation of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity (General Relativity) that offers a more parsimonious formulation. This non-linear approach notably requires the simultaneous definition of matter fields, thus aligning more closely with Einstein’s principle of relativity of inertia than General Relativity does. Solutions for spherically charged black holes have already been identified. After exploring further some of the properties of these solutions, we present new solutions for the field equations pertaining to slowly rotating charged black holes.","Entangled Relativity is a general theory of relativity that intertwines curvature (gravity) and matter fields in the definition of the theory through a non-linear coupling [1, 2]. Therefore, it better aligns with Einstein’s original opinion that a satisfying relativistic theory should prevent the existence of vacuum solutions, which he named the principle of relativity of inertia,111Also named Mach’s principle by Einstein in [3]. He explains this choice as follows: “I have chosen the term “Mach’s principle” because this principle is a generalization of Mach’s claim that inertia has to be reduced upon interaction of the bodies”. and which notably implies, in Einstein’s words, that “there can be no [spacetime metric] field without matter” [3]—see also [4, 5, 6, 7]. Indeed, because of the non-linear coupling between matter and curvature in the formulation of the theory, it cannot even be defined without matter fields. Also, because it requires less universal dimensionful constants than General Relativity in order to be defined, it is also more parsimonious than General Relativity—both at the classical and at the quantum levels [8, 9]. We will see this point with the formulation of the theory below. Indeed, Entangled Relativity can be defined from the following path integral [8, 9] Z=\int[\mathcal{D}g]\prod_{i}[\mathcal{D}f_{i}]\exp[i\Theta], (1) with \Theta=-\frac{1}{2\epsilon^{2}}\int d^{4}_{g}x\frac{\mathcal{L}^{2}_{m}(f,g)}{% R(g)}, (2) and \int[\mathcal{D}] relates to the sum over all possible (non-redundant) field configurations, R is the usual Ricci scalar that is constructed upon the metric tensor g, \mathrm{d}^{4}_{g}x:=\sqrt{-|g|}\mathrm{d}^{4}x is the spacetime volume element, with |g| the metric g determinant, and \mathcal{L}_{m} is the Lagrangian density of matter fields f. It is not necessarily the Standard Model of particles Lagrangian density at the fundamental level, and could be a completion of it instead. It also depends on the metric tensor, a priori through to the usual comma-goes-to-semicolon rule [10]—at least it has to be the case in the limit where Entangled Relativity reduces to General Relativity. Because the dimension of the integral is an energy squared, and in order to recover standard quantum field theory on “flat spacetime” when gravity is neglected,222A “flat spacetime” is only a useful approximation on scale for which gravity can be neglected. This approximation fails both at large scales and at the infinitesimal scale of quantum gravity. Classically, even for large R, there always exists a given scale at which the metric can be approximated to be flat. Nevertheless, according to present knowledge, R\neq 0 everywhere in our universe. \epsilon is the (reduced) Planck energy [8, 9]. One can check that the Planck energy does not influence the classical phenomenology of the theory, which corresponds to stationary quantum phase \delta\Theta=0. An important characteristic of Entangled Relativity is that, despite its non-linear formulation, it has a built-in decoupling—originally found in scalar-tensor theories and named intrinsic decoupling [11]—such that its phenomenology is very close to that of General Relativity whenever matter fields are such that \mathcal{L}_{m}\approx T on-shell. Since this is the case for typical matter fields present in our universe, it means that Entangled Relativity is not expected to deviate much from General Relativity for the predictions of several phenomena. In the Solar System for instance, Entangled Relativity is indistinguishable from General Relativity with current observational accuracy [1], or more generally at larger scales, due to the main contribution of non, or weakly, interacting particles that are supposed to constitute cold dark-matter. Various observational campaigns, involving either the detection of gravitational waves with the LIGO, Virgo and later KAGRA collaborations [12], or the reconstruction of the image of a supermassive black-hole’s shadow through interferometry [13], have yielded data that are consistent with vacuum solutions of black hole in General Relativity, such as the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics. Therefore, it is crucial that Entangled Relativity reproduces, at least up to non-observable differences, the predictions of Einstein’s theory for astrophysical black-holes. Minazzoli & Santos [14] demonstrated in the case of a non-rotating charged black hole that the external Schwarzschild metric can be a good approximation of the exact solutions of black holes in Entangled Relativity in astrophysical conditions. They used the electromagnetic field as the sole source of matter, being the simplest choice for matter fields with infinite range. The natural extension of this study is to look at the case of rotating charged black holes, which is what the present paper will mainly be about."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09276v1,Is The Internal Entropy of F(R)-Gravity Really An Entropy?,"This paper connects two methods for finding the functional of entropy in F(R)-Gravity: Padmanabhan’s and Hammad’s. The resulting approach is simple to follow and yields entropy functional, which can be separated into two parts. The part unknown in General Relativity is often called in the literature as an internal entropy and this paper points on incompatibility between the internal entropy found from the entropy functional and the one found using conventional approach.","F(R)-Gravity is a modified theory of gravity, where the scalar curvature in the Lagrangian is replaced with a general function F(R) of the scalar curvature. This modification is simple because it does not introduce any other scalar as well as general as we have no conditions on the function F(R), they are imposed in the moment when we compare predictions with observations [1, 2, 3, 4]. Interesting is the fact that the F(R)-Gravity produces an analogy with thermodynamics similarly as General Relativity. Ever since the thermodynamics of F(R)-Gravity was studied [5], the additional effects, arising from the higher order members of the function F(R), were identified as disipative nature of gravity caused by a new entropy member — internal entropy [6, 7, 8]. However, in a recent paper it was shown [9], that it might be more natural to see those effects as being caused by a pressure related to the function F(R). Such ambiquity is due to similarity of terms P\delta V and T\delta S because they are almost equal in the effect. Nevertheless, even in the analogy between gravity and thermodynamics, the entropy is special and when into account works of Thanu Padmanabhan and Fayçal Hammad. Thanu Padmanabhan held a specific view about nature of gravity. In his works [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], he and his team have shown, that if we assume that the space-time has a structure, the gravity is emergent as a consequence of thermodynamics of such structure. Hence, from his point of view, the gravity represents an effect of more fundamental fabric. In that case the behaviour of gravity is governed by the principle of maximizing the entropy functional. Fayçal Hammad has adopted a different approach [15, 16]. His starting point was also the theory of elastisticity. From it, he constructs the functional of entropy as well but with a different approach. Using the elasticity of space-time, he is able to obtain the same thermodynamic properties as it is usual in thermodynamics of gravity, e. g. the Bekenstein formula for entropy. In this paper, it will be demonstrated how we can combine both approaches Padmanabhan’s and Hammad’s and how we can benefit from it. The functional of entropy will be constructed using combined approach. From the functional, we will identify the so-called internal part of entropy and try to follow the Hammad’s approach and compare the results to previously obtained results of entropy [8, 9]. The paper is organized as follows, the second section introduces both approaches leading to entropy functional. The third section shows how we can combine those two approaches and how can we benefit from it. The fourth section uses the results of previous sections to identify the internal part of entropy and compare it to its expected form. This paper follows the East Coast convention with metric signature (-,+,+,+) and Latin indices running over 0..3 interval while the Greek ones over 1..3. The fundamental constants c,G,\hbar,k_{B} are treated as equal to one."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09236v1,Traversable Wormholes with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking,"We present an exact, spherically symmetric, static solution of the Einstein field equations minimally coupled to a self-interacting scalar field. The solution does not exhibit any zero proper volume singularity at the center, and therefore, curvature scalars are always regular. We study the property of radial null geodesics and derive that the metric can describe either a two-way or a one-way traversable wormhole depending on certain parameter ranges. Notably, it lacks a Schwarzschild limit. The scalar field exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking within the coordinate range where a wormhole throat forms. It can be seen as a suggestion that spontaneous symmetry breaking may act as a threshold for wormhole throat formation. Additionally, we compute the radius of the photon sphere, the Lyapunov exponent, the shadow radius, and the innermost stable circular orbits for this spacetime metric.","Although the General Theory of Relativity (GR) is widely regarded as the most accurate description of gravity to date, the number of exact solutions to its field equations remains relatively small. This limitation is primarily due to the fundamental challenges involved in solving the coupled partial differential equations that form the basis of the theory. In any case, the spherically symmetric field equations of GR are inherently quite restrictive. A clear example of this rigidity is found in the fact that, for a vacuum (where T_{\mu\nu}=0), the Schwarzschild solution stands as the unique static and isotropic solution that satisfies the condition of asymptotic flatness [1, 2, 3]. This result is central to the formulation of Jebsen-Birkhoff’s theorem [4, 5]. The Schwarzschild solution represents a singularity with zero proper volume, surrounded by a horizon, and depends on two parameters: r_{s}, which indicates the location of the horizon, and r, which defines the position of the singularity. When matter is incorporated into the field equations, they become even more restrictive and less predictable. Some partial solutions have been obtained in specific cases, such as GR coupled to self-interacting scalar fields of dilaton or axion types or when coupled to Maxwell electrodynamics or a Yang-Mills field. However, static field configurations in GR are heavily constrained outside the event horizon, as demonstrated by the no-hair theorems. For a simple minimally coupled self-interacting scalar field \phi, the contribution to the energy-momentum tensor is written as T^{\phi}_{\mu\nu}=\partial_{\mu}\phi\partial_{\nu}\phi-g_{\mu\nu}\Bigg{[}\frac% {1}{2}g^{\alpha\beta}\partial_{\alpha}\phi\partial_{\beta}\phi-V(\phi)\Bigg{]}. (1) V(\phi) is the self-interaction of the scalar field. The scalar field profile is imposed upon by a requirement that an r\rightarrow\infty limit should generate a constant value of the scalar field \phi(r) (one can choose to normalize this constant value to zero). Alongwith this, a requirement of asymptotic flatness dictates that the self-interaction potential should have a local extremum at the origin of the scalar field. In fact, we can use these conditions to demonstrate the no-hair theorem starting from the scalar field evolution equation \partial_{\mu}\sqrt{-g}g^{\mu\nu}\partial_{\nu}\phi=\sqrt{-g}\frac{dV}{d\phi}. (2) For a static case, only the g^{rr} term contributes to the above equation. We multiply the equation with \phi(r) and do integration by parts from the horizon to infinity, yielding: \left[\phi g^{rr}\sqrt{-g}\partial_{r}\phi\right]_{h}^{\infty}-\int_{h}^{% \infty}dr\sqrt{-g}g^{rr}\left(\partial_{r}\phi\right)^{2}=\int_{h}^{\infty}dr% \sqrt{-g}\phi\frac{dV}{d\phi}. (3) Usually, one realizes a horizon h at the largest zero of g^{rr}. Thus in principle it is possible to integrate the above equation for all g^{rr}\geq 0. If we assume regularity of \phi and \sqrt{-g} at the horizon, then the boundary terms can be dropped (also keeping in mind an asymptotic fall-off of \phi(r) as r\rightarrow\infty). In this context, the condition \phi\frac{dV}{d\phi}\geq 0 for all r\geq h essentially implies that the self-interaction potential has a local minimum at \phi=0 and no local maximum in the \phi-range considered outside the horizon. Under this condition, the integrands on both sides of the above equation are clearly non-negative. However, the integral on LHS brings in a negative sign, and for consistency, one must require that both sides of the equation should vanish identically. Thus, the scalar field remains at \phi(r)=\phi_{0}=0, its asymptotic value and the resulting metric solution simply generates a Schwarzschild metric. This effectively rules out non-trivial scalar deformations of the Schwarzschild metric within a limit. The scalar no-hair theorem demonstrated is now a popular avenue of research [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]; however, there remains a curiosity if one can solve a system of static scalar field embedded within GR and weaken this constraint, even if slightly. There are two further arguments which can provide strong impetus behind the curious case of a scalar field coupled to GR. The first argument is a motivation related to the study of cosmic expansion. In a spatially homogeneous cosmological universe, there is an omnipresent requirement of an entity beyond standard matter capable of accommodating the idea of an accelerated expansion [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. A scalar field with a suitably chosen interaction profile has served as the most popular candidate in this pursuit [16, 17]. The present scope of simple scalar field cosmological models appears to be quite bleak in light of the steep fifth force constraints on the baryon-quintessence interaction profile [18]; nevertheless, scalar fields remain capable of generating solutions of considerable interest. As a specific example, one can cite the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson (pNGB) model [19] as well as the models where a scalar field is capable of manipulating self-interaction via screening mechanisms [20, 21, 22]. The second argument is the requirement of a (grand) unified theory of natural interaction, which should exhibit two crucial components: an underlying Lagrangian formalism to generate the equations of motion and the necessary fundamental couplings. In practice, these couplings do not have any direct derivations, and therefore, they are treated as constant parameters somehow related to the characteristic scale of interaction. The idea of variation of these couplings was proposed by Dirac as the ‘Large Numbers hypothesis’ [23]. There have been quite a few attempts to successfully accommodate this hypothesis within a theory of gravity using interacting scalar fields; however, all of them are partially complete. One of the well-established attempts is the field-theoretic description allowing variations in the Newtonian gravitational constant, the Brans-Dicke (BD) theory [24, 25, 26]. In a BD theory, the scalar field is geometric (mass dimension two in natural units) and can be considered with or without any additional interaction. On the other hand, there are propositions of the theory of gravity accommodating the variation of \alpha=\frac{e^{2}}{\hbar c}, the fine structure constant. In such a theory, a scalar field interacts with the charged matter distribution of the universe and drives the variation of an e-field [27, 28]. Theories of this kind are usually associated with atleast a local violation of the equivalence principle, for example, a variation in electric charge e leads to a breakdown of local charge conservation [28]. There are quite a few attempts found in the literature to reproduce such variations within GR [29, 30] and overall, it is difficult to rule out the possibility of a common background mechanism that controls all such variation, although this has never been proved theoretically or experimentally. Intuitively, it can be a way forward to explore the features of a scalar field that can describe a variation in any of the fundamental couplings. Such a scalar field can not be termed exotic as it has some motivations from fundamental interactions other than gravity. In this article, we work with a lagrangian where a minimally coupled self-interacting scalar field is capable of inducing spontaneous symmetry breaking. The self-interaction of the scalar field can be compared to a Higgs-like field with a small adjustment in the quadratic term, V(\phi)=V_{0}+M(\phi)\phi^{2}+\lambda\phi^{4}. (4) While one can consider \lambda as a dimension-less parameter of the theory, M(\phi) can lead to an evolving Higgs VEV \nu, calculated as \frac{\partial V}{\partial\phi}\bigg{\rvert}_{\nu}=0~{}~{},~{}~{}\nu=\sqrt{% \frac{-2M(r)}{\lambda}}. (5) It is to be noted that \phi need not necessarily be the standard model Higgs. We can imagine the standard model Higgs \varphi having two components, the Higgs particle h alongwith a classical background field \phi, with a corresponding Lagrangian given by L=-\frac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}\varphi\partial^{\mu}\varphi-\frac{\lambda}{4}(% \varphi^{2}-\nu^{2})^{2}~{}~{},~{}~{}\varphi=\nu_{0}+\phi+h=\nu(\phi)+h. (6) Due to this construction, the Higgs VEV \nu can exhibit an evolution as a function of the classical field \phi. This variation plays an important role in the electroweak theory of interactions, where the Higgs boson is thought to be the mass generator of quarks. There is a linear correlation between the quark mass and Higgs VEV, m_{e,q}=\lambda_{e,q}\nu, where \lambda_{e,q} is the Yukawa coupling [31, 32, 33, 34]. While the quark masses are directly proportional, the VEV contribution to proton mass m_{p} can be neglected since it depends primarily on the scale of quark-gluon interaction. As a consequence, any pre-assigned variation in VEV results in a variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio \mu, which is directly measurable through the observation of molecular absorption spectra [35, 36, 37, 38]. In this manuscript, we present a new exact spherically symmetric static solution of the Einstein field equation coupled with a self-interacting scalar field. The self-interaction of the scalar field is in the form written in Eq. 4. The static solution has no zero proper volume singularity at r=0. The curvature scalars are also non-singular for all coordinate ranges. We study the behavior of radial null geodesics for this solution and explain that depending on the regions of parameter space under consideration, the solution can describe a two-way or a one-way traversable Wormhole. There is no Schwarzschild limit to this solution. The scalar field behaves as a constant in the asymptotic limit and exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking within the coordinate range associated with the formation of a wormhole throat. In other words, spontaneous symmetry breaking can be viewed as a threshold for the formation of a wormhole throat. Furthermore, we calculate the radius of the photon sphere, Lyapunov exponent, shadow radius, and innermost stable circular orbits for this spacetime and discuss their nature."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09233v1,Angle of Null Energy Condition Lines in Critical Spacetimes,"We identify a new critical parameter in Choptuik’s gravitational collapse: the angle at which null energy condition (NEC) saturation lines intersect at the center of the critical spacetime. These NEC lines coincide with regions of vanishing curvature, dividing spacetime into stripes of positive and negative curvature. By numerically solving Choptuik’s original system we find the NEC angle to be \alpha\approx 0.64 (\approx 37^{\circ}) and analytically derive \alpha=2\,\textrm{arccot}(D-1) for any spacetime dimension D>3.","Black holes have paradoxical properties — once they have settled down to a stationary state, they are the simplest macroscopic objects that one could imagine since, classically, all their properties are determined by a handful of numbers, including their mass and angular momentum (see, e.g., [1]). Non-stationary situations like the collapse or evaporation of black holes are vastly more complicated (see [2] and Refs. therein). In this work, we focus on the spherically symmetric collapse of matter to a black hole. Critical collapse, discovered numerically by Choptuik [3] for four-dimensional (4D) spherically symmetric general relativity minimally coupled to a massless scalar field [4], is characterized by two critical parameters (further explicated below): the universal exponent \gamma that governs various power-law scalings, and the echoing period \Delta of the critical solution at the threshold of black hole formation. In 4D, Choptuik found \gamma\approx 0.37 and \Delta\approx 3.44. There is no known way to derive these two numbers from first principles without numerically solving a system of coupled non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Our Letter aims to provide a third universal number that characterizes the critical solution, the NEC angle \alpha\approx 0.64, to be defined below, and to calculate it from first principles in arbitrary spacetime dimensions D>3. Our main result is \alpha=2\,\textrm{arccot}(D-1)\,. (1)"
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09202v1,A new rotating Lorentzian wormhole spacetime,"A rotating version of a known static, spherically symmetric, zero Ricci scalar Lorentzian wormhole is constructed. It turns out that for this given non-rotating geometry, the standard Newman-Janis algorithm does not produce a rotating wormhole and, therefore, the method pioneered by Azreg-Aïnou has to be used. The rotating spacetime thus obtained is shown to be regular with wormhole features, though it is no longer a R=0 spacetime. The required matter is found to violate the energy conditions, as expected. A few other characteristic properties of this new rotating spacetime are mentioned. Finally, we calculate the shadow for this geometry and discuss its features vis-a-vis the Kerr geometry and available EHT observations.","Lorentzian wormholes have been around for quite a long time now. They are theoretical constructs in theories of gravity and have attracted interest because of various reasons. Among them the prominent ones are (a) their existence versus the violation of energy conditions, (b) the curious possibility of using them to build time machine models, (c) their role as black hole mimickers especially in the context of gravitational wave observations, (d) their support for alternative theories of gravity and (e) their relevance in issues related to quantum information. The original wormhole idea goes back to the work of Flamm in 1916 Flamn and then Einstein-Rosen in 1935 Einstein . The term ‘wormhole’ was coined by Wheeler while discussing ‘geons’ Wheeler . A resurgence happened in 1988 through the seminal papers by Morris, Thorne and Morris, Thorne, Yurtsever Morris1 ; Morris2 . Subsequently, over the last three and a half decades, wormholery has been largely based on the Morris-Thorne work with later important inputs by Visser Visser . Most of the works on wormholes till date have revolved around static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. The first construction of a rotating wormhole was by Teo, in 1998 Teo . Since then there have been numerous other constructions too Kuhfittig ; Kashargin ; Dzhunushaliev ; Kleihaus . Using the rotating wormhole, researchers have carried out studies on various physical and observationally relevant aspects such as lensing, shadows as well as quasinormal modes Shaikh ; Jusufi ; Deligianni . The status of energy condition violation for the rotating spacetimes remain largely the same as for their non-rotating counterparts. Though briefly mentioned first in havas , it was realised in 2002 that imposing only the R=0 constraint on a general, static spherically symmetric line element results in a non-vacuum two parameter spacetime different from the vacuum Schwarzschild nkdsk . This spacetime, known as a R=0 wormhole spacetime was also noted as a solution in a braneworld context by Casadio et al, around the same time casadio . Much later, various features of this spacetime have been discussed by different authors – these include the non-violation of energy conditions for these spacetimes in a braneworld gravity model, quasinormal modes etc skslssg ; Aneesh ; IbScSs ; Sarkar ; RsSk1 ; RsSk2 ; IcSbSc . However, the standard Newman-Janis procedure for finding a rotating version of this line element does not quite produce a wormhole, as we will see later in this article. Hence, a rotating generalisation remained an unresolved issue. In this paper, we intend to resolve this issue and construct a rotating version of this R=0 spacetime, which does represent a wormhole. The geometry of this new spacetime, the matter required as well as the shadow structure will be explored in detail. Our paper is organised as follows. In Section II, we review the static, spherically symmetric R=0 spacetime. Section III first points out why the standard route of obtaining the rotating version did not work and then constructs the rotating generalisation using a different method. In Section IV, we focus on some of the physical properties of the new line element. Shadows of the new line element and matching with EHT observations are discussed in Section V. Finally, we present our conclusions in Section VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09193v1,Birkhoff’s Theorem and Uniqueness: A Peak Beyond General Relativity,"In General Relativity, Birkhoff’s theorem asserts that any spherically symmetric vacuum solution must be static and asymptotically flat. In this paper, we study the validity of Birkhoff’s theorem for a broad class of modified gravity theories in four spacetime dimensions, including quadratic and higher-order gravity models. We demonstrate that the Schwarzschild spacetime remains the unique Einstein branch solution outside any spherically symmetric configuration of these theories. Consequently, unlike black holes, the breakdown of junction conditions at the surface of the star further implies that the actual spacetime metric outside a horizonless star in these modified theories cannot simultaneously be spherically symmetric and remain within the Einstein branch. This insight offers a unique observational probe for theories beyond General Relativity.","Even after a century of its inception, Einstein’s theory of General Relativity (GR) remains the most successful classical framework for describing gravitational phenomena across a vast range of length scales. The predictions of GR have been extensively validated using both classical tests and modern observations — spanning over solar system tests to the unprecedented precision offered by cosmological surveys Will (2014). Lately, these tests involve the state-of-the-art gravitational wave detections by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration Abbott et al. (2016a, b, c, 2023, 2021); Cahillane and Mansell (2022) and shadow observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration Akiyama et al. (2019); Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (2022). In light of these remarkable developments, significant efforts have been put to investigate possible deviations from GR solutions, particularly from the Schwarzschild paradigm, which has been widely used in both classical and modern tests of GR to model spacetime outside spherically symmetric objects when rotational effects are negligible Will (2014). These investigations are critical as they probe the limits of GR and explore the potential for new physics in extreme gravity environments where deviations from standard GR solutions might become detectable. The wide-ranging applications of the Schwarzschild metric are primarily supported by two important facts. Firstly, understanding a spherically symmetric solution like Schwarzschild provides valuable input for finding more realistic rotating solutions. Indeed, there exist well-defined techniques, such as the Newman-Janis algorithm Newman and Janis (1965), to construct rotating solutions from spherically symmetric ones. Secondly, one of the most important results in GR, namely Birkhoff’s theorem, establishes the uniqueness of Schwarzschild solution outside a spherically symmetric object Jebsen (1921); Birkhoff and Langer (1923). In addition to its foundational role, Birkhoff’s theorem has profound observational consequences. For example, along with the regularity of the spacetime at the centre, it implies that the metric inside an empty spherical cavity must be the Minkowski. Moreover, Birkhoff’s theorem claims the absence of time-dependent vacuum solutions outside a star due to its spherical pulsations. Hence, such pulsations cannot alter the exterior metric from that of Schwarzschild, thereby producing no gravitational radiation. Over the years, several generalizations of this novel theorem have extended its domain of applicability. The usual proof of Birkhoff’s theorem in GR requires that the metric be at least twice continuously differentiable (C^{2}) for calculating the Ricci tensor. However, the theorem is also applicable under a weaker assumption of continuous and piecewise differentiability of the metric Bergmann et al. (1965). The validity of the theorem has also been extended to include electromagnetic fields, for which Reissner-Nordström is the unique spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations D’Inverno (1992). More generalizations of Birkhoff’s theorem involve the inclusion of cosmological constant Schleich and Witt (2010), as well as extensions to lower and higher spacetime dimensions Kiem (1994); Schmidt (1997); Bronnikov and Melnikov (1995); Ayon-Beato et al. (2004); Keresztes and Gergely (2008) and mild perturbations away from exact spherical symmetry and vacuum Goswami and Ellis (2011, 2012). Since Birkhoff’s theorem is a direct consequence of GR field equations, its applicability in the modified gravity landscape is not generally guaranteed. However, the importance of carefully assessing its validity in beyond-GR theories can hardly be exaggerated. In fact, there are strong theoretical and observational reasons to believe that GR might receive higher curvature corrections Penrose (1965); Donoghue (1994); Wald (1997); Peebles and Ratra (2003); Bertone et al. (2005); Clifton et al. (2012); Barack et al. (2019), which becomes particularly important in strong-field regimes Berti et al. (2015); Berti (2019). Thus, it is both interesting and important to study the status of various novel results of GR, like Birkhoff’s theorem, within the framework of these modified theories. Such studies can provide insights into potential universal features of the beyond-GR landscape. Motivated by these considerations, Birkhoff’s theorem has already been extended to Lovelock gravity Zegers (2005); Deser and Franklin (2005), and more generally quasi-topological gravity Oliva and Ray (2011); Cisterna et al. (2017); Oliva and Ray (2010); Bueno et al. (2024) in D>4 dimensions. Additionally, Birkhoff’s theorem has been explored in the context of scalar-tensor theories Faraoni (2010), Einstein-æther theory Chan et al. (2024) and Horava-Lifshitz gravity Devecioglu and Park (2019). It is also known to hold in f(R) gravity under certain conditions Capozziello and Saez-Gomez (2012); Ravindranath et al. (2018); Nzioki et al. (2014). However, a comprehensive approach to extend its validity to other modified theories is still lacking. In this work, we aim to bridge this crucial gap for the first time by establishing Birkhoff’s theorem for a wide class of beyond-GR theories in 4-dimensions (4D). The Lagrangians of these theories involve both Ricci scalar and Ricci tensor invariants, which will be discussed in more detail in the subsequent sections. Unlike in GR, such modified theories lead to multiple branches of solutions, which may be either analytic or non-analytic functions of higher curvature coupling constants. However, the remarkable observational agreement with GR strongly suggests that only the Einstein branch is astrophysically relevant. The solutions in this branch are smoothly connected to GR in the limit of vanishing coupling constants. In other words, all geometrical quantities (such as metric components and curvatures) can be written as a linear combination of analytical terms in couplings. Furthermore, stationary BHs in the Einstein branch are promising thermodynamic candidates beyond GR, as they have been shown to satisfy the zeroth law Ghosh and Sarkar (2020); Bhattacharyya et al. (2022). These novel properties motivate us to explore the extension of Birkhoff’s theorem within the Einstein branch of a class of modified theories discussed below. In particular, we shall show that Schwarzschild solution remains the unique vacuum solution outside spherically symmetric objects in the Einstein branch of these theories. Similar to the case of GR, the staticity and asymptotic flatness of the exterior spacetime follow from the spherical symmetry. We shall also discuss several important implications of this result, which are of utmost observational relevance. For instance, we shall argue that as a direct consequence of this powerful theorem, the actual spacetime metric outside a horizonless star in the theories under consideration cannot be both spherically symmetric and remain within the Einstein branch due to the failure of junction conditions at the surface of the star Khakshournia and Mansouri (2023). In other words, unlike GR, the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric star in these theories must deviate from the Einstein branch. This deviation, in turn, provides a novel observational probe into the nature of beyond-GR theories. Throughout this work, we shall set G=c=1. We begin our analysis with quadratic gravity (QG) in Sect.II as a warm-up, which we then generalize to more comprehensive beyond-QG theories in Sect. III. Finally, we conclude in Sect. IV by outlining potential future generalizations of our findings."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09147v2,Post-Newtonian templates for phase evolution of spherical extreme mass ratio inspirals,"We present various post-Newtonian (PN) models for the phase evolution of compact objects moving along quasi-spherical orbits in Kerr spacetime derived by using the 12PN analytic formulas of the energy, angular momentum and their averaged rates of change calculated in the framework of the black hole perturbation theory. To examine the convergence of time-domain PN models (TaylorT families), we evaluate the dephasing between approximants with different PN orders. We found that the TaylorT1 model shows the best performance and the performance of the TaylorT2 is the next best. To evaluate the convergence of frequency-domain PN models (TaylorF families), we evaluate the mismatch between approximants with different orders. We found that the performance of the TaylorF2 model is comparable with the TaylorT2 model. Although the TaylorT2 and TaylorF2 models are not so accurate as the TaylorT1, the fully analytical expressions give us easy-to-handle templates and are useful to discuss effects beyond general relativity.","Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are important targets of space-borne gravitational wave (GW) detectors, like Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) [1], TianQin [2], and Taiji [3]. An EMRI consists of a compact object orbiting and plunging into a massive black hole, which is expected to exist in the center of galactic nuclei. Before plunging into the central black hole, the object emits GWs including a huge number of cycles. The observation and data analysis of the GWs allow us to measure the intrinsic parameters of the EMRI system precisely and will provide insights into the theory of gravity, the physics and astrophysics of black holes [4, 5, 6]. Matched filtering is one of promising techniques to analyze the observed GWs and extract the physical information from signals emitted by EMRIs accurately and efficiently. This technique requires waveform templates representing the real signals from EMRIs accurately. The GW templates of EMRIs are often calculated by black hole perturbation theory because the extreme mass ratio is suitable for the small parameter in the perturbative expansion. In the context of black hole perturbation theory, an EMRI is modeled as a point mass moving in Kerr spacetime, and the GWs are represented by the gravitational perturbations induced by the point mass. The gravitational perturbations of Kerr black hole are described by the perturbations of the Newman-Penrose variables [7], which satisfy the Teukolsky equations [8, 9] with the source constructed from the energy-momentum tensor for the point mass. This means that we need to know the precise motion of the point mass to calculate the GWs accurately by solving the Teukolsky equation. In the test-mass limit, the motion is expressed by a geodesic in Kerr spacetime. Taking into account the self-interaction with the own gravitational field, however, a deviation of the mass’ motion from the geodesic arises. This can be interpreted as the “self-force” (see Refs. [10, 11] and the references therein) effect. The dominant contribution of the gravitational self-force to the mass’ motion is the time-averaged dissipative piece at the first order of the mass ratio, which induces the losses of the energy and angular momentum of the point mass and drives the gradual inspiral into the central black hole. The dissipative effect is most noticeable on the orbital phase and therefore the GW phase. A phase difference of O(1) significantly reduces the overlap between an observed signal and the corresponding template, and leads to failure of the detection or the accurate estimation of the physical parameters. Therefore, it is important to calculate the time-averaged dissipative self-force at high precision. The time-averaged dissipative self-force can be rewritten in the secular changes of three orbital parameters, the energy, azimuthal angular momentum, and Carter parameter of the point mass. There are several works on calculating the rates of the secular change in both numerical and analytical approaches based on the black hole perturbation theory. The state-of-the-art studies on the numerical approach can provide the data of the secular evolution for general bound orbits in Kerr spacetime [12, 13, 14, 15]. Since the numerical calculation costs a lot of computational resources, however, the use of combination with the analytical approach is expected to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency. There have been several efforts in analytically calculating the secular evolution of the orbital parameters since the 1990s (see Ref. [16, 17] and the references therein). The post-Newtonian (PN) formulas of the secular evolution for general bound orbits are presented in our previous works [18, 19, 20]. The recent advances in computers have made it possible to extend the analytical calculation to the higher PN order. Several works on calculating the higher PN corrections have been done in Refs. [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. In this work, we focus on the secular evolution of orbits off equatorial plane in Kerr spacetime, which has attracted less attention in the study of the analytic calculation of the self-force so far. As the first step, we consider the evolution of a spherical orbit, which is an orbit with a constant radius on a plane precessing around the rotation axis of the central black hole. We calculate the 12PN formulas for the secular change of orbital parameters for spherical orbits with arbitrary inclination angle, through the procedure based on the adiabatic approximation proposed in Refs. [19, 20] 111In Refs. [19, 20], the PN and eccentricity-expanded formulas for generic bound orbits not only spherical orbits are presented. Since the higher PN calculation with finite eccentricity requires significantly more cost than the non-eccentric orbit case, however, we restrict the calculation to the spherical orbit case in this work.. To study the convergence of the PN formulas and the impact of the higher corrections on the accuracy of the gravitational waveform, we derive the PN templates of the phase evolution, the time-domain, TaylorT and frequency-domain, TaylorF models [27, 28], for quasi-spherical orbits. Although the TaylorT and TaylorF templates in the context of the black hole perturbation theory have been derived in Ref. [29], the work is restricted to the circular orbit case in Schwarzschild spacetime in exchange for the remarkably high, 22PN order. This work presents the extension into the spherical orbit case in Kerr spacetime, and we investigate how the convergence of the PN formulas is influenced by the orbital inclination and the spin of the central black hole. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly review the spherical orbit in Kerr spacetime and its secular evolution driven by the dissipation due to the gravitational radiation. In Sec. III, we present the TaylorT and TaylorF models derived in a similar manner to Ref. [29]. In addition, we propose alternative choices of the TaylorT1 and TaylorT4 templates, which appear because of increasing the number of orbital parameters. In Sec. IV, we examine the performance of the Taylor models for several sets of the orbital inclination and the black hole spin. In Sec. V, we summarize our results. In Appendices A–I, we present the explicit expressions of the PN coefficients of the orbital energy and angular momentum, their time averaged rates of change, the TaylorT and TaylorF templates, up to the 4.5PN order. Throughout this paper, we adopt the geometrized units with c=G=1 and metric signature (-+++), and the Kerr metric is described in the Boyer–Lindquist coordinates (t,r,\theta,\varphi)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09032v1,Proca stars in excited states,"In this paper we consider families of solutions for excited states of Proca stars in spherical symmetry. We focus on the first two excited configurations and perform a series of fully non-linear dynamical simulations in order to study their properties and stability. Our analysis reveals that excited Proca stars are always unstable against even very small perturbations, and their dynamical evolution can lead to three different final states: collapse to a black hole, dissipation, or migration to a different configuration in the ground state. We find that migration to the ground state can only occur in a small region of the parameter space of solutions with negative binding energy.","Exotic stars are hypothetical self-gravitating compact objects composed of different types of exotic matter. One particular type of exotic compact object (ECO) are the bosonic solitons, which represent stationary solutions of the Einstein field equations minimally coupled to massive, scalar or vector, complex fields. The scalar case corresponds to the usual boson stars [1, 2], while the vector case corresponds to the so-called Proca stars [3]; these models are commonly referred to as bosonic stars. In addition to bosonic stars, there are also Dirac stars [4] composed of complex spinor fields, further expanding the array of potential ECOs proposed in the literature. For a comparative analysis and review of these types of objects see for example [5, 6]. ECOs are theorized to be detectable due to their gravitational interactions with surrounding matter. This detection has the potential to offer valuable insights into the nature of the dark sector of the Universe, in particular serving as a promising environment for identifying the nature of dark matter (DM). Indeed, bosonic fields are considered viable candidates for dark matter due to their ability to clump together and form compact objects. Depending on the value of the mass parameter of the bosonic field, these objects can be considered as massive compact objects in galactic halos (MACHO’s), or can even acquire galactic scales in the case of ultralight masses [7, 8, 9]. These objects can also exhibit characteristics that mimic black holes [10], serve as potential sources of dark matter, and manifest in a variety of other phenomena [11]. One extensively studied scenario involves investigating whether these bosonic fields could undergo accretion inside stars, leading to the formation of stable configurations with observable effects. For a more detailed discussion we direct the reader to [12]. In this work we shall focus on Proca stars, that is spherically-symmetric self-gravitating configurations of a complex massive vector field (the Proca field) in four spacetime dimensions, and carrying a conserved Noether charge Q associated with a global U(1) symmetry. The first such self-gravitating solutions composed of massive spin-1 particles were reported in [3]. Numerical dynamical evolutions of these configurations have been performed in [13, 14], studying their stability and the various different phenomena that occur under perturbations of the Proca field in the ground state. Additionally, Proca stars have been set up in different astrophysical scenarios, such as those with rotation [15], charge [16], or more generalized models [17]. The primary objective of this work is to shed new light on the properties Proca stars in excited states, and in particular their stability under perturbations. This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we present the Einstein–Proca system. In Section III we derive the spherically symmetric field equations for the stationary configurations corresponding to Proca stars and also discuss the total mass, total bosonic charge, and binding energy of the system, as well as the boundary conditions and the numerical methods that we have used. Section IV presents our results for the families of stationary configurations in the first two excited states, as well as the resuts of their dynamical evolutions under perturbations. We conclude in Section V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09024v1,Geometrical-optics analysis of the interaction between light and gravitational waves from binaries,"We consider a situation in which light emitted from the neighborhood of a binary interacts with gravitational waves from the binary (e.g., a supermassive black hole binary in a quasar, a binary pulsar, etc.). The effect is cumulative over the long path lengths of light propagation and might be appreciable if the interaction initially takes place close to the source of gravitational waves, where the strain amplitude can be large. This situation can be modeled effectively using spherical gravitational waves (i.e., transverse-traceless radially propagating waves), with the strain amplitude varying with the distance from the source to a field point where the two wavefronts of light and gravitational waves meet each other. Our analysis employs geometrical-optics methods in curved spacetime, where the curvature is due to gravitational waves propagating in a flat spacetime background. We place a particular focus on the effect of gravitational Faraday rotation (or Skrotskii/Rytov effect) resulting from the interaction between light and gravitational waves from binaries.","Astronomers use light, i.e., electromagnetic waves (EMWs), to make observations of a wide variety of astrophysical events. Among others, recently, light has been used as a major tool to detect gravitational waves (GWs), due to its prominent property – interaction with other kinds of waves; e.g., the property is exploited by the detection schemes via laser interferometers – LIGO, VIRGO, GEO600, KAGRA, LIGO-India, eLISA, etc. PhysRevLett.116.061102 ; Grote_2010 ; Somiya_2012 ; LIGO-India_2011 ; amaroseoane_2012 and via pulsar timing arrays – EPTA, PPTA, IPTA, SKA, etc. Kramer_2013 ; Hobbs_2013 ; Manchester_2013 ; Dewdney_2009 . Two massive objects orbiting each other (e.g., a black hole (BH) binary, a neutron star (NS) binary, a BH-NS binary, etc.) generate GWs, which propagate radially in all directions, with the energy of GWs decreasing over the distance from the source. However, when reaching a distant observer (like ones located at those aforementioned detectors), the energy of GWs decreases considerably, and the (strain) amplitude is usually treated as an extremely small constant value; therefore, the effects on EMWs due to GWs are extremely small too, of the same order as the strain amplitude. In case light is emitted from the neighborhood of a binary (e.g., a supermassive BH binary in a quasar, a binary pulsar, etc.) at the same time GWs are emitted from the binary, the EMWs interact with the GWs all along the propagation path towards an observer. Here the strain amplitude varies with the distance from the binary source to a field point of GWs, where the two wavefronts of EMWs and GWs cross each other. A number of studies have been published in the context of the interaction between EMWs and plane GWs. Among others, Halilsoy and Gurtug Halilsoy_2007 analyzed the Faraday rotation in the polarization vector of a linearly polarized electromagnetic shock wave upon encountering with GWs. Hacyan Hacyan_2012 ; Hacyan_2016 determined the influence of a GW on the elliptic polarization of light, deducing the rotation of the polarization angle and the corresponding Stokes parameters, and applied this effect to the detection of GWs, as a complement to the pulsar timing method. Cabral and Lobo Cabral_2017 obtained electromagnetic field oscillations induced by GWs, and found that these lead to the presence of longitudinal modes and dynamical polarization patterns of electromagnetic radiation. Park and Kim Park_2021 employed the perturbation theory of general relativity to analyze the influence of GWs on EMWs, concentrating mainly on the effects on the polarization of light, and applied their analysis to the observation of GWs by means of Stokes parameters. Kim and Park Kim_2021 investigated how light is perturbed in the presence of GWs from a general relativistic perspective, by solving Maxwell’s equations in the geometrical-optics limit. In the aforementioned works, the interaction between EMWs and GWs is assumed to take place far away from the source of GWs; therefore, the strain amplitude of GWs can be treated as an extremely small constant value. In contrast with them, Cruise Cruise_1983 estimated the rotation angle of the plane of polarization of an EMW, which results from the passage of the wave through a non-flat spacetime with a GW present. Here the EMW-GW interaction can occur close to the GW source and continue all along the EMW propagation path towards an observer. In this case, the strain amplitude can be initially large and decreases inversely as the distance from the source to a point of EMW-GW intersection; as a result, the cumulative effect from EMW-GW interaction over the long propagation path can be outstanding in comparison with all the aforementioned cases, in which EMWs interact with plane GWs. However, despite a fresh perspective on the problem, Cruise Cruise_1983 overlooked some other important aspects: the spherical property of the GW, i.e., the dependence of the wave’s amplitude and phase on \left(r,\theta,\phi\right) in spherical polar coordinates, and its influence on EMW-GW interaction.111Instead, the GW is modeled in a cylindrical form. Besides, he used several simplifying assumptions, with which to make his analysis easier, and this inevitably led to some loss of generality in his approach. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between EMWs and GWs, and its effects on the properties of light, in a situation where light emitted from the neighborhood of a binary meets GWs from the binary all along the way to an observer. To this end, the paper proceeds largely in two steps as follows. In Sect. 2, we will model the situation effectively using spherical GWs,222To be precise, ‘spherical GWs’ refers to ‘transverse-traceless radially propagating GWs’, as will be clarified in Sect. 2.1, but we will use this term instead for convenience later. and perform a geometrical-optics analysis in curved spacetime, with the curvature being due to the GWs propagating in flat spacetime. In Sect. 3, for application of our analysis, we will focus in particular on the effect of gravitational Faraday rotation (or Skrotskii/Rytov effect), resulting from the interaction between EMWs and GWs from binaries, such as a supermassive BH binary in quasar and a double NS system."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09014v1,Massive Fields Affected by Echoes: New Physics vs. Astrophysical Environment,"Unlike the perturbations of massless fields, the asymptotic tails of massive fields exhibit oscillations and decay slowly, following a power-law envelope. In this work, considering various scenarios admitting (either fundamental or effective) massive scalar and gravitational fields, we demonstrate that bump deformations in the effective potential, either in the near-horizon or far-field regions, modify these asymptotic oscillatory tails. Specifically, the power-law envelope transitions to a more complex oscillatory pattern, which cannot be easily fitted to a simple formula. This behavior is qualitatively different from the echoes of massless fields, which appear mainly during the quasinormal ringing stage and are considerably suppressed at the asymptotic tails. We show that in some models echoes may considerably amplify the signal at the stage of asymptotic tails.","Echoes are modifications of a signal at late times stipulated by the secondary scatterings of the wave from additional maxima of the effective potential Cardoso et al. (2016a); Cardoso and Pani (2017); Barausse et al. (2014). While echoes of massless fields have been studied in a great number publications (see, for instance, Cardoso et al. (2016a); Cardoso and Pani (2017); Barausse et al. (2014); Huang et al. (2022); Konoplya et al. (2019); Abedi et al. (2017); Mark et al. (2017); Wang et al. (2020); Bronnikov and Konoplya (2020); Bueno et al. (2018); Churilova et al. (2021); Guo et al. (2022); Churilova and Stuchlik (2020); Li and Piao (2019); Buoninfante (2020); Liu et al. (2021); Chowdhury et al. (2022); Yang et al. (2024a); Shen et al. (2024); Yang et al. (2024b) and references therein), echoes in the massive gravity, to the best of our knowledge, were discussed only in Dong and Stojkovic (2021) where no effects for effectively massive fields were reported. However, the time-domain profiles for the Kaluza-Klein gravitational degrees of freedom in the braneworld scenario have been recently obtained in Tan et al. (2024). At the same time, there are several motivations to study the evolution of perturbations in massive fields. Firstly, fields that are initially massless may acquire an effective mass term due to the influence of tidal forces in brane-world models and other extra-dimensional scenarios Seahra et al. (2005); Ishihara et al. (2008), or in the presence of a magnetic field Konoplya and Fontana (2008); Konoplya (2008); Wu and Xu (2015). Additionally, massive gravitons and other massive particles are expected to contribute to long-wavelength gravitational waves Konoplya and Zhidenko (2024a), which are currently being investigated through Pulsar Timing Array observations Afzal et al. (2023). The quasinormal modes of massive fields differ qualitatively from those of massless fields, particularly due to the strong suppression of the damping rate. In some cases, this leads to the existence of arbitrarily long-lived modes, known as quasi-resonances, within the spectrum Ohashi and Sakagami (2004); Konoplya and Zhidenko (2005, 2006); Zhidenko (2006). Moreover, the asymptotic tails of massive fields exhibit distinct behavior, as they do not decay according to the power-law characteristic of massless fields. Instead, they oscillate and decay slowly with a power-law envelope (see the review in Konoplya and Zhidenko (2011)). In this work, we address a gap in the literature by studying echoes in massive fields. To this end, we consider three different models: the simplest massive scalar field in a Schwarzschild background, the squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole, and a wormhole mimicking the Schwarzschild solution Damour and Solodukhin (2007). In the first two models, echoes are induced by a deformation in the effective potential, creating a bump. In contrast, the third model features a double-well potential, producing echoes without the need for an additional bump. We have demonstrated that echoes in massive fields are markedly different from those in massless fields. Specifically, when the bump is localised in the far zone, they affect the signal more during the asymptotic tail stage, leading to the oscillation of the power law envelope. The near-horizon bumps, one the contrary, induce the distinctive echoes effects in some cases at the earlier stage of quasinormal ringing. Given the slow decay of the asymptotic tails in massive fields, this enhances the significance of echoes in such fields. The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we examine the echoes of a massive scalar field in a Schwarzschild background, focusing on cases where the effective potential has a bump both at a distance and near the horizon. In Section III, we analyze the echoes of gravitational perturbations (effectively massive) around squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes. Section IV is dedicated to the study of echoes of massive fields around the Schwarzschild-like wormhole."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08985v1,Dipoles and chains of solitons in the Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model,"We construct static axisymmetric multisolitons in the Einstein-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. This theory features a complex scalar field which gains mass through its interaction with a real scalar field that has a non-zero vacuum expectation value. By performing three-dimensional numerical relativity simulations, we identify stable dipolar boson stars in specific regions of the parameter space. Based on the dipole results, non-rotating odd parity chains with and without gravity can also be constructed when the mass of the real scalar field is sufficiently small. However, chains beyond the dipole case are found to be unstable.","The investigation of self-gravitating scalar field configurations in 3 dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime has garnered significant interest in recent decades, primarily due to the fundamental role scalar fields play in models of dark matter, inflation and early Universe evolution. Scalar fields can lead to gravitational collapse, forming localized gravitating objects such as boson stars Kaup (1968); Ruffini and Bonazzola (1969)—compact, stationary and horizonless configurations where the scalar field exhibits harmonic time dependence. Beyond boson stars, flat space solitons, which are spatially localized field configurations, are widely studied across various fields of theoretical physics, including cosmology and quantum field theory. These solitons can be topological, stabilized by a conserved topological number, or non-topological, like Q-balls Rosen (1968); Friedberg et al. (1976); Coleman (1985), which arise in field models with continuous global symmetry and exhibit a stationary oscillating internal phase. Interestingly, certain gravitating solutions such as some particular models of boson stars, monopoles, and Skyrmions are closely related to their flat space counterparts, representing non-topological solitons or Q-balls, and exhibit intriguing dynamics when coupled with gravity. Q-balls can be realized in two scenarios, the single complex scalar field with a non-renormalizable self-interaction potential found by Coleman in the 80’s Coleman (1985) and the earlier two-component model found by Friedberg, Lee and Sirlin which contains a symmetry breaking potential Friedberg et al. (1976). The Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (FLS) model provides a compelling example of a renormalizable scalar field theory with natural interaction terms, where a complex scalar field gains mass through coupling with a real scalar field that acquires a finite vacuum expectation value via a symmetry-breaking potential. This interaction gives rise to Q-ball solutions, which emerge from the phase rotation of the complex scalar field. When coupled with gravity, these Q-balls manifest as boson stars. The FLS model has been studied in various contexts. In flat spacetime, it was shown that solutions exist even when the scalar potential vanishes, rendering the real scalar field massless Loiko et al. (2018). Additionally, axially symmetric spinning solutions with both even and odd parity were constructed in Loiko et al. (2018), and a U(1)-gauged generalization, which generates a dipolar magnetic field, was explored in Loiko and Shnir (2019). In Xie et al. (2024a), the superradiance of Q-balls in the FLS model was investigated, demonstrating the potential for amplifying incident waves. When coupled minimally with gravity, the FLS model has been studied in various scenarios. Boson stars in this theory were first constructed in Kunz et al. (2019), where spherical and spinning solutions were found to be connected to their flat spacetime counterparts. The spherical solutions were revisited in the U(1)-gauged case in Kunz et al. (2022) and further studied in de Sá et al. (2024) with a focus on their astrophysical signatures. In Herdeiro et al. (2023), a vector analogue of the FLS model was introduced to add self-interactions to the Proca model, avoiding hyperbolicity issues. Remarkably, the Einstein-FLS model also supports black hole solutions, as explored in Kunz et al. (2022); Kunz and Shnir (2023); Kunz et al. (2024). Einstein’s gravity, minimally coupled to free scalar fields, gives rise to families of static solutions beyond the spherical case, exhibiting rich structures. These are known as multipolar boson stars Herdeiro et al. (2021a). The simplest of these non-spherical configurations is the dipolar boson star Yoshida and Eriguchi (1997); Cunha et al. (2022), a two-center soliton in equilibrium due to the balance between gravitational attraction and repulsion caused by the phase difference in the odd-parity scalar field. However, this equilibrium is inherently unstable Sanchis-Gual et al. (2021), though self-interactions similar to the Coleman Q-ball scalar potential have been found to stabilize the dipole Ildefonso et al. (2023). Beyond the dipole, chains of solitons have also been studied Sun et al. (2023); Herdeiro et al. (2021a), including chains of rotating stars Gervalle (2022); Sun and Wang (2023) and self-interacting configurations Herdeiro et al. (2021b). Similar multipolar configurations have also been shown to form dynamically when initial components are prepared with opposite charges that swap over time Jaramillo and Zhou (2024); Copeland et al. (2014); Xie et al. (2021); Hou et al. (2022); Xie et al. (2024b). Additionally, dipolar boson stars have a close relation with recent constructions of equilibrium systems involving two black holes Herdeiro and Radu (2023a, b). Notably, chains of boson stars, including dipolar configurations, do not have a flat space limit. The Klein-Gordon field alone cannot support dipolar static equilibrium solutions, even with generic self-interactions, as the gravitational attraction needed for balance is absent (see Sec. 5.2 of Cunha et al. (2022) and Shnir (2021) for a detailed argument). In contrast, other theories, such as the Yang-Mills monopole-antimonopole Kleihaus and Kunz (2000), Skyrmions Krusch and Sutcliffe (2004), and others (reviewed in Shnir (2021)), do admit such solutions. Of particular interest are the even chains of spinning and charged Q-balls in the Maxwell-FLS model Loiko et al. (2021). The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the existence of Einstein-FLS dipolar solutions, explore their stability within a region of parameter space using full 3D nonlinear evolutions, and show that flat space non-rotating Q-chains can also be constructed in the standard FLS model. The paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we present the Einstein-FLS model, its equations, and the ansatz. In Sec. III, we construct the solutions and investigate their properties. The stability analysis of the dipolar solutions is addressed in Sec. IV, and in Sec. V, we construct static Q-dipoles, Q-chains and gravitating chains. We conclude with a discussion in Sec. VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08921v1,"The equilibrium configurations of neutron stars in the optimized f(R,T) gravity","We construct equilibrium configurations for neutron stars using a specific f(R,T) functional form, recently derived through gaussian process applied to measurements of the Hubble parameter. By construction, this functional form serves as an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration, circumventing the cosmological constant problem. Here, we aim to examine its applicability within the stellar regime. In doing so, we seek to contribute to the modified gravity literature by applying the same functional form of a given gravity theory across highly distinct regimes. Our results demonstrate that equilibrium configurations of neutron stars can be obtained within this theory, with the energy density and maximum mass slightly exceeding those predicted by General Relativity. Additionally, we show that the value of some parameters in the f(R,T) functional form must differ from those obtained in cosmological configurations, suggesting a potential scale-dependence for these parameters. We propose that further studies apply this functional form across different regimes to more thoroughly assess this possible dependence. Keywords: tov equation; neutron stars; modified gravity","Modified gravity is a highly active area of research in physics, as it has the potential to explain the cosmic acceleration without relying on the cosmological constant. The advantage of that is the evasion of the infamous cosmological constant problem, which is the tremendous discrepancy between the theoretically predicted and observed values of the vacuum energy density [1, 2, 3, 4]. The operational framework of modified gravity is outlined in the following. General Relativity field equations in the presence of the cosmological constant can be obtained from the variation of the following action S=\frac{1}{16\pi}\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}(R-2\Lambda)+\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\mathcal% {L}_{m}, (1) in which g is the metric determinant, R is the Ricci or curvature scalar, \Lambda is the cosmological constant, \mathcal{L}_{m} is the matter lagrangian density and natural units are assumed. Modified gravity (usually) neglects \Lambda and substitutes R by a function of it, namely, f(R), and even of other scalars. The variation of these augmented actions yields field equations with extra terms in comparison with General Relativity field equations, and those extra terms may be capable of explaining the cosmic acceleration in accordance with observations. Some successful examples of that are presented, e.g., in [5, 6, 7, 8]. The extra terms of the modified gravity field equations must be negligible in regimes where General Relativity is already probed. In other words, for a modified gravity theory to be acceptable, it must converge to the results of General Relativity in the regimes where the latter has already been experimentally validated. Some severe solar system constraints were put to modified gravity in [9, 10, 11]. It is an unpleasant current feature of modified gravity theory applications that usually there is no concern with the behaviour of a particular model in different regimes of application. That is, when one applies a particular modified gravity to a particular field of applications (equilibrium configurations of compact objects, solar system, galactic dynamics, structure formation, cosmological models etc.), there is usually no consideration of the outcomes obtained in the remaining applications. Let us exemplify such an argumentation in the following. In a paper by Capozziello and collaborators [12], the rotation curves of 15 low surface brightness galaxies were examined, showing no need for dark matter, in the f(R)=f_{0}R^{n} gravity, with f_{0} a constant that accounts for the correct units and n=3.5. Later, Faraoni showed that in order for the scalar field in the scalar-tensor version of R^{n} gravity to be non-tachyonic, one must have 1\leq n\leq 2 [13]. More dramatically, by writing n=1+\delta, the precession of the perihelion of Mercury yields \delta=(2.7\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-19} [14, 15, 16], a stringent limit often ignored in R^{n} gravity (check References [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], among others). Allemandi and Ruggiero have written a quite interesting paper in which they use gravitational redshift, light deflection, gravitational time-delay and geodesic precession to constrain different f(R) gravity models [25]. Remarkably, they obtained that the estimated values of the f(R) functional form parameters are orders of magnitude bigger than the values obtained in the cosmological framework. As one would expect, this is not a feature of f(R) gravity theory only. Exactly motivated by severe weak field constraints on f(R) theory that, as a matter of fact, rule out most of the suggested models [26, 27, 32, 28, 29, 30, 31], Harko and collaborators proposed the f(R,T) gravity theory [33], for which T is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The motivations to insert terms on T in the gravitational action will be provided next. For now, let us mention that the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation was derived for the first time for the f(R,T) gravity in [34]. The functional form chosen for f(R,T) was f(R,T)=R+2\lambda T, with constant \lambda, and such a constant presented different values - around one order of magnitude - when solutions were obtained for neutron stars and strange stars, being lower in the former case. Later, the same approach was applied to white dwarfs and a lower limit for \lambda was found, namely |\lambda|>3\times 10^{-4} [35]. The examples on the above regard are numerous and spread to several modified gravity theories. They point to an incoherence in the results of a given theory when applied to different regimes or to a hidden scale-dependence of these “constants”. It is the purpose of the present article to verify the neutron stars equilibrium configurations viability of a particular functional form of the f(R,T) gravity which is well succeeded, by construction, in the cosmological scenario. We will work with the functional form found by Fortunato et al. [36]. In [36], the f(R,T) functional form was constructed through gaussian process [37], that was applied through the use of a series of measurements of the Hubble parameter. The result obtained was f(T)=\alpha T^{2}+A\tanh[\lambda(T+T_{0})]+\beta T+\gamma. (2) More details on this result as well as the values obtained for the constants \alpha,A,\lambda,T_{0},\beta and \gamma will be given in the following. The article is organized as follows. In Section II we present the basis of the f(R,T) gravity. In Section III, we derive the TOV-like equation. In Section IV we present our results, which are obtained by particularizing f(T) as according to Eq.(2). Those are discussed in Section V, in which we also provide some perspectives for applications of (2)."

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09616v1,Non-Locality induces Isometry and Factorisation in Holography,"In holography, two manifestations of the black hole information paradox are given by the non-isometric nature of the bulk-boundary map and by the factorisation puzzle. By considering time-shifted microstates of the eternal black hole, we demonstrate that both these puzzles may be simultaneously resolved by taking into account non-local quantum corrections that correspond to wormholes arising from state averaging. This is achieved by showing, using a resolvent technique, that the resulting Hilbert space for an eternal black hole in Anti-de Sitter space is finite-dimensional with a discrete energy spectrum. The latter gives rise to a transition to a type I von Neumann algebra.","I Brief review of generalized TFD states From the perspective of the boundary theory which is an ordinary quantum theory without gravity, the TFD state (2) can be thought of as a split state Roos (1970); Buchholz (1974); Fewster (2016) satisfying \mathrm{Tr}(\rho_{\rm TFD}A_{L}B_{R})=\mathrm{Tr}_{L}(\rho_{L}A_{L})\,\mathrm{% Tr}_{R}(\rho_{R}B_{R})\,, (3) where \rho_{\rm TFD}=\left|\text{TFD}\right\rangle\langle{\text{TFD}}| is the TFD density matrix. \rho_{L/R} are density matrices, and A_{L},B_{R} are observables defined for the left and right system respectively. In this way the TFD state (2) can be thought of as the purification of a thermal state represented by the thermal density matrix \rho_{R}. From this perspective, the von Neumann entropy associated with \rho_{R} may also be interpreted as the entanglement entropy between the left and the right systems. The interpretation of the TFD state as a split state is a more precise restatement of the factorisation of the boundary Hilbert space. The ER=EPR proposal Maldacena and Susskind (2013); Van Raamsdonk (2010) provides a holographic bulk interpretation of the TFD state as the Hartle-Hawking wave function of a two-sided black hole, i.e. a wormhole in AdS Maldacena (2003). Consequently, the entanglement entropy associated with the reduced density matrix \rho_{R} is identified with the thermal entropy of the two-sided eternal black hole Verlinde (2020) S(\rho_{R})=-\mathrm{Tr}_{R}\,\rho_{R}\log(\rho_{R})=S_{\text{BH}}=\frac{A}{4G% _{N}}\,, (4) where A is the area of the black hole horizon. This implies that the thermal partition function Z(\beta) appearing in (2) corresponds to the Gibbons-Hawking partition function Gibbons and Hawking (1977). We note that this interpretation crucially relies on the fact that for any local quantum mechanical system, such as the boundary CFT, the split property is satisfied, and consequently reduced density matrices exist. However, the gravity theory in the bulk is manifestly non-local. Therefore the split property, which is a statement about locality, ceases to exist in the bulk Raju (2022). In particular, this implies that density matrices associated with a local subregion do not exist in gravity. Consequently, the TFD state dual to such a wormhole geometry can no longer be identified as the purification of a thermal state, and the identification (4) is does not hold, since the left hand side of that equation is not well defined. The non-locality of gravity manifests itself through the absence of a time-reversal symmetry, or equivalently an origin of time. For the two-sided eternal black hole in AdS, this non-local nature of gravity results in a large class of states, namely the generalised TFD states (1). These states arise from one-sided time evolutions of the TFD state \left|\text{TFD}_{\alpha}\right\rangle=e^{iH_{L}t}|\text{TFD}\rangle\,, (5) identifying \alpha_{n}=E_{n}t, H_{L} being the left boundary Hamiltonian. These states share the same dual black hole geometry, nevertheless, with different identifications of the left and the right boundary points. The original TFD state (2) corresponds to one particular identification of boundary times, which is along the Cauchy slice shown in blue on the left-hand side of Fig. 1, with support at t_{L}=t_{R}=0. For observers infalling from one of the boundaries, all the states (5) yield the same correlation functions Papadodimas and Raju (2015, 2016). This fact reflects, quantitatively, the freedom to independently choose the origins of time for the left and right boundary theory. Since time runs in different directions in the left and right exterior, this identification is respected by time evolution generated by the difference of the left and right boundary Hamiltonians U_{-}(t)=e^{i\frac{t}{2}(H_{L}-H_{R})}\,, (6) in the sense that the TFD state with a given phase remains invariant under this evolution. A direct consequence of this fact is that we can also obtain the generalised TFD states (5) from global time evolution, which is generated by \left|\text{TFD}_{\alpha}\right\rangle=U_{+}(t)\,U_{-}(t)|\text{TFD}\rangle=U_% {+}(t)|\text{TFD}\rangle\,, (7) where the unitary transformation U_{+} is given by the sum of the boundary Hamiltonians, U_{+}(t)=e^{i\frac{t}{2}(H_{L}+H_{R})}\,. (8) The global time evolution is illustrated on the right-hand side of Fig. (1). Since the evolved Cauchy slice contains a larger portion of the black hole interior, we may also interpret the evolved state as being dual to a Lorentzian wormhole of different length. Every state in the infinite family (1) is a microstate of the black hole Note (3), which shows that the bulk Hilbert space appears to have way too many states when probed by a local observer. However, it is worth emphasizing that although the relative time-shift between the left and the right boundaries remains undetected by a single infalling observer, the phases can be detected through non-local measurements Verlinde (2020); Note (7). In what follows, we will demonstrate how non-local effects can actually lift this infinite microstate degeneracy."

Cryogenic Radio Frequency Experiment","There are strong arguments that quantum mechanics may be nonlinear in its dynamics. A discovery of nonlinearity would hint at a novel understanding of the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory, for example. As such, experiments searching for potential nonlinear effects in the electromagnetic sector are important. Here we outline such an experiment, consisting of a stream of random bits (which were generated using Rigetti’s Aspen-M-3 chip) as input to an RF signal generator coupled to a cryogenic detector. Projective measurements of the qubit state, which is originally prepared in an equal superposition, serve as the random binary output of a signal generator. Thereafter, spectral analysis of the RF detector would yield a detectable excess signal predicted to arise from such a nonlinear effect. A comparison between the projective measurements of the quantum bits vs the classical baseline showed no power excess. This sets a new limit on the electromagnetic nonlinearity parameter |\epsilon|\lessapprox 1.15\times 10^{-12}, at a 90.0% confidence level. This is the most stringent limit on nonlinear quantum mechanics thus far and an improvement by nearly a factor of 50 over the previous experimental limit.","Linearity of time evolution is a fundamental axiom of quantum mechanics. However, in physical systems linearity is typically an approximation to a more complete description of the system. The full evolution of the system can be viewed in terms of a power series, where the linear terms are observationally prominent with nonlinear terms suppressed by energy scales. Recent theoretical work [1], building on prior insights [2, 3], has shown that a similar structure is possible in the time evolution of quantum mechanics itself. It has been shown that there is a broad class of consistent (causal and gauge invariant) extensions of quantum mechanics where the time evolution of the system is nonlinear. In this class of theories, one can view the time evolution equation of a quantum field theory as a power series expansion in the quantum states. The term that is linear in the quantum state is simply the first term in this expansion and is observationally dominant. This results in linear evolution emerging as the leading order approximation of a more complex time evolution. The main observation of Ref. [1] is that the Hamiltonian that describes the time evolution of a quantum state |\Psi\rangle of a quantum field theory can be made state-dependent – thus leading to nonlinear time evolution – by shifting various bosonic field operators in the Hamiltonian by a small amount proportional to the expectation value of the operator in the full quantum state |\Psi\rangle. In quantum electrodynamics, these nonlinear terms effectively shift the conventional Lagrangian A_{\mu}J^{\mu} to the term \left(A_{\mu}+\epsilon\langle\Psi|A_{\mu}|\Psi\rangle\right)J^{\mu}. Here A_{\mu} is the electromagnetic 4-vector potential, J^{\mu} a 4-vector current and \epsilon parametrizes the magnitude of the nonlinear term. Thus, the current J^{\mu} effectively sees a modified 4-vector potential \left(A_{\mu}+\epsilon\langle\Psi|A_{\mu}|\Psi\rangle\right). It was shown in Ref. [1] that despite over a century of precise quantum mechanical measurements (for example, in atomic, optical, nuclear and collider experiments), observational limits on causal nonlinear quantum mechanical evolution were weak, but that nevertheless, potent experimental probes of such nonlinearities are possible with dedicated experiments. Figure 1: A schematic of our test of nonlinear quantum mechanics (NLQM). A qubit is prepared in a superposition state and measured, creating a macroscopic superposition, two worlds. In the world in which the qubit is measured to be in the |1\rangle state an electric circuit is powered with a voltage of V_{0} during a predetermined time. In the world in which the qubit is measured to be |0\rangle, the source is kept off, but the voltage of the same circuit is measured to high precision in the same predetermined time. Because the expectation value of the voltage, averaged over both worlds is V_{0}/2, NLQM will effectively lead to a leakage of voltage of size \epsilon V_{0}/2 from the source world to the measurement world. The experimental protocols to test Ref. [1] relied on the following fact: nonlinear evolution leads to interactions of the quantum state with itself. This manifests itself in the form of interactions between different “branches” or “arms” of the wave function, also referred to as “worlds”. Each branch corresponds to one possible outcome of the measurement of the quantum system, and all branches coexist after the measurement [4]. Based on this, there are two kinds of experiments that can probe nonlinear quantum mechanics. First, one can consider interferometric experiments where a quantum system is placed in a superposition and anomalous interactions between the arms of the superposition manifest as a phase shift in the interferometer. This protocol was implemented in an ion interferometer [5] which searched for the Coulomb field of one arm of the ion interferometer interacting with the other arm. In these interferometric experiments, it is essential to maintain quantum coherence of the superposition. Surprisingly, causal nonlinear quantum mechanics leads can lead to effects that persist even when the arms of the superposition get entangled with an environment and decohere. This phenomenon, dubbed the “Everett Phone” [3], gives rise to a second class of potent experimental probes. A search relying on this is sketched schematically in Figure 1. First, a macroscopic quantum superposition is created. Since the superposition need not be coherent, it is easily created by performing a measurement on a quantum system such as a spin or a qubit. The many-worlds interpretation suggests that this measurement, which is simply an interaction between the quantum system and the measuring device, creates a macroscopic superposition of two worlds: one in which the qubit was measured to be |0\rangle and another where it was measured to be |1\rangle. At a fixed location L in the laboratory, we turn on a voltage V_{0} if the qubit is measured in |1\rangle. In the case of |0\rangle , we use a voltmeter to measure the voltage signal with no voltage source turned on at location L. The Schrödinger equation predicts that the full quantum state |\Psi\rangle is the superposition of both these worlds, and thus it can be verified that \langle\Psi|A_{\mu}|\Psi\rangle is non-zero at L. In the presence of the nonlinear term \epsilon\langle\Psi|A_{\mu}|\Psi\rangle J^{\mu}, the current J^{\mu} will respond to an additional voltage \epsilon V_{0}/2 irrespective of the qubit outcome that the current is entangled with. That is, the voltage that was turned on in the world when the qubit was |1\rangle leaks into the world where it is |0\rangle. This phenomenon, a robust consequence of any causal nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics [3, 1], is thus once again simply the interaction between two arms of a superposition that nonlinearities would enable. However, its persistence, even in the presence of decoherence, could enable much more potent experimental probes of this scenario than is possible with quantum coherent interferometric probes, as in Ref. [5]. The first experiment implementing this protocol was performed in Ref. [6], obtaining a bound of |\epsilon|\lessapprox 4.7\times 10^{-11}. The purpose of the present paper is to report on an experiment that implemented this protocol using a high-power radio frequency (RF) setup, which improved the bound to |\epsilon|\lessapprox 1.15\times 10^{-12}. Here again, we measure a qubit system. If a |1\rangle measurement is obtained, we turned on an RF source with applied power P_{A} at a fixed location L in the laboratory. If |0\rangle was obtained, we turned on a device that measured RF power without any RF source being turned on. In the presence of the nonlinear term \epsilon\langle\Psi|A_{\mu}|\Psi\rangle, the detectors will experience an additional power \epsilon^{2}P_{A}/4 irrespective of the qubit outcome they are entangled with. Thus, in the world where the qubit was in the 0 state and there was no power source, the detector will see RF power \epsilon^{2}P_{A}/4. If P_{M} is the smallest power that can be experimentally measured, then the corresponding value of \epsilon that the experiment is sensitive to is given by \displaystyle|\epsilon_{\textrm{lim}}|=2\times\sqrt{P_{M}/P_{A}} (1)"
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09574v1,Notes on entropy,"Following our previous work on hybrid quantum states in the RST model, we study its most interesting solution representing a completely regular spacetime with the structure of causal diamond, containing an apparent horizon and radiation at infinity. Adapting recent computations of radiation entropy in terms of the entropy of entanglement, we find that this entropy follows a Page curve. This confirms our previous result [1], which was obtained by directly calculating the thermodynamic entropy of radiation at infinity. We also investigate the presence of a possible island in these systems, and find that it does not seem to play a role in contributing to the generalized black hole entropy.","Ever since Hawking discovered in the 1970s that black holes emit radiation and should eventually evaporate, there has been much debate about whether their evolution is in disagreement with the principles of quantum mechanics. Indeed, according to Hawking’s computation their radiation is thermal and does not correspond to a pure state, so that if a black hole (BH) is formed from a pure state its evolution would be manifestly non-unitary. This problem is known as the information paradox, or information loss problem, and many resolutions were proposed throughout the last decades to explain how information could be preserved. For a nice introduction to this problem and a presentation of possible solutions one can consult [2]. In fact many people were convinced that black hole evolution should indeed be unitary when in 1997 Maldacena [3] exhibited the correspondence between Anti de Sitter (AdS) quantum gravity and conformal field theory (CFT), a realization of the holographic principle proposed by ’t Hooft and Susskind in 1993 [4, 5]. The basic idea is that, if one considers a black hole in an AdS spacetime, the equivalent CFT on the boundary evolves unitarily, so the black hole should do too. However this is not a consensus, see for instance [6] for a discussion about the relevance of this argument. A criteria was suggested by Page [7, 8] to establish whether an evaporation process is unitary and preserves information. The idea is to consider the evolution of the Hawking radiation’s entanglement entropy during a unitary evaporation process. Initially, when the black hole has just formed, there is no radiation and this entropy is zero. As radiation starts coming out, it is entangled with the inside of the black hole, so even though the whole quantum state remains pure (as evolution is unitary), the subsystem consisting of this outside radiation has a positive entanglement entropy. When the black hole has completely evaporated, there remains only outside radiation and it has nothing left to be entangled with, so the entropy must be back to zero. What this means is that there exists a time at which the entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation starts decreasing, signaling that trans-horizon correlations start to appear in the radiation. This time is referred to as the Page time and should be of order half the total evaporation time [8]. Plotting the evolution of the entropy of radiation as a function of time, we thus get a curve that is increasing at first and then decreasing, called the Page curve. A schematic plot is presented on figure 1. Figure 1: Schematic plot of the various entropies during a black hole evaporation process. The entanglement entropy of the radiation S_{\mathrm{ent}}, also known as the “fine-grained” entropy, is always smaller than the thermodynamic, or “coarse-grained” entropy of the black hole S_{\mathrm{B}\mathrm{H}}, and the radiation entropy S_{\mathrm{rad}}. If the evolution is unitary, S_{\mathrm{ent}} has to start and end at zero, and it is expected that its maximum should coincide with the point where S_{\mathrm{B}\mathrm{H}}=S_{\mathrm{rad}}. In the last decade, a new procedure was introduced with the aim of computing the entanglement entropy during an evaporation process. The idea is to introduce so-called islands, as part of the quantum extremal surface [9], which are surfaces located inside the horizon (and sometimes outside) that contribute to the generalized entropy. See [10] for a nice introduction to this procedure, which was used in [11] to derive a Page curve for Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, a model of two-dimensional semi-classical gravity. In this paper we pursue the work done in [12, 1, 13], in which we focused on another model of two-dimensional semi-classical gravity, the RST model [14]. This model is a semi-classical extension of the classical CGHS model [15], obtained by considering conformally coupled quantum fields, whose energy-momentum tensor is fixed by the conformal anomaly in two dimensions. The RST action is given by \mathcal{S}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int\mathrm{d}^{2}x\,\sqrt{-g}\,\Big{\{}e^{-2\phi}% \big{[}R+4(\nabla\phi)^{2}+4\lambda^{2}\big{]}-\frac{1}{2}(\nabla f)^{2}-% \kappa\phi R-\frac{\kappa}{2}R\,\square^{-1}R\Big{\}}\,, (1.1) with \phi the dilaton field and where \kappa is proportional to the central charge of the conformal field theory, i.e. to the number of fields if we are only considering scalar fields. \lambda is the cosmological constant in the theory, and f will denote infalling classical matter, whose presence will turn a static solution into dynamical one. In our previous papers, especially [13], we were able to define the quantum states of interest, namely the Hartle-Hawking, Boulware and Unruh states, and find the corresponding solutions in the RST model. An interesting scenario is obtained when considering fields in the Boulware state, meaning that they do not radiate at infinity in a static spacetime. The Minkowski vacuum is one particular instance of this case. When sending in a shockwave, an apparent horizon and a singularity are created. An interesting point is that, although the fields are initially in the Boulware state, the creation of a horizon effectively causes them to radiate at future infinity. At first, the singularity is hidden behind the horizon, but they collide at a finite point, signaling the breakdown of the semi-classical approximation and the evaporation of the black hole. In [16, 17], based on the work of [18], the authors studied this solution in the context of the information loss problem. First, they computed the entanglement entropy without considering islands, finding that it increases up until the evaporation point, indicating a non-unitary evolution. However, by applying the island procedure, they found that one eventually obtains a Page curve like behavior. This provides a crucial example, where considerations of islands can indeed signal a unitary evolution of the BH. In our previous work, we provided a systematic and detailed study of these various states, uncovered a new set of states, and explored the possibility of combining two different states creating a hybrid quantum state. In the last case, the idea is to explore what happens if the backreacting conformal fields are non-physical (such as ghosts), and how the physics changes when they are considered in combination with the usual physical fields. These fields contribute negatively to the total central charge [19, 20, 21] and we argued that the most natural state for them is the Boulware state, as they should not be observed at infinity. As for the physical fields, a natural choice is the Unruh state,111One can also take the physical fields to be in the Hartle-Hawking state, which corresponds to a black hole in thermal equilibrium with its radiation. The only notable difference between the two states is the presence of incoming radiation at past infinity. which contains outgoing radiation at future infinity but no incoming radiation at past infinity. Thus it is expected to be the most suited state to describe black hole evaporation. In this setup, the most interesting case arises when the total central charge is negative, \kappa<0, that is when the non-physical fields dominate the physical ones. Indeed, the resulting solution is singularity free, asymptotically flat, and sending in a shock wave creates an apparent horizon but no singularity. Importantly, the radiation at future infinity has two contribution: one from the physical fields, which is thermal, and one from the non-physical fields, which can be interpreted as corrections rendering the total radiation non-thermal. In fact, we argued in [1, 13] that the thermodynamic entropy of the resulting radiation followed a Page curve thanks to the radiation of non-physical particles at future infinity. What we would like to do now is study the entanglement entropy of the radiation of this hybrid solution, with and without islands. In order to do this, we will adapt the discussion from [16, 17] on the Boulware state solution, to our solution. We want to investigate whether the inclusion of islands is relevant in this case, and what are its implications towards the Page curve with or without its contribution. In section 2, we briefly review how the entanglement entropy can be defined, and reproduce the main results of [16, 17] in section 3. In section 4 we study how the same computation translates to our hybrid solution. We find that one indeed obtains a Page curve even without an island. Finally, section 5 is dedicated to the island procedure, where we once again follow [16, 17] to investigate the relevance of islands for our hybrid case. Sections 4 and 5 present the main new results of our paper. We conclude in section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09548v1,Replica wormhole and AMPS firewall,"We investigate the potential for generating an AMPS firewall from the replica wormhole topology, which describes the post-Page time spacetime in the evaporation process of a black hole. Our analysis reveals that this topology gives rise to a Dirac delta force experienced by infalling particles at the event horizon, consistent with the AMPS firewall hypothesis. This force, proportional to the particle’s total energy squared, is a direct consequence of the inherent Dirac delta in the Ricci scalar of the replica wormhole. We provide a regularization scheme for this force, which is crucial for obtaining physically meaningful results. Notably, our approach suggests that considering the replica wormhole resolves both the information paradox and the AMPS argument regarding the monogamy of entanglement simultaneously, yielding a more coherent framework.","In 1975, Hawking studied quantum field theory in curved spacetime and showed that black holes do evaporate while losing their masses [1, 2]. Given that the radiation is purely thermal, the evaporation process destroys quantum information and is not a unitary process [3]. A quantity called “von Neumann entropy” or “fine-grained entropy” or “entanglement entropy” is used to express the information loss amount quantitatively, which is defined as S_{R}=-\Tr\rho_{R}\ln\rho_{R}, with \rho_{R} representing the density matrix of the radiation. One would expect this quantity to rise at the initial stages of the evaporation process due to the increasing entanglement between the emitting radiation and the remaining black hole. However, for a black hole starting in a pure state, the entanglement entropy should decrease after about half of the black hole has evaporated (Page time) and eventually hit zero for the process to be unitary. Hence, the entanglement entropy should follow the curve shown in Fig. 1, suggested by Page [4, 5, 6], for the information to be conserved. Figure 1: Left: The curve that Page suggested for entanglement entropy of the radiation emitted from a black hole initially in a pure state, from [6]. This curve is produced by considering the thermodynamic entropies of the radiation and the black hole as functions of time, and choosing the less one. Right: A schematic visualization of Page’s procedure in obtaining the Page curve, from [7]. As is shown, the true curve for entanglement entropy of the radiation is expected to follow the thermodynamic entropy of the radiation at first. However, when reaching the Page time, it should switch to follow the thermodynamic entropy of the black hole. Obviously this curve is consistent with unitarity. Further investigations has confirmed that the information is indeed conserved. In 2006, Ryu and Takayanagi introduced a holographic formula for the entanglement entropy, which can be proved in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence, using replica trick [8, 9, 10]. In the derivation of the holographic formula we have \Tr_{A}\rho_{A}^{n}=\int Dg\;\exp(-\mathcal{S}_{n\text{-AdS}}[g]), (1) where \rho_{A} is density matrix of a system A described by a d-dimensional CFT. Moreover, the integration is performed over different geometrical configurations (given by different metric tensors) in the dual n-sheeted AdS space, which in turn is constructed by gluing n numbers of (d+1)-dimensional AdS spaces by the means of [10], with \mathcal{S}_{n\text{-AdS}}[g] being its action given by \mathcal{S}_{n\text{-AdS}}[g]=-\frac{1}{16\pi G}\int dx^{(d+1)}\sqrt{\left|% \det(g)\right|}\left(R+\Lambda\right). (2) R in the above expression is the Ricci scalar of the n-AdS space and \Lambda is the negative cosmological constant. The entanglement entropy, S_{A}, can be found using the following relation S=-\frac{\partial}{\partial n}\ln(\Tr\rho^{n})\biggl{|}_{n=1}. (3) In the CFT side, there is a negative deficit angle of 2\pi(1-n) localized on the gluing surface, \partial A. Consequently, in the dual AdS space, the deficit angle locates on a codimension-2 surface homologous to A, we denote which by \gamma_{A}. The deficit angle contributes to the Ricci scalar through a singular Dirac delta, i.e., R=4\pi(1-n)\delta(\gamma_{A})+R^{(0)}, (4) with R^{(0)} representing the Ricci scalar of the AdS space and being extensive in n. \gamma_{A} in the above relation is only restricted to be homologous to A and hence is not quite fixed. So the summation over different geometries in Eq. (1) breaks into: (i) a summation over different choices of \gamma_{A} alongside (ii) a summation over different choices of g in R^{(0)}. Using Eqs. (1)-(4), and approximating the summations over g (in R^{(0)}) and \gamma_{A} by their maximum contributions given by classical general relativity and minimal surface (\gamma_{A}^{*}) respectively, we obtain the holographic entanglement entropy formula S_{A}=\frac{\text{Area}(\gamma_{A}^{*})}{4G}. (5) The holographic formula, Eq. (5), is particularly useful when we aim to compute the entanglement entropy of a system in a CFT. This formulation was further developed by [11] to a covariant form and by [12] to incorporate quantum corrections, eventually leading to the following formula proposed by [13], which is applicable to evaporating black holes S=\text{min}_{X}\left\{\text{ext}_{X}\left[\frac{\text{Area}(X)}{4G}+S_{\text{% semi-cl}}\left(\Sigma_{X}\right)\right]\right\}. (6) Here, X is a codimension-2 surface and \Sigma_{X} is the region bounded by X and the surface from where we can almost assume that spacetime is flat, called cutoff surface111Determining the precise location of the cutoff surface is challenging according to the long-range nature of gravity [7].. Moreover, the term S_{\text{semi-cl}}(\Sigma_{X}) is standing for the entanglement entropy of the quantum fields on \Sigma_{X} in the semi-classical description222The semi-classical description treats matter fields as quantum and the gravitational field as classical.. The expression in the brackets is called generalized entropy, S_{\text{gen}}(X). The surface that extremizes S_{\text{gen}}(X) is called Quantum Extremal Surface (QES). According to the recipe by [13], if there are multiple QESs, then we should select the one with the least S_{\text{gen}}. For an evaporating black hole that starts from a pure state, we identify two QESs as described by Eq. (6): (i) a vanishing surface with a growing contribution, and (ii) a nonvanishing surface just behind the event horizon with a decreasing contribution. In the early stages, the minimal QES is the vanishing one causing the generalized entropy to match the entanglement entropy of the bulk (inside the cutoff surface). Hence, the initial black hole’s fine-grained entropy starts at zero and continuously increases. On the other hand, the nonvanishing QES appears shortly after the black hole formation with a contribution that reflects the black hole’s area, which decreases as the black hole evaporates. According to the minimal selection rule of Eq. (6), when the contribution of the nonvanishing surface becomes smaller than that of the vanishing one, it starts to represent the true fine-grained entropy of the black hole [7]. This switch between the two QESs allows the black hole’s entanglement entropy to closely follow the Page curve shown in Fig. 1, which is indicative of unitary evaporation [4, 5, 6]. In the context of the replica trick, when assuming n=2 replicas, we have two different topologies contributing in \Tr\rho^{2} as shown in Fig. 2. Notably, they are in accordance with the two minimal QESs discussed previously. The first diagram, called Hawking saddle, represents n=2 black holes evaporating independently. The second diagram, on the other hand, represents n=2 black holes in the way that their interiors are connected, forming a kind of wormhole, called replica wormhole. The minimization rule of Eq. (6) leads to a strict switch between these saddles: Before the Page time, the Hawking saddle is dominant and after that time the replica wormhole becomes dominated. A more accurate treatment would replace the strict transition by a gradual one, and, correspondingly, smoothen the sharp peak of the Page curve [14]. Figure 2: Illustrating diagrams are given in [7] for two different contributions of \Tr\rho^{2}. Left is what Hawking considered in his calculations and hence is called Hawking saddle. It simply considers the black holes as evaporating independently and is the dominant contribution before the Page time. Right is a non-trivial topology in which the interiors of the black holes are connected forming a wormhole called replica wormhole. It becomes the dominant contribution after the Page time. In 2012, Ahmed Almheiri, Donald Marolf, Joseph Polchinski, and James Sully (AMPS) revealed that the three fundamental assumptions in black hole physics: (i) purity of Hawking radiation, (ii) absence of infalling drama, and (iii) validity of semiclassical behavior outside the event horizon, are in conflict [15]. This conflict arises because the post-Page time radiation has to be maximally entangled with both its ingoing pair (according to (iii)) and the pre-Page time radiation (enforced by (i)), violating the monogamy of entanglement in absence of an infalling drama (according to (ii)). To resolve this conflict, AMPS proposed that observers crossing the event horizon experience a “firewall” of high-energy particles, which must turn on prior to the emission of post-Page time radiation; i.e., at least around the Page time [16].‌ Although there are some alternative resolutions, such as complementarity [17, 18] and non-local interactions [19, 20, 21], AMPS argued that removing assumption (ii) by introducing the firewall is the most conservative resolution to the paradox. This investigation explores the potential for generating an AMPS firewall from the replica wormhole, through studying the Ricci scalar. The organization of this paper is as follows: In Sec. 2, learning from Eq. (4), we state that the Ricci scalar for the replica wormhole topology contains a singular Dirac delta multiplied by (n-1). This combination becomes uncertain when we send n\rightarrow 1 and r\rightarrow r_{s}. Therefore, we keep this combination, while neglecting the (n-1) alone according to the replica trick, to derive a metric that corresponds to the replica wormhole topology, expected to describe the post-Page time spacetime. Subsequently, we simulate an infalling particle toward the black hole in this spacetime and find that it experiences a Dirac delta force at the event horizon. This force is in accord with the AMPS firewall hypothesis. However, a regularization is needed to remove its ambiguity, which is explored in Sec. 3. Finally conclusions are presented in Sec. 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09500v1,Blackish Holes,"Based on previous works, in this article we systematically analyze the implications of the explicit normal modes of a probe scalar sector in a BTZ background with a Dirichlet wall, in an asymptotically AdS-background. This is a Fuzzball-inspired geometric model, at least in an effective sense. We demonstrate explicitly that in the limit when the Dirichlet wall approaches the event horizon, the normal modes condense fast to yield an effective branch cut along the real line in the complex frequency plane. In turn, in this approximation, quasi-normal modes associated to the BTZ black hole emerge and the corresponding two-point function is described by a thermal correlator, associated with the Hawking temperature in the general case and with the right-moving temperature in the extremal limit. We further show, analytically, that the presence of a non-vanishing angular momentum non-perturbatively enhances this condensation. The consequences are manifold: e.g. there is an emergent strong thermalization due to these modes, adding further support to a quantum chaotic nature associated to the spectral form factor. We explicitly demonstrate, by considering a classical collapsing geometry, that the one-loop scalar determinant naturally inherits a Dirichlet boundary condition, as the shell approaches the scale of the event horizon. This provides a plausible dynamical mechanism in the dual CFT through a global quench, that can create an emergent Dirichlet boundary close to the horizon-scale. We offer comments on how this simple model can describe salient features of Fuzzball-geometries, as well as of extremely compact objects. This also provides an explicit realization of how an effective thermal physics emerges from a non-thermal microscopic description, within a semi-classical account of gravity, augmented with an appropriate boundary condition.","Black hole thermodynamics has shaped much of modern theoretical research in quantum aspects of gravity, since the early results of Bekenstein and Hawking [1, 2]. Several aspects of this can be understood within the framework of Euclidean Quantum Gravity, which, however, is a mathematically ill-defined quantity. The working principle here is similar to the equivalence between Euclidean QFT and Statistical Field Theory. Unlike Euclidean QFT though, the Euclidean gravitational path integral is unbounded from below. Moreover, the formulation does not shed any light on how it can capture physical answers that are expected to be sensitive to the UV-description of the system. Nevertheless, there is plenty of circumstantial evidence that Euclidean Quantum Gravity does capture salient physical features of black holes, ranging from thermodynamic properties of black holes to much fine-grained entropic measures, e.g. Renyi entropies, of the system. See e.g. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] for (only a representative of the) recent works on this. The latter has also a vast literature on various aspects of realizing the Page curve in the context of black hole information paradox. See e.g. [8, 9, 10, 11], for a partial list on some of these progress, and [12, 13] for recent reviews including these advances. While it inherits the issues of Euclidean quantum gravity,111In particular, the Euclidean path integral is not bounded from below and therefore the corresponding path integral is mathematically ill-defined. the fine-grained entropic discussions are mostly also confined to low-dimensional gravitational systems, in particular in two dimensions. Despite being extremely interesting and tractable models, it remains unclear to what extent they capture universal and generic mechanism for quantum black holes in higher dimensions. Nonetheless, a robust feature of this formulation is the so-called Euclidean regularity at the origin, which physically translates to a smooth event horizon of a black hole. Alternatively, the “Fuzzball paradigm” attempts to construct explicit microscopic descriptions of a quantum black hole, starting from a manifestly UV-complete framework of string theory. See e.g. [14, 15] for a recent review on this. Both perturbative and non-perturbative degrees of freedom in string theory (such as D-branes) are required to construct the explicit description. In the massless limit of string theory, these degrees of freedom can be as large as the scale of the event horizon and therefore in this paradigm, the event horizon is not smooth. Instead, it is replaced by a stringy star-like object whose dimension can be arbitrarily close to the Schwarzschild radius.222Note that, in order to achieve this, one needs a mechanism to avoid the Buchdahl limit[16]. In the Fuzzball-paradigm, the Buchdahl theorem can be violated since the extra-dimensions and fluxes turned on them violate the underlying assumptions of the theorem. See e.g. [17, 18] for more discussions on this. By now, an impressive family of such solutions have been explicitly constructed within supergravity, which is the massless limit of string theory. However, most of these geometries carry a large number of symmetries and, in particular, supersymmetry. The latter makes it unlikely to realize quantum-thermal aspects of black holes, e.g. scrambling, thermalization and quantum chaos. These features, on the other hand, can be realized rather generically from semi-classical analyses of a smooth horizon. It is therefore an interesting and important question whether an “effective” description of the fuzzball paradigm exists in which salient features of black holes can be captured, without making explicit reference to the precise details of the UV degrees of freedom. At the outset, this is analogous to the existence of Euclidean quantum gravity path integral itself, which can be viewed as an effective tool to capture certain physical phenomena; however, it is not known to be derivable from a first principle. In [19] t’ Hooft introduced an effective model of quantum black holes, by replacing the purely ingoing classical boundary condition (in the Lorentzian picture) by a Dirichlet boundary condition slightly outside the event horizon of the black hole. It was dubbed as a “brickwall”, which completely reflects all modes that are incident on it. By tuning the position of the brickwall, it was argued that the entropy of a probe scalar sector becomes dominated by a black hole area term at the leading order. This can be viewed as a “mechanism” of generating area-worth thermal entropy for an otherwise ordinary system. Figure 1: A pictorial representation of the Brickwall model. The dashed circles denote the location of the brickwall, which can be placed at an arbitrary location. In figure 6, we have schematically represented the model, in an asymptotically AdS-background.333We emphasize that while AdS asymptotics make the framework better defined, the physics does not depend on it. The relevant features emerge from the near horizon geometry. Clearly, the crucial input here is the brickwall itself, which is a priori a non-dynamical object, but resembles to D-branes in string theory. Recently, in [20, 21, 22, 23], this model has been explored further and it was demonstrated that the probe scalar sector contains signatures of quantum chaos, even though it is not as strong as the Random Matrix Theory universality. Furthermore, in [24, 25], a more precise “entropy-matching” was performed based on the explicit modes found earlier. It was also shown in [26] that the black hole quasi-normal modes can be obtained from the analytic properties of the Green’s function which a priori contains the information about the normal modes. See also [27, 28, 29] for further recent progress based on this model. Taken seriously, the above circumstantial evidences perhaps hint that an “effective description”, which can be described geometrically, exists for quantum black holes. This, however, does not shed any light on how this could be “derived” from a UV-complete description, nor does it guarantee which physical questions this is able to address. It is important to nonetheless emphasize that it incorporates a crucial UV-data of the Fuzzball paradigm: there is structure at the horizon, which is now described by a Dirichlet boundary condition. One primary goal of this program is to understand these aspects systematically. It is important to note at this point that a possible resolution of the black hole information paradox is also proposed from a completely different technical and mathematical perspective. In terms of the so-called mirror operator construction, which necessitates the existence of a black hole interior. See e.g. [30, 31, 32, 33, 34] as well as a recent review in [35]. Furthermore, the resolution based on the Island-rule has been criticized in [36, 37], while the Fuzzball-approached has been criticized in [38]. It is also important to note that our “effective geometry” is explicitly at loggerheads with the mirror operator construction. At this point, however, we will not attempt to offer any resolution between any of these tensions. Coming back to our work, this program can be rephrased and motivated from a different perspective. Given the interesting aspects of the quantum black holes, we can ask: Is there a class of boundary conditions that can yield a qualitatively similar physics? This question will essentially revolve around the aspects of area-worth thermal entropy, maximal chaos as seen by out-of-time-correlators, quantum chaos in the spectral form factor and so on. On one hand, a similar class of questions have been addressed in quantum quench in QFTs, especially CFTs. In critical quenches, the boundary state yields a kinematic thermal description for low-point correlators, and can display a maximally chaotic dynamics for a large-c CFT in two-dimensions[39, 40, 41, 42]. A very similar physics is also realized in the “moving-mirror” models in which the dynamics of eternal or evaporating black holes can be realized by choosing an appropriate mirror profile[43, 44, 45, 46]. For the CFT degrees of freedom, these are essentially certain boundary conditions. This class of questions can now be posed for an arbitrary QFT in a curved geometry, augmented by a class of boundary conditions. Returning back to the geometric picture, there is a rather pragmatic and perhaps observational perspective on which this program can also shed light. This is to distinguish between black holes and black hole mimickers. While it is certainly true that recent observations in the Event Horizon Telescope or the LIGO black hole mergers strongly support the existence of black holes in our observed Universe, we cannot rule out the possibility of (quantum) structures at the horizon scale. Therefore, it becomes important to understand and catalogue possibilities in which such signatures may be detected, albeit in future. Such a program already exists within the Fuzzball paradigm itself where the intricate detailed geometric structures are currently explored to extract observational signatures in e.g. mesoscopic physics[47]. The idea of distinguishing black holes from black hole mimickers have received a wide attention in [48, 49, 50, 51], beginning with the very early work of Israel-Mukhoyama in [52] where it was already advocated that a low-energy observer is unable to distinguish the Boulware vacuum from the Hartle-Hawking vacuum and therefore for a compact enough star, the observed physical thermodynamic relations are indistinguishable from that of a black hole. In a very precise sense, our program is to revisit this aspect in an asymptotically AdS spacetime, with the added understanding of gauge-gravity duality. Furthermore, our focus is on finer-grained physical quantities, such as the spectral form factor, quasi-normal modes and the related. In this article, we first expand on the key observations in [26] and explore its consequences in various directions. In particular, we identify the presence of a strong thermalization due to the angular momenta modes, which adds strength to the non-trivial spectral rigidity in the corresponding scalar spectrum. Secondly, by considering a collapsing shell model and quantizing a scalar determinant in this dynamical geometry, we explicitly demonstrate that a Dirichlet boundary condition emerges when the collapsing shell approaches the event horizon. In the dual CFT, this provides a plausible mechanism by which a global quench can result into an effective Dirichlet boundary condition for the scalars modes in the bulk. Subsequently, the quantization yields results that we have already observed in the static case. This article is divided into the following parts: We begin with setting up the framework in the next two sections, in which we also summarize and review many of the earlier results. In section 2, among several physical properties, we extensively study the analytic structure of the Green’s function focussing on the particular role of the angular momenta modes. In particular, we argue that there are two emergent notions of thermalization when the Dirichlet wall approaches the event horizon: “weak thermalization” and “strong thermalization”. In the next section, we offer comments on the case of rotating BTZ geometry, focussing on similar aspects. The next section is devoted to a detailed account of the one-loop scalar sector in a collapsing geometry, where we also demonstrate that a Dirichlet boundary condition for the scalar sector emerges dynamically at the horizon scale, in this framework. Finally we review how a type III von Neumann algebra emerges from a type I algebra in the limit when the brickwall approaches the horizon. We then conclude with several open and possible future directions. Various technical details, relevant reviews (including a discussion on the Boulware vacuum) and technical results are summarized in seven Appendices. A note on terminology: In this article, we will use various terms to mean the same physical degree of freedom. These terms are “brickwall”, “Dirichlet hypersurface”, “stretched horizon”, “cut-off surface”."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09195v1,"The origin channels of hierarchical binary black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O1, O2, and O3 runs","We infer the origin channels of hierarchical mergers observed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O1, O2, and O3 runs using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis under a parametric population model. By assuming the active galactic nucleus (ANG) disk and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, we find that NSCs likely dominate the hierarchical merger rate in the universe, corresponding to a fraction of f_{\rm NSC}=0.87_{-0.29}^{+0.10} at 90% credible intervals in our fiducial model; AGN disks may contribute up to nearly half of hierarchical mergers detectable with LVK, specifically f_{\rm det,AGN}=0.34_{-0.26}^{+0.38}. We investigate the impact of the escape speed, along with other population parameters on the branching fraction, suggesting that the mass, mass ratio, and spin of the sources play significant roles in population analysis. We show that hierarchical mergers constitute at least \sim10\% of the gravitational wave events detected by LVK during the O1-O3 runs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is challenging to effectively infer detailed information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of black hole merger parameters if multiple formation channels are considered.","During the first three observing runs, the LIGO (LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al., 2015), Virgo (Acernese et al., 2015), and KAGRA (Somiya, 2012; Aso et al., 2013) (LVK) Collaboration reported nearly a hundred binary compact merger events (Abbott et al., 2019, 2021; The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al., 2021; Abbott et al., 2023a). The majority of binary black hole (BBH) mergers could be explained by first-generation (1G) mergers formed from the collapse of stars. These primarily arise from isolated binary evolution, as well as dynamical formation in young/open star clusters and globular clusters (Mapelli, 2021; Mandel & Farmer, 2022). Others might stem from second (or higher) generation mergers, referred to hierarchical (repeated) mergers (O’Leary et al., 2016; Gerosa & Berti, 2017; Fishbach et al., 2017), which could mainly originate from active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks and nuclear star clusters (NSCs) (Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021; Arca Sedda et al., 2023b), although hierarchical mergers can also occur in globular clusters (GCs) and young massive clusters (YSCs). Because they are less frequent in the latter environments, which strongly depends on the escape speed of their dynamical environments (see e.g., Antonini & Gieles, 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2019; Mapelli et al., 2021; Kimball et al., 2021; Arca Sedda et al., 2023a). Hierarchical mergers can efficiently bridge the pair-instability (PI) mass gap predicted by PI supernovae (Heger et al., 2003) and Pulsational PI supernovae (Woosley et al., 2007; Belczynski et al., 2016), explaining the growth of intermediate-mass black holes (BHs) in dense stellar environments (e.g., Di Carlo et al., 2020b, a; Tagawa et al., 2021; Fragione et al., 2022; González Prieto et al., 2022; Kritos et al., 2023; Di Cintio et al., 2023). In the active phase of galactic nuclei, a high-density gas disk can efficiently capture stellar-mass BHs and facilitate binary formation and mergers (Bellovary et al., 2016; Bartos et al., 2017; Tagawa et al., 2020b). This unique environment leads to distinctive characteristics of BBHs. The BH mass spectrum is expected to undergo hardening due to the orbital alignment of BHs with the AGN disks, which preferentially selects heavier BHs (Yang et al., 2019a). Under accretion, the spin magnitudes of BHs are likely to be higher, with spin directions tending to align or anti-align with the disk (Bogdanović et al., 2007; Tagawa et al., 2020a; Yi & Cheng, 2019; McKernan et al., 2020). Moreover, migration and migration traps efficiently promotes BH hierarchical growth with extreme mass ratio mergers (Yang et al., 2019b; Li, 2022a). NSCs are also efficient sites for the occurrence of hierarchical mergers (Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021). BBHs in NSCs are formed through dynamical pairing, either via exchanges between a binary star and an intruder, or via dynamical encounters of three initially single bodies (Heggie, 1975; Hills & Fullerton, 1980). The remnant of a 1G BBH merger can be retained by the host cluster if the escape speed of the host cluster is larger than its kick velocity. This surviving remnant can then pair up with another BH to form a hierarchical BBH. Therefore, the crucial condition for hierarchical mergers in NSCs is the escape speed of the host cluster—higher escape speeds result in more efficient hierarchical mergers (Gerosa & Berti, 2019; Li, 2022b; Li et al., 2023a). Additionally, the occurrence of relatively symmetric binary for hierarchical mergers may be preferential in NSCs due to mass segregation (Pavlík & Vesperini, 2022). As a result, the difference in hierarchical mergers lies in the presence of additional changes in the mass and spin of BHs in NSCs compared to those in AGN disks. This implies that the mass and effective spin distributions of hierarchical mergers in AGN disks are higher than those in NSCs (Li et al., 2023a). Regarding the mass ratios of hierarchical mergers, unequal-mass pairings are favored in AGN disks, represented by the hierarchical branch of NG+1G mergers (NG refers to the BH generation), while in NSCs, relatively equal-mass pairings are still favored, represented by the hierarchical branch of NG+NG mergers. In addition, it is generally agreed that the efficiency of BH hierarchical growth in AGN disks may be higher than in NSCs (e.g., Yang et al., 2019b; Li et al., 2023a), although it depends on several parameters that are currently unknown. These parameters include the formation channel of NSCs, the real structure and dynamics of an AGN disk, the possible existence of migration traps, the presence of a supermassive BH in the NSC, and the dynamical evolution of the NSC and its co-evolution with the surrounding environment (Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021; Arca Sedda et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023b). Primarily focusing on 1G mergers, previous research has examined the branching fractions of their isolated binary evolution or cluster channels for BBH mergers (Zevin et al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2023; Iwaya et al., 2023; Vaccaro et al., 2024). However, some of the BBH mergers detected by LVK might be hierarchical mergers originating from dynamical channels, such as AGN disks and NSCs. In this study, our objective is to infer the branching fractions of the AGN disk and NSC channels for hierarchical mergers. Our focus is on investigating the population parameters (see Table 1) that influence branching fractions, which suggests that effectively inferring information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of BBH merger parameters presents a significant challenge."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09000v1,Does decoherence violate decoupling?,"Recent calculations in both flat and de Sitter spacetimes have highlighted a tension between the decoupling of high-energy physics from low-energy degrees of freedom and the expectation that quantum systems decohere due to interactions with unknown environments. In effective field theory (EFT), integrating out heavy fields should lead to Hamiltonian time evolution, which preserves the purity of low-energy states. This is consistent with the fact that we never observe isolated quantum states spontaneously decohering in the vacuum due to unknown high-energy physics. However, when a heavy scalar of mass M is traced out, the resulting purity of a light scalar with mass m typically appears to scale as a power of 1/M (when m\ll M), an effect that cannot be captured by a local effective Hamiltonian. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that the purity depends on the resolution scale of the EFT and how the environment is traced out. We provide a practical method for diagnosing the purity of low-energy states consistent with EFT expectations, and briefly discuss some of the implications these observations have for how ultraviolet divergences can appear in decoherence calculations.","Progress in science is possible because one is never required to study all degrees of freedom in the universe all at once. Physics in particular excels at focussing on a subset of variables in a simple limit to infer useful information about the behaviour of more complicated systems. Systems for which only a subset of variables are explicitly tracked are usually called open systems. Since essentially all scientific studies involve open systems it is surprising that open-system tools are not more widely used. In quantum mechanics not measuring a degree of freedom usually means marginalizing over its value (and so integrating it out). The emergence of novel phenomena like decoherence and thermalization show that the result after this has been done can behave dramatically differently than the initial system. The study of these effects falls into the category of open quantum systems. We follow some of the nomenclature of this field here, with the observed degrees of freedom generically called the ‘system’ and the unobserved marginalized ones called the ‘environment’. Effective field theories (EFTs) Weinberg:1978kz are a particularly important framework for integrating out degrees of freedom in quantum systems in the special case that the ignored states are at high energy relative to the energies of interest in a physical process. In the modern understanding pretty much all of our successful theories are EFTs of this type. So one might expect that phenomena like decoherence and thermalization must be very common within the low-energy regime, since the EFT framework is at its heart an open system analysis. This expectation turns out to be wrong: EFTs lead to standard quantum behaviour for some choice of effective Hamiltonian with no exotic open effects like decoherence at all. That is just as well because we do not see isolated quantum states decohering around us all the time despite the fact that there are always very high energy degrees of freedom beyond reach of our measurements. Ultraviolet (UV) physics decouples from low-energy decoherence calculations. There is a good reason for this that at its core relies on the fact that for EFTs the criterion separating the observed low-energy system from its unobserved high-energy environment involves the eigenvalues of a conserved quantity (energy). For Wilsonian EFTs defined by having low energy it is conservation of energy111Low energies are sometimes supplemented with other conserved things when defining a Wilsonian EFT – such as a specific value of electric charge or baryon number – but if so it is again important that these charges be conserved for avoiding things like decoherence. The same conclusions can also hold in time-dependent situations – such as for cosmology – provided the time-dependence is adiabatic Burgess:2003jk . that ultimately precludes EFTs from displaying the kinds of open-system non-Hamiltonian evolution that can cause things like decoherence EFTBook . In this paper we test this general expectation by comparing it with the results of recent explicit decoherence calculations in which the time-evolution of the purity of a ‘system’ field, \sigma, is computed when a second ‘environmental’ field, \phi, is integrated out Burgess:2024eng ; Colas:2024ysu . We start by first spelling out the decoupling argument more explicitly, with §1.1 giving a more detailed argument why decoherence cannot appear when high-energy states are integrated out. A summary of the results of several explicit perturbative purity calculations is then given in §2 (with some details provided in Appendix A). For some of these the interactions are simple enough that an exact solution is possible. In the limit that the mass M of the environmental field becomes very large these calculations should become well-described by an EFT framework and so their contribution to decoherence should be suppressed. In particular, general EFT arguments tell us that any effect that occurs at a fixed finite order in 1/M can be captured by an effective interaction within an appropriate effective Hamiltonian, H_{\rm eff}. But Hamiltonian evolution always takes pure states to pure states and so one expects that decoherence effects in such theories should be smaller than any finite power of 1/M. This is not borne out by explicit calculations, which therefore contain a puzzle: how can having decoherence be proportional to any power of 1/M be consistent with the existence of a local Wilsonian Hamiltonian description? This paper aims to explain how these calculations can be consistent with the general arguments against decoherence in EFTs, without undermining Wilsonian methods, with the main argument given in §3. Both the calculations and the general arguments are correct and this reveals a subtlety in interpreting purity calculations, particularly so far as the contribution of UV degrees of freedom are important. There are many ways to trace out UV degrees of freedom, particularly if the full system energy eigenstates are only approximately known. Although each correctly computes the purity evolution of low-energy states, they do so subject to different assumptions about precisely what the environment is that has been traced out. Only the specific calculation that accurately captures the effects of energy eigenstates provides a good diagnostic of the low-energy purity, and this agrees with the general expectation that pure states remain pure. §3 also describes a simple practical way to compute the purity evolution predicted by integrating out high-energy states, without having to know in advance precisely what the high-energy energy eigenstates are. Because UV divergences are a specific type of UV behaviour our conclusions are also relevant to the discussion of whether divergences can appear in decoherence calculations (they can), and how they are renormalized if they do (we argue they can be renormalized in the well-known way appropriate for dealing with composite operators). A preliminary version of this discussion is given in §4. Finally §5 briefly summarizes our conclusions. Appendices B and C provide equivalent and complementary discussions of our example calculations using the Schrödinger picture framework and using the Schwinger-Keldysh framework. 1.1 Theorem: the purity of decoupling In this section we argue that integrating out heavy physics always leads to Hamiltonian evolution (and so in particular cannot change a pure state into a mixed state). This is the benchmark against which we compare various explicit purity calculations in later sections. In an operator language a low-energy theory is obtained by projecting onto a subspace of the Hilbert space defined by energy (or energy plus values of other conserved quantities). We assume that the only measurements of interest lie in the low-energy sector of states having energy E<\Lambda where \Lambda is an arbitrary UV cutoff for the theory. The projection operator onto the low-energy sector is P_{\Lambda}, defined for each energy eigenstate H|E\rangle=E|E\rangle by: \begin{cases}\;P_{\Lambda}|E\rangle=0\quad&\hbox{if}\quad E>\Lambda\\ \;P_{\Lambda}|E\rangle=|E\rangle\quad&\hbox{if}\quad E<\Lambda\end{cases} (1) This satisfies P^{2}_{\Lambda}=P_{\Lambda}. In the low-energy theory the only observables considered have the form, {\cal O}_{\scriptscriptstyle LE}=P_{\Lambda}O\,P_{\Lambda} (2) for some hermitian O and all allowed low-energy states |\Psi(t)\rangle_{\scriptscriptstyle LE}:=P_{\Lambda}|\Psi(t)\rangle satisfy P_{\Lambda}|\Psi(t)\rangle_{\scriptscriptstyle LE}=|\Psi(t)\rangle_{% \scriptscriptstyle LE}\,. (3) In the Schrödinger picture the evolution of states is given in the full theory by |\Psi(t)\rangle=U(t,t_{0})|\Psi(t_{0})\rangle=\exp\Bigl{[}-iH(t-t_{0})\Bigr{]}% |\Psi(t_{0})\rangle\,. (4) Evolution in the effective theory is then given by |\Psi(t)\rangle_{\scriptscriptstyle LE}=P_{\Lambda}U(t,t_{0})|\Psi(t_{0})% \rangle=U(t,t_{0})P_{\Lambda}|\Psi(t_{0})\rangle=P_{\Lambda}U(t,t_{0})P_{% \Lambda}|\Psi(t_{0})\rangle_{\scriptscriptstyle LE}\,, (5) which uses that P_{\Lambda} commutes with H and P^{2}_{\Lambda}=P_{\Lambda}. The evolution operator within the effective theory is therefore U_{\scriptscriptstyle LE}(t,t_{0})=P_{\Lambda}U(t,t_{0})P_{\Lambda}=\exp\Bigl{% [}-iP_{\Lambda}HP_{\Lambda}(t-t_{0})\Bigr{]} (6) which is clearly Hamiltonian evolution, U_{\scriptscriptstyle LE}(t,t_{0})=\exp[-iH_{\rm eff}(t-t_{0})] with H_{\rm eff}=P_{\Lambda}HP_{\Lambda}. When using energy to integrate out states we are guaranteed to have Hamiltonian evolution. So it is an exact statement that pure states always remain pure within the effective theory as time goes by. The interesting question in this case is precisely what H_{\rm eff} looks like when expressed in terms of low-energy fields \phi_{\rm eff}(x)=P_{\Lambda}\phi(x)P_{\Lambda} (and the formalism of EFTs is aimed at identifying this as efficiently as possible – see e.g. EFTBook ). So far so good. But tracing out a sector is not simply a matter of projection. One must also incorporate the probability information that resides in the environmental part of the Hilbert space. To make the issues explicit, consider two uncoupled scalars,222Uncoupled scalars will be regarded as the leading approximation within a perturbative treatment of the more interesting case where the scalars are coupled. a system field \sigma with mass m and an environmental field \phi with mass M\gg m. The total Hilbert space is the product of the space for each field separately: \mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_{\sigma}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{\phi}. If m\ll M projecting out energies E<\Lambda with m\ll\Lambda\ll M is related intuitively to tracing out the heavy field, but strictly speaking the image of the projector P_{\Lambda} in this case includes states with an overlap with \mathcal{H}_{\phi}. An extra step is needed to completely reduce the theory to a single-field Hilbert space. Let us assume that there are no initial correlations between \sigma and \phi. Because of the mass hierarchy m\ll\Lambda\ll M any state including at least one \phi particlelike \widehat{a}^{\dagger}_{\phi}({\boldsymbol{k}})|0\rangle_{\phi}:=|{\boldsymbol{% k}}\rangle_{\phi} has energy \omega_{\phi}\geq M\gg\Lambda, so the only low-energy \phi-sector state is the vacuum |0\rangle_{\phi} defined by \widehat{a}_{\phi}({\boldsymbol{k}})|0\rangle_{\phi}=0 for all {\boldsymbol{k}} (see Figure 1). Figure 1: Distribution of states in \mathcal{H}:=\mathcal{H}_{\sigma}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{\phi} organized in terms of energy, with the red region corresponding to high energy states projected out (i.e. mapped to zero) via the low energy projection P_{\Lambda} defined in Eq. (1). The green region contains the low energy states preserved by the projection P_{\Lambda}. Note crucially that the \phi vacuum |0\rangle_{\phi} is in the low-energy sector. The only uncorrelated low-energy states therefore have the form \rho=\varrho\otimes\Xi_{\phi}\quad\hbox{where}\quad\Xi_{\phi}=|0\rangle_{\phi}% \,{}_{\phi}\langle 0|\,, (7) where \varrho is a density matrix within the low-energy sector of {\cal H}_{\sigma}. Tracing out high-energy states requires both a projection onto energies smaller than \Lambda and the tracing out of the low-energy part of {\cal H}_{\phi} weighted by the vacuum state \Xi_{\phi}: \langle\langle\,\cdots\,\rangle\rangle={\hbox{Tr}_{\rm env}}[(\cdots)\,\Xi_{% \phi}]. Because {}_{\phi}\langle 0|0\rangle_{\phi}=1 we have \rho^{2}=\varrho^{2}\otimes\Xi_{\phi} and so the purity of the full state \rho is completely controlled by the purity of the state \varrho within the \sigma sector. The uniqueness of the low-energy state in the \phi sector guarantees one can project onto the low-energy subspace defined by \mathcal{H}_{\sigma} by tracing over \mathcal{H}_{\phi} without loss of information. The same reasoning also applies to interacting systems provided several key assumptions are valid. First we assume weak coupling so that the state of the system is only perturbatively different from the non-interacting factorized state (7). Second, we assume the time evolution is adiabatic in the sense that it leaves the \phi sector in its instantaneous vacuum state \Xi_{\phi}(t). Third, it is crucial that the projection P_{\Lambda} is defined using only conserved quantities (low energy and perhaps the specification of the value of other conserved charges). These assumptions are required because interactions in general cause energy eigenstates to no longer factorize: |{\boldsymbol{p}},{\boldsymbol{q}}\rangle\neq|{\boldsymbol{p}}\rangle_{\sigma}% \otimes|{\boldsymbol{q}}\rangle_{\phi} for all times. The related requirements \Lambda\ll M and adiabaticity help ensure that this factorization is maintained in practice for low-energy states, and so the process of tracing out the \phi sector at time t_{0} and evolving to time t agrees with the process of evolving from t_{0} to t in the full theory and only then tracing out \phi. This distinction (in the presence of interactions) between \phi and \sigma sectors and energy eigenstates plays an important role in later sections, where use the name decoupled basis for the energy eigenbasis and the name decohered basis defined by tracing out the fields \sigma and \phi. Notice that the adiabatic assumption also allows a deviation from the strict requirement that P_{\Lambda} use only conserved quantities, in particular for situations with time evolving backgrounds for which fluctuation energy is not strictly conserved. In this case, it suffices for states to evolve adiabatically so that there are no quantum jumps to other states from an initial one. Note however if the interacting Hamiltonian is strongly time dependent, then a large number of \sigma particles could be produced, taking states like those in eq. (7) out of the low-energy space of states. This could potentially pose an issue in cosmological settings where the number of \sigma particles created typically scales like e^{aH/k} when m\ll M. Summarizing the above requirements: we ask for a projection based on the eigenvalues of a conserved charge (notably energy) together with a scale hierarchy M\gg m and adiabatic evolution in order to make it worthwhile to reduce the effective number of propagating degrees of freedom and to be able to restrict the heavy-field sector to a unique adiabatic vacuum. These are generic assumptions that are usually required for an effective field theory (EFT) treatment – see EFTBook for details. We also assume a factorizable initial state with no cross-correlation between the two sectors, which is usually true of the perturbative ground state but is not in itself usually an EFT requirement. Under these circumstances the purity of a low-energy state is not changed at all by the process of integrating out heavy physics, as is usually taken for granted when discussing low-energy effective Hamiltonians within an EFT framework. It is this general result that subsequent sections confront with explicit calculations for simple models."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08970v1,Discovery of a Dense Association of Stars in the Vicinity of the Supermassive Black Hole Sgr A*,"We focus on a sample of 42 sources in the vicinity of the bow-shock source IRS 1W (N-sources), located at the distance of 6.05^{\prime\prime} north-east of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), within the radius of 1.35^{\prime\prime}. We present the first proper motion measurements of N-sources and find that a larger subset of N-sources (28 sources) exhibit a north-westward flying angle. These sources can be bound by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) or the concentration that we observe is due to a disk-like distribution projection along the line of sight. We detect the N-sources in H, K_{s}, and L’ bands. The north-westward flying sources could be a bound collection of stars. We discuss a tentative existence of an IMBH or an inclined disk distribution to explain a significant overdensity of stars. The first scenario of having an IMBH implies the lower limit of \sim 10^{4}~{}M_{\odot} for the putative IMBH. Our measurements for the first time reveal that the dense association of stars containing IRS 1W is a co-moving group of massive, young stars. This stellar association might be the remnant core of a massive stellar cluster that is currently being tidally stripped as it inspirals towards Sgr A*. The second scenario suggests that the appearance of the N-sources might be influenced by the projection of a disk-like distribution of younger He-stars and/or dust-enshrouded stars.","The extended radio source Sgr A consists of three components in terms of different radiative and spatial properties: Sgr A East, which is a non-thermal supernova remnant, Sgr A West which is a thermal region associated with the ionized mini-spiral structure, and the compact variable radio source Sgr A * associated with the supermassive black hole (SMBH) of \sim 4\times 10^{6}\,M_{\odot} (Balick & Brown, 1974; Goss & McGee, 1996; Eckart & Genzel, 1996; Ghez et al., 1998; Genzel et al., 2010; Eckart et al., 2017; GRAVITY Collaboration et al., 2019; Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al., 2022; Genzel et al., 2024, and references therein) at the center of the Milky Way. The thermal Sgr A West region or the mini-spiral (Ekers et al., 1983; Lo & Claussen, 1983) is detected as a distinct filamentary structure in near- and mid-infrared bands (Clénet et al., 2004; Viehmann et al., 2006; Mužić et al., 2007; Bhat et al., 2022) as well as in the mm- and radio domain (Zhao et al., 2009, 2010; Moser et al., 2017). It is composed of three clumpy streamers orbiting around Sgr A* that consist of dust and ionized and atomic gas with the dust temperature of \sim 100\,K and the gas temperature of \sim 10^{4} K (Yusef-Zadeh et al., 1998; Kunneriath et al., 2012). A surprisingly large number of massive young stars with the age of a few million years resides in the Milky Way’s innermost half parsec (pc). They form at least one disk-like structure of clockwise orbiting stars (CW) (Genzel et al., 2003; Levin & Beloborodov, 2003). Paumard et al. (2006) also propose the existence of a second disk of counter-clockwise orbiting stars (CCW), which, however, appears to be less populous. The existence of disk-like structures, which can be traced even within the innermost S cluster (Ali et al., 2020), suggests the association of star-formation in the Galactic Center with the accretion disks that formed during the previous enhanced accretion activity of Sgr A*. The mechanism which leads to the presence of young stars with the age of \lesssim 5{\rm Myr} is still not completely understood because there are several factors in the Galactic Center environment that should be inhibiting the star-formation process, such as intense UV radiation and stellar winds, large turbulence, enhanced magnetic field, and the tidal forces from the SMBH (Morris, 1993). This problem is known as the “Paradox of youth” (Ghez et al., 2003), though with the advance of star-formation and dynamical models in galactic nuclei, it has been possible to explain the occurrence of young stars in the Galactic Center, see e.g. Mapelli & Gualandris (2016) for a review. Three plausible scenarios are generally discussed: 1. in-situ star-formation approach, in which stars form in the gravitationally unstable accretion disk or within an infalling molecular cloud that gets shocked due to collisions with the surrounding gas or is tidally compressed (Morris, 1993; Levin & Beloborodov, 2003; Nayakshin et al., 2006; Hobbs & Nayakshin, 2009; Lu et al., 2009; Bartko et al., 2009a; Paumard et al., 2006; Jalali et al., 2014; Bartko et al., 2010); 2. in-spiral star formation approach which claims that the star cluster first starts forming outside the central parsec, e.g. within the circum-nuclear disk or even further away in the central molecular zone. The presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) can shorten the dynamical friction timescale, which needs to be at most a few million years long in order for stars to be still young when they settle around the SMBH (Gerhard, 2001; McMillan & Portegies Zwart, 2003; Hansen & Milosavljević, 2003; Portegies Zwart et al., 2006; Berukoff & Hansen, 2006; Rizzuto et al., 2021; Peißker et al., 2021); 3. rejuvenation scenario, which proposes that late-type stars have undergone collisions with other stars, a dense accretion disc, or a jet, which caused their colder outer layers to be stripped off and made them appear hotter and younger than they actually would be (Morris, 1992, 1993; Genzel et al., 2003; Zajaček et al., 2020). In addition, late-type stars aligned with an accretion disk accrete material from it, which also leads to their rejuvenation by gaining fresh hydrogen (Cantiello et al., 2021). Apart from the cluster of young stars centered around Sgr A* within \sim 0.5\,{\rm pc}, there is a distinct concentration of infrared sources IRS 13 located at the projected distance of \sim 3-4^{\prime\prime} (\sim 0.12-0.16 pc) south-west of Sgr A * (Peißker et al., 2023; Dinh et al., 2024; Peißker et al., 2024). IRS 13 has been studied as a suitable candidate for the first two aforementioned scenarios for the origin of young stars in the central parsec. IRS 13 consists of two components – the northern part IRS 13N and the eastern part IRS 13E. IRS 13N hosts young, infrared-excess sources (Maillard et al., 2004; Eckart et al., 2004; Paumard et al., 2006; Mužić et al., 2008; Eckart et al., 2013). IRS 13E mainly contains massive Wolf- Rayet (WR) stars and the violent supergiant E1(OBI) (Maillard et al., 2004; Moultaka et al., 2005; Paumard et al., 2006), whereas the rest of the stars are fainter ones, identified as late-type stars and are most likely the background stars (Fritz et al., 2010). The velocity dispersion of the IRS 13E sources motivated the speculation about the existence of an IMBH to bind the cluster and thus prevent it from tidal disruption at the given distance from Sgr A*. The required mass of the assumed IMBH was inferred to be about \sim 10^{4}M_{\odot} (Maillard et al., 2004; Schödel et al., 2005). The existence of the prominent X-ray source in the IRS 13E cluster reinforced the discussion about the IMBH. On the other hand, Zhu et al. (2020) argue that a colliding wind scenario between E2 and E4 can explain the X-ray spectrum as well as the morphology of IRS 13E and suggests that there is no significant evidence that IRS 13E hosts an IMBH more massive than \sim 10^{3}M_{\odot}. In general, the occurrence of IMBHs in nuclear star clusters is expected based on dynamical arguments. Rose et al. (2022) propose that dynamical mechanisms operating in galactic nuclei, specifically black hole-star collisions, mass segregation, and relaxation, are particularly effective in the formation of IMBHs of \lesssim 10^{4}M_{\odot}. Their findings imply that at least one IMBH is likely to exist in the central parsec of the Galaxy. Another channel for the occurrence of IMBHs in galactic nuclei is their infall within massive stellar clusters (Spitzer, 1969; Portegies Zwart & McMillan, 2002; Rasio et al., 2004; Fragione, 2022), which directly relates dense stellar associations such as IRS13 with an IMBH. Rose et al. (2022) suggest that the collisions between black holes and stars can contribute to the diffuse X-ray emission in the Galactic Center region. Hence, also a growing black hole inside IRS13E that collides with the surrounding stars could contribute to the X-ray emission of the cluster. Another apparent concentration of stars in the inner parsec of the Galactic Center is associated with the source IRS 1W that is located within the northern arm of the mini-spiral. The mini-spiral contains mostly hot, ionized gas traced by bright Br\gamma emission. Vollmer & Duschl (2000) interpret the kinematics of the ionized gas in the northern arm to be Keplerian. IRS 1W has been studied previously as a bow shock source interacting with the material of the northern arm. Its broad-band infrared continuum emission is consistent with the temperature of \sim 300 K (Tanner et al., 2002, 2003, 2005) suggesting the presence of warm dust in its bow shock. Ott et al. (1999) used the speckle camera SHARP on the New Technology Telescope (NTT) and showed that IRS 1W is an extended source which could be a young star. Previously it was suggested that it could have formed in the northern arm of the mini-spiral or from the accreted gas and dust in the infalling material out of the northern arm. However, due to the current low inferred mass of the minispiral gas of \sim 100\,M_{\odot} it is unlikely that it formed within the northern arm. Tanner et al. (2005) observed IRS 1W alongside IRS 10W and IRS 21 by W.M. Keck 10 meter and Gemini 8 meter telescopes and identified them as bow-shock sources with central sources as Wolf-Rayet stars. The stellar-wind properties and kinematics of IRS 1W are similar to the properties of the clockwise orbiting He emission-line stars. Viehmann et al. (2006) showed that IRS 1W is very red and has a featureless spectral energy distribution (SED). Sanchez-Bermudez et al. (2014) analyzed the bow-shock orientation alongside the proper motion and confirmed that IRS 1W is a Wolf-Rayet star with a bow shock created by the interaction between the mass-losing star and the surrounding interstellar gas. The apparent stellar overabundance in the vicinity of IRS 1W could hypothetically be a stellar cluster similar to IRS 13 that is getting tidally disrupted upon the approach towards the SMBH. We investigate this possibility in more detail in this paper. We focus on the area around IRS 1W that contains 42 sources including IRS 1W. The geometrical center of these sources is situated at 6.24\pm 0.47 arcsec (right ascension) and 0.25\pm 0.42 arcsec (declination) with respect to Sgr A* in 2005.366 epoch within the circular region with a radius of 1.35^{\prime\prime}. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe analyzed datasets in the near-infrared (NIR) domain. The identification of stars associated with IRS 1W that constitute an apparent overabundance in comparison with other fields around Sgr A* is analyzed in Section 3. The NIR photometry colour-colour diagram of the sources is presented in Section 4. Proper motions of the sources are analyzed in Section 5, where the significant stellar concentration with the common proper motion in the north-western direction is identified. We discuss potential clustering scenarios (IMBH-bound cluster or a projected disk-like distribution) in Section 6. Finally, we summarize the main results in Section 7.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08793v1,Dark energy effects on realistic neutron stars,"By considering realistic equations of state (EoSs) to describe the ordinary matter of the stellar crust, in this study, we explore the effect of a dark energy core, made of Chaplygin Dark Fluid (CDF), on neutron stars (NSs). To accomplish this purpose, we solve the stellar structure equations and investigate the impact of the CDF parameters on the several macroscopic properties of NSs such as mass-radius (M-R) relation, and tidal deformabilities of a single star and of a binary system, the latter being of great importance when analyzing gravitational-wave signals coming from the merger of such compact objects. We also present an analysis of the radial oscillation modes for the rapid phase transition, with the aim of distinguishing regions consisting of dynamically stable stars from those of unstable ones. Specifically, our outcomes reveal that an increase in the energy density jump (controlled by a parameter \alpha) leads to an increase in the radial stability of the NS with a CDF core. Furthermore, our theoretical results are consistent with the observational M-R measurements of millisecond pulsars from NICER data and tidal deformability constraints from the GW170817 event.","According to various cosmological observations, our universe is currently undergoing an accelerated expansion phase [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], so that the late-time acceleration is a widely accepted phenomenon nowadays. The standard model of cosmology, also called the “\LambdaCDM model”, is based on cold dark matter (responsible for cosmic structure formation) and cosmological constant \Lambda which is commonly associated with the vacuum density energy of the universe. Such a model is in good agreement with the observational data [8], however, it suffers from coincidence and fine-tuning problems [9, 10]. Since then, many attempts have been proposed to address these issues and the literature therefore offers a variety of models as candidates to describe dark energy [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. A dark energy fluid with negative pressure and positive energy density may be a candidate to describe cosmic acceleration [13], although the exact nature of this dark energy still remains a mystery. In particular, negative pressure can be obtained using quintessence dark energy, where quintessence is more precisely a scalar field [11]. Nevertheless, quintessence model fails to avoid fine-tuning in explaining the cosmic coincidence problem. In that regard, the Chaplygin fluid prescription provides a good alternative to explain the transition from a universe filled with dustlike matter in the early era to an accelerated expansion phase in the late stage [21]. In fact, the Chaplygin gas and its generalized models have been investigated and confronted with different observational cosmological measurements by several researchers [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. If it is assumed that the universe is filled with an exotic form of fluid, described by a Chaplygin-type equation of state (EoS), then dark energy could be present in stellar interiors. In recent years there has therefore been a growing interest in investigating the role of dark energy on the relativistic (internal and/or external) structure of compact objects. As a matter of fact, Anti-de Sitter black holes surrounded by Chaplygin Dark Fluid (CDF) were recently investigated [31, 32, 33], where the existence of a dark fluid described by the Chaplygin gas as a cosmic background is assumed. Additionally, Li and collaborators [34] explored the impact of CDF on the geodesic structure, shadows and optical appearance of a black hole surrounded by various profiles of accretions. In particular, the authors showed that the CDF parameter B plays a crucial role in the formation of optical images of the black hole, by affecting features such as the event horizon radius, photon sphere radius, and the radius of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO)/OSCO. In addition to black holes, the connection between dark energy and compact stars has become an active area of research in the last few years. Indeed, it was shown that Chaplygin-type EoS gives rise to compact-star radii and masses compatible with astrophysical observations [35, 36, 37, 38], and such stars are often referred to as dark energy stars (DESs) [39, 40, 41, 42]. These single-phase models have recently been extended to a hybrid context [43], where dark energy is confined in the core of the compact star while the crust contains baryonic matter. The presence of the dark energy core (made of a CDF) leads to a sizable change in the internal structure of NSs with a polytropic EoS for the external layer. Despite the crust being described by a simple EoS, there is a great possibility that these stars exist in the universe since they are dynamically stable under radial perturbations and because their mass-radius relations are compatible with observational measurements. In this work, we aim to extend this simple toy model of hybrid stars by adopting more realistic EoSs to describe the crust and to investigate the influence of the dark energy core on their tidal deformability which are measurable in the chirp signals of merging NSs. To depict the ordinary matter of the outer layer, we use two well-known models, i.e., the relativistic mean-field (RMF) and the Skyrme one. The arrangement of this paper is the following: in Sec. II we provide both EoSs to depict our hybrid star model, one for the dark energy core and one for the crust made of hadronic matter. We employ parametrizations of two different hadronic models to describe the outer layer so that our stellar model is characterized by four astrophysical parameters \{\rho_{c},\rho_{\rm dis}^{+},\alpha,A\}. We introduce the basic differential equations related to spherically symmetric equilibrium configurations in the theory of General Relativity in Sec. III. We continue our discussion of numerical calculations especially focusing on the mass-radius diagram, tidal deformability, and the radial stability for the rapid phase transition in Sec. IV. In the same section, we compare our theoretical predictions with observational data. Finally, we give a summary and our conclusions in Sec. V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08744v1,The impact of large-scale galaxy clustering on the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation: numerical results,"Pulsar timing array experiments have recently found evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, which induces correlations among pulsar timing residuals described by the Hellings and Downs (HD) curve. Standard calculations of the HD correlation and its variance assume an isotropic background. However, for a background of astrophysical origin, we expect a higher GW spectral density in directions with higher galaxy number densities. In a companion paper, we have developed a theoretical formalism to account for the anisotropies arising from large-scale galaxy clustering, leading to a new contribution to the variance of the HD correlation. In this subsequent work, we provide numerical results for this novel effect. We consider a GW background resulting from mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, and relate the merger number density to the overdensity of galaxies. We find that anisotropies due to large-scale galaxy clustering lead to a standard deviation of the HD correlation at most at percent level, remaining well below the standard contributions to the HD variance. Hence, this kind of anisotropies in the GW source distribution does not represent a substantial contamination to the correlations of timing residuals in present and future PTA surveys. Suitable statistical methods to extract the galaxy clustering signal from PTA data will be investigated in the future.","Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) were used to deliver the first evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background in the nHz band NANOGrav:2023gor ; Reardon:2023gzh ; EPTA:2023sfo ; Xu:2023wog . The correlation of pulsar timing residuals due to the passing of GWs, as a function of the pulsar pair separation on the sky, is usually assumed to be described by the Hellings and Downs (HD) curve Hellings:1983fr .111We note that we use the notion HD curve to refer to the theoretical prediction by Hellings and Downs Hellings:1983fr , while HD correlation corresponds to the observed correlation that is in fact measured in our Universe and might differ from the idealized HD curve. However, it has been recently shown that the stochasticity of GW sources, and the fact that the number of pulsar pairs at a given separation is finite, cause a departure from this idealized curve Allen:2022bjz ; Allen:2022dzg ; Allen:2022ksj ; Romano:2023zhb ; Allen:2024rqk . In these studies, however, the GW sources are assumed to be isotropically distributed. In Ref. Grimm:2024lfj we presented a novel framework to account for the impact of the cosmological large-scale structure on the HD correlation.222Prior to our work in Ref. Grimm:2024lfj , the possibility of anisotropies in the distribution of GW sources in the PTA band has been pointed out in various studies, however either not in the context of the HD correlation Allen:1996gp ; Cusin:2017fwz ; Cusin:2017mjm ; Cusin:2018rsq ; Cusin:2018avf ; Cusin:2019jpv ; Cusin:2019jhg ; Pitrou:2019rjz ; Jenkins:2019nks ; Alonso:2020mva ; renzini2022 , or without targeting the impact on its variance Mingarelli:2013dsa ; Taylor:2013esa ; Gair:2014rwa ; Ali-Haimoud:2016mbv . The detectability of kinematic anisotropies in the SGWB with different PTA experiments has been recently studied in Ref. Cruz:2024svc . Indeed, since galaxies are not isotropically distributed on the sky but cluster to form the large-scale structure, we expect an intrinsic isotropy to be present as well for astrophysical GW sources. The timing residual measured for a given pulsar is linear in the total GW strain in a given direction, due to a superposition of GWs, emitting incoherently by a large number of sources. Such a signal is stochastic for two distinct reasons: first because we cannot predict the properties of the emitted waves (in particular the phases), and second because we cannot predict the distribution of sources. Usually, the second source of stochasticity is ignored: sources are assumed to be isotropically distributed, and there is therefore only one possible realization of the distribution of sources. The HD curve is then defined as the product of the timing residuals of two pulsars, averaged over all realizations of the GW emission. As we have shown in Ref. Grimm:2024lfj , to account for anisotropies in the distribution of sources due to large-scale galaxy clustering, one needs to add an additional average over all possible realizations of the distribution of sources. We considered an ensemble of GW sources in one realization of the universe (i.e. a fixed distribution of sources), and then analyzed how the HD correlation varies from realization to realization. The mean of the HD correlation itself is not affected by clustering, which means that anisotropies in the distribution of sources do not generate a systematic bias. However, the large-scale structure of the Universe induces a variance in the measurement of the HD correlation, quantifying to which amount the measurements in our specific realization of the Universe can differ from the mean.333In this work and in the companion paper Grimm:2024lfj we consider only the effect of clustering (i.e. fluctuations in the distribution of sources) on the variance of the HD correlation, neglecting relativistic effects (due to gravitational potentials and source velocities) that are expected to be subdominant on all scales, see e.g. the calculation in Ref. Cusin:2017fwz ; Pitrou:2019rjz in the context of ground-based detectors. In this work, we numerically evaluate the size of this variance. To do so, we assume that the observed background is given by the GW emission of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the inspiraling phase. For our case study we choose to work with the catalogs of Refs. BarausseCatalogue ; Klein:2015hvg , and we show results for the three population models considered therein: the popIII model based on light growth seeds for SMBHs; and the other two heavy-seed Q3 SMBH models, with (Q3-d) and without (Q3-nd) delays between galaxy merger and SMBH binary merger. We assume that the overdensity of black hole mergers is a biased tracer of the underlying galaxy overdensity, which itself is a biased tracer of the matter distribution. We find that anisotropies due to large-scale galaxy clustering lead to a departure from the HD curve at a sub-percent level, ranging from 0.54% to 2.85% depending on pulsar pair separation, i.e. well below the precision of current PTA surveys NANOGrav:2023gor ; Reardon:2023gzh ; EPTA:2023sfo ; Xu:2023wog . Moreover, it is well below the standard variance calculated in Ref. Allen:2022dzg under the assumption of an isotropic source distribution. This indicates that the clustering of sources can safely be neglected in current and future analyses. In addition to these results, which refer to a single pulsar pair, we also compute the variance related to an (infinite) continuous distribution of pulsar pairs, which we refer to as the irreducible case. Averaging over pairs of pulsars reduces the clustering variance by an order of magnitude, since anisotropies in the distribution of sources affect pulsar pairs at different sky locations differently and are therefore washed out by the average over an infinite number of pulsars. The irreducible and single pair cases provide, respectively, a lower and upper bound on the clustering variance in a real observation with a finite number of pulsar pairs. We compare our results with the approximate computations of the clustering variance derived in Ref. Allen:2024mtn for the pulsar-averaged, i.e. irreducible case. We find that the irreducible clustering variance is, with a relative amplitude of 0.10-0.14\%, an order of magnitude smaller than the upper bound of 1% claimed in Ref. Allen:2024mtn . This difference is due to the different modeling of the clustering correlation of GW sources. Ref. Allen:2024mtn assumes a constant value for the angular power spectrum of galaxy correlations (independent on angular separation) and does not take any redshift dependence into account. In contrast, we are using the clustering correlation predicted in a \LambdaCDM cosmological model, which properly accounts for the non-trivial dependence of clustering correlations on source angular separation and on redshift. Our formalism provides therefore a clear link between our cosmological and astrophysical modeling and the variance of the HD correlation. The remaining part of this paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we describe basic concepts concerning PTAs and galaxy clustering in the context of this work. We also give an overview over different types of variance contributions to the HD correlation introduced in this and previous works Grimm:2024lfj ; Allen:2022dzg , and summarize the analytical results of Ref. Grimm:2024lfj for the clustering variance. Then, in Section III, we present the modeling and catalog reconstruction of the quantity b_{\rm GW}, which relates galaxy density to GW spectral density and modulates the amplitude of the clustering variance. The fact that SMBH mergers are biased tracers of the underlying galaxy and matter fields are discussed as well. Section IV presents the numerical results for the clustering variance obtained in this work. We also describe our numerical methods and provide a comparison to Ref. Allen:2024mtn in this section. Finally, we conclude in Section V. Moreover, in Appendix A, we present the analytical results for the irreducible clustering variance in the case of infinitely many pulsar pairs."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08686v2,The Lense–Thirring effect at work in M87,"Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87∗ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole’s spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole’s external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense–Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post–Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87∗. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense–Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of 0.56\pm 0.02 radians per year of the jet’s one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole’s spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole’s spin axis and the jet’s one stays constant over the years amounting to 1.16^{\circ}, in agreement with its measured value of 1.25^{\circ}\pm 0.18^{\circ}. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet’s angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense–Thirring precessional model.","The focus of this paper is on the so–called Lense–Thirring (LT) effect111In fact, recent historical studies 2007GReGr..39.1735P ; 2008mgm..conf.2456P ; Pfister2014 pointed out that it would be more correct to rename it as Einstein–Thirring–Lense effect; however, the name which has now entered into common use will be used throughout the paper. 1918PhyZ…19..156L ; 1984GReGr..16..711M , arising to the first post–Newtonian (1pN) order of the General Theory of Relativity (GTR), and its applicability to the context of the temporal evolution of the accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBH) lurking at galactic cores.

This paper will confirm it clearly and transparently in a way hopefully understandable to a broader audience not specialized in GRMHD nor in black hole (BH) astrophysics. The present work aims also to build a bridge that confidently unites, on the one hand, the community that deals with celestial mechanics and astrodynamics and, on the other hand, the one that studies astrophysics of compact objects by translating the language used by one into that adopted by the other and vice versa. This should make it easier for the two communities to read each other’s work, potentially stimulating new collaborations. The following physical and orbital parameters are used throughout the paper. G is the Newtonian constant of universal gravitation, while c is the speed of light in vacuum. Furthermore, M is the mass of a localized gravitational field source, whether it is a material body with a physical surface or not, such as a BH, acting as the primary in a gravitationally bound restricted two–body system made of itself and a test particle orbiting it, {\mathchoice{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}}:=GM, is its standard gravitational parameter, R_{\mathrm{g}}:={\mathchoice{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}}/c^{2} is its gravitational radius, \boldsymbol{J} is its spin angular momentum, J is its magnitude, and \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}:=\boldsymbol{J}/J is its spin axis arbitrarily oriented with respect to some asymptotic333It means that, in principle, its inertial nature may be limited by some residual tidal effects due to external gravitational fields; here, they will be considered negligible. inertial reference frame \mathcal{K} centered in the field’s source. For a rotating BH 1970Natur.226…64B , whose external spacetime is believed to be described by the Kerr metric 1963PhRvL..11..237K ; 2015CQGra..32l4006T , it is 1986bhwd.book…..S J=\chi M^{2}G/c, where \chi is a dimensionless number whose (absolute) value ranges from 0 (no rotation, static Schwarzshild BH) to444The aforementioned condition on the dimensionless spin parameter holds only for the Kerr metric. For material bodies, it is generally not satisfied. Suffice it to say that for, e.g., the Earth and Jupiter it is \chi_{\oplus}\simeq 738,\chi_{\jupiter}\simeq 860; for the Sun, it is \chi_{\odot}\simeq 0.2. 1 (maximally rotating BH, or extreme Kerr BH). If \chi>1, a naked singularity without a horizon would occur, implying the possibility of causality violations because of closed timelike curves. It may be worth of recalling that, although not yet proven, the cosmic censorship conjecture 2002GReGr..34.1141P states that naked singularities may not be formed via the gravitational collapse of a material body. The parameter \chi, which can also be viewed as the second characteristic length555Sometimes, the symbol a is used for J/\left(Mc\right) itself, in which case it is dimensionally a length. J/\left(Mc\right) occurring in the Kerr metric 1963PhRvL..11..237K ; 2015CQGra..32l4006T measured in units of the gravitational radius R_{\mathrm{g}}, is usually denoted with a in BH studies. The motion of an uncharged and nonspinning massive particle in the full Kerr metric was described in 1972ApJ…178..347B ; 1972PhRvD…5..814W . Ways to probe possible departures from the Kerr metric in the strong–field regime are discussed, e.g., in 2024arXiv240602454G. As far as the orbit of the test particle is concerned, the semimajor axis is half the sum of its maximum and minimum distances from the primary, so that it characterizes the orbit’s size. In celestial mechanics, it is commonly denoted with a; thus, caution is in order since it may be confused with the BH’s spin parameter. The eccentricity, which determines the shape of the orbit, is usually denoted with e, being 0\leq e<1. A circle of radius a\equiv r_{0} is obtained for e=0 (the maximum and the minimum distances from the primary are identical), while a highly eccentric orbit has e close to unity. In BH studies, e can reach very large values as for many S–type stars revolving around the SMBH in the Galactic Centre (GC) at Sagittarius A∗ (Sgr A∗) 2009ApJ…692.1075G ; 2010RvMP…82.3121G ; 2017ApJ…837…30G . On the other hand, if the test particle is representative of a fluid element of an accretion disk around a SMBH, e is assumed to be zero. The orientation of the orbital plane with respect to \mathcal{K}, or, equivalently, of the orbital angular momentum \boldsymbol{h} of the test particle, is fixed by two angles which, in celestial mechanics, are customarily denoted with I and \mathit{\Omega}. The former, called inclination, is the tilt of \boldsymbol{h} with respect to some direction of \mathcal{K} chosen as reference z axis, and ranges from 0^{\circ} to 180^{\circ}. The orbits characterized by 0^{\circ}\leq I<90^{\circ} are called prograde, while those with 90^{\circ}<I\leq 180^{\circ} are defined as retrograde. Orbits with I=90^{\circ} are said polar since they pass through the poles of the primary. In BH studies, I is usually denoted with \phi and called viewing angle, while the reference z direction is the line of sight (LOS), usually oriented towards the observer 2023Natur.621..711C . The other angle \mathit{\Omega} is the longitude of the ascending node. It lies within the fundamental plane \Pi of \mathcal{K}; the latter one is the reference plane perpendicular to the direction with respect to which I is reckoned; in general, it does not coincide with the primary’s equatorial plane. \mathit{\Omega}, ranging from 0^{\circ} to 360^{\circ}, is counted from the reference x direction to the point on the line of nodes crossed by the particle from below, where the upward direction is that of \boldsymbol{h}; such a crossing point is the ascending node, denoted with \ascnode. In turn, the line of nodes is the intersection of the orbital plane with \Pi. Stated differently, \mathit{\Omega} is the angle reckoned from the reference x direction to the projection of \boldsymbol{h} onto \Pi. In the BH literature, \Pi is the plane of the sky, while \mathit{\Omega} is called position angle (PA) of the sky–projected orbital angular momentum, being denoted with \eta 2023Natur.621..711C . Finally, the orientation of the orbit within the orbital plane itself, or, equivalently, of the line of apsides being the latter ones the pericentre and the apocentre, is determined by the argument of pericentre \omega. It is an angle which ranges from 0^{\circ} to 360^{\circ}, and is reckoned within the orbital plane from the line of nodes towards the ascending node to the point of closest approach. Figure \T@reffigure0 displays a generic Keplerian ellipse, arbitrarily oriented in space and within its orbital plane, with a massive spinning primary located at one of its foci; its spin axis \boldsymbol{\hat{k}} is not directed along any preferred direction. Figure 1: Keplerian ellipse followed by a test particle orbiting an object of mass M located at one of its foci at distance r\left(t\right). The fundamental plane \Pi of the asymptotically inertial reference system \mathcal{K} adopted is shaded in gray. The unit vector \boldsymbol{\hat{k}} of the primary’s spin angular momentum is arbitrarily oriented with respect to \mathcal{K}. The angles I,\mathit{\Omega} and \omega, are the inclination, the longitude of the ascending node and the argument of pericentre, respectively. The ascending and descending nodes are labelled with \ascnode and \descnode, respectively. The unit vectors \boldsymbol{\hat{l}},\boldsymbol{\hat{m}},\boldsymbol{\hat{h}} and \boldsymbol{\hat{P}}, given by Equations (\T@refelle)–(\T@refacca) and Equation (\T@refPi), are clearly visible. The lines of nodes and apsides are shown dashed. Also the true anomaly f\left(t\right), reckoning the instantaneous position of the orbiter with respect to the pericentre, is displayed for completeness. Figure \T@reffigure0b is focussed on the SMBH’s spin axis and the orbital angular momentum. For the sake of convenience, the notation of 2023Natur.621..711C is adopted for the angles determining their orientation in space. Figure 2: SMBH’s spin axis \boldsymbol{\hat{k}} and unit vector of the disk’s orbital angular momentum \boldsymbol{\hat{h}}. The notation of 2023Natur.621..711C is adopted for their angles whose numerical values were chosen here solely for illustrative purposes. If only the Newtonian mass monopole acceleration A_{\mathrm{N}}={\mathchoice{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{m}}}/r^{2} acts on the test particle, where r is its instantaneous distance from its primary, all the aforementioned orbital parameters stay constant. Should some post–Keplerian (pK) accelerations A_{\mathrm{pK}} other than A_{\mathrm{N}} be present, altering the otherwise purely Keplerian motion, then (some of) the orbital parameters undergo steady temporal variations which manifest themselves cumulatively revolution after revolution. Such a picture, which can be traced back to a perturbative scheme, is valid to the extent that the other pK accelerations are sufficiently smaller than A_{\mathrm{N}}. The LT effect is a consequences of the so–called gravitomagnetic field arising from the off–diagonal components g_{0i},\,i=1,2,3 of the spacetime metric tensor g_{\mu\nu},\,\mu,\nu=0,1,2,3, which, in turn, are determined by the mass–energy currents of the source under consideration Thorne86 ; 1986hmac.book..103T ; 1988nznf.conf..573T ; 2001rfg..conf..121M ; 2001rsgc.book…..R ; Mash07 . For a localized rotating object, such as a star or a Kerr BH, the gravitomagnetic field is generated by its angular momentum \boldsymbol{J}. Basically, the LT effect consists of variations of the orientation of both the orbital plane and of the orbit within the orbital plane itself over time 1918PhyZ…19..156L ; 1984GReGr..16..711M ; 2024gpno.book…..I . Instead, the shape and the size of the path are left unaffected along with the time of passage at the pericentre. Attempts to measure them in the Earth’s field with some geodetic satellites 2019JGeod..93.2181P tracked with the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLT) technique SLR11 have been underway for almost 30 years 1996NCimA.109..575C . For different points of view on their reliability and actual accuracy, see, e.g., the reviews 2011Ap&SS.331..351I ; 2013NuPhS.243..180C ; 2013CEJPh..11..531R , and references therein. It should be said that the magnitude of the LT effect around the Earth amounts to a few tens of milliarcseconds per year (mas yr-1), while it is expected to be as large as a few tens of sexagesimal degrees per year ({}^{\circ}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) around M87∗, i.e., more than a million times larger than around our planet. On the other hand, the several competing physical effects of non–gravitational origin which act as sources of systematic bias are generally much more accurately known in the terrestrial scenario than around SMBHs. Other tests of the LT effect were performed also in the fields of Jupiter 2011AGUFM.P41B1620F ; 2024ApJ…971..145D and the Sun 2015IAUGA..2227771P ; Pav2024 ; RussiLT , but they proved to be inconclusive because of the resulting far too large errors and high correlations with other estimated parameters. The only known experiment that has successfully measured a gravitomagnetic effect and which, to date, has not been criticized in the peer–reviewed literature is that conducted by the Gravity Probe B (GP–B) mission Varenna74 ; 2001LNP…562…52E . Indeed, it detected, among other things, the gravitomagnetic Pugh–Schiff precessions Pugh59 ; Schiff60 of the spins of four gyroscopes carried onboard a drag–free spacecraft orbiting the Earth with a 19\% accuracy 2011PhRvL.106v1101E ; 2015CQGra..32v4001E compared to the \simeq 1\% initially expected Varenna74 ; 2001LNP…562…52E . The paper is organized as follows. Section \T@refsect:anal reviews the analytical model of the LT effect, expressed in terms of the both the Keplerian orbital elements and in vectorial form, for a generic orientation of the primary’s spin axis in space. In Section \T@refsec:M87, the results of the previous Section are successfully applied to the case of the measured precession of the jet emanating from M87∗. Section \T@reffine summarizes the findings and offers conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08564v1,Shadow analysis of an approximate rotating black hole solution with weakly coupled global monopole charge,"We investigate the shadow properties of a rotating black hole with a weakly coupled global monopole charge, using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm. This study explores how this charge and rotational effects shape the black hole’s shadow, causal structure, and ergoregions, with implications for distinguishing it from Kerr-like solutions. Analysis of null geodesics reveals observable features that may constrain the global monopole charge and weak coupling parameters within nonminimal gravity frameworks. Observational data from M87* and Sgr A* constrain the global monopole charge and coupling constant to 0\leq\gamma\lesssim 0.036 and -0.2\lesssim\alpha\leq 0, respectively.keywords: Black holes, nonminimal coupling, global monopole charge, Newman-Janis algorithm, shadow PACS numbers: 04.20.Fy, 04.20.Jb, 04.25.-g","Black holes are among the most fascinating astrophysical phenomena predicted by general relativity (GR) and have been central to theoretical and observational research for decades. Observations of M87* [1] and Sgr A* [2] by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration have intensified interest in black holes, allowing us to probe their properties beyond theoretical models. Despite GR’s successes at cosmic scales, it faces significant limitations when addressing quantum effects, topological defects, and certain early-universe phenomena. For instance, GR does not inherently include quantum-scale phenomena or high-energy structures, such as global monopoles, which are predicted by symmetry-breaking mechanisms in various field theories [3, 4]. These monopoles, arising from phase transitions in the early universe, are characterized by a global monopole charge (GMC) that affects spacetime geometry. The presence of the GMC meaningfully alters black hole properties, influencing thermodynamic behavior, stability, and observable features such as photon orbits and shadow boundaries [5, 4, 6]. Studying black holes with a GMC thus offers a valuable connection between gravitational and particle physics, revealing possible limitations of GR and suggesting pathways for developing modified gravitational theories. In fact, topological defects like global monopoles are predicted by grand unified theories and arise from the Kibble mechanism, which links defect formation to the breaking of specific symmetry groups during cosmological phase transitions [7, 8]. A global monopole, resulting from the symmetry breaking of \mathrm{SO}(3) to \mathrm{U}(1), generates a unique gravitational effect that can be modeled by a Schwarzschild-like metric with an additional GMC term. This charge is connected to the symmetry-breaking energy scale and modifies spacetime by introducing a deficit angle, which affects the paths of test particles and the bending of light. Furthermore, the monopole’s core mass can be negative or negligible, leading to a repulsive gravitational effect that produces distinct features in black hole metrics. Furthermore, in modified gravity theories, the gravitational influence of global monopoles has been extensively studied, particularly in models that incorporate matter-curvature coupling [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. A recent study [17] in nonminimally coupled gravity showed that interactions between matter and geometry impart intriguing properties to global monopoles. In particular, the nonminimal coupling yields a positive core mass for the monopole and affects its internal structure, including core size. This study also examined the possibility of a nonminimal global monopole acting as an extra ”hair” for a Schwarzschild black hole. By analyzing geodesic motion and gravitational light bending in the weak coupling regime, the study aimed to identify potential observational signatures of the GMC. This approach enables constraints on the nonminimal coupling and GMC parameters, providing insights into the symmetry-breaking scale. Recent work in Ref. [18] further investigated light propagation in the vicinity of this black hole, proposing observational limits on spacetime parameters. Building on this interest in the impact of GMC on black hole properties, this paper examines the shadow of the rotating counterpart of this black hole. Analyzing the shadow of rotating black holes is essential, as it reveals observational signatures that can help differentiate various gravitational theories and enhance our understanding of spacetime geometry, especially in the presence of exotic features like topological defects. To obtain the rotating solution, we take the static metric introduced above as the seed and apply a modified version of the Newman-Janis algorithm (NJA) [19] to generate the rotating counterpart. This modified Newman-Janis algorithm (MNJA), as presented in Refs. [20, 21], is particularly effective when extended to theories beyond GR, offering improved accuracy and stability in these contexts. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. II provides an overview of the static black hole solution with a weakly coupled GMC, covering its spacetime and causal structure. In Sect. III, we apply the MNJA step-by-step to derive the rotating counterpart of the static black hole. Sect. IV examines the causal structure of the resulting spacetime, including horizon formation under varying black hole parameters, as well as the ergoregions and their evolution in terms of the GMC and coupling constant. Sect. V introduces the Lagrangian formalism and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to study light propagation in the black hole’s exterior geometry. Here, we derive equations of motion for null geodesics and identify conditions for spherical photon orbits, mapping photon regions outside the event horizon and demonstrating the effects of the GMC on these regions. This section also parametrizes the celestial plane for an observer at infinity, enabling shadow boundary plots for several cases and detailed analysis of their properties. To facilitate observational testing, Sect. VI introduces shadow observables and derives their mathematical expressions. We use these to constrain the GMC and coupling constant based on EHT data for M87* and Sgr A*. In Sect. VII, we calculate the black hole’s evaporation rate, considering parameter constraints inferred from EHT data. Finally, we summarize our findings in Sect. VIII. Throughout this paper, we adopt natural units with G=c=1=M_{\rm{pl}}, and use a sign convention of (-,+,+,+), with primes denoting differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08554v1,Blandford-Znajek power as a strong-gravity signature,"The Blandford-Znajek mechanism is an electromagnetic manifestation of the Penrose process that currently constitutes the best theoretical candidate to explain the launching of relativistic jets by black holes. In this talk we offer a modern review about the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and the analytic construction of black hole magnetospheres. Higher order perturbative corrections are crucial in order to produce results that are complementary to numerical simulations when the black hole is in the high-spin regime, and can potentially predict new features about the non-perturbative structure of the Blandford-Znajek theory. Moreover, we show by means of an explicit example that these perturbative corrections depend in a non-degenerate manner on the underlying theory of gravity considered, enabling one to use the BZ power emitted as a strong-gravity signature to test General Relativity against alternative theories of gravity on future horizon-scale observations.","The mechanism responsible for the emission of jets by supermassive Black Holes (BHs) is one of the outstanding questions in the field of relativistic astrophysics. New observational perspectives were recently opened by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), with the potential to shed a new light on the complex interplay of matter and electromagnetic fields subject to the extreme conditions characterizing the BH environment. In fact the observations already revealed some of the features expected to be crucial in the physics of jet emission: the polarized images of M87* produced by EHT confirmed that strong and ordered magnetic fields are present at the horizon scale [1, 2, 3, 4], whereas comparisons with synthetic templates obtained by means of GRMHD simulations fostered models in which the BH is rapidly spinning and the jet is launched via the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism [5]. Since its first theoretical formulation, and well before the strong indications provided by EHT, the BZ mechanism has always been considered a favourite theoretical candidate to explain how relativistic jets are launched and sustained by BHs immersed in strongly magnetised environments, and many research efforts have been devoted to clarify its dynamics and its relevance in BH physics [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. According to our modern understanding, the BZ mechanism is an electromagnetic manifestation of a generalised Penrose process [18, 19], in which the active component operating the energy and angular momentum extraction is a strong magnetosphere that spins together with the BH. The nature of the BZ mechanism is thus deeply rooted in general relativity, and a natural question to ask in this regard is whether strong-gravity signatures can be derived by analyzing the power emitted in this process. In order to address this question it is therefore crucial to clarify which elements contribute to the expression that characterize the BZ power. Intuitively, due to its Penrose process-like nature, it is to be expected that the faster the BH spins the more energy will be available to be extracted. Moreover, since the energy extraction is operated by the magnetic environment in which the BH is immersed, one also expects that the greater is the number of open magnetic field lines penetrating the horizon the more energy can be transfered from the BH to the infinity. A leading order approximation for the BZ power, already derived in the seminal BZ paper [5], is indeed considered to be \dot{E}_{+}\simeq\kappa\left(2\pi\Psi_{H}\right)^{2}\Omega_{H}^{2}, where \kappa is a numerical coefficient associated to the magnetospheric topology, (2\pi\Psi_{H}) represents the flux of open magnetic field lines threading the BH horizon, and \Omega_{H} is the BH angular velocity [20, 11]. The scaling \dot{E}_{+}\sim\Omega_{H}^{2}, in particular, is typically regarded as a distinguishing signature of the BZ mechanism, often employed in numerical investigation to identify the process. Nonetheless, analytical [17] as well as numerical [20] studies agree that for BHs in the high spinning regime the contribution of an additional high-spin factor f(\Omega_{H}) becomes relevant. A more accurate expression for the BZ power extracted that accounts for its presence, thus, reads \dot{E}_{+}=\kappa\left(2\pi\Psi_{H}\right)^{2}\Omega_{H}^{2}~{}f(\Omega_{H})~% {}~{}. (1) The function f(\Omega_{H}) can be computed either numerically, by fitting data extracted from the simulations [20], or analytically by combining perturbative approaches with matched asymptotic expansion schemes [17]. The latter method has been employed to derive an explicit sixth order expression for a split-monopole magnetospheres in the Kerr metric, that has been shown to be featured with logarithmic terms \begin{split}f(\Omega_{H})\simeq 1+1.38(M\Omega_{H})^{2}&-11.25(M\Omega_{H})^{% 4}+1.54|M\Omega_{H}|^{5}\\ &+\Big{[}11.64-0.17\log|M\Omega_{H}|\Big{]}(M\Omega_{H})^{6}+\dots~{}~{},\end{split} (2) and well agrees with simulations even for BHs spinning closely to the Thorne limit [17]. From Eq. (2) one can immediately observe that if the BH is slowly spinning the usual quadratic scaling in \Omega_{H} is recovered as the leading order term of the series. Moreover, numerical indications give support to the fact that f(\Omega_{H}) only weakly dependends on the details of the magnetospheric configuration [20], and thus one can expect the expression above to be characteristic of the BZ mechanism in the Kerr background. Given our current understanding of the BZ mechanism it is natural to ask where the strong-gravity nature of this process manifests at the level of Eq. (1), and whether such an expression enables us to test the Kerr paradigm in future horizon-scale observations at EHT, with the aim of understanding if the BHs emitting relativistic jets are well described by the Kerr metric or not. The main goal here [21] is to motivate and provide theoretical support to the idea that the high-spin factor f(\Omega_{H}) is not only necessary to correctly model the energy extraction for rapidly spinning BHs, but it is also the quantity where the details of the background metric enter unambiguously in the power (1). In this regards we notice that truncating the BZ power at the leading order, \dot{E}_{+}\sim\Omega_{H}^{2}, would not be useful to test the nature of a BH, since the angular velocity \Omega_{H} is typically a quantity degenerate in the parameters that characterize the spacetime metric [22, 21]. We support this hypothesis by exploring analytically a concrete example in which the BZ mechanism operates in the context of an alternative theory of gravity, and by studying how the power extracted deviates from the expression derived in the Kerr metric [21]. As a prototype of a non-Kerr background we consider a stationary and axisymmetric BH solution of Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG) [23] – also known in the literature as MOdified Gravity (MOG) – called Kerr-MOG [24]. STVG constitutes a covariant extension of GR still not discharded by observations, in which an additional repulsive Yukawa potential alters the asymptotic value of the effective gravitational coupling constant compared to its value close to the source. In this way the theory provides a possible justification to phenomena like the galaxy rotation curves without invoking dark matter [25]. We refer the reader to the literature for extensive details about STVG, while here we limit to stress that an additional deformation parameter q=(G_{\infty}-G_{N})/G_{N} enters the Kerr-MOG solution, accounting for deviation from the Newton constant at large scales [24]. Explicitly, the Kerr-MOG metric in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates is given by ds^{2}=-\frac{\Delta_{q}\Sigma}{\Pi}dt^{2}+\frac{\Pi\sin^{2}\theta}{\Sigma}% \left(d\phi-\omega_{q}dt\right)^{2}+\frac{\Sigma}{\Delta_{q}}\,dr^{2}+\Sigma\,% d\theta^{2}~{}~{}, (3) with \Sigma=r^{2}+a^{2}\cos^{2}\theta, \Pi=(r^{2}+a^{2})^{2}-a^{2}\Delta_{q}\sin^{2}\theta, \Delta_{q}=r^{2}-2M_{q}r+a^{2}+q/(1+q)M_{q}^{2} and \omega_{q}=a(2M_{q}r-q/(1+q)^{2}M_{q})/\Pi. The Arnoitt-Deser-Misner mass and angular momentum depend on the deformation parameter q according to M_{q}=(1+q)M and J=aM_{q} [26]. The coordinate singularities are located at r_{\pm}=M_{q}\left(1\pm\sqrt{1/(1+q)-(a/M_{q})^{2}}\right) and the BH angular velocity is \Omega_{H}(q)=a/M_{q}\left(2r_{+}-q/(1+q)M_{q}\right)^{-1}. From here we see that the angular velocity is degenerate with respect to the spin a and the deformation parameter q, and therefore the quadratic scaling that characterize the leading order expression of the BZ power, \dot{E}\sim\Omega_{H}^{2}, is not useful to perform tests on the Kerr paradigm. Having clarified the motivations and the context in which this research proceeds, in the following sections we offer a short review of the BH magnetospheric problem and of the analytic techniques that can be employed to construct consistent models. These approaches can be systematically adapted in non-Kerr backgrounds to derive expression of the BZ power emitted in alternative theories of gravity, as we show in the last section by analyzing the case of a Kerr-MOG BH."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08486v1,"Determining parameters of Kerr-Newman black holes 
by shadow observation from finite distance and spatial infinity","We present a method for determining the physical parameters of a Kerr-Newman black hole through shadow observation. In a system comprising a Kerr-Newman black hole, an observer, and a light source, the relevant parameters are mass M, specific angular momentum a, electric charge Q, inclination angle i, and distance r_{o}. We consider the cases where the observer is at either a finite distance or spatial infinity. Using our method, the dimensionless parameters (a/M,Q/M,i) can be determined by observing the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole from spatial infinity. We analytically prove that the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole observed from spatial infinity is unique, where uniqueness is defined as the absence of two congruent shadow contours for distinct sets of dimensionless parameter values. This method is versatile and can be applied to a range of black hole solutions with charge. Additionally, we show analytically that the shadow contour of a Kerr-Newman black hole observed from a finite distance r_{o} is not unique, meaning that the parameters of a Kerr-Newman black hole at finite distance cannot be determined from shadow observations. This result reveals a new challenge and provides a clear direction for further research on black hole shadows.","A black hole is a fascinating celestial object that serves as the ultimate testing ground for studying the physics of strong gravitational fields. Observing a black hole shadow has long been a significant goal in physics. This shadow is formed when light emitted by matter surrounding the black hole is bent by the black hole’s intense gravitational pull. Recently, Earth-sized very long baseline interferometers achieved a milestone by capturing images of two black hole candidates. The first image captured {\rm M87}^{\ast} EventHorizonTelescope:2019dse ; EventHorizonTelescope:2019uob ; EventHorizonTelescope:2019jan ; EventHorizonTelescope:2019ths ; EventHorizonTelescope:2019ggy ; EventHorizonTelescope:2021bee ; EventHorizonTelescope:2021srq , and the second focused on {\rm Sgr~{}A}^{\ast} EventHorizonTelescope:2022xnr ; EventHorizonTelescope:2022vjs ; EventHorizonTelescope:2022wok ; EventHorizonTelescope:2022exc ; EventHorizonTelescope:2022urf ; EventHorizonTelescope:2022xqj . Both images displayed a prominent ring, marking a major advancement in black hole imaging techniques. However, the darker central region, known as the shadow, has yet to be clearly identified. Further enhancements in observation equipment are needed to resolve these shadows with greater precision EventHorizonTelescope:2019ths . Some researchers suggest that the study of black hole imaging began with the derivation of the shadow contour, which is now known as the apparent shape. The apparent shape of a Schwarzschild black hole was first derived in Ref. darwin1959gravity , followed by that of a Kerr black hole in Ref. Bardeen:1973xx . These foundational studies established the basis of shadow theory. Although these calculations focused on the apparent shapes of simple bare black holes without considering surrounding accretion disks, they highlighted the essential role of the photon sphere. This feature remains significant even in the shadow of a black hole with an accretion disk. Many researchers have explored black hole shadows and methods for extracting physical information, such as a specific angular momentum of a black hole, through shadow observations Hioki:2008zw ; Bambi:2010hf ; Amarilla:2010zq ; Amarilla:2013sj ; Wei:2013kza ; Papnoi:2014aaa ; Wei:2015dua ; Singh:2017vfr ; Stuchlik:2019uvf ; Tsukamoto:2024gkz . In this paper, however, we emphasize that there is still potential to improve the accuracy of measuring black hole parameters via shadow analysis. In particular, further study is needed to determine whether information like a specific angular momentum and electric charge of a black hole can be obtained solely from shadow observations. One way to investigate this possibility is examining whether the map from a parameter space to an image library is injective Hioki:2009na ; Hioki:2022mdg . It has been shown that the map from the parameter space to the apparent-shape library for a bare Kerr black hole is indeed injective Hioki:2009na ; Hioki:2023ozd . Here, the apparent-shape library refers to the set of all possible apparent shapes that can be produced within the framework of the given gravitational theory and model. The result suggests that the dimensionless specific angular momentum and inclination angle of a Kerr black hole can be uniquely determined by observing its apparent shape. Determining (1) whether an object is indeed a black hole, (2) identifying the specific black hole solution, and (3) accurately measuring its physical parameters based solely on shadow images is a challenging problem that requires extensive research. It is essential to generate a wide range of models for relativistic objects, thereby building an apparent-shape library that incorporates diverse parameters. Moreover, investigating the injectivity of the map is critical. If the map is not injective, it indicates the presence of images that correspond to different models and parameter configurations, making it impossible to uniquely determine the model based on shadow observations alone. These research efforts are ongoing, and further studies are necessary. As a first step toward addressing this problem, we assume that the black hole solution of the observed object has been identified, and it must be demonstrated that its parameters can be determined from shadow observations. When the target object is a black hole with three physical parameters (mass, angular momentum, and charge), no method has yet been proposed to uniquely determine these parameters from shadow observations alone, rather than merely constraining them. For this purpose, we assume that the observed object is a Kerr-Newman black hole. The system comprising the Kerr-Newman black hole and the observer includes the physical quantities of mass M, specific angular momentum a, electric charge Q, inclination angle i, and distance r_{o}. We consider both cases in which the observer is at a finite distance and at spatial infinity. For the first time in this paper, we show with a concrete method that the dimensionless parameters (a/M,Q/M,i) can be uniquely determined by observing the shadow when the observer is at spatial infinity. The key point is that the aforementioned map from the parameter space to the image library is injective. This method can be applied to various black hole solutions with charge and is highly versatile. We also show analytically that there is uniqueness in the contour of the black hole shadow when the observer is at spatial infinity. Uniqueness is defined as the absence of two congruent apparent shapes for two distinct dimensionless parameter values. The uniqueness of the apparent shape is the basis of our method for determining dimensionless parameters from shadow observations. Surprisingly, we analytically prove that uniqueness does not hold for the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole when the distance r_{o} of the black hole is finite. This is a different feature from the case of the apparent shape of the Kerr black hole at finite distance Hioki:2023ozd . This will be a problem to be solved in the future when there is an opportunity to observe black holes from a finite distance. It would be interesting to consider what would happen to this point if a more realistic model were considered, such as a black hole with an accretion disk. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we begin the analysis by deriving the null geodesic equations around the Kerr-Newman black hole and describing how to construct an apparent shape from these geodesics. In Sec. III, we present examples of the apparent shapes of the Kerr-Newman black hole at finite distances and then analytically demonstrate the non-uniqueness of these shapes. In Sec. IV, we analytically prove the uniqueness of the apparent shape in Bardeen coordinates. We also propose a method to systematically construct observables that characterize the apparent shape of Kerr-Newman black holes, showing that the dimensionless parameters of the system can be determined from shadow observations. In the final section, we summarize our analysis and discuss future prospects. We use geometrized units, where c=G=1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08407v1,Parameter estimation of protoneutron stars from gravitational wave signals using the Hilbert-Huang transform,"Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are potential multimessenger events detectable by current and future gravitational wave (GW) detectors. The GW signals emitted during these events are expected to provide insights into the explosion mechanism and the internal structures of neutron stars. In recent years, several studies have empirically derived the relationship between the frequencies of the GW signals originating from the oscillations of protoneutron stars (PNSs) and the physical parameters of these stars. This study applies the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) [Proc. R. Soc. A 454, 903 (1998)] to extract the frequencies of these modes to infer the physical properties of the PNSs. The results exhibit comparable accuracy to a short-time Fourier transform-based estimation, highlighting the potential of this approach as a complementary method for extracting physical information from GW signals of CCSNe.","Advanced gravitational-wave (GW) detectors now regularly observe signals from compact binary coalescences, with over 90 detections recorded to date [1, 2, 3, 4]. The anticipated next milestone for these detectors is the first observation of the GW signal from a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). A CCSN is an explosion of a massive star, which leads to the formation of either a neutron star or a stellar-mass black hole. This explosion usually emits electromagnetic waves, neutrinos, and GWs. Although the exact explosion mechanism remains unclear, it is widely believed that most stars undergo neutrino-driven explosions [5, 6]. Current GW detectors, like Advanced LIGO [7], Advanced Virgo [8], and KAGRA [9], are predicted to detect neutrino-driven CCSN explosions occurring within our Galaxy, reaching a distance of \sim 10 kpc [10]. Coherent network analysis of GW signal [11] also highlighted several important hydrodynamic features of CCSN. Next-generation ground-based GW detectors, such as the Cosmic Explorer [12, 13] and the Einstein Telescope (ET) [14], are anticipated to enable the detection of these events from other galaxies, such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. The kHz-band detector NEMO [15, 16] has also been proposed in Australia for studying nuclear physics by observing high-frequency GWs. The detection of GW signals and their neutrino counterparts from supernovae yields valuable insights into the inner core of stars, offering crucial information about the explosion mechanism. Modeling the collapse of the stellar core, the bounce, and the subsequent post-bounce evolution is extraordinarily complicated and computationally expensive. However, remarkable progress has been made in multidimensional numerical simulations of CCSN explosions over the last decade. The characteristics of the GW waveform depend on the properties of its progenitor, such as mass, angular velocity, and equation of state, as well as on how the simulations approximate general relativistic effects and treat neutrino transport. Recent developments in these computations have revealed common characteristics of the CCSN signals. While the current standard burst GW search pipeline, the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) [17, 18, 19], does not rely on specific waveform morphologies, studies have begun to utilize known features of GW waveforms in detection algorithms. In particular, the application of machine learning in detection algorithms [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] has been studied extensively. Machine learning has also been employed to classify equations of state or explosion mechanisms using simulated gravitational waveforms [26, 27, 28, 29]. The GW spectrogram of CCSN explosions highlights a noticeable time evolution of the frequency, increasing monotonically over time. This so-called gravity-mode, also known as g-mode, is believed to be associated with the oscillation of PNSs [30, 31]. Characterizing these modes is essential to enable CCSN asteroseismology using GWs (e.g. [32]). In recent years, numerical simulations have investigated the relationship between the frequency of these modes and the mass and radius of PNSs. In their studies [33, 34], Torres-Forné et al., calculated the relations between each f/g/p-mode and the physical parameters of the PNS. These relations are considered universal, as they are independent of the equation of state or the progenitor mass. Sotani et al. [35] suggest that once we observe a GW signal from a CCSN explosion, we can infer the physical parameters of the PNS by extracting the frequencies of these modes and solving the universal relations. In pursuing this goal, Bizouard et al. [36] developed a method to track the g-mode in a spectrogram to estimate the PNS properties with current or next-generation GW detectors. Powell and Müller [37] proposed a reconstruction approach in the spectrogram domain with Bayesian inference and an asymmetric chirplet model to extract the PNS properties. Bruel et al. [38] extended the study in Ref. [36] by combining the data of a multi-detector network and tracking the g-mode with a LASSO regression algorithm. Moreover, Casallas-Lagos et al. [39] used a neural network regression model to estimate the slope of the high-frequency mode in a CCSN. Accurate extraction of GW frequencies is essential for inferring the physical properties of GW sources. Unlike the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transforms, time-frequency maps produced by the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) [40] are not constrained by the tradeoff between temporal duration and bandwidth—this absence of limitation results in high resolutions along both the time and frequency axes. In this context, the HHT has been explored within the GW research domain, as documented by Camp et al. [41], who recorded the first application of the HHT in GW analysis. Numerous studies have highlighted the HHT’s efficacy in identifying the frequencies of GW signals in addition to its use in detection algorithms. This includes postmerger studies of binary neutron star coalescence [42, 43], binary black hole coalescence [44], and low-frequency modes induced by neutrino-driven convection and standing accretion shock instability (SASI) in a CCSN [45]. In this study, we propose an HHT-based approach for estimating M_{\mathrm{PNS}}/R_{\mathrm{PNS}}^{2} from the g-mode GW signal, where M_{\mathrm{PNS}} and R_{\mathrm{PNS}} denote the mass and radius of the PNS, respectively. Our method integrates the cWB technique [17, 18, 19] and the extraction of the g-mode frequencies using the HHT to solve the universal relations from Refs. [33, 34]. We first apply the method to the GW signal-only case, then test it on signals in the ET’s simulated detector noise, and perform a comparative evaluation of the estimation accuracy with an approach based on STFT. This paper is organized as follows. Section II outlines the data used to evaluate our methodology. Section III details our approach for parameter estimation of PNSs. The results are presented in Sec. IV. Finally, we conclude our study in Sec. V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08114v1,Black-hole evaporation for cosmological observers,"In the present work, evaporation of a black hole immersed in a de Sitter environment is considered. Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime is used to model the process in a scenario of accelerated expansion of the Universe. The role of observers is highlighted in the development and Hayward thermodynamics for non stationary geometries is employed in the description of the compact objects. The results of the proposed dynamical model are compared with the usual description based on stationary geometries, focusing on primordial black holes (PBHs). It is found how the timescale of evaporation depends on the choice of a cosmological observer. It may differ substantially from the treatment based on stationary models for black holes. In particular, the standard assertion that there is a fixed initial mass just below 10^{15}\,\text{g}\sim 10^{-18}M_{\odot} for the PBHs which are ending their evaporation process today is imprecise, even when possible quantum corrections at the late stages are not considered. Deviations from this prediction appear when the evaporation is measured with respect to the cosmological time.","The formation of compact objects in the primitive Universe has been studied extensively Ambartsumian ; Ambartsumyan-Saakyan ; Novikov1 ; Novikov2 ; Hawking:1971 , leading to the possible existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) carr-spectrum ; Novikov3 . Nowadays, black holes have turned into directly observable objects, as shown by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration Akiyama:2019bqs , and a new observational window for the early Universe has opened. If PBHs exist, mergers of them would be a possible source of gravitational waves as it was suggested by Nakamura, Thorne et al. Nakamura_1997 or, most recently, by Raidal et al. Raidal_2017 and Sasaki et al. sasaki2018primordial . In addition, one of the possible scenarios considers that the LIGO detection GW150914 Abbott:2016blz corresponds to a merger of PBHs of a binary system Sasaki:2016 . In fact, the idea that PBHs may account for all or even a portion of the dark matter in the Universe is under debate, with new suggestions for PBH mass spectra being discussed carr-silk . More recently, it was also proposed that the excess of microlensing events in the 5-year Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment data and the anomalous orbits of trans-Newtonian objects could be interpreted as a new population of dark objects (predicted to be PBHs) Scholtz:2019csj . Moreover, new observations of unusually massive galaxies in early epochs of the Universe (z\gtrsim 10) by the James Webb Space Telescope were made Yan:2022sxd ; Labbe:2022 ; Finkelstein:2022 ; Atek:2023 . They could be explained by PBHs liu2022accelerating ; Yuan:2023bvh , increasing the interest in black holes within cosmological settings. Fundamentally, black holes are dynamical objects, either due to the accretion of matter content that crosses their event horizon or because of the semiclassical phenomenon of Hawking radiation. Thus, black holes are actually never stationary, although they are frequently modeled by stationary geometries if their mass variation is small. In addition, the black-hole background can be dynamical. For instance, considering a PBH formed during the radiation dominated era, it will evolve during the expansion of the Universe, eventually reaching the period when the cosmological constant dominates saida2007black . Nevertheless, despite their dynamic evolution, the evaporation of PBHs is typically treated using models based on the Schwarzschild geometry. These static treatments predict a PBH lifetime of the order of carr2021constraints ; calmet2014quantum \frac{G^{2}M_{0}^{3}}{\hbar c^{4}}\sim 10^{64}\bigg{(}\frac{M_{0}}{M_{\odot}}% \bigg{)}^{3}\ \text{yr}\,, (1) where M_{0} is the initial mass of the PBH. More precisely, Eq. (1) refers to the proper time measured by a static observer at (asymptotically flat) infinity. This model results in the important prediction that PBHs originated with an initial mass smaller than 10^{15}g would have already evaporated completely by now. However, due to the accelerated rate of expansion of the spacetime, deviations from this prediction are expected. In the present work, we are interested in the Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime, derived by R. Mallet in 1985 mallett1985radiating . As the Vaidya spacetime generalizes Schwarzschild for a black hole with accretion or emission of radiation, the Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime is an analogous generalization of Schwarzschild-de Sitter. It describes a black hole emitting (or accreting) photons immersed in a universe dominated by a positive cosmological constant. We will employ the Vaidya-de Sitter solution to model Hawking radiation, following an approach used in hiscock1981models ; hiscock1981modelsII discussing Vaidya geometry in the context of black-hole evaporation. Underlying this proposal is the fact that the dynamics of a PBH should assume neither a static nor a pure de Sitter description of the Universe. These two scenarios are considered to be the extremes of a spectrum of possible PBH models. To see how the usual Eq. (1) might fail, we propose to explore the other side of the spectrum, where the expansion rate is maximized. Deviations between the models can be expected to become more prominent in the later future, when the de Sitter description should be more appropriate. The Vaidya-de Sitter geometry has the drawback of having its simplest form in Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates berezin2017vaidya . In an asymptotically flat spacetime, the advanced and retarded time coordinates may coincide with the proper time of an observer infinitely distant, for instance, in Schwarazschild and Vaidya. But, in a cosmological background, those time coordinates have no direct cosmological meaning. In order to get around this problem, we link Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates in Vaidya-de Sitter to the time measured by cosmological observers comoving with the natural expansion of the Universe. These will replace the usual static observers in the Schwarzschild model. Based on the Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime, an evaporation model for black holes in a de Sitter background is constructed and the evolution of those compact objects are analyzed from the point of view of cosmological observers. The developed tools are applied to the estimation of PBH lifetimes. In the present work, an important tool is Hayward’s proposal for a black-hole thermodynamics. This development started with generalized laws for black hole mechanics hayward1994general , which were derived considering trapping horizons as the boundary of black holes. Subsequently, the proposal generalized the Bekenstein-Hawking thermodynamics for spherically symmetric dynamic spacetimes hayward1996gravitational ; hayward1998unified ; hayward2009local . Within this framework, dynamical spacetimes, such as Vaidya-de Sitter geometry, can be thermodynamically treated. We employ Hayward’s thermodynamics in the physical characterization of black-hole evaporation, including an analysis of the generated Hawking atmosphere. The structure of this paper is presented as follows. In section II, some main features of Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime are reviewed, focusing on the points that are relevant to the present work. In section III, a link between the cosmological time and Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates is established. A relativistic model for the black-hole evaporation in Vaidya-de Sitter is constructed in section IV. The family of “cosmological observers” introduced in the present work is discussed in section V, and in section VI the evaporation model is explored and compared to the usual static model applied to PBHs. In particular, it is shown how PBH evaporation timescales depend on the cosmological observer. Final comments are presented in section VII. Details of a relevant coordinate transformation are presented in Appendix A, and in Appendix B a thermodynamic analysis of the region outside the black hole is conducted. In this paper, we use signature (-,+,+,+)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08089v1,Charged Binaries in Gravitational Tides,"Next-generation low-frequency interferometers are expected to detect binary systems near supermassive black holes, where tidal effects can alter significantly the binary’s motion. This motivates a broader investigation of how external gravitational fields influence the dynamics of physical systems. In this work, we consider a charged black hole binary system subject to a gravitational tide. We first construct a stationary gravitational tide acting on a dyonic Reissner–Nordström black hole and, focusing on the extreme mass-ratio limit, we analyze the motion of a test particle. By calculating the particle’s secular Hamiltonian, we obtain the ISCO and light ring tidal shifts in terms of explicit functions of the binary’s parameters. Our results show that tidal corrections are suppressed as the black hole’s charge increases, but they persist in the extremal limit yielding a finite contribution. This work paves the way towards studying tidal effects on other charged systems, such as topological stars.","The strong-field regime of gravitation has remained both fascinating and elusive for decades. Its most fundamental prediction, black holes, have challenged our deepest ideas about the structure of spacetime and remain at the core of gravitational physics since their theoretical discovery. The fact that gravitational wave astronomy provides a direct channel of observation into such regime of gravity is, consequently, an important milestone in science and motivates studying the effect of strong gravitational fields on physical systems. In particular, understanding the response of self-gravitating systems to slowly-varying tidal fields has proved being very valuable. On the one hand, the deformability properties of stars under gravitational tides reveal information about their structure and can be used, for example, to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter [1, 2, 3]. On the other hand, quite intriguingly black holes exhibit no response to external tides,111In fact, this is true not only for gravitational tides but also for other kinds of fields, like scalar or electromagnetic ones. More exotic environments or curvature corrections can, however, yield nonvanishing tidal responses [4, 5]. a fact that is made somehow precise by showing that their tidal Love numbers vanish [6]. Given that in a binary merger tidal deformations can leave imprints in the last stages of the inspiral phase, this can be used to learn about the nature of the binary’s constituents. Another paradigmatic way of understanding tidal deformations is via the motion of test fields (say, a test particle) in the vicinity of the deformed object. This is, in fact, a case of astrophysical relevance as next generation interferometers are expected to observe black hole binary systems next to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) [7, 8, 9, 10]. An interesting case is when the binary itself has one component much larger than the other, thus yielding a hierarchical triple. These type of systems have been intensively studied in the literature in the Post Newtonian (PN) approximation, where each of the three objects is treated as a test particle, but still keeping the hierarchical regime [11, 12, 13, 14]. However, through processes like the migration trap mechanism, the binary systems may be placed only a few Schwarzschild radii away from the SMBH [15, 16, 17], in which case the PN expansion ceases to hold. In some sense, these systems generalise Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) by endowing the secondary with structure (it gets replaced by another EMRI), and accounting for strong field effects requires a computation in full General Relativity (GR). A first step towards understanding the effect of strong external fields on EMRIs was performed in [18, 19, 20] where, in particular, the smallest object of the triple behaves like a test particle evolving on a tidally deformed black hole. Another interesting situation is the one examined in [21] where it is shown how strong gravitational effects modify the dynamics of a binary system of black holes with comparable masses. In general, it is important to understand from a theoretical point of view the behaviour of self-gravitating systems when subject to external tides. While Love numbers have been studied for a wide variety of objects and theories, the behaviour of matter surrounding the deformed object has remained less explored. In this paper we consider the motion of test particles in the vicinity of a tidally deformed black hole carrying both electric and magnetic charge (a dyonic black hole). In particular, we analyse the dependence on the hole’s charge of the tidal deformations to the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) and the light ring. Being well defined both physically and mathematically, charged black holes have been largely explored in the literature of theoretical astrophysics for decades and yielded very valuable lessons [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. In fact, while typically black holes are expected to quickly neutralise by either friction with interstellar medium or Schwinger pair-decay, there are physical mechanisms that allow them to retain their charge (although small) [28]. Assuming they are near-extremal, charged black holes could constitute a significant fraction of dark matter [29] or, alternatively, their charge could be due to minicharged dark matter, hidden vector fields [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39] or magnetic monopoles [40, 41, 42, 43]. In the latter case one has magnetic black holes, which have gained a lot of attention recently. When interacting with charged matter they behave drastically different than their electric counterparts, and this can be seen at several levels including the binary dynamics [44, 45, 46, 47], black hole superradiance [48], hairy black hole solutions [49, 50], and other physical processes (see [51] and references therein).222For magnetic black holes in some dark matter models see [52]. In addition, some well-defined models of horizonless compact objects, such as topological stars [53] (see also [54, 55]), exhibit charges of magnetic type. These are interesting, yet more complicated, solutions so solving the black hole case first is an instructive example. Finally, given that charged black holes do also share some similarities with rotating ones, such as the existence of an extremal limit, the results in the charged case may anticipate the behaviour in the more complicated scenario where the black hole carries angular momentum. This paper is organised as follows. In Sec. 2 we construct the metric for a tidally deformed dyonic Reissner–Nordström black hole. The leading order (quadrupolar) solution is then used in Sec. 3 to study the dynamics of a test particle moving in such a background. In particular, we focus on the secular effects induced by the tidal deformation and we derive the secular Hamiltonian for the test particle. As an application of our approach, in Sec. 4 we determine how the tidal deformation modifies the location and properties of the ISCO (for neutral and charged particles) and of the light ring. Finally Sec. 5 contains our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08873v1,"A consistency relation for induced 
gravitational wave anisotropies","We show that the anisotropies in the spectrum of gravitational waves induced by scalar modes after the end of inflation in canonical, single-field models are completely determined by the tilt of the scalar and tensor power spectra. The latter contains information about anisotropies produced due to the propagation of the tensor modes in an inhomogeneous Universe, whereas the former represents the anisotropies generated at the time of production and arise only when non-Gaussian corrections to the angular power spectrum are considered. Our proof takes into account all scalar interactions in the cubic inflaton Lagrangian.","I INTRODUCTION Upon expanding Einstein’s equations to second order in perturbations, one finds that gravitational waves are sourced by terms quadratic in scalar modes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The physics of these scalar-induced gravitational waves has been thoroughly explored in recent years, see e.g. [6] for a pedagogical review. This mechanism of gravitational wave production becomes particularly relevant in models which feature an enhancement in the scalar power spectrum. For instance, in the context of single-field inflation, an inflection point in the potential can lead to a phase of ultra-slow-roll in which the field slows down and the power spectrum develops a sharp feature, which then translates into a peak in the frequency spectrum of gravitational waves. This class of models is motivated by the fact that an enhanced scalar spectrum leads to large density fluctuations which later collapse into primordial black holes, compact objects that could account for the entirety of dark matter. Other cosmological sources (such as phase transitions or topological defects) can also produce a peak in the spectrum, however, and a key question that remains open is whether one can use other observables to distinguish between different signals. One possibility is to use anisotropies in the gravitational wave background. Astrophysical sources typically produce anisotropies that are much larger in amplitude than those due to cosmological sources, making them a key observable in determining the origin of the signal. Significant efforts have been devoted recently to search for these anisotropies in Pulsar Timing Arrays [7, 8], but measuring them is a difficult task 111For instance, even an isotropic background could produce large anisotropies due to interference between different sources [30].. Scalar-induced gravitational waves represent one of the main candidates for new physics in this context [10, 11] and thus understanding their anisotropies is of paramount importance for these analyses. Since gravitational waves are generated locally (once the large scalar fluctuations that source them re-enter the horizon after inflation), one would expect distant patches in the sky to be essentially uncorrelated, and therefore for the corresponding anisotropies to be volume-suppressed. Although generally speaking this argument is correct, non-Gaussianities provide a way out of this issue. For instance, anisotropies induced by non-Gaussianities of the local kind (that is, when the curvature perturbation \mathcal{R} can be written as \mathcal{R}=\mathcal{R}_{\rm G}+f_{\rm NL}\mathcal{R}_{\rm G}^{2} for some Gaussian variable \mathcal{R}_{\rm G}) were considered in [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], where it was shown that, since the product \mathcal{R}_{\rm G}^{2} becomes a convolution in Fourier space, it is possible for two short-wavelength modes to conspire and create a long-wavelength one, effectively correlating distant patches 222The non-Gaussian correction to the gravitational wave frequency spectrum have also been considered in [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39].. As shown in [19], the argument also holds when other types of non-Gaussianity (e.g. those that arise due to the self-interactions of the inflaton) are considered. The goal of this work is to show that, in canonical, single-field models of inflation, anisotropies are completely determined by the tilt of the scalar and tensor spectrum on small scales. Concretely, let us anticipate that we find the coefficients C_{\ell} for the angular power spectrum of the gravitational wave density contrast \delta_{\rm GW} are given by [13, 17] C_{\ell}(q)=\frac{2\pi\mathcal{P}^{\rm L}_{\mathcal{R}}}{\ell(\ell+1)}\bigg{\{% }\frac{\Omega_{\rm NG}(q)}{\Omega_{\rm GW}(q)}+\frac{3}{5}\bigg{[}4-\frac{% \partial\log\Omega_{\rm GW}(q)}{\partial\log q}\bigg{]}\bigg{\}}^{2}. (1) where \Omega_{\rm GW} is the induced gravitational wave energy density, \mathcal{P}^{\rm L}_{\mathcal{R}}\sim 10^{-9} is the long-wavelength scalar power spectrum on CMB scales, and the term \displaystyle\Omega_{\rm NG}(q)=-\frac{1}{12}\int\frac{d^{3}p}{(2\pi)^{3}}% \frac{1}{2\pi^{2}q}\Big{[}{\bm{p}}\cdot{\bm{e}}^{s}({\bm{q}})\cdot{\bm{p}}\Big% {]}^{2}\frac{(2\pi^{2})^{2}}{p^{3}|{\bm{q}}-{\bm{p}}|^{3}} \displaystyle\;\frac{q^{2}}{a^{2}H^{2}}\overline{I_{q}(p,|{\bm{q}}-{\bm{p}}|)^% {2}}\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}(|{\bm{q}}-{\bm{p}}|)\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}(p)% \frac{d\log\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}(p)}{d\log p} (2) is identical to the usual expression for the scalar-induced \Omega_{\rm GW} (see the following section for our notation and conventions), but where the integrand is modulated by the tilt of the scalar spectrum on small scales. The above equation is the main result of this paper and shows that, in single-field models of inflation, the non-Gaussian corrections to the angular power spectrum only appear in one specific combination, namely, the scalar bispectrum in the squeezed limit, which can then be related to the tilt of the scalar spectrum by using Maldacena’s consistency relation [20, 21]. Previous works studying non-Gaussianties of the local kind can therefore be thought of as particular cases of this equation (if we restrict our attention to single-field models, for which the consistency relation in [20, 21] holds). This relation was first discussed in [19], where non-Gaussianities induced by the inflaton self-interactions were considered. Here we show that this is not an accidental result, and in fact is a general relation which we obtain by considering the full single-field cubic Lagrangian in our proof."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08858v1,Symmetry Operators and Gravity,"We argue that topological operators for continuous symmetries written in terms of currents need regularization, which effectively gives them a small but finite width. The regulated operator is a finite tension object which fluctuates. In the zero-width limit these fluctuations freeze, recovering the properties of a topological operator. When gravity is turned on, the zero-width limit becomes ill-defined, thereby prohibiting the existence of topological operators.","In recent studies, symmetry has taken center stage in many different and seemingly unrelated arenas of physics. This stems from the novel observation that symmetry structure is encoded in the properties of topological operators, i.e., operators which commute with the energy-momentum tensor, and hence for which correlation functions are insensitive to small deformations of their position Gaiotto et al. (2015). Excitingly, this generalization of symmetry brings to bear a rich mathematical structure, dubbed categorical symmetries, in the study of quantum systems. The implications of these developments have injected new life in the study of fundamental physics, with important consequences yet to be uncovered. On the other hand, it is widely expected that UV complete theories of gravity cannot admit any conserved charges Hawking (1976); Banks and Seiberg (2011); Coleman (1988); Giddings and Strominger (1988); Abbott and Wise (1989); Coleman and Lee (1990); Kallosh et al. (1995); Arkani-Hamed et al. (2007); Harlow and Ooguri (2019, 2021). This leads to a curious paradox involving quantum field theories – which can emerge as low-energy limits of gravitational theories – and quantum gravity. This paradox can be further articulated with the following question: what is the fate of conservation laws in field theories when embedded in gravity from a bottom-up perspective, and how do they emerge from the top-down perspective in decoupling limits of gravity? In the context of generalized symmetry, this question can be formulated as: what is the fate of topological operators in the presence of gravity? Note that here, we wish to study the fate of operators measuring charge instead of charge conservation. In this paper, we provide a concrete perspective on how to address this question and set the stage for analyzing its broader implications in gravity. Quantum field theories often admit a wide class of extended objects, such as solitons, domain walls, defects, and topological operators to name a few. We can study their role in QFT by their explicit insertion in the path integral. Often, this is done at the level of the fields by considering special boundary conditions, or interfaces where the fields undergo non-trivial transformations. This perspective is usually taken in the study of solitonic objects, which are finite energy configurations. From the point of fields, one can study the role of the collective coordinates in the world-volume dynamics of the objects Tong (2005). A particular class of collective coordinates that is always present corresponds to the Goldstone modes associated to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of spacetime symmetries due to the insertion. These are most easily understood from the explicit choices of boundary conditions at the level of the fields. These modes constitute a universal sector of the world-volume dynamics of solitons, and therefore are integral to any effective field theory description of these objects. \rightarrow Figure 1: A regulated topological defect acquires a non-zero width \lambda and fluctuates. In this paper, we wish to study the insertion of topological operators similarly as solitons 111Throughout this paper we use the terms “operator” and “defect” interchangeably, since we are working with QFTs that are defined in Euclidean space.. This is achieved by considering field configurations whose asymptotic values are related by a symmetry transformation, as depicted in Figure 1. The “soliton” interpolates between the two field configurations, has a finite width and supports an effective field theory for the collective coordinates. We will characterize the limit wherein the “soliton” recovers a topological operator. We expect decoupling or freezing of the collective modes in such a limit. An important difference between solitons and topological operators is that the former are finite energy configurations, while the latter have vanishing stress tensor. The above solitonic picture regulates the insertion of the operator. We first discuss why a choice of regulator is needed in the case of continuous symmetries with Noether currents. Once established, we assume a definition of topological operators in field theory as solitons in general, including those that generate finite symmetries. This approach to defining topological operators will set the stage for how we study their fate in gravity. In particular, our objective will be to demonstrate that the collective coordinates cannot freeze or decouple when G_{\rm N} is small but non-vanishing. In string theory, a quantum theory of gravity, there are studies of symmetries that have shed light on how topological operators can emerge in the decoupling limit of gravity. For example, in García Etxebarria (2022); Apruzzi et al. (2023) it was demonstrated that the topological sector of branes in string theory (i.e., the Wess-Zumino terms in the low energy effective worldvolume action) yield topological operators in field theories constructed both using geometric engineering and AdS/CFT duality. This approach to studying branes as topological operators was further explored in Bah et al. (2024); Apruzzi et al. (2024); Heckman et al. (2022, 2023a); Cvetič et al. (2024); Heckman et al. (2024); Waddleton (2024). The main lesson from these works is that extended non-topological defects in the string theory can become topological operators in the decoupling limit of gravity. In particular, the kinetic terms of the collective coordinates of the branes freeze when G_{\rm N} is taken to zero. This top-down result motivates the present paper in asking if, from a bottom-up perspective, we can see the collective coordinates come alive in a universal way independent from string theory. Our goal is to demonstrate that there is a universal sector, associated to Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken spacetime symmetries, that is necessarily dynamical in presence of gravity. In Section II, we explore our prescription for defining topological operators in some examples and understand how the collective coordinates freeze. We consider simple scalar field theories with 0-form symmetries, and the electric 1-form symmetry in Maxwell theory. We then couple these theories to gravity in Section III and demonstrate how the topological limit is ill-defined."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08854v1,Stochastic inflation and non-perturbative power spectrum beyond slow roll,"Stochastic inflation, together with the \Delta N formalism, provides a powerful tool for estimating the large-scale behaviour of primordial fluctuations. We construct a numerical code to capture the non-perturbative statistics of such fluctuations and test our code to obtain the exponential non-Gaussian tail of the curvature perturbations. We provide a numerical algorithm to compute the non-perturbative curvature power spectrum and apply it to slow-roll (SR) and ultra-slow-roll (USR) single-field models of inflation. For the USR case, we successfully reproduce the peak in the power spectrum, which agrees to a certain accuracy with the perturbative power spectrum. We highlight some important differences between non-perturbative and perturbative approaches that may suggest the inconsistency of the \Delta N formalism at the transition stages between attractor and non-attractor regimes.","Despite uncountable criticism and lack of smoking gun proof, inflation stands as arguably the most established theory explaining the creation of primordial perturbations that gave rise to inhomogeneous structures in the present universe, even decades after its discovery [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]. A number of predictions have been successfully verified by either ground-based or space-based missions viz. the flat geometry of the spacetime at very large scales [5, 6], statistical homogeneity, isotropy and scale invariant adiabatic primordial density perturbations from observing the spatial temperature anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [7, 8, 9], with forthcoming measurements in line to detect and measure the primordial gravitational waves from B-modes of the CMB [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Several inflationary models with a slow-roll (SR) attractor solution have been devised that give rise to scale-invariant Gaussian perturbations [15, 16, 17, 18]. On the other hand, a non-attractor regime in the inflaton potential can be featured by introducing a flat region in the potential, leading to an Ultra-Slow roll (USR) regime, which enhances the perturbations by many orders of magnitude at the scales yet unprobed by the present measurements. An important consequence of this is that such large fluctuations could undergo gravitational collapse after re-entering the horizon post-inflation resulting in Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. Since the detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers by the LIGO-VIRGO collaboration [28, 29], many eyes have turned towards PBHs as potential candidates. The possibility that PBHs could contribute to a notable fraction of present dark matter density has still not been ruled out, given that there are still some unconstrained mass windows [30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. Moreover, such large scalar perturbations couple to tensor perturbations at second order in perturbation theory, resulting in the generation of Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves that might serve as a viable explanation for the recent detection of stochastic gravitational wave background by Pulsar Timing Array [35, 36, 37] from several collaborations of NANOGrav worldwide [38, 39, 40]. It is known that the large amplitude fluctuations resulting from USR models may not follow strict Gaussian statistics. The assumption of Gaussianity could have serious implications in computing the abundance of PBHs, which form from rare large fluctuations and hence, are susceptible to the tail of the probability distribution of the curvature perturbations [41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. Stochastic inflation was introduced to incorporate the non-linear effects resulting from the influence of the quantized small-scale modes of the field fluctuations on the large-scale dynamics of the expanding background, also called quantum diffusion [46, 47, 48, 49, 50]. The stochastic approach treats the overall volume in Fourier space as large-scale modes that have classicalized substantially and small-scale modes quantum modes that influence the large-scale modes every time they cross the threshold. Another complementary tool in the non-perturbative bucket is the separate universe approach, popularly known as the \Delta N formalism [51, 52, 53, 54], that tracks the evolution of the independent super-Hubble locally FLRW patches and relates their differences in expansion rate to the equivalent large scale curvature perturbation, leading us to the perturbations without solving the linearized perturbed Einstein equations [55, 56]. When the \Delta N formalism is applied after infusing the quantum diffusion effects onto the classical background evolution, the method is called stochastic \Delta N formalism. Lately, numerous works have studied non-perturbative statistics via stochastic inflation for both SR and USR models of inflation. It was shown in [57, 58, 45, 59, 60, 61] that the tail of the probability distribution of the curvature perturbation exponential non-Gaussianity, thus predicting a much higher PBH abundance when compared with the Gaussian counterpart. Moreover, [62, 63, 64] applied importance sampling technique to significantly speed up the computation of the tail of the distribution by cherry-picking more rare realizations. On the other hand, a non-perturbative framework of computing the curvature power spectrum has also been coined [65, 66, 67] and also for higher correlators [68]. It has been exhibited that quantum diffusion effects on the power spectrum of USR models lead to significant deviations from the linearized treatment in the beyond SR models [69, 70, 71, 72, 73]. At this stage, it is important to highlight two specific works due to their proximity to our results. First, Ref. [69] analyzes quantum diffusion effects during a non-attractor phase beyond slow-roll for several realistic inflationary models, and shows the impact of stochastic noise from sub-Hubble modes, computed using an approximation, on the curvature power spectrum at the end of inflation. For this purpose, they compute the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation numerically over a quantum-corrected background. Moreover, they set up a statistical distribution of the field velocity by running many realizations of stochastic inflation using the Kramers-Moyal equation, a generalized form of the Fokker-Planck equation, again using the simplistic approximation of the noise variance. On the other hand, Ref. [70] computes the correlators of the field perturbations via the time derivative of the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation and numerically solves for the system of equations. The power spectrum is obtained as a time derivative of the two-point correlators without simulating many stochastic realizations. Our work is different from both of them in regards that we treat our model via the Langevin equations of linear order, and numerically simulate the inflationary regime taking into account the stochastic background evolution. We repeat this for several realizations to catch the first passage time of the field through its value at the end of inflation in each of them. Finally, we make use of the \Delta N formalism to first study the probability distribution of the curvature perturbations and then the non-perturbative power spectrum using the algorithm explained in Section 5. To the best of our knowledge, such a numerical implementation of the non-perturbative scalar power spectrum, accounting for the numerical evolution of the stochastic noise, has not been done in the context of USR models. This paper is drafted as follows: In Section 2 we summarize the picture of a homogeneous FLRW universe with the first-order perturbations over it. In Section 3 we give a formal intuition of stochastic inflation, \Delta N formalism and collect the important equations. Section 4 is reserved for testing our numerical code to obtain the probability distribution of perturbations and check it against the known results. Our main results are presented in Section 5, where we elucidate the numerical approach to non-perturbatively getting the power spectrum, accompanied by its application on attractor and non-attractor models. We end this discussion with concluding remarks in Section 6. In Appendix A, we recall the computation of the perturbed Klein-Gordon equation to point out an inaccuracy in the equation of motion for sub-Hubble perturbation evolution in Ref. [57, 58]. For the more curious readers, we provide the visuals of the stochastic noise and the accuracy check of our code in Appendix B and Appendix C respectively."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08820v1,Effects of Nontrivial Topology on Neutron Star Rotation and its Potential Observational Implications,"Rotational irregularities are one of the prominent observational features that most pulsars exhibit. These glitches, which are sudden increases in spin angular velocity, remains an open problem. In this study, we have investigated the potential role of nontrivial topological defects, specifically in the form of Nambu-goto-type CSs, and its connection to spin irregularities. Such CSs which are one-dimensional topological defects may be formed during various symmetry-breaking and phase transition scenarios and can interact with the neutron stars. In this work, we see that the appearance of such topological defects trapped within the core can lead to the coupling of the string tension with the angular velocity, leading to the abrupt rotational changes observed as pulsar glitches. We have further studied how these coupling may generate detectable gravitational waves as a mixture of continuous and burst signals. The evolution of cusps of CSs trapped within neutron stars and the neutron star’s mass quadruple moment change due to rotation could produce distinctive gravitational wave signatures, well within the noise cutoff of advLIGO. Our study highlights a potential connection between topological defects, pulsar glitches, and gravitational wave emissions, offering a possible avenue for observationally testing the presence of CSs and their astrophysical effects.","Compact stars such as Neutron stars (NS) formed from core collapsing supernova explosions have highly dense cores. Such NS has extreme physical conditions, like exceeding nuclear saturation densities, around 10^{15} g/cm3 or 1 baryon/fm3 number density, strong gravitational fields, and high rotational speeds, making them natural laboratories for testing the limits of fundamental physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Under such extreme condition, one of the model for the core is the overlapping of the baryons and pointing to a state of de-confined quark matter (QM) resulting in a phase transition (PT) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Various constraints on the maximum mass and radius of such stars has been implemented [13, 14] from the gravitational wave data of the binary merger GW 190814 [15], and from the observed pulsars PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0952-0607, and PSR J0030+0451 using both Bayesian analysis [16] and also using the frame work of Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity [17]. Recent studies in the field of high-energy astrophysics and condensed matter physics have shown the possible presence and significance of topological phases in strongly interacting matter, such as those found in the NS cores [18, 19, 20, 21]. The presence of stable, global features which cannot be removed by continuous deformations, describes a nontrivial topology such as vortex lines, domain walls, or cosmic strings (CS). In the case of NS, such topological defects (TD) are expected to form in the core, where densities are high enough to form color superconducting phases or QM and are governed by the principles of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [22, 23, 24]. In this work we have considered CSs which are hypothetical one-dimensional TDs that may have formed during PTs in the early universe. These defects, which are a consequence of symmetry-breaking processes, are modeled using the Nambu-Goto (NG) action expressed as the area of the string’s world-sheet, a two-dimensional surface traced out by the string as it moves [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. The action is written as: S=-\mu\int d^{2}\sigma\sqrt{-g} (1) where, \mu is the energy per unit length of the string, \sigma is the coordinates of the two dimensional world-sheet traced by the string and g is the determinant of the metric induced on the world-sheet. Transitions from a high-energy symmetric state to a lower-energy state with broken symmetry, described mathematically by the breaking of a larger symmetry group G to a smaller subgroup H. Now for a scalar field \Phi whose dynamics are governed by a potential with spontaneous symmetry breaking, at high energies, the field respects the symmetry group G. As the universe cools, the potential causes the field to settle into a vacuum manifold M=G/H, where H is the unbroken subgroup. CSs are associated with non-contractible loops in this vacuum manifold, which can be classified by the fundamental group \pi_{1}(M). If \pi_{1}(M)\neq 0, then the vacuum manifold supports CS solutions. Typically the breaking of a U(1) symmetry, where the vacuum manifold M is a circle S^{1}, whose fundamental group is the non-trivial, \pi_{1}(S^{1})=\mathbb{Z}. This non-trivial fundamental group implies that strings can form, and their winding number corresponds to elements of the group \mathbb{Z}, representing how many times the field winds around the vacuum manifold [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. Accordingly such TDs if formed in these phases arising from PT via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in the core of NS [36, 37, 38], could significantly affect the star’s internal structure and thus its rotational dynamics. NS rotate rapidly, often with periods ranging from milliseconds to seconds, and exhibit phenomena such as “glitches” which are sudden changes in their rotational speed. These glitches are thought to result from angular momentum exchange between different components of the star, such as the crust and the superfluid interior [39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. Recent theoretical work suggests that the presence of non-trivial topology within NS could modify their moment of inertia, leading to changes in their rotational frequency. For example, vortex lines in a superfluid phase may act as conduits for angular momentum transfer, while domain walls or other TDs could interact with the star’s magnetic field, leading to the dissipation or storage of rotational energy. These effects could manifest as changes in the star’s spin-down rate, or they may influence the timing and magnitude of observed glitches [44, 45, 46, 47]. Moreover, TDs could also affect the coupling between different layers of the star, further impacting its rotational dynamics. The potential observational implications of non-trivial topology in NS are quite possible. One of the most promising signatures of topological effects is the emission of gravitational waves. If TDs exist in the core, they could interact with the star’s rotation and magnetic field, producing gravitational wave signals that could be detectable by observatories like advLIGO and Virgo [48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53]. In summary, the study of NS glitches and spin-down irregularities could provide indirect evidence for the presence of topological structures and non-trivial topology. By linking topological phases of matter with observable astrophysical phenomena, some new insights could be gained into the physics of dense matter, the properties of quantum fields under extreme conditions, and the broader implications for astrophysical and cosmological models. The paper is structured as follows: In section II, we have defined the metric of a compact object coupled to a NG type defect. We have solved such a metric to obtain the rotational equation for the star and have also discussed various EoS that can arise due to a hadronic and a hybrid star. In section III, we have solved the rotational equation for various EoS and also across various energy density for the strings. Here we have also discussed about the universality of the rotational changes across EoSs. In section IV, we have discussed how the appearance of a TD can cause the spin up of the star and how radiative losses due to such strings can cause the star to lose angular momentum. In section V, we have discussed the possible gravitational wave signals for such a star and the detectibility of it in the advLIGO and Virgo detectors. In section VI we have drawn conclusions from the results obtained."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08691v1,Chiral Gravitational Wave Background from Audible Axion via Nieh-Yan Term,"Axions and axion-like particles can be probed through gravitational waves indirectly, often referred to as “audible axions”. The usual concept of audible axion relies on the coupling between the axions and the gauge fields. Here we consider an axion-like mechanism with coupling to the Nieh-Yan term. This interaction leads to the direct and efficient production of gravitational waves during the radiation-dominated era, originating from the tachyonic instability of the gravitational perturbations with the Nieh-Yan term. We calculate the energy spectral density of the chiral gravitational wave background and the comoving energy density of axion-like fields. Based on the numerical results, we explore the parameter space of axion masses and decay constants for detectable gravitational wave signals, either in pulsar timing arrays or space-based gravitational wave detections.","In modern physics, understanding the nature of dark matter is crucial. One of the candidates for dark matter is the axion [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], in general, it also includes axion-like particles (ALPs) [8, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Axion was originally introduced to solve the strong CP problem [14, 15], and it also appeared extensively in other studies such as string theory [16]. Following the first detection of gravitational waves by LIGO [17], the detection of new particles in cosmology, such as axions or ALPs, by gravitational waves has become possible [18, 19, 20]. In recent years, many studies focusing on parity-violating gravity, with Chern-Simons modified gravity being one of the most notable examples [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. In this work, we utilize another healthy parity-violating model known as Nieh-Yan modified teleparallel gravity (or Nieh-Yan gravity) [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. The Nieh-Yan gravity is a theory that modifies the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) by the Nieh-Yan term [41, 42], which couples with the axion or axion-like field. We explore the different parameter regions built with axion masses and decay constants, and we numerically calculate the chiral gravitational wave background [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48] produced by the audible axion via Nieh-Yan term. We find that the gravitational wave spectral energy density varies with different helicities. Considering the evolution of gravitational waves, we identify detectable signals in pulsar timing arrays (PTA) [49, 50, 51, 52, 53] or future space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA [54], Taiji [55], and ASTROD-GW [56]. Furthermore, by calculating the axion comoving energy density within the axion dynamics which is affected by gravitational backreaction, we find that backreaction of the Nieh-Yan term can reduce the axion comoving energy density by several orders of magnitude. Thus, in some parameter spaces, the relic density of axion dark matter can be comparable to the observational results [57, 58], and the chiral gravitational wave radiation energy density is also within a reasonable range [59]. The organization of this paper is as follows. In section II, we briefly review the TEGR, introduce the Nieh-Yan modified teleparallel gravity, and discuss how the axion dynamics are affected by geometric backreaction. In section III, we study the production mechanism of chiral gravitational waves via Nieh-Yan term, by numerically calculating the energy spectral density of chiral gravitational waves. The process of numerical calculation is described in detail. In section IV, we explore the parameter region of axion mass and decay constants that could be detected by PTA and the space-based gravitational wave detectors. The time evolution of the comoving energy densities of the axion and the gravitational wave are calculated. In the last section V, we conclude with the discussions. Throughout this paper, we choose the signature difference as (-,+,+,+), and set c=\hbar=1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08658v1,Probing cosmic chemical enrichment with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories,"By observing binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to the edge of the Universe, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will map the BBH merger rate across all of cosmic history. This merger rate traces the formation rate of their progenitor stars convolved with a delay time distribution. Given theoretically-motivated priors on the delay time distribution, we show how XG observations can measure the BBH progenitor formation rate, probing the star formation rate (SFR) up to z>15. However, the progenitor formation rate does not directly give a measurement of the SFR, but rather a combination of the SFR and its metallicity distribution as a function of redshift. Fortunately, the metallicity-dependence of BBH formation likely varies as a function of BBH mass and/or formation channel. We find that if different BBH subpopulations with distinct metallicity biases can be identified, comparing their rates as a function of redshift yields a simultaneous measurement of the SFR and its metallicity distribution. Given optimistic theoretical priors and one year of observation, this may provide a \sim 10\% measurement of the SFR at its peak and a 0.2 dex (0.7 dex) measurement of the median metallicity out to z=10 (z=15) at 90% credibility, although the uncertainties scale with theoretical uncertainties on BBH delay times and formation efficiencies.","The current generation of ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA are surveying the population of merging compact object binaries out to redshifts z\lesssim 2 (LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al., 2015; Acernese et al., 2015; Akutsu et al., 2021). In their first three observing runs, the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observatory network detected \approx 70 binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to z\approx 1 (Abbott et al., 2019, 2021a, 2023a). At design A+ sensitivity, the LVK network will observe hundreds to thousands of merging BBHs out to z\approx 2 (Borhanian & Sathyaprakash, 2022). The growing GW catalog is expanding our understanding of the BBH population and their progenitor stars. With hundreds of events, we can map the population properties of BBH systems, including how their merger rate varies with mass, spin and merger redshift, over the Universe’s past 10 billion years. The existing observations are revealing features in the BBH population, including peaks and dips in the mass distribution, correlations between BBH masses and spins, and evolution of the BBH merger rate with redshift (e.g. Fishbach & Holz, 2017; Talbot & Thrane, 2018; Fishbach et al., 2018; Abbott et al., 2021b; Tiwari & Fairhurst, 2021; Edelman et al., 2023; Callister & Farr, 2024; Farah et al., 2023; Callister et al., 2021; Abbott et al., 2023b). The proposed next-generation of ground-based GW observatories, including Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, would be sensitive enough to detect BBH mergers with total masses above 10\,M_{\odot} out to z\approx 30 (Hall & Evans, 2019; Maggiore et al., 2020; Kalogera et al., 2021; Evans et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2023; Branchesi et al., 2023). As Vitale et al. (2019) showed, this would enable a direct measurement of the BBH merger rate over the entire history of the Universe, from the very first mergers to the present day. The redshift evolution of the BBH merger rate informs a combination of their progenitor formation history and the delay time distribution between progenitor formation and BBH merger. For the remainder of this work, we assume that BBH systems are the remnants of massive stellar evolution (as opposed to, e.g., primordial BHs; Carr & Kühnel 2020). Starting from a massive star origin, the formation of merging BBH systems may involve isolated binary evolution and/or stellar dynamics (see, e.g. Mapelli, 2021; Mandel & Farmer, 2022, for reviews). Isolated binary evolution may include stable mass transfer (van den Heuvel, 1976; Neijssel et al., 2019; Gallegos-Garcia et al., 2021), unstable mass transfer leading to a common envelope (Paczynski, 1976; Dominik et al., 2012), and chemically homogeneous evolution (de Mink & Mandel, 2016; Marchant et al., 2016). Meanwhile, dynamical assembly may occur in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters (Kulkarni et al., 1993; Sigurdsson & Hernquist, 1993; Rodriguez et al., 2015), nuclear star clusters (Antonini & Rasio, 2016) (possibly involving a central supermassive BH; Rose et al. 2022), and the disks of active galactic nuclei (McKernan et al., 2014; Rowan et al., 2023), and involves dynamical friction and three-body interactions leading to binary hardening, exchanges and ejections. There are environments in which both binary stellar evolution and dynamical processes are relevant, including stellar triples (Thompson, 2011; Antonini et al., 2017) and young star clusters (Rastello et al., 2020). 1.1 Progenitor formation rate and dependence on metallicity Regardless of formation channel, as long as BBH systems have a stellar origin, the BBH progenitor formation rate depends on the properties of stellar populations across cosmic history, including the star formation rate, the stellar initial mass function (IMF), the initial chemical composition (metallicity) of stars, their binary fraction, and the star forming environment, such as whether stars form in a dense cluster or near a supermassive BH. The conditions of star formation vary significantly over cosmic time (Madau & Dickinson, 2014). The initial metallicity (particularly the iron abundance) of progenitor stars is especially relevant for BBH formation (Belczynski et al. 2010; see Chruślińska 2024 for a review). The high iron opacity in outer stellar layers drives stellar winds, which leads to mass loss and increased radial expansion (Kudritzki & Puls, 2000). This means that higher-metallicity stars with a greater iron abundance are less likely to retain enough mass in their cores to collapse to a BH, particularly one more massive than \sim 10\,M_{\odot}. Furthermore, high-metallicity stars are more likely to merge with their stellar companion due to the increased radial expansion, preempting BBH formation in isolated binaries. Supernova natal kicks, which can disrupt binary systems, may also be larger at higher metallicities. The effect of metallicity on BBH formation efficiency is amplified by the other properties of star formation that correlate with metallicity. For example, there are indications that the low-metallicity IMF favors more massive stars, which would increase the number of BHs formed (Li et al., 2023; Klessen & Glover, 2023; Hennebelle & Grudić, 2024). The fraction of star formation that occurs in dense stellar clusters is also thought to be higher at low metallicity, which increases the rate of BBH mergers driven by stellar dynamics (Lamers et al., 2017; El-Badry et al., 2019; Reina-Campos et al., 2019; Belokurov & Kravtsov, 2023). Thus, within most proposed formation channels, the formation of merging BBH systems is thought to be more efficient at low metallicities compared to high metallicities, although the details depend on the formation channel. The theoretical expectation that BBH formation is more efficient at low metallicities is consistent with current observations of BBH mergers at z\lesssim 1. The overall star formation peaks at redshift z\approx 2–3, while the star-forming metallicity increases monotonically with time (decreasing redshift) as stars enrich their environments with heavy elements during their lives and deaths. The steep evolution of the BBH merger rate, as inferred from the latest GW catalog GWTC-3 (Abbott et al., 2023b), favors a combination of short delay times and a progenitor formation rate that peaks at higher redshifts than the Madau & Fragos (2017) SFR, consistent with the low-metallicity SFR (Fishbach & Kalogera, 2021; Vijaykumar et al., 2023; Karathanasis et al., 2023; Fishbach & van Son, 2023; Turbang et al., 2024; Schiebelbein-Zwack & Fishbach, 2024). 1.2 Delay time distributions The delay time for merging binaries refers to the time between the formation of the progenitor stars and the merger of the BBH. This timescale is dominated by the GW inspiral time, which depends on how closely the two BHs can be brought together by their evolutionary pathway. For circular binaries, the inspiral time scales with the initial orbital separation as \tau_{\mathrm{insp}}\propto a^{4} (Peters, 1964). The delay time experienced by a given BBH merger is drawn from a probability distribution referred to as the delay time distribution. Regardless of formation channel, the delay time distribution is generally predicted to have a long tail towards long delay times because of the steep dependence of the GW inspiral time on the orbital separation: increasing the orbital separation only slightly results in a much longer delay time. The specific delay time distribution is determined by the evolutionary pathway. Within isolated binary evolution, it is generally expected that common envelope can lead to shorter delay times than stable mass transfer because a successful common envelope ejection can shrink the binary orbit more effectively (Gallegos-Garcia et al., 2021; van Son et al., 2022a). According to population synthesis models, common envelope evolution generally yields delay time distributions that can be approximated by power laws with slopes \alpha\approx-1, while stable mass transfer yields distributions with shallower slopes, although the details depend on uncertain physical parameters (Fishbach & van Son, 2023). Within dynamical assembly, the delay time distribution depends on the mass and size of the star cluster, with more massive, denser clusters leading to tighter BBH systems with shorter delay times between star cluster formation and BBH merger (Hong et al., 2018; Rodriguez & Loeb, 2018). For a realistic cluster mass function, the predicted delay time distribution is usually well-described by a power-law slope \approx-1 (Rodriguez et al., 2019; Ye & Fishbach, 2024). 1.3 Binary black hole subpopulations In reality, multiple evolutionary pathways, with different progenitor formation rates and delay time distributions, may contribute to the BBH population. Ng et al. (2021) argued that a combination of different subpopulations, including the remnants of the first (Pop III) stars, remnants of Pop II isolated binary evolution, and dynamically-assembled binaries in star clusters, may create multiple peaks in the BBH merger rate as a function of redshift. They showed that these different subpopulations could be identified by measuring the redshift evolution of the BBH merger rate with XG observatories. In addition to having different merger redshift distributions, BBH subpopulations from distinct formation channels exhibit different mass and spin distributions. Indeed, there are already indications that the BBH population consists of a superposition of distinct subpopulations from different formation channels, characterized by unique mass, spin and redshift features (Zevin et al., 2021b; Wong et al., 2021; Godfrey et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024; Ray et al., 2024). BBH systems that were dynamically assembled in dense star clusters, which can be identified by their isotropic distribution of spin orientations (Rodriguez et al., 2016), may dominate the merger rate at high component masses \gtrsim 30\,M_{\odot}, perhaps explaining the peak in the BBH mass spectrum at \sim 35\,M_{\odot} (Godfrey et al., 2023; Ray et al., 2024). This is in line with some theoretical models (Antonini et al., 2023). The highest mass BBH systems may be explained by repeated, hierarchical mergers in dense clusters, which cause these systems to be spinning more rapidly (Fishbach et al., 2017; Gerosa & Berti, 2017; Gerosa & Fishbach, 2021; Kimball et al., 2021; Li et al., 2024; Pierra et al., 2024). In the future, if orbital eccentricity can be robustly measured from the GW signal, it would provide a powerful discriminator for dynamical assembly that can place constraints on the formation history of globular clusters (Rodriguez et al., 2018; Samsing, 2018; Zevin et al., 2021a, a; Romero-Shaw et al., 2021). Among BBH mergers from isolated binary evolution, population synthesis models suggest that evolution involving a common envelope phase may dominate the merger rate at low component masses \sim 10\,M_{\odot}, while stable mass transfer may contribute more at higher masses (van Son et al., 2022a). Post-common envelope systems may experience tidal spin up, leading to second-born BHs with larger spins (Zaldarriaga et al., 2018; Bavera et al., 2020; Olejak & Belczynski, 2021). Even within a fixed BBH evolutionary channel, the formation efficiency and delay time distribution may correlate with BBH mass and spin. For example, within isolated binary evolution channels, population synthesis studies often predict that the formation efficiency of high-mass BBH mergers depends most strongly on metallicity, with low-mass BBH mergers (component masses \lesssim 10\,M_{\odot}) and BNS mergers exhibiting only mild, if any, dependence on metallicity (Giacobbo & Mapelli, 2018; Klencki et al., 2018; Neijssel et al., 2019; Iorio et al., 2023, although see Gallegos-Garcia et al. 2023). This means that high-mass BBH mergers probably prefer to form at higher redshifts compared to low-mass systems. Meanwhile, the delay time distribution from common envelope evolution may correlate with the spins of the BBH because of the correlation between tidal spin up and the orbital separation of the BBH (Qin et al., 2018; Bavera et al., 2022). Dense star clusters probably merge more massive BBHs faster than low-mass BBHs because of mass segregation (Belczynski et al., 2022; Ye & Fishbach, 2024). In this work, we make use of the fact that different subpopulations of binary compact object mergers (as identified based on their masses and/or spins) may trace different progenitor metallicities with different delay time distributions. We consider a simplified toy model in which the different subpopulations are perfectly identified from their masses and spins. If we have a theoretical expectation of the delay time distribution corresponding to each subpopulation, we can propagate sources back to their formation redshifts (Fishbach & van Son, 2023). Then, by measuring the formation rate of each subpopulation as a function of redshift and comparing them, we can disentangle the overall SFR and its metallicity dependence, as emphasized by Chruślińska (2024). The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In §2, we describe our model for the metallicity-specific SFR and explain its relationship to the BBH merger rate. We simulate populations of mock BBH mergers in §3, discuss their consistency with current LVK data, and show how XG detectors can reconstruct the merger rate as a function of redshift. In §4, we describe how to deconvolve the inferred merger rates with a theory-motivated prior on the delay time distribution, yielding a measurement of the BBH progenitor formation rate for each subpopulation (§4.1). Combining this with a theory-motivated prior on the BBH formation efficiency, we show how XG detectors can measure metallicity as a function of redshift (§4.2). We conclude in §5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08639v1,Revisiting holographic dark energy after DESI 2024,"New insights from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data, in conjunction with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE) models, utilizing CMB, DESI BAO, and SN data. By considering the combined DESI BAO and SN data, we determine that in the IHDE model, the parameter c>1 and the dark-energy equation of state w does not cross -1 at the 1\sigma confidence level, whereas in the HDE model, it marginally falls below this threshold. Upon incorporating CMB data, we observe that in the HDE model, the parameter c<1 and w crosses -1 at a level beyond 10\sigma. Conversely, for the IHDE model, the likelihood of w crossing -1 is considerably diminished, implying that the introduction of interaction within the HDE model could potentially resolve or mitigate the cosmic big rip conundrum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the HDE and IHDE models are statistically as viable as the \LambdaCDM model when assessing Bayesian evidence with DESI BAO data combined with SN data. However, when CMB data are added, the HDE and IHDE models are significantly less favored compared to the \LambdaCDM model. Our findings advocate for further exploration of the HDE and IHDE models using forthcoming, more precise late-universe observations.","Since the initial discovery of the universe’s accelerating expansion Riess et al. (1998); Perlmutter et al. (1999), the nature of dark energy has persisted as an enduring enigma in contemporary cosmology and fundamental physics. Over the past two decades, a plethora of theoretical and phenomenological models have been crafted in response. Notably, the standard \Lambda cold dark matter (\LambdaCDM) cosmological model, with six basic parameters, has garnered significant acclaim for its exceptional fit to the majority of cosmological observations. However, as the precision of cosmological parameter measurements has increased, some perplexing discrepancies have emerged. Particularly, the Hubble constant H_{0} inferred from the \LambdaCDM model’s best fit to the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data Aghanim et al. (2020a) is in significant tension, exceeding 5\sigma, with the direct measurements by the SH0ES team Riess et al. (2022) utilizing the distance ladder method. Lately, the Hubble tension has been a hot topic in current cosmology (see, e.g., Refs. Li et al. (2013); Zhang et al. (2015); Feng et al. (2017); Zhao et al. (2017); Verde et al. (2019); Riess (2019); Guo et al. (2019, 2020); Gao et al. (2021); Di Valentino et al. (2021); Cai et al. (2021); Kamionkowski and Riess (2023); Gao et al. (2024); Lynch et al. (2024); for relevant forecast analyses, see also, e.g., Refs. Zhao et al. (2011); Cai et al. (2018); Du et al. (2019); Zhang (2019); Zhang et al. (2019); Chen (2020); Chen et al. (2021); Bian et al. (2021); Jin et al. (2021); Wang et al. (2022a, b); Qi et al. (2022); Zhao et al. (2022); Jin et al. (2023a, b); Zhang et al. (2023); Song et al. (2024); Dong et al. (2024); Jin et al. (2024a, b); Xiao et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024); Pan et al. (2024); Fu and Zhang (2024)). On another front, the cosmological constant \Lambda in the \LambdaCDM model, which is equivalent to the vacuum energy density, also faces severe theoretical challenges, namely, the “fine-tuning” and “cosmic coincidence” problems Sahni and Starobinsky (2000); Bean et al. (2005). In light of the first-year data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, the \LambdaCDM model is encountering heightened scrutiny. The combination of DESI baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data with CMB anisotropy measurements from Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), along with Type Ia supernova (SN) data from the PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5 datasets, has revealed a statistically significant inclination towards a dynamical dark energy scenario, specifically for the w_{0}w_{a}CDM model, with confidence levels of 2.5\sigma, 3.5\sigma, and 3.9\sigma respectively. The dark-energy equation of state (EoS) in the w_{0}w_{a}CDM model is articulated by w(a)=w_{0}+w_{a}(1-a), (1) where a represents the cosmological scale factor, and w_{0} and w_{a} are constants. The DESI collaboration has reported w_{0}=-0.727\pm 0.067 and w_{a}=-1.05^{+0.31}_{-0.27} based on CMB+DESI+DESY5 datasets, signifying a pronounced preference for w_{0}>-1 and a substantial w_{a}<0. These notable deviations from the \LambdaCDM model, as indicated by DESI, have ignited extensive debates on the nature of dark energy. Numerous studies have endeavored to constrain cosmological parameters utilizing the novel DESI BAO data Calderon et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2024a); Escamilla-Rivera and Sandoval-Orozco (2024); Di Valentino et al. (2024); Yang et al. (2024); Wang and Piao (2024); Gomez-Valent and Sola Peracaula (2024); Allali et al. (2024); Qu et al. (2024a); Wang (2024a); Colgáin et al. (2024); Cortês and Liddle (2024); Wang (2024b); Jiang et al. (2024); Giarè et al. (2024a, b); Du et al. (2024); Toda et al. (2024); Pang et al. (2024); Rebouças et al. (2024); Sabogal et al. (2024); Escamilla et al. (2024); Li et al. (2024a); Specogna et al. (2024); Park et al. (2024a, b); Alestas et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2024b); Giarè (2024); Wu and Zhang (2024); Ye et al. (2024); Tyagi et al. (2024). While parameterization approaches such as the w_{0}w_{a}CDM model are valuable for data-driven description and serve as stringent consistency tests against the null hypothesis of the \LambdaCDM model, they remain empirical and lack a fundamental physical underpinning. Thus, it is imperative to delve into dark energy models that are anchored in solid theoretical frameworks and to evaluate whether the DESI BAO data can accommodate these models. More fundamentally, it is widely posited that the conundrums surrounding dark energy are inextricably tied to the realm of quantum gravity. Consequently, probing the nature of dark energy through the perspective of quantum gravity is of paramount interest. In the absence of a comprehensive quantum gravity theory, we are compelled to lean on the holographic principle within quantum gravity to construct an effective theory of dark energy. The holographic dark energy (HDE) model, rooted in the holographic principle of quantum gravity, has gained significant traction in the quest to unravel the enigma of dark energy. Within the framework of effective quantum field theory, Cohen et al. Cohen et al. (1999) articulated that, when gravity is taken into account, the total energy of a system with scale L should not surpass the mass of a black hole of equivalent size, that is, L^{3}\rho_{\rm de}\lesssim LM_{\rm pl}^{2}. This energy bound gives rise to the density of HDE, \rho_{\rm de}=3c^{2}M_{\rm pl}^{2}L^{-2}, (2) where c is a dimensionless parameter accounting for certain indeterminacies in the effective quantum field theory, M_{\rm pl} is the reduced Planck mass defined by M_{\rm pl}^{2}=(8\pi G)^{-1}, and L represents the infrared cutoff within the theory. Should L be regarded as the scale of the current universe, such as the Hubble radius H^{-1}, the derived dark energy density aligns well with observational data. However, Hsu (2004) noted that this approach yields an incorrect EoS for dark energy. Li (2004) then proposed that L should instead be equated to the scale of the future event horizon, L=a\int^{\infty}_{t}\frac{{\rm d}t}{a}=a\int^{\infty}_{a}\frac{{\rm d}a}{Ha^{2% }}, (3) with H(a) being the Hubble parameter as a function of the scale factor a. This selection not only provides a plausible value for the density of dark energy but also leads to an accelerating universe. Furthermore, the HDE model offers a theoretical explanation for the cosmic coincidence problem Li (2004). Investigations into HDE models have been pursued in the literature (see, e.g., Refs. Huang and Gong (2004); Wang et al. (2005); Nojiri and Odintsov (2006); Zhang and Wu (2005); Zhang (2007, 2006); Zhang and Wu (2007); Zhang et al. (2007, 2014); Landim (2016); Cui et al. (2015a); Wang et al. (2017); Wang and Li (2023)). The parameter c plays a pivotal role in dictating the HDE evolution. At c=1, the EoS of HDE approaches that of a cosmological constant, steering the universe toward a de Sitter phase in the distant future. When c>1, the EoS of HDE stays above -1, with HDE exhibiting quintessence-like dark energy behavior. Conversely, if c<1, the EoS of HDE will cross the phantom divide at w=-1, culminating in a phantom universe destined for a catastrophic big rip. Prior observational constraints on the HDE model have collectively suggested c<1, hinting that HDE could precipitate a phantom universe ending in a big rip. To circumvent this conundrum, researchers have contemplated the implications of extra dimensions Zhang (2010) or entertained the notion of an interaction between dark energy and dark matter within the HDE model Li et al. (2008). Moreover, the possibility of direct interactions between dark energy and dark matter might offer a solution or at least a mitigation to the so-called Hubble tension and cosmic coincidence problems. Interacting dark energy (IDE) models have garnered substantial attention Zhang (2005); Zhang et al. (2008); Szydłowski et al. (2015); Zhang et al. (2010); Li et al. (2011); Li and Zhang (2011); Fu et al. (2012); Cui et al. (2015b); Zhang (2017); Li et al. (2020); Di Valentino et al. (2020); Feng et al. (2020); Zhang et al. (2021); Wang et al. (2022c); Jin et al. (2022); Nunes et al. (2022); Zhao et al. (2023); Han et al. (2024); Forconi et al. (2024); Li et al. (2024b); Halder et al. (2024); Benisty et al. (2024); Nong and Liang (2024). The exploration of interacting models within the framework of holographic dark energy has been extensively studied (see, e.g., Refs. Li et al. (2009); Zhang et al. (2012); Feng and Zhang (2016); Li et al. (2017)). Given that the value of c cannot be ascertained from the theoretical framework of the HDE and IHDE models, it is essential to pin down the value of c through cosmological observations. In this study, we harness the latest observational data, encompassing the DESI BAO data, CMB data from Planck and ACT, and SN data from three distinct compilations — PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5 — to constrain both the HDE and IHDE models. Our primary objective is to ascertain the value of c within the context of the HDE and IHDE models using the latest cosmological observations. Furthermore, we employ Bayesian evidence to assess the extent to which the HDE and IHDE models are endorsed by both early and late-universe data. This work is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly introduce the HDE and IHDE models, as well as the cosmological data used in this work. In Sec. III, we report the constraint results and make some relevant discussions. The conclusion is given in Sec. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08617v1,Globally Stable Dark Energy in F(R) Gravity,"F(R) models for dark energy generally exhibit a weak curvature singularity, which can be cured by adding an R^{2} term. This correction allows for a unified description of primordial and late-time accelerated expansions. However, most existing models struggle to achieve this, as they become unstable over certain negative ranges of the Ricci scalar, where either the first or second derivative of F(R) turns negative. These instabilities may disrupt the post-inflationary evolution when the Ricci scalar oscillates about the vacuum state after the R^{2} inflation. In this work, we introduce a new model-building to guarantee global stability, i.e., the first and second derivatives are positive for all real Ricci scalars. By extending the idea from Appleby and Battye, we demonstrate that viable models can be constructed by imposing a positive, bounded first derivative of F(R) with a sigmoid shape. As examples, we first reformulate and generalize the original Appleby-Battye model. Then, we propose a new dark energy model, which successfully explains the acceleration of cosmic expansion and passes local gravity tests.","Since the discovery of the current acceleration of the cosmic expansion about a quarter-century ago Riess et al. (1998); Perlmutter et al. (1999), numerous attempts have been made to explain the underlying repulsive energy source, referred to as dark energy Li et al. (2013); Yoo and Watanabe (2012); Mortonson et al. (2013); Klimchitskaya and Mostepanenko (2024). In addition to the static cosmological constant Aghanim et al. (2020); Bull et al. (2016); Perivolaropoulos and Skara (2022), dark energy could also be attributed to a dynamical scalar field emerging, for instance, from F(R) gravity Sotiriou and Faraoni (2010); De Felice and Tsujikawa (2010); Nojiri et al. (2017). By replacing the Ricci scalar R with a general function F(R), F(R) gravity introduces an additional scalar degree of freedom, dubbed scalaron. Capozziello was the first to attempt achieving cosmic acceleration by introducing quintessence into F(R) gravity, called curvature quintessence Capozziello (2002). Subsequently, Carroll et al. proposed the first well-studied model Carroll et al. (2004), while Nojiri et al. proposed the first potential unified model to describe both primordial and late-time acceleration within a single F(R) Lagrangian Nojiri and Odintsov (2003). Such a light scalar field would mediate a long-range fifth force, which is tightly constrained by solar-system tests through the Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) parameter. Fortunately, nonlinear effects can screen the propagation of the fifth force via the chameleon mechanism Khoury and Weltman (2004a, b); Brax et al. (2004). After a few years of exploration, several viable models have been successfully developed Hu and Sawicki (2007); Starobinsky (2007); Appleby and Battye (2007); Tsujikawa (2008); Cognola et al. (2008). However, it was soon recognized that these models typically lead to a weak curvature singularity, occurring in the past Starobinsky (2007); Tsujikawa (2008); Frolov (2008); Appleby and Battye (2008). As a result, the scalaron mass exceeds the Planck mass even during the matter-dominated era, signaling the breakdown of F(R) gravity as an effective field theory. It has been found that adding an R^{2} term can naturally remove the singularity, and the resulting R^{2}-corrected dark energy may provide a unified description of primordial and late-time acceleration of the cosmic expansion Kobayashi and Maeda (2009); Appleby et al. (2010); Lee et al. (2012). In such a unified scenario, the standard sequence of inflation, reheating, radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, and dark energy-dominated epochs must be preserved. In the original R^{2} inflationary model, post-inflationary reheating begins when the linear R term dominates over the nonlinear R^{2} term and oscillates around the vacuum state R=0. Adhering to this reheating mechanism suggests that not all viable dark energy models can fulfill these criteria, as many become unstable when R<0. The only viable model, to the best of my knowledge, is the Appleby-Battye model Appleby et al. (2010), which, unlike others, was specifically designed with the condition F_{R}>0 for all ranges of Ricci scalar Appleby and Battye (2007). For recent cosmological constraints, see Ribeiro et al. (2024). In this paper, we will generalize the idea from the Appleby-Battye model and demonstrate that the favored form of F_{R}(R) is a bounded function with a sigmoid shape, with its midpoint (or center of symmetry) determined by the critical curvature. In addition, the \LambdaCDM model (for positive R) can be regarded as an extreme case of these sigmoid functions, i.e., the Heaviside delta function of R. The Appleby-Battye model contains exponential terms, and as we will show, the first derivative is actually the logistic function. For comparison, we will also introduce a new model in which the first derivative follows a power-law form. Consequently, our model resembles the Hu-Sawicki model but achieves global stability. We demonstrate that this model can account for the current cosmic acceleration by explicitly solving the Friedmann equation. Furthermore, the effective Equation of State (EoS) parameter for the dark energy component exhibits phantom crossing behavior, a common feature of F(R) dark energy models Amendola and Tsujikawa (2008); Bamba et al. (2010, 2011). Next, We constrain the model parameters by confronting our model with local gravity tests. Finally, We discuss the unified description of dark energy and inflation within the framework of globally stable models. Throughout this paper, we adopt natural units with c=\hbar=1 and focus exclusively on the metric formalism, where the metric signature is (-,+,+,+). A prime ”\prime” and a subscript ”R” denote derivatives with respect to the function’s argument and Ricci scalar, respectively."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08467v1,"Inflationary constraints on the moduli-dependent species scale
in modular invariant theories","We demonstrate that a broad class of modular inflation models predicts the emergence of new physics within an energy range of approximately 10^{15}\,\mathrm{GeV} to 10^{17}\,\mathrm{GeV}. This prediction arises by comparing the moduli-dependent species scale with observational constraints on inflation. Specifically, we illustrate this within the context of SL(2,\mathbb{Z})-modular inflation models by re-expressing inflationary observables in terms of the species scale. We further discuss the implications of this approach for generic Calabi-Yau threefolds, showing that this reformulation allows us to directly constrain the fundamental parameters related to the geometry of extra dimensions, specifically the second Chern numbers.","A large N number of light degrees of freedom in a quantum theory of gravity modifies the scale at which quantum effects of gravity become relevant. Such an effective ultraviolet cutoff in theories of quantum gravity is called the species scale Dvali:2007hz ; Dvali:2007wp ; Dvali:2008ec , which in four dimensions is given by \displaystyle\Lambda_{\rm sp}=\frac{M_{\rm Pl}}{N^{1/2}}. (1) Since a large number of species leads to a decrease in \Lambda_{\rm sp}, the quantum effects of gravity become relevant below the Planck scale. The species scale depends on the light modes \tau, which in string compactifications correspond to moduli fields exhibiting geometric symmetries of compact extra-dimensional spaces. It was shown in Refs. vandeHeisteeg:2022btw ; vandeHeisteeg:2023ubh ; Castellano:2023aum ; vandeHeisteeg:2023dlw that the moduli-dependent species scale is constrained to be an automorphic form of the duality symmetries, including the modular symmetries of the theory, as calculated in Refs. Green:1999pu ; Green:1999pv ; Green:2005ba ; Green:2010kv ; Green:2010wi . In type II compactifications on Calabi-Yau (CY) threefolds, the species scale can be identified with the genus-one topological free energy F_{1}, as proposed in Ref. vandeHeisteeg:2022btw , i.e., N\simeq F_{1}, which is described by a specific modular function, as explicitly demonstrated in the Enriques CY (K3\times T^{2})/\mathbb{Z}_{2} Ferrara:1995yx . The decrease of the species scale impacts particle phenomenology and cosmology. Indeed, the decay rate of the tower of states |\partial_{\phi}\Lambda_{\rm sp}/\Lambda_{\rm sp}| is found to have a lower bound vandeHeisteeg:2023ubh ; Calderon-Infante:2023ler ; Castellano:2023stg ; Castellano:2023jjt and an upper bound of order {\cal O}(1) vandeHeisteeg:2023ubh ; Calderon-Infante:2023ler ; vandeHeisteeg:2023dlw ; Lust:2023zql , which permits only a finite range for the light mode in gravitational effective field theories. By imposing this finite range on the inflaton field during an accelerated expansion of the universe, it has been shown that the inflaton field range is bounded by the tensor-to-scalar ratio Cribiori:2023sch ; Scalisi:2019gfv ; vandeHeisteeg:2023uxj ; Scalisi:2024jhq . Furthermore, the coefficient of the {\cal R}^{2} term becomes a duality-invariant form, and the Starobinsky inflation model has been revisited from the perspective of string theory Lust:2023zql . In this paper, we focus on the SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) modular symmetry, which appears in four-dimensional effective field theories (EFT) on toroidal compact spaces and in the asymptotic limits of CY moduli spaces Ishiguro:2024xph . By imposing SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) modular invariance on the theory, one can achieve a unique pattern of flavor structure Feruglio:2017spp and a successful inflation mechanism Kobayashi:2016mzg ; Schimmrigk:2016bde ; Abe:2023ylh ; Ding:2024neh ; King:2024ssx ; Casas:2024jbw ; Kallosh:2024ymt , where the scalar potential is expected to be stable against higher-order corrections, in contrast to the Starobinsky model. Remarkably, several cosmological observables, such as the tensor-to-scalar ratio, are determined by the modular-invariant species scale Casas:2024jbw , indicating that recent cosmological observations place a bound on the species scale itself as well as its decay rate. Unlike the decay rate of the species, a phenomenologically viable range of the species scale has not yet been fully explored. The purpose of this Letter is to evaluate the species scale directly in modular-invariant theories by utilizing recent cosmological observations. We find that the species scale is restricted to the range 10^{15}\,\text{GeV}\lesssim\Lambda_{\rm sp}\lesssim 10^{17}\,\text{GeV} when the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are required to match observational data."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08440v1,Bayesian evaluation of hadron-quark phase transition models through neutron star observables in light of nuclear and astrophysics data,"We investigate the role of hybrid and nucleonic equations of state (EOSs) within neutron star (NS) interiors using Bayesian inference to evaluate their alignment with recent observational data from NICER and LIGO-Virgo (LV) collaborations. We find that smooth hybrid EOSs are slightly favoured in explaining NS mass-radius relations, particularly for pulsars such as PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620. However, this preference is not definitive, as gravitational wave (GW) data does not significantly differentiate between our hybrid and nucleonic models. Our analysis also reveals tensions between older NICER data and recent measurements for PSR J0437-4715, highlighting the need for more flexible EOS models. Through two sampling approaches — one fixing the hadronic EOS set and the other without fixing the same, we demonstrate that the hybrid EOS model can incorporate stiffer EOSs, resulting in a better agreement with NICER data but leading to higher tidal deformability, which is less consistent with GW observations. In some recent publications a parameter d_{c}, related to the trace anomaly and its derivative, is used to indicate the presence of deconfined quark matter. We find that our hadronic model, which does not include phase transition to deconfined matter, under the influence of imposed constraints, is able to predict values below 0.2 for d_{c} at around five times saturation density. The hybrid model goes below this threshold at lower densities under the same conditions.","Recent observational data, particularly from gravitational wave (GW) detections and precise pulsar measurements, have significantly advanced our understanding of neutron star (NS) interiors. Mass-radius estimation by NICER (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer) reported a radius of 12.71_{-1.19}^{+1.14} km and a mass of 1.34_{-0.16}^{+0.15} M⊙ [1] whereas an alternative study[2] found a radius of 13.02_{-1.06}^{+1.24} km and a mass of 1.44_{-0.14}^{+0.15} M⊙ for the pulsar PSR J0030+0451. Furthermore, NICER’s observations for the pulsar PSR J0740+6620 indicated an equatorial circumferential radius of 12.39^{+1.30}_{-0.98} km and a mass of 2.072_{-0.066}^{+0.067} M⊙ (with a 68% confidence interval)[3]. Most recent NICER observations of PSR J0437-4715 have measured its mass and radius 1.418 M⊙ and 11.36_{-0.63}^{+0.95} km respectively[4]. In addition to astrophysical observations, numerous research efforts[5, 6, 7, 8, 9] have focused on determining the EOS of strongly interacting NS matter, considering the saturation properties of nuclear matter. Inferred mass-radius values from the detection of GWs from binary NS merger event GW170817[10, 11, 12], combined with ab initio calculations like perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) at very high densities[13, 14] and chiral effective field theory (\chiEFT) models of neutron matter at low densities, have provided additional insights into the EOS of dense matter. These combined empirical observations and theoretical frameworks are essential for advancing our understanding of nuclear matter under extreme conditions[15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Owing to the incredibly high density within the core of an NS, the highly compressed matter might contain strange particles like hyperons[20, 21, 22], deconfined quarks[23, 24], Bose-Einstein condensates of antikaons[25], etc. In recent decades, numerous quark models (QM) have been investigated, suggesting the possibility of two-flavour colour superconductivity[26, 27, 28], the colour-flavour locked (CFL) phase, and even more complex states such as the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF)[29, 30], and crystalline superconducting phases[31]. The MIT bag model[32, 33] and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model are two widely used frameworks to describe QM within NS [34, 35, 36, 37]. Additionally, the hybrid EOS models often utilize the Mean Field Approximation of QCD (MFTQCD), which is derived from the QCD Lagrangian [38]. This approach considers the decomposition of a gluon field into soft and hard momentum components, where the mean field approximation for hard gluons contributes to stiffening the EOS, allowing for high pressures at high energy densities. On the other hand, the soft gluon fields generate condensates that soften the EOS, resulting in a bag-like term [38]. Usually, strange degrees of freedom soften the EOS, which results in a lower maximum mass and more compact star[23, 39]. However, some model-independent research indicates that the cores of most massive stars may align with the presence of QM[40, 41, 42]. Besides mass-radius, f-mode oscillation frequency is a potential probe of stellar structure[43, 44]. f-mode oscillations are sensitive to EOS. Hence, they can also give clues about the presence of exotic matter in the core of NS[45, 46]. The study of correlations among various aspects of stellar structure, such as mass, radius, tidal deformability, and f-mode frequencies, helps to infer properties that are otherwise difficult to measure directly. For NSs, the correlation between observed data with theoretical model parameters allows stringent limits on the EOS of dense matter. Some recent works[47, 48, 49] have analysed EOSs with hadron-quark phase transitions keeping in mind the latest astrophysical observations. The correlation between the radii of two NSs, like PSR J0030+0451, and PSR J0740+6620, with masses differing by \approx 0.6M_{\odot} as measured by NICER, was found to be noteworthy for EOSs with nucleonic degrees of freedom [50]. However, this correlation weakens during a first-order phase transition [51]. As a result, it might serve as a signature for the existence of hadron-quark phase transitions in NSs. In a recent publication [52], the correlation in the radius domain to f-mode oscillation frequency domain is translated using semi-universal relations. Also, analysis based on a few selected hybrid EOSs from the CompOSE database[53] with NICER data hints at non-nucleonic degrees of freedom for matter inside the NS core [52]. In this letter, we perform a detailed statistical analysis using large sets of hybrid EOSs. Considering the latest astrophysical constraints, we investigate whether NSs with a hadron-quark phase transition are more favourable compared to stars composed solely of nucleonic matter. Using recent observational data, we choose a systematic Bayesian inference approach to evaluate the Bayes Log Evidence for these two scenarios. Specifically, we calculate the Bayes Log Evidence based on astrophysical data for three cases: a purely nucleonic EOS, a hybrid EOS utilizing NICER data for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, and another hybrid EOS incorporating additional mass-radius constraints from the recent observation of PSR J0437-4715[4]. The article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the construction of hybrid EOS. Section 3 reviews the non-radial oscillations of NS. In Section 4, we present our results. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our findings and their implications for the study of NS interiors."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08396v1,Translating current ALP photon coupling strength bounds to the Randall-Sundrum model,"In this article, we look at the current bounds on the coupling strength of axion-like particles (ALPs) with two photons in the context of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We relate the coupling strength to the compactification radius that governs the size of the extra dimension in the RS warped geometry model and show how the current bounds on the ALP can be used to derive appropriate constraints on the size of the extra fifth dimension in the RS model. We show that the resulting constraints fail to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem for light/ultralight ALPs and require a massive ALP of at least m_{a}\gtrsim 0.1 [GeV] to be relevant in the context of the hierarchy problem when the gauge field is in the bulk.","Theories of extra spatial dimensions were originally proposed to achieve electromagnetism and gravity unification through a geometric interpretation. Subsequently, there was a revival of interest in extra-dimensional models in the context of a possible resolution of the unnatural fine-tuning problem associated with the mass of the Higgs boson against large radiative corrections which, in turn, have their roots in the large hierarchy between the electroweak and Planck scale. To achieve a resolution to this problem geometrically, several variants of higher dimensional theories were proposed. Among these, theories with warped extra dimensions drew special attention because of their inherent property to resolve the gauge hierarchy naturalness problem [1, 2] without invoking any intermediate scale other than the Planck scale. It has also been shown that such types of warped geometry models have their natural origin in an underlying string theory which admits of Klebanov-Strassler throat geometry [3] in the backdrop of an appropriate string compactification. The simplest and most popular warped geometry model was proposed by Randall and Sundrum (RS) [4] which portrays the presence of two 3-branes located at the two orbifold fixed points in a 5-dimensional anti-de Sitter bulk compactified on a Z_{2} orbifold. This model mimics the essential features of a stringy braneworld model compactified on \text{AdS}_{5}\crossproduct S_{5}. Due to the anti-de Sitter character of the 5-dimensional bulk, this model also received special attention in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence [5]. The most important aspect of the RS model is its testability where observable signatures can be searched for both in TeV scale collider physics as well as in various astrophysical and cosmological scenarios [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Apart from various scattering and decay processes associated with graviton Kaluza-Klein modes (mass \sim TeV) coupled to the standard model fields with inverse TeV couplings [13, 14], and the phenomenology of the TeV scale radion (the only extra-dimensional modulus in the model) [15, 16, 17, 18, 19], the RS model also gives rise to an axion phenomenology. The origin of such axions and their coupling with standard model photons is due to the coupling of the second-rank massless antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field with the electromagnetic field (photon). Such a coupling arises from the requirement of the Chern-Simons extension to cancel the U(1) gauge anomaly which also restores the U(1) invariance for an appropriate choice of gauge transformation of the KR field [20, 21]. The magnitude of the resulting axion-photon coupling is dictated by the value of the warp factor in this model [22, 23, 24] which, in turn, is determined from the fundamental requirement of the resolution of the gauge hierarchy problem discussed earlier. Whether this requirement is consistent with the available constraints on the mass of the axions and its coupling from various experimental findings is the essential goal of the present work. We assume, here, that the axion acquires a mass through various non-perturbative mechanisms. In the context of string theory, one such mechanism is mass generation through world sheet instanton corrections [25, 26]. In our analysis, we consider two distinct scenarios: (a) the gauge field propagates in the bulk [27, 28, 29, 30] and (b) the gauge field is confined on the brane. In both these cases, the KR field, which appears as closed string excitation, is assumed to reside in the bulk. In both scenarios, our analysis reveals that resolving the gauge hierarchy problem and satisfying the strong experimental bounds of axion-photon coupling simultaneously is strongly disfavoured for ultralight and light axions and allows a window for axion mass \gtrsim 0.1 [GeV] for the bulk gauge field scenario only. On the other hand, when the gauge field is confined on the brane, the current experimental bounds do not permit a possible resolution for the hierarchy problem even up to a few TeV of axion mass. We present our work as follows: We briefly describe the RS model and the origin of the axion-photon coupling in the RS model. Subsequently, we analyse in detail various bounds set by different experiments on the axion-photon coupling and the corresponding axion mass. This is then compared to test the viability of the RS model in the context of the resolution of the fine-tuning/gauge hierarchy problem as discussed earlier."

functional operator and multiverse","We explore a wider theoretical framework that has quantum field theory built-in, taking the fact that quantum mechanics is reconstructed from quantum field theory as a hint. We formulate a quantum theory with an embedded structure by introducing functional operators, and we find that it could describe the level II multiverse. Topics related to a beginning of the universe such as inflation, the third quantization and the landscape are discussed in our formulation.","Quantum field theory (QFT) or quantum theory of fields offers an excellent framework that explains a great variety of phenomena in our world and describes curious features such as creation and annihilation of particles, the dichotomy between a particle and a wave, and so on [1, 2]. In fact, QFT has been applied to various systems and been massively successful. For example, particle physics at the electroweak scale is excellently explained by the standard model [3], and the superconductivity becomes better understood by BCS theory [4] in condensed matter physics. In spite of such prominent features and triumphs of QFT, it cannot be an ultimate framework of physics because it suffers from intrinsic problems. For instance, QFT has a divergence difficulty that theoretical values of physical quantities diverge to infinity after radiative corrections are incorporated. In particular, this problem becomes serious after the gravitational interaction is introduced, because there appear infinities which cannot be removed by the renomalization procedure. Hence, QFT is currently understood as an effective theory of quantum fields [5]. Furthermore, we have several questions in mind. Q1 Why does QFT work as an effective theory of elementary particles extremely well? Why are particles or fields quantized in the first place? Q2 What is an origin of particles and spacetime? Which came first particles or space-time? Q3 Why is our universe described by the standard model at the electroweak scale? As for Q1, the relationship between QFT and quantum mechanics (QM) can be a key to solve the riddle by the following reasoning. QM describes a system with a definite number of particles very well in a simple fashion. In contrast, QFT is applied to a system that the number of particles can vary as well. In other words, the range in application of QFT is wider than that of QM, and QM can be actually reconstructed from QFT by fixing a number of particles in a system. Hence, if there were a theory that rebuilds QFT, an answer to Q1 can be derived. As for Q2, this question can be expanded and deepened as “what is an origin of physical laws and our universe?” and “which came first physical laws or our universe?”, respectively. If there were a framework to deal with particles and space-time (physical laws and our universe) as a unit, the which-came-first-particles-or-spacetime problem (which-came-first-physical-laws-or-our-universe problem) could be solved. As for Q3, this question stems from the fact that QFT possesses no powerful principle to select realistic models theoretically and completely. If there were a huge variety of universes with different particle contents and physical parameters, called “the level II multiverse” [6], there is a possibility that the existence of our universe is understood by the anthropic principle [7, 8], and a profound riddle like the cosmological constant problem is neutralized [9]. Then, Q3 substitutes for the question whether a framework to describe the level II multiverse can be constructed or not. In this paper, we explore a wider theoretical framework that has QFT built-in, taking the fact that QM is reconstructed from QFT as a hint. We formulate a quantum theory with an embedded structure by introducing functional operators, and we find that it could describe the level II multiverse. Topics related to a beginning of the universe such as inflation, the third quantization and the landscape are discussed in our formulation. The outline of this paper is as follows. In the next section, we review a framework of QFT and explain how QM is derived from QFT. In Sect. 3, we explore an underlying framework that embeds QFT, by the use of a toy model. In Sect. 4, we extend our framework in order to describe the level II multiverse and discuss physical implications on a birth of the universe. In the last section, we give conclusions and discussions. Explicit forms of Hamiltonian operators are listed for several species of particle in appendix A. More about a wave functional is explained in appendix B."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08240v1,Constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity with 3d Velocity Reconstruction from the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect,"The cosmic velocity field is an unbiased probe of the total matter distribution but is challenging to measure directly at intermediate and high redshifts. The large-scale velocity field imprints a signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect. We perform the first 3d reconstruction of the large-scale velocity field from the kSZ effect by applying a quadratic estimator to CMB temperature maps and the 3d positions of galaxies. We do so by combining CMB data from the fifth data release of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (in combination with Planck) and a spectroscopic galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We then measure the galaxy-velocity cross-power spectrum and detect the presence of the kSZ signal at a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.2\sigma. Using this galaxy-velocity cross-correlation alone, we constrain the amplitude of local primordial non-Gaussianity finding f_{\rm NL}=-90^{+210}_{-350}. This pathfinder measurement sets the stage for joint galaxy-CMB kSZ constraints to significantly enhance the f_{\rm NL} information obtained from galaxy surveys through sample variance cancellation.","Unraveling the initial conditions that seeded structure formation is one of the main objectives of modern cosmology. From a diverse set of observational datasets, we have determined that the early density field is well described by a Gaussian random field [1]. However, small deviations from pure Gaussianity, referred to as primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG), could yield crucial information about the physics of inflation (see e.g. [2]). For this Letter, we will focus on local-type PNG quantified by the parameter f_{\rm NL} through the relation [3] \displaystyle\Phi=\phi+f_{\rm NL}\left(\phi^{2}-\langle\phi^{2}\rangle\right), (1) where \Phi is the total gravitational potential and \phi is the potential for a Gaussian field. The strongest constraints on local PNG have been obtained from the CMB from Planck with f_{\rm NL}=0.8\pm 5.0 [1] while large-scale structure probes have found f_{\rm NL}=7\pm 31 using the galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum [4], -4<f_{\rm NL}<27 using the eBOSS quasar samples [5], and -87<f_{\rm NL}<19 from cross-correlations between large-scale structure (LSS) tracers and CMB lensing [6]. The former CMB constraints probe non-Gaussianity through three-point functions in the temperature and polarization maps, while the latter LSS probes exploit the fact that a non-zero f_{\rm NL} imprints a scale-dependent bias to dark matter tracers such as galaxies such that [7] \displaystyle b_{g}^{\rm NL}(k)=b_{g}+f_{\rm NL}\frac{3H_{0}^{2}\Omega_{m}% \delta_{c}(b_{g}-1)}{k^{2}T(k)D(z)}, (2) where k is the magnitude of the comoving Fourier wavenumber, H_{0} is the Hubble constant, \Omega_{m} is the relic matter density, b_{g} is the galaxy bias, T(k) is the matter transfer function, \delta_{c}=1.42 is the critical overdensity, and D(z) is the linear growth factor at redshift z. Due to the 1/k^{2} scaling of the non-Gaussian bias, most of the information about f_{\rm NL} is located on the largest scales. However, due to cosmic variance, few independent realizations of the large-scale modes exist. To overcome this sample variance, it is helpful to complement the galaxy power spectrum measurement (proportional to \left(b_{g}^{\rm NL}\right)^{2}) with information from a different tracer of the matter density [8]. As first suggested in [9], the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect in CMB maps can be used to reconstruct the velocity field, providing the necessary tracer that can dramatically improve constraints on f_{\rm NL} through sample variance cancellation. Recently, the kSZ effect was used to set bounds on f_{\rm NL} using a two-dimensional analog of the approach we demonstrate here [10], albeit without a detected kSZ signal. A similar 2d kSZ estimator was also used with the sample of luminous red galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) reaching a detection significance of 3.8\sigma [11], but in a manner insensitive to scale-dependent bias. In this Letter, we constrain f_{\rm NL} through its effect on scale-dependent bias using the full 3d information in the velocity field and detecting the kSZ signal at >7\sigma. Figure 1: Sketch diagram of a two-dimensional Gaussian overdensity (1+\delta) and corresponding gravitational potential (\Phi), velocity magnitude (|\mathbf{v}|), and line-of-sight velocity (v_{\parallel}). We note the dipolar pattern which emerges when considering the parallel component of the velocity (the y-axis is taken as the line-of-sight). On large scales, the galaxy velocity field is an unbiased tracer of the total matter density, and the radial velocity field (along the line-of-sight) can be obtained from the continuity equation \displaystyle v_{r}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)=faH\frac{ik_{r}}{k^{2}}\delta_{m}% \left(\mathbf{k}\right), (3) where f is the logarithmic growth factor, a=1/(1+z) is the scale factor, H is the Hubble expansion rate, and \mathbf{k},\;k_{r},\;k are the comoving wavenumber, its radial component and its magnitude, respectively. The cosmic velocity field is thus a perfect complement to the galaxy density field if one hopes to get past the cosmic variance limit on large scales. The challenge in this case, however, is to measure said velocities. In one instance, we can use standard candles located within galaxies to make peculiar velocity measurements [12]. This gives precise measurements but is limited to low redshifts of about z\lesssim 0.15 [13]. This reduces the volume of the survey and the range of scales we can probe, thus limiting the available information to constrain (local) primordial non-Gaussianity. We can also reconstruct the velocity field from the galaxy density [14, 15, 16, 17]. However, this requires us to assume the form of the galaxy bias and cannot be used to probe its scale-dependence. This type of velocity reconstruction is also quite sensitive to non-linear growth of structure and, therefore, is unsuitable to extract more information about the cosmic velocity field. The kSZ effect is a CMB secondary which results from the motion of electrons relative to the rest frame of the CMB. As CMB photons travel through ionized gas, they inverse Compton scatter with free electrons and gain (or lose) energy proportional to the electron line-of-sight velocity (v_{e,\;r}) \displaystyle\frac{\Delta T_{\rm kSZ}}{T_{\rm CMB}}=\int dz\frac{d\chi}{dz}K(z% )(1+\delta_{e})v_{e,\;r}, (4) where \chi is the comoving distance, \delta_{e} is the electron density contrast. The kSZ prefactor reads \displaystyle K(z)\equiv\sigma_{T}n_{e,0}(1+z)^{2}x_{e}(z)e^{-\tau(z)}, (5) where \sigma_{T} is the Compton cross-section, n_{e,0} is the present-day electron number density, x_{e} is the ionization fraction, and \tau is the optical depth. The kSZ effect induces a squeezed bispectrum between long-wavelength (k_{L}\sim 0.01\;\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}) radial velocities, short-wavelength (k_{S}\sim 1\;\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}) galaxy overdensities, and CMB secondary temperature fluctuations [18]. From this bispectrum, one can construct a 3-dimensional quadratic estimator for the radial momentum field [18, 9, 19] \displaystyle\hat{v}_{r}\left(\mathbf{k}_{L}\right)=N_{v_{r}}^{(0)}\left(% \mathbf{k}_{L}\right)\frac{K_{\rm eff}}{\chi^{2}_{\rm eff}}\int\frac{d^{3}k_{S% }}{(2\pi)^{3}}\frac{d^{2}\ell}{(2\pi)^{2}}\frac{P_{ge}(k_{S})}{C_{\ell}^{\rm tot% }P_{gg}^{\rm tot}(k_{S})}\delta_{g}^{*}(\mathbf{k}_{S})T_{\rm CMB}^{*}(\bm{% \ell})(2\pi)^{3}\delta_{D}^{3}\left(\mathbf{k}_{L}+\mathbf{k}_{S}+\frac{\bm{% \ell}}{\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}}\right), (6) where K_{\rm eff},\;\chi_{\rm eff} are evaluated at z_{\rm eff} and \delta_{D}^{3} denotes the three-dimensional Dirac delta. The P_{gg}, P_{ge}, and C_{\ell}^{\rm tot} denote the 3d galaxy-galaxy, 3d galaxy-electron, and CMB temperature map angular power spectra, respectively. Here, T_{\rm CMB}(\bm{\ell}) is the 2d Fourier transform of the beam-deconvolved CMB temperature map and \delta_{g}^{*}(\mathbf{k}_{S}) is the 3d Fourier transform of the galaxy overdensity field. We can simplify the above by directly applying a filter to the CMB temperature map, giving us an approximated kSZ temperature map through \displaystyle\hat{T}_{\rm kSZ}(\bm{\theta})=\int\frac{d^{2}\ell}{(2\pi)^{2}}e^% {i\bm{\theta}\cdot\bm{\ell}}\frac{P_{ge}(\ell/\chi_{\rm eff})}{C_{\ell}^{\rm tot% }P_{gg}^{\rm tot}(\ell/\chi_{\rm eff})}T_{\rm CMB}(\bm{\ell}). (7) The galaxy auto-spectrum and the galaxy-electron cross-spectrum are obtained using the halo model prescription implemented in the hmvec code 111https://github.com/simonsobs/hmvec[18]. The reconstruction in Eq. 6 produces a “box” of the 3d momentum field, whose noise per mode on large scales tends to a constant \displaystyle N_{v_{r}}^{(0)}=\frac{\chi^{2}_{\rm eff}}{K^{2}_{\rm eff}}\left(% \int\frac{k_{S}dk_{S}}{2\pi}\;\frac{\left[P_{ge}\left(k_{S}\right)\right]^{2}}% {P_{gg}^{\rm tot}\left(k_{S}\right)C_{\ell}^{\rm tot}}\right)^{-1}, (8) where the CMB power spectrum is evaluated at \ell=k_{S}/\chi_{\rm eff}. With the noise being constant, we can calculate a temperature-based velocity weight by rescaling the approximated kSZ map through \displaystyle\hat{T}_{v_{r}}(\bm{\theta},z)=N_{v_{r}}^{(0)}\frac{K_{\rm eff}}{% \chi^{2}_{\rm eff}}\hat{T}_{\rm kSZ}(\bm{\theta}). (9) Since the exact distribution of electrons on cosmological scales is unknown, our choice of model for the galaxy-electron cross-spectrum introduces a bias in the reconstructed velocity field such that [18] \displaystyle\langle\hat{v}_{r}(\mathbf{k})\rangle=b_{v}(\mathbf{k})v_{r}(% \mathbf{k}) (10) where b_{v} is the velocity reconstruction bias. It has been shown to be constant on large scales [19]. This bias stems from the optical depth degeneracy of kSZ measurements and the uncertainties of baryonic physics. If our fiducial P_{ge} captures the true galaxy-electron correlation, we expect this bias to converge to unity. Since the true P_{ge} is not known a priori, we focus on large scales and marginalize over this parameter in our analysis. Since the reconstruction bias is perfectly degenerate with the combination f\sigma_{8}, our estimator cannot measure the growth function as with peculiar velocities surveys [20]. This degeneracy can be broken in a sufficiently high SNR measurements by modeling the galaxy-velocity octupole in combination with the dipole. Figure 2: (Left panel) Galaxy density in the CMASS NGC sample used in the reconstruction process. Darker shades correspond to higher density regions. (Right panel) Smoothed map of the reconstructed line-of-sight momentum using the quadratic estimator on the CMASS NGC sample. The angular direction denotes right ascension and the field are summed along the declination axis. The bluer regions denote motion towards the observer in the velocity panel. I.1 Data To measure the kSZ signal, we use CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Planck satellite together with galaxy positions and spectroscopic redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey twelfth data release (SDSS BOSS DR12; [21, 22]). The CMB maps we use are ACT+Planck co-adds [23] at central frequencies of roughly 90 and 150 GHz (labeled f090 and f150). We describe the processing and filtering of these maps in Appendix A. For our galaxy sample, we limit our analysis to the North Galactic Cap (NGC) of the CMASS survey with 0.43<z<0.7 and z_{\rm eff}=0.55, since it it is the largest contiguous area from BOSS that has overlap with ACT data. We also do not include the LOWZ sample as its low effective redshift does not allow us to reconstruct sufficiently large scales."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08087v1,Fréchet Vectors as sensitive tools for blind tests of CMB anomalies,"Cosmological data collected on a sphere, such as CMB anisotropies, are typically represented by the spherical harmonic coefficients, denoted as a_{\ell m}. The angular power spectrum, or C_{\ell}, serves as the fundamental estimator of the variance in this data. Alternatively, spherical data and their variance can also be characterized using Multipole Vectors (MVs) and the Fréchet variance. The vectors that minimize this variance, known as Fréchet Vectors (FVs), define the center of mass of points on a compact space, making them highly sensitive to small displacements of these points. This sensitivity makes FVs excellent indicators of statistical correlations between different multipoles. We demonstrate this using both simulations and real data. Through simulations, we show that FVs enable a blind detection and reconstruction of the location associated with a mock Cold Spot anomaly introduced in an otherwise isotropic sky. Applying this to the 2018 Planck maps, we implement several improvements on previous model-independent tests of Gaussianity and statistical isotropy, down to arc-minute scales. When compared with simulated maps that incorporate masking and anisotropic noise, for 2\leq\ell\leq 1500, while Planck’s MVs appear consistent with these hypotheses, the corresponding FVs reject them with significances between 5.2 and 8.3\sigma, depending on the component separation method.","Ever since its discovery, cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation has played a central role in the development of modern cosmology. Following its first detection by Penzias & Wilson, the three generations of space-based instruments, together with several ground-based telescopes and balloon experiments (see [1] for a brief review), have cemented our understanding of the early universe and the Big Bang paradigm. In particular, they were pivotal in establishing \LambdaCDM as our de-facto standard cosmological model. CMB anisotropies are arguably the cleanest and most direct observational window into the early universe that we have. This conclusion is supported by our precise understanding of the physics that produce the observed fluctuations across different scales, due in part to the fact that these fluctuations largely occur in a regime where the dynamics is essentially linear. If the universe is further assumed to have primordial fluctuations which are Gaussian, and to have translational and rotational symmetries, as dictated by the Cosmological Principle, the angular power spectrum, C_{\ell}, becomes a summary statistic that encapsulates all available information. Although the measured C_{\ell}s of the CMB temperature map are in excellent agreement with what one would expect from a Gaussian, and statistically isotropic (GSI) universe [2, 3], and no detection of primordial non-Gaussianity has yet been made [4], deviations from the GSI expectations are certainly present in the data. Some arise naturally from known second-order perturbations, such as CMB lensing [5], detected at over 40\sigma [6], and aberration and Doppler couplings due to the observer motion [7, 8], detected at around 6\sigma [9]. However, other so-called anomalies have been found, which have no consensual explanation [10, 11]. Some of these deviations may be due to different cosmological models, or they may be simpler flukes in the data. Thus, a central issue is to tell whether measured deviations are of a cosmological, astrophysical, or systematic nature. This prompts us to examine the data using alternative mathematical representations, summary statistics, or both. This particular approach to the analysis of CMB anisotropies is not new. In fact, CMB studies have long benefited from alternative representations of the usual harmonic analysis, as exemplified by the extensive use of wavelets [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], Minkowski functionals [18, 19, 20, 21], and multipole vectors [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. These are versatile tools, applicable to a wide range of topics in CMB data analysis, from component separation methods [27], to non-Gaussianities [19, 20, 16], and cosmic topologies [28, 24]. Alternatively, if a null test of the GSI hypotheses is desired, then one can keep the usual harmonic approach and dispose of anisotropic and model-independent implementations of two-point correlation functions and their estimators [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. Among these tools, Multipole Vectors (MVs) figure as the least explored by cosmologists. Originally introduced by Maxwell in the context of electrostatics, they are an alternative to the standard harmonic basis, summarized by the multipolar coefficients a_{\ell m}s, to describe CMB fluctuations [22]. In the multipole vector basis, the 2\ell+1 degrees of freedom characterizing a given CMB multipole \ell are split into \ell unit headless vectors plus a scalar which, in the case of GSI skies, is proportional to the (cosmology-dependent) C_{\ell}s. Thus, in the standard cosmological model, MVs carry all the C_{\ell}-independent data contained in the a_{\ell m}s. Moreover, they are naturally invariant under spatial rotations, unlike the a_{\ell m}s which mix ms in such cases. These properties make the MVs an interesting tool to probe deviations from Gaussianity and isotropy hypotheses in a model-independent way [26]. This motivation led to a recent development of the code polyMV, discussed below, which allows efficient computation of the MVs at all scales, which was previously not possible [26]. Although the MV set contains all the information of a given scalar map of the sky, often in cosmology we make use of summary statistics to analyze the data. In the context of MVs, summary statistics have been designed for the specific task of detecting CMB anomalies [22, 35] or, more specifically, possible alignments between low \ell multipoles, which is one of the observed anomalies of the CMB [36, 37, 38]. For this reason, these statistics invariably mix vectors from different multipoles, and thus cannot be used as a summary of the behavior of the CMB at each angular scale. It is therefore interesting to have a summary statistic for each multipole, that is still capable of detecting deviations from isotropy. One such statistic is the Fréchet vectors (FVs), originally proposed in [26]. Frechét vectors borrow from the mathematical definition of variance in metric spaces, also known as Fréchet variance, to build a geometrically motivated and model-independent summary statistic of the MVs which results in one unit and headless vector per CMB multipole. These vectors are geometrically defined as the position of the “center of mass” of the MVs on the unit sphere and have many interesting geometrical and statistical properties. First, being based on the MVs, they are C_{\ell}-independent and have an isotropic 1-point distribution function in the case of GSI skies [26]. Second, since they result from compressing \ell vectors into just one, they are less prone to cosmic variance. Finally, because the direction of each FV is defined by the collection of \ell multipole vectors, the FVs are more susceptible to very small angular variations of each MV, which can result in greater sensitivity to anisotropies in the data. Here we demonstrate, using simulations, that the FVs can be directly correlated with spatial anisotropies artificially introduced in the input maps. This allows in principle for a blind reconstruction of spatial anisotropies of real CMB maps. We illustrate this for the case of a mock Cold Spot anomaly [39, 40], and show that in the case of a spot of nearly the same aperture but twice as cold, FVs can detect its presence and pinpoint its axis blindly. We also analyze real Planck 2018 data with a straightforward chi-squared test of the null GSI hypotheses using 1-point statistics of both MVs and FVs. Overall, we find Planck’s MVs to be consistent with GSI simulations, including mask and instrumental anisotropic noise across all scales considered (2\leq\ell\leq 2000). In contrast, Planck’s FVs rule them out with varying statistical strengths. These depend on whether we probe scales with high (\ell<1500) or low (\ell\geq 1500) signal-to-noise ratios. Conservatively, we find NILC and SMICA to be inconsistent with GSI simulations at 3.5\sigma and 4.3\sigma, respectively, in the former region. We include many important improvements in the analysis compared to [26], such as a pixel-based implementation (as opposed to an independent analysis on both angular coordinates of these vectors), an improved evaluation of MVs and FVs covariance matrix, and the inclusion of the simulated anisotropic noise in our simulations, which allowed for an extension of our tests to the scales 1500\leq\ell\leq 2000, where CMB maps are known to contain residual anisotropies. We start Section 2 by recalling the formalism of the MVs. We then introduce the notion of statistical variance in Riemannian spaces, from which the FVs are defined. In Section 3 we analyze a mock Cold Spot model. In Section 4 we describe our pixel-based implementation of a null test of Gaussianity and isotropy, and in Section 5 we present the results of our tests on 2018 Planck maps. We conclude in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08031v1,\tilde{\xi}-attractors in metric-affine gravity,"We propose a new class of inflationary attractors in metric-affine gravity. Such class features a non-minimal coupling \tilde{\xi}\,\Omega(\phi) with the Holst invariant \tilde{\cal R} and an inflaton potential proportional to \Omega(\phi)^{2}. The attractor behaviour of the class takes place with two combined strong coupling limits. The first limit is realized at large \tilde{\xi}, which makes the theory equivalent to a \tilde{\cal R}^{2} model. Then, the second limit considers a very small Barbero-Immirzi parameter which leads the inflationary predictions of the \tilde{\cal R}^{2} model towards the ones of Starobinsky inflation. Because of the analogy with the renown \xi-attractors, we label this new class as \tilde{\xi}-attractors.","Cosmic inflation, i.e. an accelerated expansion during the very early Universe, is the current paradigm for explaining the flatness and homogeneity of the Universe at large scales [1, 2, 3, 4]. Moreover, it also provides an origin for the small inhomogeneities observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. In its minimal version, inflation is usually formulated by adding to the Einstein-Hilbert action one scalar field, the inflaton, whose energy density induces a near-exponential expansion. The latest combination of Planck, BICEP/Keck and BAO data [5] has sensibly reduced the allowed parameters space, strongly favouring nearly-flat concave inflaton potentials and already ruling out many proposed models. Nevertheless, the most popular inflationary realizations, the Starobinsky model [1] and Higgs-inflation [6], still sit in the allowed region. Both models can be described by a scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity (e.g. [7] and references therein). However, when theories are non-minimally coupled to gravity there is more than one choice of the dynamical degrees of freedom. In the more popular metric gravity, the metric tensor is the only dynamical degree of freedom, while the connection is fixed to be the Levi-Civita one. On the other hand, in metric-affine gravity (MAG), both the metric and the connection are dynamical variables and their corresponding equations of motion will dictate the eventual relation between them. When the gravity action contains only the term linear in the curvature scalar, the two approaches lead to equivalent theories (e.g. [8] and refs. therein), otherwise the theories are completely different [8, 9, 10] and lead to different phenomenological predictions, as recently investigated in e.g. [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63]. Moreover, MAG admits two, rather than just one, two-derivative curvature invariants: the usual Ricci-like scalar and the Holst invariant [64, 65, 66], which can be used to construct new models (e.g. [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78]). The purpose of this article is to study a new model in MAG, where the Jordan frame inflaton scalar potential is proportional to the square of the non-minimal coupling function involving the Holst invariant and/or the Ricci-like curvature scalar. As we will see later, this kind of setup will induce a new class of inflationary attractors. The discussion is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the action for our inflationary model in metric-affine gravity. For the sake of minimality, we consider only constructions where the physical degrees of freedom are only the graviton and the inflaton. In Section 3 we present an analytical study of the inflaton potential and describe how the attractor configuration is reached. Then, in Section 4 we present a detailed numerical study with the corresponding inflationary predictions. Finally, in Section 5 we summarize our conclusions. In addition, in Appendix A, we show the full analytical equations of the slow-roll parameters and the inflationary observables."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07980v1,"Nonlinear Effects in Black Hole Ringdown Made Simple:
Quasi-Normal Modes as Adiabatic Modes","The nonlinear nature of general relativity manifests prominently throughout the merger of two black holes, from the inspiral phase to the final ringdown. Notably, the quasi-normal modes generated during the ringdown phase display significant nonlinearities. We show that these nonlinear effects can be effectively captured by zooming in on the photon ring through the Penrose limit. Specifically, we model the quasi-normal modes as null particles trapped in unstable circular orbits around the black holes and show that they can be interpreted as adiabatic modes, perturbations that are arbitrarily close to large diffeomorphisms. This enables the derivation of a simple analytical expression for the QNM nonlinearities for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes which reproduces well the existing numerical results.","References Abbott et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07897v1,MODIFIED LANDAUER PRINCIPLE ACCORDING TO TSALLIS ENTROPY,"The Landauer principle establishes a lower bound in the amount of energy that should be dissipated in the erasure of one bit of information. The specific value of this dissipated energy is tightly related to the definition of entropy. In this article, we present a generalization of the Landauer principle based on the Tsallis entropy. Some consequences resulting from such a generalization are discussed. These consequences include the modification to the mass ascribed to one bit of information, the generalization of the Landauer principle to the case when the system is embedded in a gravitational field, and the number of bits radiated in the emission of gravitational waves.","The Landauer principle Ref. [1], which is a cornerstone in the theory of information, states that the erasure of one bit of information stored in a system implies the dissipation of energy, whose value cannot be smaller than \bigtriangleup E=kT\ln 2, (1) where k is the Boltzmann constant and T denotes the temperature of the environment. The important point to keep in mind here is that even though the value of dissipated energy depends on the erasure procedure, it cannot be lower that Equation (1). At this point, some remarks are needed, as follows: • It has been argued in the past (see for example Ref. [2]) ) that the main idea stated in the Landauer principle appears already in some Brillouin works Ref. [3]. We shall skip this controversy and shall adopt the notation used by most of researchers, and we shall refer to it as the Landauer principle. • In spite of some arguments put forward in the past questioning the relevance of the Landauer principle (see Ref. [4] and references therein), the important point to retain here is that on the one hand it allows an “informational” reformulation of thermodynamics, as stressed in Ref. [4], and on the other hand brings out a link between information theory and different branches of science Refs. [5, 6, 7]. This allows us to approach some physical problems from the point of view of information theory. • The expression Equation (1) for the dissipated energy heavily relies on the concept of entropy. More specifically, such an expression was found using the Gibbs entropy. Therefore, we should expect different expressions for alternative definitions of entropy."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07856v1,Gravity from thermodynamics in vacuum: Lorentz invariance and the role of Bel-Robinson tensor,"Thermodynamics of local causal horizons have been shown to encode the information necessary to derive the equations governing the gravitational dynamics. We have previously shown that, in the presence of matter, this derivation further implies quantum phenomenological corrections to gravitational dynamics. Herein, we study whether similar corrections also occur in vacuum. We show that, under the assumptions of locality and local Lorentz invariance of physics, the vacuum dynamics is prescribed by the Einstein equations. We also discuss an alternative paradigm which assumes the existence of a preferred direction of time (much like in Einstein-aether or Hořava-Lifshitz gravity). Then, we find an modified gravitational dynamics in which Ricci curvature is sourced by Bel-Robinson super-energy.","Gravitational dynamics shares a strong connection with thermodynamics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This relation becomes especially clear in the way the heat term appears in the first law of black hole thermodynamics. This term can be derived directly from the gravitational Lagrangian as a conserved charge associated with the time translational Killing symmetry [3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], without imposing any further assumptions. Then, quantum field theory in curved backgrounds shows that black holes emit thermal radiation, assigning a physical temperature to the black hole [11] (the Hawking temperature). With these two ingredients, the ratio of the heat term in the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the Hawking temperature yields the expression for the black hole entropy. Notably, no similarly straightforward link between the dynamics and the entropy appears in other physical theories, making gravity unique in this regard. The black hole entropy not only follows directly from the gravitational Lagrangian, but actually contains enough information to reconstruct the gravitational dynamics [4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. More precisely, the dynamics can be derived by first requiring that gravitational entropy is not specific for black holes, but instead a universal property of any causal horizon. This assumption is supported by a number of results obtained for thermodynamics of various horizons, see e.g. [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 25]. Then, one can construct a local, observer-dependent causal horizon in every regular spacetime point and study the changes in its entropy. It turns out that the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions imposed on such local horizons encode (locally) the equations governing the gravitational dynamics. If the equivalence principle111More precisely, one in general needs the Einstein equivalence principle. Specifically, to recover the Einstein equations a more stringent formulation, the strong equivalence principle (valid for gravitational test physics) is required [15]. For detailed discussion of the various formulations of the equivalence principle and their relations, see [33]. holds, these equations are valid throughout the spacetime. This approach not only recovers Einstein equations [4, 15, 19], but also the equations of motion of any gravitational theory whose Lagrangian is an arbitrary function of the metric and the Riemann tensor [16, 20, 21, 22], using the corresponding gravitational Wald entropy expression [6]. Moreover, these local equilibrium conditions phrased instead in terms of quantum von Neumann entropy have been shown to encode the semiclassical Einstein equations in which the quantum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor serves as the source term for the classical spacetime curvature [17, 18, 19, 20]. Herein, inspired by this success of thermodynamic methods in recovering the classical and semiclassical gravitational dynamics, we, following a research program we started some years ago, employ them to peer one step further, to low energy quantum gravitational effects. To this end, we consider the leading order quantum gravitational correction to entropy of causal horizon, a term proportional to the logarithm of the horizon area. Remarkably, a leading order correction term of this form is nearly universally predicted by various approaches to quantum gravity [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39] and also by some theory-independent considerations [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48]. This generality of the logarithmic term in horizon entropy makes its influence on gravity robust and independent of any specific approach to quantum gravity. We have previously studied the effect of this term on the linearised gravitational dynamics, finding a result equivalent to the linearised equations of motion of quadratic gravity. We have also shown that beyond the linearised regime, it leads to correction terms quadratic in the Ricci tensor which do not appear in quadratic gravity, marking a clear departure from it. However, in both special cases we studied so far the corrections to gravitational dynamics that only occur in the presence of matter. In the present work, we ask whether the Einstein equations are modified even in vacuum. We show that imposing the local Lorentz invariance prohibits any such modifications. Nevertheless, if one chooses to introduce a preferred local direction of time, the thermodynamic derivation yields a scalar equation resembling the Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity with a source term proportional to the Bel-Robinson tensor contracted with the local direction of time in all indices [49, 50] (such a scalar is known as the Bel-Robinson super-energy density). The Bel-Robinson tensor is quadratic in the Weyl tensor and satisfies an analogy of the dominant energy condition valid for the energy-momentum tensor. It has been suggested that the Bel-Robinson super-energy density can be interpreted as a quasilocal gravitational energy density per unit surface area [51, 50]. This interpretation appears to be consistent with the role the Bel-Robinson super-energy density plays in the geometry of small spheres [52, 53]. Therefore, its appearance as a source term for the Hamiltonian constraint is somewhat intuitive, since in general relativity the source term is the matter-energy density. In this work, we realise the local causal horizons as causal diamonds. The changes of the area of the horizon of causal diamonds in vacuum and their relation to the Bel-Robinson tensor have been explored in previous works [54, 55]. We build on the results of these references, connecting them with the derivation of the equations governing the gravitational dynamics. This connection is made possible by two innovations we introduce compared to the previous works. First, we work with the light-cone cut construction of the local causal diamonds, slightly modifying its original version [55], to make it suitable for deriving the gravitational equations. Second, as we discuss in section III, considering the logarithmic correction to entropy allows us to obtain nontrivial local corrections to the traceless Einstein equations. The paper is organised as follows. In section II, we briefly recall the derivation of the traceless Einstein equations from thermodynamics of local causal diamonds. Section III derives the corrections in vacuum, finding them to be proportional to the Bel-Robinson tensor in four spacetime dimensions. We discuss a possible interpretation of these corrections in terms of a gravitational theory violating the local Lorentz invariance in section IV. Lastly, section V focuses on possible physical interpretation of our results and outlines the future developments."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07734v1,The stability of the greybody factor of Hayward black hole,"In this study, we investigate the stability of the greybody factor of Hayward black holes by adding a small bump to the effective potential. Considering the greybody factor is a function of frequency, we define the so-called \mathcal{G}-factor and \mathcal{H}-factor to quantitatively characterize its stability. We study the stability of the greybody factor within the equal amplitude method and the equal energy method, respectively. Here, the equal amplitude method can be directly imposed by fixing the amplitude of the bump, while the equal energy method requires a physical definition of the energy of the bump with the assistance of hyperboloidal framework. For both the equal amplitude method and the equal energy method, when the location of the bump is close to the event horizon of the black hole, and the closer it is to the peak of original potential, the larger are \mathcal{G}-factor and \mathcal{H}-factor, and they are bounded by the magnitude of the amplitude or the energy. More importantly, for the equal amplitude method, two factors tend to a specific value as the location of the bump increases. In contrast, for the equal energy method, two factors converge to zero as the location of the bump increases. Notably, the \mathcal{G}-factor and the \mathcal{H}-factor are insensitive to the regular parameter of Hayward black hole. Therefore, our results indicate that the greybody factor is stable under specific perturbations.","The ringdown phase of a black hole serves as a crucial probe for testing gravitational theories, and it can be described using the linear perturbation theory of black holes. The ringdown spectrum is characterized by a discrete set of quasinormal modes (QNMs) with complex frequencies Berti et al. (2009); Konoplya and Zhidenko (2011), which encode information about the geometric structure of the background spacetime. As the accuracy of gravitational wave detection enhances, research efforts have shifted towards investigating the QNM spectra of black holes immersed in surrounding matter. This shift is motivated by the fact that black holes do not exist in isolation but are inherently embedded within astrophysical environments Barausse et al. (2014); Cannizzaro et al. (2024). Initial studies Nollert (1996); Nollert and Price (1999) have shown that QNM spectra are sensitive to small perturbations, challenging the assumption that a good approximation of the effective potential would yield minimal deviations in the observed spectra, and many extensive studies have aligned with this conclusion. Current approaches used to study the spectrum instability can be broadly divided into two categories: one involves modifying the effective potential of the black hole Daghigh et al. (2020); Qian et al. (2021); Cardoso et al. (2024); Courty et al. (2023); Berti et al. (2022); Cheung et al. (2022); Li et al. (2024); Yang et al. (2024), the other involves using pseudospectrum analysis Jaramillo et al. (2021); Destounis and Duque (2023); Jaramillo et al. (2022); Destounis et al. (2021); Areán et al. (2023); Boyanov et al. (2024); Cownden et al. (2024); Sarkar et al. (2023); Destounis et al. (2024); Boyanov et al. (2023); Carballo and Withers (2024); Chen et al. (2024); Cao et al. (2024); Arean et al. (2024); Garcia-Fariña et al. (2024); Luo (2024); Warnick (2024). Recently, some authors have suggested that another universal characteristic, namely the black hole greybody factor, represented by \Gamma_{lm}, where l and m refer to different angular modes, could potentially serve as a valuable tool for modeling the amplitude of the ringdown phase Oshita (2023, 2024); Okabayashi and Oshita (2024). It means that the ringdown spectral amplitude |\tilde{h}_{lm}(\omega)| can be modeled by the greybody factor. One significant advantage of modeling by using greybody factors lies in the fact that it requires fewer parameters compared to modeling with superposed QNMs, thereby one can effectively avoid the potential overfitting issue and the start time problem in ringdown modeling. Furthermore, studies on the stability of greybody factors can be found in Rosato et al. (2024); Oshita et al. (2024); Ianniccari et al. (2024). These studies indicate that the greybody factors are stable under small perturbations of the system, which is exactly the opposite of the stability of QNMs. Penrose’s singularity theorem Penrose (1965); Hawking and Penrose (1970) states that within the classical general relativity (GR) framework, the occurrence of singularities is inevitable, which leads to the breakdown of physical laws Hawking (1976); Senovilla (1998). The studies of regular black holes have become an important topic in gravitational physics, aimed at exploring ways to solve the singularity problem in classical GR. Therefore, to avoid the conceptual and physical challenges posed by singularities, several models of regular (non-singular) black holes have been proposed Bambi (2023). The Hayward black hole, which is one important among regular balck holes, is proposed in Hayward (2006). The Hayward black hole can also be regarded as a quantum correction to the Schwarzschild black hole Frolov (2016), and exploring the gravitational waves of the Hayward black hole is one of the important means to study quantum effects of black holes. As mentioned earlier, the greybody factor is suitable for modeling gravitational waves, so it is necessary to consider the stability of the greybody factor for the Hayward black hole. In addition, although the greybody factor of Hayward black hole has been studied in Konoplya (2023), the stability of the greybody factor of Hayward black holes is still lack. Studying the stability of the greybody factor of Hayward black holes can serve as a typical example of studying the stability of the greybody factor of regular black holes. It will help us understand the influence of regular parameters on the stability of the greybody factor of black holes. It should be emphasized here that when we study the stability of QNM spectra, given that QNM frequencies are only complex numbers, the way to quantitatively characterize their stabilities is relatively simple. As far as we know, the formula currently used to quantitatively characterize the stability of spectra is |\omega^{(\epsilon)}-\omega^{(0)}|/|\omega^{(0)}|, where \omega^{(\epsilon)} denotes the perturbed QNM frequency and \omega^{(0)} denotes the unperturbed QNM frequency. This formula has been applied to a number of references Destounis and Duque (2023); Cardoso et al. (2024); Cheung et al. (2022); Courty et al. (2023); Cao et al. (2024). Alternatively, some authors propose another formula \lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\delta\omega_{n}/\epsilon to quantitatively characterize the sensitivity of QNM frequencies Yang et al. (2024). But things are not so direct or simple for the greybody factor, because we see that the greybody factor is a function of \omega\in\mathbb{R}. There are various ways to evaluate the differences between the original greybody factor and the perturbed greybody factor. Similar to researches on QNM stability, we also study the stability of the greybody factor by adding a small bump to the original effective potential. In this work, we propose various comparison methods to describe the difference between the greybody factor after perturbation and the original greybody factor, i.e., the so-called \mathcal{G}-factor and \mathcal{H}-factor. The \mathcal{G}-factor is based on the L^{p} integral, and \mathcal{H}-factor is the Hausdorff distance. The detailed definitions of two factors can be found in the main text. For convenience, we limit the parameter space of perturbation in two dimensions, namely, the amplitude and position of the perturbation. Additionally, we categorize our approaches to selecting parameters into two types: the first is called equal amplitude method, and the second is called equal energy method. For the equal amplitude method, just as its name implies, we will discuss the impact of the bump’s position on the stability of the Hayward black hole’s greybody factor by keeping the amplitude unchanged. Based on the hyperboloidal framework Panosso Macedo (2024); Panosso Macedo and Zenginoglu (2024), the physical size, i.e., energy norm, carried by the bump can be well defined Jaramillo et al. (2021); Gasperin and Jaramillo (2022). Based on it, we will discuss the impact of the bump’s position on the stability of the greybody factor by keeping the energy carried by the bump unchanged as the equal energy method. The remains of this paper are organized as follows. In Sec.II, we give the hyperboloidal framework of the Hayward black hole and more details can be found in Appendix.A. In Sec.III, we show the stability of the greybody factors of Hayward black hole. Sec.IV provides the conclusions and discussions. In the Appendix.B, we provide the QNM frequencies of the Hayward black hole."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07692v1,Crunch from AdS bubble collapse in unbounded potentials,"We consider a scalar field theory with a Minkowski false vacuum and an unbounded (or very deep) true vacuum. We show compelling evidence that an AdS bubble of vanishing total energy, embedded in asymptotically flat spacetime, generically undergoes a spherical collapse which leads to a space-like curvature singularity after the formation of trapped surfaces and apparent horizons. The crunch singularity, which is hided behind an apparent horizon, occurs before the true vacuum is reached, and the existence of a lower bound of the scalar field potential is not a necessary condition for its formation.","Scalar fields with zero-energy false vacua and deep true vacua are commonplace in high energy physics, e.g., Bosonic String theory and the String theory landscape Polchinski (2007); Agmon et al. (2022), possibly the Standard Model Higgs Elias-Miro et al. (2012), etc. In the context of early-universe cosmology, transitions of a scalar field into the negative true vacuum could lead to rich phenomenology, e.g., expanding and/or collapsing Anti-de Sitter (AdS) domains, primordial black hole formation, constraining inflationary scenarios Espinosa et al. (2015); Jain and Hertzberg (2020); De Luca et al. (2022), and dark matter production scenarios Espinosa et al. (2018). The evolution of a gravitating bubble with a negative energy-density core has been mainly studied analytically, employing the thin-wall approximation Weinberg (2012); Coleman and De Luccia (1980); Abbott and Coleman (1985); Espinosa et al. (2015); De Luca et al. (2022). In recent years, there have been numerical Strumia and Tetradis (2022) and analytical Dong and Harlow (2011); Kanno and Soda (2012); Kanno et al. (2012); Espinosa (2020); Espinosa et al. (2021) studies (based on analytic continuations from Euclidean Instanton and Bounce solutions), going beyond the thin-wall approximation, for potentials of specific forms. It has been established that the interior of the AdS bubble undergoes a gravitational collapse, leading to the formation of trapped surfaces, and a space-like singularity behind them, known as the AdS crunch. Depending on the details of the bubble configuration and its embedding Espinosa et al. (2015), e.g., if the total (ADM) mass is positive, zero or negative, and on whether the asymptotic spacetime is dS, Minkowski or AdS, the exterior of the bubble could collapse – leading to a black hole, or expand – engulfing the entire false vacuum. In this work we study for the first time the gravitational collapse of an AdS bubble of a scalar field with a Minkowski false vacuum and an unbounded (or very deep) true vacuum. We show that the existence of a lower bound of the scalar field potential is not a necessary condition for the formation of trapped surfaces and apparent horizons. We discover an apparent horizon can be generated while the scalar field is rolling down the slope of the unbounded potential (or towards its deep true vacuum, if the potential is bounded). Namely, a naked singularity does not form. This is in contrast with the commonly accepted picture that trapped surfaces appear after the true vacuum is reached. We consider a natural scalar field potential – a quadratic false vacuum, and an infinite (or very deep) true vacuum, approached along a quartic slope. We do not employ the thin wall approximation. We assume the bubble collapse follows its nucleation through an O(4)-symmetric instanton, known as the Coleman-De Luccia instanton. We also assume the subsequent bubble collapse is O(3,1) symmetric, reducing its equations of motion to a system of ODEs which is readily solved. The validity of the O(3,1) symmetry is straightforwardly proven for the bubble exterior. If the solution is analytic, it immediately follows that the bubble interior is also O(3,1) symmetric. However, it needs to be shown in general, as the solution may not be analytic. To this end, we independently numerically solve the Einstein and Klein-Gordon PDEs, using different coordinate system and slicing condition, without assuming O(3,1) symmetry but only spherical symmetry. We employ the 3+1 ADM formalism. The simulations confirm the O(4) initial data gives rise to a globally O(3,1) bubble, validating our ODE approach and its conclusions. We observe the scalar field continuously speeds up its roll along the steepening negative slope, the positive kinetic energy grows, eventually overtakes the negative potential energy, rendering the core energy density positive. The positive energy-density core leads to the formation of trapped surfaces, and the subsequent rapid unbounded growth of the energy density (and associated geometric invariants) signifies the formation of the crunch singularity. This is in accordance with the notion that the formation of trapped surfaces is one of the sufficient (along with others) conditions for geodesic incompleteness, i.e., singularity existence Hawking and Ellis (2023). The work is organised as follows. In Section II we present the details of the model. Section III outlines the initial conditions for the bubble collapse, which are based on the quantum bubble nucleation from a false vacuum. The subsequent bubble evolution is studied in Section IV. We present our summary in Section V. Technical details about scaling symmetries of the model, numerical GR studies and their results are delegated to the appendices. Throughout the paper, we work in units in which \hbar=c=1, and the reduced Planck mass is m_{pl}=1/\sqrt{8\pi G_{N}}. We use the Einstein summation convention for repeated Greek and Latin indices."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07648v1,Primordial Black Hole Formation from Type II Fluctuations with Primordial Non-Gaussianity,"This study investigates the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) resulting from the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations with large amplitudes and non-Gaussianity. Ref. [1] showed that fluctuations with large amplitudes lead to the formation of type B PBHs, characterized by the existence of the bifurcating trapping horizons, distinct from the more common type A PBHs without a bifurcating trapping horizon. We focus on the local type non-Gaussianity characterized by the curvature perturbation \zeta given by a function of a Gaussian random variable \zeta_{\rm G} as \beta\zeta=-\ln(1-\beta\zeta_{\rm G}) with a parameter \beta. Then we examine how the non-Gaussianity influences the dynamics and the type of PBH formed, particularly focusing on type II fluctuations, where the areal radius varies non-monotonically with the coordinate radius. Our findings indicate that, for \beta>-2, the threshold for distinguishing between type A and type B PBHs decreases with increasing \beta similarly to the threshold for black hole formation. Additionally, for large positive values of \beta, the threshold for type B PBHs approaches that for type II fluctuations. We also find that, for a sufficiently large negative value of \beta\lesssim-4.0, the threshold value is in the type II region of \mu, i.e., there are fluctuations of type II that do not form black holes. Lastly, we calculate the PBH mass for several values of \beta. Then we observe that the final mass monotonically increases with the initial amplitude within the parameter region of type A PBHs, which differs from previous analytical expectations.","Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are Black Holes (BHs) formed in the early universe, which can play a crucial role in exploring the early universe [2, 3, 4, 5]. They are unique probes of statistical properties of the small-scale primordial inhomogeneity. In addition, they are considered as one of the candidates for dark matter and could be detected as black hole binaries by gravitational wave interferometers [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In the standard scenario of PBH formation, PBHs are formed during the radiation-dominated era when regions of extremely high density, generated by fluctuations during the inflationary period, undergo gravitational collapse [4]. In this scenario, an enhancement of the power spectrum of the curvature fluctuations is typically necessary to produce a considerable fraction of PBHs in the form of dark matter, which can be followed by the generation of non-Gaussianity. Non-Gaussianities can have a significant effect on the PBH formation process and abundance [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], and on induced gravitational waves [21, 22, 23, 24, 25] (see [26] for a focused review on non-Gaussianities). On the other side, when the initial amplitude of the primordial fluctuation is extremely large, we may have a non-monotonic behaviour of the areal radius as a function of the radial coordinate r, and we call it type II fluctuation following Ref. [27], while standard fluctuations with monotonic behavior of the areal radius type I fluctuation. The study of PBH formation associated with type II fluctuations has been conducted using the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) solution, which is the analytic solution for the dust fluid, in Ref. [27]. Type II fluctuations may have a very low probability of generation due to their huge amplitude far above its threshold, and they are usually considered to contribute negligibly to the abundance of PBHs. However, it has been pointed out that if the statistics of the curvature fluctuations exhibit non-Gaussianity, the threshold of the amplitude for PBH formation may be close to that for the realization of type II fluctuations, and type II fluctuations may significantly contribute to the PBH abundance [28]. Moreover, in Ref. [29], type II fluctuations have been observed surrounding the bubbles (which eventually will produce PBHs [30]) formed when the inflaton overshoots the barrier separating a local minimum of the inflaton potential in a single-field inflationary model. As non-Gaussianity increases, the vacuum bubble formation channel becomes dominant in comparison with the adiabatic one. As a result, the mass and abundance of PBHs are primarily given by those of type II fluctuations. Recently, Ref. [1] simulated PBH formation from type II fluctuations. It was proposed to classify PBH types into type A/B depending on the existence of the bifurcating trapping horizons, independently of the type of the initial fluctuations, type I/II. We also follow this convention in this paper. In this work, we mainly explore the behaviour of fluctuations of type II under the effect of non-gaussianities. In particular, based on the typical profile depending on a non-Gaussian parameter, we investigate the threshold between type A/B PBH and how the PBH mass depends on the initial amplitude of the fluctuation. Our study aims to give insights and get a deeper understanding of the behavior of fluctuations of type II, specifically focusing on the scenario of non-Gaussianities. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce spherically symmetric curvature fluctuations with non-Gaussianity on the super-horizon scale. In Section 3, we introduce the compaction function, which serves as an indicator of the threshold for PBH formation, and present the threshold values derived from analytical approaches. Section 4 presents the numerical simulation setup and the results obtained. Finally, Section 5 is devoted to summary. Throughout this paper, we use the geometrized units in which both the speed of light and Newton’s gravitational constant are set to unity, c=G=1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07580v1,Power spectrum of scalar fluctuations of the metric during the formation of a scalar black hole in inflation,"In this paper we use the collapse metric obtained by Carneiro and Fabris to calculate the power spectrum associated to gauge invariant fluctuations of the metric during the formation of a primordial scalar black hole at the end of inflation. We assume that local perturbations in the vacuum energy density can collapse by means of the collapse of the local inflaton field, generating a singularity as shown by Carneiro and Fabris. Employing a representative term of the series expansion of the scale factor we obtain a nearly scale invariant power spectrum for a second order approximation of the scale factor. Thus, the spectrum for scalar black holes obtained can be considered as a correction of the power spectrum of the primordial quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field.","I INTRODUCTION Due to their spectrum of masses black holes are nowadays considered as good candidates for dark matter. Some are originated due to gravitatational collapse of stars. However, there are others, called primordial black holes (PBHs), that are believed to have been formed in the early universe RI1 ; RI2 . The two possible mass ranges for PBHs to significantly contribute to dark matter are: the asteriod mass region between 10^{-16}\,M_{\odot}, and 10^{-11}\,M_{\odot}, and the solar-mass region that is only slightly constrained by microlensing surveys RI3 . Many models concerning about the origin of PBHs are baesd on first and second order transitions RI4 ; RI5 . However, we can find in the literature several other proposals like for example the collapse of density perturbations generated during the inflationary period RI6 ; RI7 , the dynamics of scalar condensantes RI8 , and during the collapse of topological defects RI9 , among others. On the other hand, Carneiro and Fabris have shown that the gravitational collapse of a minimally coupled scalar field collapses to a singularity when the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar field is separated into a pressureless matter and a vacuum parts Carneiro . Hence, if we consider this mechanism at the end of inflation we can interpret that local fluctuations in the vacuum energy density can collapse to form a type PBHs called scalar black holes. In this paper we use the collapse metric obtained by Carneiro and Fabris to calculate the power spectrum generated during the collapse of a local perturbation in the vacuum energy density at the end of inflation. With this in mind the paper was organized as follows. In section I we give a brief introduction. In section II we explain the formalism for non-perturbative gauge invariant fluctuations of the metric during the collapse. In section III we treat the case of scalar fluctuations of small amplitude as a weak field limit. In section IV we calculate the power spectrum to the gauge invariant fluctuations of the metric generated during the formation of a scalar black hole. Finally section V is left for some final comments."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07568v1,"Quasinormal modes of Plebański–Demiański 
black hole in the near-Nariai regime","We investigates the massless scalar perturbations of the Plebański–Demiański black hole considering the general case that admits all nonzero parameters. This case is the most generic black hole spacetime in general relativity, characterized by mass, spin, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges, NUT parameter, and cosmological constant. Employing conformal transformations, we can separate the massless scalar field equation and reduce the effective potential in the radial perturbation equation into the Pöschl–Teller potential in the near-Nariai limit where the event and cosmo-acceleration horizons are close. This allows us to obtain an exact analytical solution of the quasinormal frequency, implying that the decay rate of the field is quantized depending only on the surface gravity of the black hole.","Black holes have a strong gravitational field and absorb any matter that falls onto them. An event horizon corresponding to the surface of the black hole is a one-way membrane because the matter that has passed through it cannot escape and moves towards the singularity at the center. The structure of a black hole is uniquely determined by its conserved quantities: mass, charge, and angular momentum. A rotating black hole with a nonzero angular momentum forms an ergosphere outside the event horizon. Previous studies have shown that energy can be extracted through the ergosphere [1]. However, only part of the energy can be extracted because the black hole has an irreducible mass that does not decrease in any process. The irreducible mass is proportional to the square root of the surface area of the black hole and always increases during the irreversible process [2, 3]. This is reminiscent of the second law of classical thermodynamics. Bekenstein defined the entropy of a black hole by relating it to its surface area, describing the black hole system from a thermodynamic perspective [4]. Furthermore, an analogy between the temperature and the surface gravity of the black hole was suggested. Hawking explained that quantum effects near the event horizon produce pairs of virtual particles, causing the black hole to emit a thermal flux similar to an ordinary body with a temperature proportional to its surface gravity [5]. From these novel discoveries, black hole thermodynamics was established, providing a connection between the classical and quantum properties of black holes. Studying the propagation and scattering of waves enables us to obtain useful characteristics of the black hole spacetime. This can be achieved at a linearized level by considering the propagating field on a fixed black hole background. In particular, when a gravitational wave packet perturbs a Schwarzschild black hole, the signal is dominated by a damped oscillation mode of a single frequency at intermediate times [6]. The oscillation with an exponential decay is the quasinormal mode [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], and its associated frequency depends only on the characteristic parameters of the black hole. Furthermore, if the incident wave satisfies certain conditions, then the scattered wave can be amplified. This phenomenon is known as superradiance and causes black hole instability [12, 13, 14, 15]. The radiation amplification process in a classical dissipative system was discussed in [16, 17], and superradiant scattering for rotating black holes was considered in [12, 18]. Moreover, assuming confinement, such as the reflecting mirror in the system, the wave has been shown to be exponentially amplified, leading to a black hole bomb. The superradiant instability has been analyzed for astrophysical applications, such as the search for dark matter candidates [19, 20] and hairy black hole solutions [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Research on the quasinormal mode of black holes has developed in various directions, highlighting their physical significance. The main source of current gravitational wave detection is the collision of binary black holes. The ringdown phase, in which the merged black hole settles, is described by the quasinormal mode, and because its frequency is decided solely from the parameters of the final black hole, the identification of the key information of the system is crucial [26, 27, 28]. Furthermore, the quasinormal frequency contributes to validating the strong cosmic censorship conjecture, which suggests that the singularities of black holes are hidden from all observers and may be related to the determination of the blue-shift instability of the Cauchy horizon [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. Additionally, the anti-de Sitter (AdS)/conformal field theory (CFT) duality [42, 43, 44] states that the perturbations of a black hole in AdS spacetime, which is characterized by a negative cosmological constant, correspond to the perturbations of a thermal state in the CFT on the AdS boundary. Thus, the timescale for the state in lower-dimensional CFT to reach thermal equilibrium can be predicted by computing the quasinormal modes of the black hole [45, 46]. The quasinormal modes are analyzed by solving perturbations of various test fields, which can be reduced to ordinary differential equations through separation [47]. Because obtaining a solution is typically complicated, various numerical methods have been employed. Interestingly, an analytically exact solution for certain special spacetimes can be obtained. A black hole in de Sitter (dS) spacetime, which is the spacetime of the positive cosmological constant, has a cosmological horizon outside its event horizon. For the near-Nariai black hole where these two horizons are close, the potential in the wave equation is reduced to the Pöschl–Teller potential [48, 49], yielding the general form of the solution. Moreover, the quasinormal frequency analytically obtained by the Pöschl–Teller approximation agreed well with that computed using numerical methods [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55]. Most objects in the universe rotate. During the coalescence of rotating binary black holes, gravitational waves can be emitted in a specific direction. Then, the final black hole obtains recoil velocity and acceleration [56, 57]. The source of the acceleration of the black hole is also explained by the tensions of the cosmic strings [58], the topological defect formed during the phase transitions in the early universe. Therefore, accelerating black hole spacetime may be suitable for describing more general and natural gravitational phenomena. The most generic exact solution of the Einstein–Maxwell equation with a cosmological constant representing the accelerating black hole is the Plebański–Demiański solution. The original form of this metric was proposed in [59] and further improved in [60, 61, 62, 63] with physical interpretations of the parameters and a discussion of various features. The Plebański–Demiański metric is characterized by mass, spin, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges, NUT parameter, and cosmological constant. This metric encompasses well-known solutions, such as the Kerr–Newman metric, C-metric, and Taub–NUT metric, as its special subcases. For a deeper understanding of the physics in strong gravitational fields, the properties of this extended black hole spacetime must be scrutinized in various aspects. Consequently, the perturbations and quasinormal modes of the Plebański–Demiański family have been analyzed in recent years [64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71]. In this study, we investigate the quasinormal modes of an accelerating and spinning charged NUT black hole in asymptotically dS spacetime. We employ the Plebański–Demiański metric where all parameters are nonzero. The analysis of perturbations on this general black hole remains open. We consider a massless scalar field conformally coupled to the gravitational field and use the conformal transformations, which enable us to easily separate the field equation. The presence of both acceleration and positive cosmological constant results in a cosmo-acceleration horizon outside the event horizon. We focus on the near-Nariai case for which the event horizon and the cosmo-acceleration horizon are closely located. Moreover, we demonstrate that in such spacetime the radial perturbation equation can be reduced to an effective equation with the Pöschl–Teller potential. Subsequently, the solution of the quasinormal frequency is analytically obtained. We find that the decay rate of the scalar perturbation on the near-Nariai Plebański–Demiański black hole is quantized for the overtone index n, depending on the surface gravity. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec 2, we briefly review the Plebański–Demiański black hole. In Sec 3, we consider a massless scalar perturbation with conformal coupling. The boundary conditions defining the quasinormal mode are presented. In Sec 4, we analytically derive the quasinormal frequencies for the near-Nariai black hole. Finally, Sec 5 summarizes the study. In this study, geometrized units, where c=G=1, were employed."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07481v1,Imprints of black hole charge on the precessing jet nozzle of M87*,"The observed jet precession period of approximately 11 years for M87* strongly suggests the presence of a supermassive rotating black hole with a tilted accretion disk at the center of the galaxy. By modeling the motion of the tilted accretion disk particle with the spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole, we study the effect of charge on the observation of the precession period, thereby exploring the potential of this strong-gravity observation in constraining multiple black hole parameters. Firstly, we study the spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole and find that their precession periods increase with the charge. Secondly, we utilize the observed M87* jet precession period to constrain the relationship between the spin, charge, and warp radius, specifically detailing the correlations between each pair of these three quantities. Moreover, to further refine constraints on the charge, we explore the negative correlation between the maximum warp radius and charge. A significant result shows that the gap between the maximum warp radii of the prograde and retrograde orbits decrease with the black hole charge. If the warp radius is provided by other observations, different constraints on the charge can be derived for the prograde and retrograde cases. These results suggest that in the era of multi-messenger astronomy, such strong-gravity observation of precessing jet nozzle presents a promising avenue for constraining black hole parameters.","As a prediction of general relativity (GR), the existence of black holes has been supported by the observation of LIGO LIGO . It is widely believed that there exists supermassive black hole in the center of each galaxy. Excitingly, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration released the first-ever image of the black hole at the center of the M87* Akiyama1 , strongly suggesting the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of M87 and providing a pathway for strong field tests of gravity. Subsequently, the EHT collaboration published the image of SgrA* at the center of our Milky Way Akiyama2 , further advancing the progression of the observation and theory. However, due to limitations in image resolution, there remains significant room for further studies. One of the most striking features of M87* is the bright jet of energy and matter emanating from its core. Previous studies of the inner region of M87* indicated that the jet near the black hole exhibits a large opening angle WJunor ; KHada ; RCWalker ; RLu . Recently, Cui et al. Cui reported an analysis of 22 years of radio observations, showing that the jet’s position angle varies periodically. They hypothesized that this is due to a misaligned accretion disk around a rotating black hole, leading to Lense-Thirring precession. Through their analysis, they derived a half-opening angle of the precession cone of 1.25^{\circ}\pm 0.18^{\circ} and a corresponding period of 11.24\pm 0.47 years, with a precession angular velocity of 0.56\pm 0.02 radians per year. This observation strongly indicates that the central black hole in M87* has a tilted accretion disk deviating from the equatorial plane. Subsequently, they examined the imprints of M87’s jet precession on the black hole-accretion disk system, including the disk’s size and the jet’s non-collinear structure Cui2 . For a tilted accretion disk, the disk plane varies with radius. Within the innermost stable orbit (ISCO), matter particles will rapidly fall into the black hole, and thus it can generally regarded that the accretion disk starts at this orbit radius and then extends towards the distance. The inner disk typically undergoes Bardeen-Petterson alignment BardeenPetterson , which means it usually aligns with the equatorial plane. The outer edge of the inner disk is defined by a characteristic radius known as the warp radius. Beyond the warp radius, the tilt angle of the disk relative to the equatorial plane gradually increases. The tilted accretion disk is found in a wide variety of systems, e.g., protostars, X-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) Papaloizou ; Herrnstein ; Begelman ; Wijers ; Chiang ; Martin ; Lodato ; Casassus . Modeling such complex accretion disks is difficult if one considers its internal dynamical mechanisms. However, if the characteristics of the tilted disk are grasped, one can simulate the motion of the accretion disk with simple and manageable model. For example, the quasi-periodic oscillations observed in certain astrophysical black hole systems can be explored by studying the precession of spherical orbits Zahrani . Another interesting application was first proposed in Ref. Wei that the observed jet precession period can be used to constrain the black hole parameters. In the study, the warp radius and black hole spin parameter are constrained based on the following three assumptions. First, the motion of the disk particles at each radial distance can be accurately described by spherical orbit with a constant radius, deviating from the equatorial plane Wilkins ; Goldstein ; Dymnikova ; Shakura ; ETeo ; PRana ; Kopek . Second, the jet is assumed to originate near the warp radius and be oriented perpendicular to the accretion disk. Finally, the precession axis is considered as the axis of the black hole spin. The black holes of general relativity can be completely specified by only three parameters: their mass M, spin angular momentum J, and the electric charge Q according to the “no-hair theorem” Israel1 ; Israel2 ; Carter2 ; Hawking ; Gravitation ; Robinson . The effects caused by the charge are minimal, making it difficult to constrain the charge through observations in weak gravitational fields Sereno ; Ebina . The EHT collaboration, using observations of black hole shadows in strong gravitational fields, constrained multiple parameters, including the charge, but only ruled out certain regions corresponding to specific physical charges Kocherlakota . The precession of M87*’s jet presents another strong gravitational observation following black hole shadow, and we expect to use this observation to constrain multiple parameters. Although very recent study have explored a rotating black hole immersed in a Melvin magnetic field CChen , a simpler and equally meaningful case is the Kerr-Newman black hole. One might argue that the charge of a charged black hole would quickly neutralize in the surrounding plasma, but here we do not consider the neutralization process or the electromagnetic interaction with the astrophysical environment. This assumption is consistent with that made in Refs. Kocherlakota ; Tsukamoto . Our goal is to explore the potential of using black hole jet precession to constrain multiple parameters, with a particular focus on constraining parameters other than the spin, specifically the charge Q in the Kerr-Newman scenario. Besides, some accretion scenario also involve the study of charged rotating black holes Wilson ; Damour ; Ruffini . Thus, here we consider the charged rotating black holes described by the Kerr-Newman solution at the center of M87* Newman . Building on the assumptions proposed in Ref. Wei , we model the tilted accretion disk using spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole and constrain the black hole parameters through the observed jet precession period. First, we calculate the energy and angular momentum of spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole, as well as the radii of the innermost stable spherical orbit (ISSO) and the last spherical orbit (LSO), and focus on the impact of the charge on these quantities. Next, we numerically solve the equations of motion in the \theta and \phi directions to obtain the precession angular velocity of the spherical orbits and investigate its dependence on the black hole parameters. Finally, based on these calculations, we derive the precession period and use the spherical orbits of the Kerr-Newman black hole to model the accretion disk of M87*, constraining the relationships between the spin, charge, and warp radius with the observed jet precession period. We also established a relationship between the maximum warp radius and the charge. Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we carry out a detailed study of spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole, including its special subclasses ISSO and LSO. In Sec. III, we further analyze the precession of spherical orbits. Then we provide some constraints on the black hole parameters using the observed jet precession period in Sec. IV. Finally, we discuss and conclude our results in Sec. V. Here we adopt the metric convention (-,+,+,+) and use geometrical units with G=c=1 in addition to recovering dimensionality in Sec. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07284v1,Full 3D nonlinear dynamics of charged and magnetized boson stars,"Gauged boson stars are exotic compact objects that can potentially mimic black holes or magnetized neutron stars in both their gravitational and electromagnetic signatures, offering a compelling new description or even an alternative explanation for various multimessenger phenomena. As a crucial step toward establishing boson stars as viable multimessenger sources, we perform 3D numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system, focusing on both spherical and axisymmetric boson star configurations that vary in their electromagnetic coupling between the neutral case up to values close to the critical case, and so their magnetic field content. For spherical configurations, we consistently find stable solutions. In contrast, for axially symmetric, electrically neutral, magnetized configurations, the dynamics are highly sensitive to the electromagnetic coupling. Configurations with stronger coupling develop a one-armed mode instability, which leads to collapse into black holes. Configurations with weaker coupling undergo a two-stage process: an initial bar-mode instability that triggers a one-armed spiral deformation. This eventually also results in black hole formation, accompanied by emissions of both gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. A similar instability and two-stage pattern is observed in all charged rotating boson stars analyzed. However, all of these configurations become stable when self-interactions are introduced.","We are in an unprecedented era of astrophysics, where an influx of new observations from gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals to neutrino detections Janka (2012); Aartsen et al. (2013); Abbott et al. (2017); Kocevski et al. (2017), is reshaping our understanding of the Universe. Gravitational wave astronomy began in 2015 with the groundbreaking detection of gravitational waves from the merger of a binary black hole system, event GW150914 Abbott et al. (2016). Two years later, the simultaneous detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star inspiral, event GW170817, along with its post-merger electromagnetic counterpart, marked the dawn of multimessenger astronomy Abbott et al. (2017); Cowperthwaite et al. (2017). Numerical simulations play an essential role in multimessenger astronomy, as they generate the waveforms needed to interpret signals detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration, and anticipate those from upcoming detectors like the Einstein Telescope and LISA Afshordi et al. (2023); Hild et al. (2011). Besides, these simulations also predict electromagnetic counterparts, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and electromagnetic luminosity Paschalidis et al. (2015); Ruiz et al. (2016); Kiuchi et al. (2024); Liebling and Palenzuela (2016), while modeling the fraction of ejected mass responsible for kilonova events Just et al. (2023); Metzger and Fernández (2014); Curtis et al. (2022), which can be observed through X-ray instruments like CHANDRA and XMM-Newton (see e.g. Haggard et al. (2017); D’Avanzo et al. (2018)). However, despite the advances made through multimessenger observations combined with numerical simulations, there are still open questions regarding the nature of the progenitors of some events, such as GW190814 Abbott et al. (2020). This event involved the merger of a black hole with an object in the so-called mass gap Barr et al. (2024); van Son et al. (2020), of around 2.6M_{\odot}, too massive to be a typical neutron star but too light to be classified as a black hole. Additionally, it has been shown that GW190521 is consistent not only with the merger of a black hole binary but also with the collision of vector boson (Proca) stars Calderón Bustillo et al. (2021); Calderon Bustillo et al. (2023), pointing to a degeneracy of the possible sources. These findings suggest the potential involvement of exotic neutron stars or other unknown compact objects. The detection of unusual black hole masses and possible intermediate-mass black holes further emphasizes significant gaps in our understanding of gravitational source in the Universe, emphasizing that gravitational wave astronomy continues to raise important, unresolved questions in astrophysics and general relativity. Exotic compact objects (ECOs), that include quark stars, and strange stars (stars containing strange quarks), have also been proposed as alternative explanations for several “unexplained” electromagnetic phenomena, including fast radio bursts (FRBs) Dai and Lu (1998); Bombaci and Datta (2000); Zhang et al. (2024a). For instance, magnetized exotic compact objects may undergo oscillations or instabilities that trigger violent energy releases, which could manifest as FRBs. When interacting or merging with other compact objects, the strong coupling between scalar and electromagnetic fields might cause bursts of radiation, explaining the millisecond-duration nature of FRBs. Moreover, the intense magnetic fields associated with gauged boson stars could lead to magnetospheric reconnections, similar to mechanisms proposed for neutron stars Cheong et al. (2024), further supporting their role as potential FRB sources. Beyond FRBs, exotic compact objects could also provide explanations for other astrophysical anomalies, such as superluminous supernovae and GRBs. Some theories suggest that exotic stars could form in extreme astrophysical events, such as neutron star mergers or collapses, releasing enormous amounts of electromagnetic energy that are detectable across various wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum Ruiz and Shapiro (2017); Ponce et al. (2014). Furthermore, advances in theoretical modeling and computational techniques have provided new ways to explore the existence of alternative compact objects (see e.g. Bezares and Sanchis-Gual (2024) for a recently review). The study of self-gravitating objects composed of scalar fields has proven especially fruitful. The relative simplicity of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system allows for the exploration of novel geometries, which can be used to explain several astrophysical observations. This approach not only challenges the traditional black hole paradigm but could also help to solve some of the puzzles mentioned above. In the case of a complex scalar field, these self-gravitating and horizonless objects are known as boson stars (for reviews, see Shnir (2023); Liebling and Palenzuela (2023)). When minimally coupled to gravity, the dynamical properties of these solutions are primarily determined by the choice of scalar field potential and whether angular momentum or non-spherical morphologies are introduced. The stability of these families of solutions has been a central focus of discussion for some time Gleiser (1988); Lee and Pang (1989); Seidel and Suen (1990); Balakrishna et al. (1998); Sanchis-Gual et al. (2019, 2021); Siemonsen and East (2021); Alcubierre et al. (2021); Jaramillo et al. (2020); Ildefonso et al. (2023). However, the stability of solutions when the scalar field interacts with a Maxwell field has been less thoroughly studied. The interplay between scalar and electromagnetic interactions in the \mathrm{U}(1)-gauged model of complex scalar fields with minimal electromagnetic coupling opens up the possibility of constructing explicit, self-consistent charged and magnetized spacetimes Jetzer and van der Bij (1989); Delgado et al. (2016); Herdeiro and Radu (2020); Jaramillo et al. (2024); Jaramillo and Núñez (2022); Kunz and Shnir (2023), leading to a rich array of phenomena Sanchis-Gual et al. (2016); Zhang et al. (2024b); Sanchis-Gual et al. (2022). In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of gauged scalar field self-gravitating solitons, commonly known as charged boson stars. We begin with the spherical case, which has previously been considered stable Jetzer and van der Bij (1989); Jetzer (1989). Through numerical evolution, we confirm that stability persists in a manner similar to that of free-field neutral boson stars Kaup (1968); Ruffini and Bonazzola (1969); Gleiser (1988); Lee and Pang (1989); Seidel and Suen (1990), where an entire branch of solutions is present. We then examine the axisymmetric (spinning) case, where the motion of the system generates both electric and magnetic components. While uncharged objects were known to be unstable, our results show that the presence of an electric charge intensifies this instability and plays a role on how the star collapses to a black hole. Next, we introduce a specific configuration in which scalar fields, that interact only through gravity, are superimposed to form a static object with a toroidal morphology Jaramillo and Núñez (2022). This object carries no net charge and, consequently, does not generate an electric field, but it does produce a poloidal magnetic field. This model serves as a simple analog to objects observed in nature, electrically neutral yet exhibiting a magnetic field. However, this configuration is also unstable. Instabilities emerge more rapidly as the individual electric charge of each torus increases. Motivated by the stability properties of the above configurations, we probe the case where a self-interaction term is included in the scalar potential. Previous studies have shown that rotating boson stars with self-interaction are numerically stable Siemonsen and East (2021); Di Giovanni et al. (2020). As expected we find that a rotating, uncharged scalar torus with both squared and quartic terms in the scalar potential remains stable over long evolution times. In particular, our configuration remains stable for 10^{4} times the characteristic oscillation time of the scalar field. Following this, we investigate the impact of the electromagnetic field on stability by gauging the scalar field for various charge values. We then explore the non-spinning magnetic and electrically neutral star described above. This configuration also proves stable across several values of the charge. In cases where the system becomes unstable and undergoes gravitational collapse into a black hole, we observe emissions of gravitational, electromagnetic, and scalar radiation. Therefore, we a provide comprehensive analysis of scenarios involving both scalar and electromagnetic fields, offering insights into their stability and collapse dynamics. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we briefly review the theory of gauged scalar field coupled to gravity and discuss the families of stationary asymptotically flat configurations that can be constructed within this physical model. In addition we describe some of the diagnostics we monitor to verify the reliability of our numerical simulations and outline our numerical methods. In Sec. III we probe the stability properties of both spherical and axisymmetric charged boson star configurations. In Sec. IV, we address the stability of electrically neutral magnetized boson stars, while in IV.1 we describe the evolution of self-interacting axisymmetric stars. Finally, we summarize our results and conclude in Sec. V. Throughout the paper we adopt units in which the speed of light c, gravitational constant G, and the vacuum permeability \mu_{0} are equal to one."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08001v1,(Quasi-)normal modes of rotating black holes and new solitons in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet,"In this paper, we analyze the scalar field (quasi-)normal modes of recently derived rotating black holes within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory at the Chern-Simons point in five dimensions. We also examine the mode spectrum of these probes on new static gravitational solitons. These solitons, featuring a regular center, are constructed from static black holes with gravitational hair via a double analytic continuation. By imposing ingoing boundary conditions at the horizons of rotating black holes, ensuring regularity at the soliton centers, and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions at infinity, we obtain numerical spectra for the rotating black holes and solitons. For static black holes, we demonstrate analytically that the imaginary part of the mode frequencies is negative. Our analysis of the massless Klein-Gordon equation on five-dimensional geometries reveals an infinite family of gapped, massive three-dimensional Klein-Gordon fields, despite the presence of a non-compact extended direction. For the static solitons, the frequencies are real and non-equispaced, whereas in the rotating black holes, counter-rotating modes are absorbed more quickly, and the imaginary part of the co-rotating modes approaches zero as extremality is approached. Additionally, we show that both the rotating black holes and solitons can be equipped with non-trivial torsion, leading to a novel branch of solutions.","Recently, a new exact, rotating solution of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory was constructed in dimension five us (see Anabalon:2009kq ; Cvetic:2016sow for other exact rotating solutions at in Lovelock theories at the Chern-Simons point). The solution exists at the Chern-Simons point of the theory, with an action principle given by I\left[g_{AB}\right]=\int d^{5}x\sqrt{-g}\left(R-2\Lambda+\alpha\left(R^{2}-4R% _{AB}R^{AB}+R_{ABCD}R^{ABCD}\right)\right)\ , (1) where \Lambda=-\frac{3}{l^{2}}\text{ and }\alpha=\frac{l^{2}}{4}\ . (2) with field equations \displaystyle 0 \displaystyle=G_{AB}+\Lambda g_{AB}+\alpha\left[2RR_{AB}-4R_{ACBD}R^{CD}+2R_{% ACDE}R_{B}^{\ \ CDE}\right. \displaystyle\left.-4R_{AC}R_{B}^{\ C}-\frac{1}{2}g_{AB}\left(R^{2}-4R_{AB}R^{% AB}+R_{ABCD}R^{ABCD}\right)\right]\ . (3) (See Garraffo:2008hu and libroCS and references therein). The five-dimensional geometry, is constructed from a three-dimensional rotating, Kerr-Schild seed with Ricci scalar equal to -6, oxidated to dimension five by suitable warp factors us . The three-dimensional geometry is asymptotically AdS5, and it is characterized by three parameters M, j and b, that receive the interpretation of a mass and angular momentum parameters, and a hair of gravitational origin, respectively. The warp factors that allow embedding this geometry as a solution of the five-dimensional theory, contain a further integration constant, \rho_{0}, that stands for a second gravitational hair. The metric is integrated assuming a three-dimensional Kerr-Schild anzatz with a single metric function, oxidated to dimension five. After performing the change to Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, the rotating solution reduces to ds_{BH_{I}}^{2}=l^{2}\cosh^{2}\left(\rho\right)\left[-N^{2}dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}% }{N^{2}}+r^{2}\left(d\phi-\frac{j}{2r^{2}}dt\right)^{2}\right]+l^{2}d\rho^{2}+% l^{2}\cosh^{2}\left(\rho-\rho_{0}\right)dx^{2}\ , (4) where N^{2}=r^{2}-M-\frac{b}{r}+\frac{j^{2}}{4r^{2}}\text{ }\ . (5) Here, l is the AdS5 radius of the maximally symmetric solution of the five-dimensional theory, and the ranges of the coordinates are given by -\infty<t<\infty, r_{+}<r<+\infty, 0\leq\phi<2\pi, -\infty<\rho<\infty and -L\leq x\leq L. The coordinate x can be suitably identified with arbitrary period, or could be considered as well as a non-compact direction. The event horizon is located at r=r_{+}, with r_{+}, being the largest root of the lapse function N^{2}\left(r_{+}\right)=0 in (5). The existence of an event horizon was thoroughly investigated in us , and here we will assume that the integration constants are such that the event horizon indeed exists. For simplicity, hereafter we set the second gravitational hair parameter \rho_{0} to zero. Quasinormal modes of black hole geometries play a fundamental role in our understanding of black hole dynamics. On the one hand, the quasinormal modes dominate the late time, ringdown of black holes that are formed via merger of compact objects (see e.g. Kokkotas:1999bd , Berti:2009kk ). Also, in the context of holography, quasinomal modes of the bulk, asymptotically AdS black hole geometries, capture the relaxation time of thermal perturbations in the boundary theory Horowitz:1999jd , Birmingham:2001pj , and can be used as well to obtain transport properties of the dual plasma via the computation of the viscosity of the dual system Kovtun:2005ev . Given the importance of the physics of quasinormal modes as probe fields on black hole spacetimes, in this paper we study the quasinormal spectrum of the new, exact, rotating black hole geometry given by the metric (4). Even more, we introduce three new spacetimes that solve the equations of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with a unique vacuum (3), namely a new rotating black hole, and two static solitons and we explore the propagation of massless scalar probes on these spacetimes. The paper is organized as follow: Section II contains the characterization of the geometries of the rotating black hole solutions and solitons as well as an asymptotic behavior that accomodates these solutions, and that is preserved by two copies of the generators of the Witt, namely the two dimensional conformal algebra. Section III deals with the problem of normal modes of scalar probes on the solitons, and quasinormal modes for those probes on the rotating black holes. In Section IV we show how to dress our new solutions with non-vanishing, gravitating torsion, which in the context of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity it is consistent due to the presence of quadratic terms in the curvature. We provide conclusions and further comments in Section V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07995v1,"Large Field Polynomial Inflation in Palatini f(R,\phi) Gravity","In this paper, we employ the Palatini formalism to investigate the dynamics of large-field inflation using a renormalizable polynomial inflaton potential in the context of f(R,\phi) gravity. Assuming instant reheating, we make a comparative analysis of large-field polynomial inflation (PI). We first consider the minimal and non-minimal coupling of inflaton in R gravity, and then we continue with the minimally and non-minimally coupled inflaton in f(R,\phi) gravity. We scan the parameter space for the inflationary predictions (n_{s} and r) consistent with the Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 results as well as the sensitivity forecast of the future CMB-S4 and depict the compliant regions in the \phi_{0}-\beta plane where \phi_{0} and \beta are two parameters of polynomial inflation model which control the saddle point of the potential and the flatness in the vicinity of this point respectively. We find that a substantial portion of the parameter space aligns with the observational data.","Cosmic inflation posits that the universe underwent an extremely rapid exponential expansion in its very early stages, right after the Big Bang, during the first tiny fraction of a second [1, 2, 3, 4]. This period of inflation helps explain the uniformity of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation and the universe’s large-scale structure [5, 6, 7]. There is a significant body of literature on inflationary cosmology [8, 9]. Amongst the plethora of inflationary models, the single-field models are the simplest ones, where a single scalar field slowly rolls down a sufficiently flat potential profile [10]. Those profiles are generically monomials of the inflaton with a power of two or four, so they are bounded from below and renormalizable. The problem with these monomial potentials is they are sufficiently flat only at fairly large field values. This results in the overproduction of tensor modes and consequently in a large tensor-to-scalar ratio r which measures the strength of the tensor perturbations (gravitational waves) relative to the scalar perturbations (density fluctuations). Thus, those models are ruled out after the release of Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 results [11, 12]. The next simplest model involves a single real scalar field again. However, it has a renormalizable potential: a fourth-degree polynomial instead of a monomial. This model is dubbed the polynomial inflation (PI) [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. It is similar to the inflection point inflation scenario [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. In standard inflection point inflation, the inflaton potential has an inflection point, a point where the second derivative of the potential changes sign, but the first derivative remains small, and near this point, the potential can be approximated by a cubic function. Similarly, in PI, the polynomial potential has a saddle point, where both the first and second derivatives of the potential vanish. In practice, the location of this (would-be) saddle point is used as a free parameter, and a second free parameter controls the slope of the potential profile to modulate the flatness of the inflaton excursion zone. PI has been the subject of many analyses since the ’90s because it is possible to encounter this type of potential in both minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) and string theory [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. PI can bear fruit in string theory in the sense that, in the limit where inflation occurs at field values that are very far away from the saddle point the potential approximates a purely quartic one. This in turn leads to eternal inflation which helps justify the weak anthropic principle and relax the initial conditions problem of inflation itself [36, 37, 38]. PI has been analyzed for both small [39] and large field values [40, 41] considering the latest measurements and utilizing the metric formalism. Unlike the analyses conducted in these papers, we work out polynomial inflation in Palatini formalism in different cosmological settings like minimal and non-minimal inflaton coupling to standard metric-Palatini R gravity and metric-Palatini f(R,\phi) gravity. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the difference between metric and Palatini formulation of f(R,\phi) concerning inflation. Section 3 discusses the fundamentals of polynomial inflation in four different cosmological settings: minimal and non-minimal coupling of inflaton in standard metric-Palatini R gravity (standard Einstein theory of gravity) or f(R,\phi) metric-Palatini gravity. Section 4 analyzes the inflationary dynamics and compares the model’s predictions with observational data. Section 5 concludes with a summary and discussion of the implications and potential future research directions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07961v1,Quantum Mechanics from General Relativity and the Quantum Friedmann Equation,"In this work, we demonstrate that the recently introduced linear form of the Friedmann equations corresponds to the first-order WKB expansion of a quantum cosmological equation, indicating that both General Relativity (GR) contains aspects of Quantum Mechanics (QM) and that GR itself is part of a more general theory. Solutions of this quantum Friedmann equation are built in terms of a quantum scale factor that encapsulates the quantum effects on a free-falling particle. The quantum-modified scale factor reshapes the dynamics of the universe, removing the singularity due to the vanishing of the scale factor. A detailed example within the radiation-dominated context illustrates how these quantum solutions connect to Seiberg-Witten theory, recently applied to black holes, and incorporate resurgence phenomena and complex metrics as developed by Kontsevich, Segal, and Witten. As a result, this reveals an invariance of time parametrization under \Gamma(2) transformations of the wave function.","It is widely recognized that the domains of the physical world governed by gravity and those governed by quantum processes are challenging to reconcile [1, 2]. General Relativity (GR) is a highly non-linear theory whereas Quantum Mechanics (QM) is fundamentally based on linear equations, with the superposition principle playing a crucial role in describing quantum phenomena. Nonetheless, there are compelling arguments suggesting a deep connection between GR and QM. A fascinating example arises in the loop expansion of the effective action in Quantum Field Theory (QFT). This expansion, formulated as a power series in the Planck constant, treats the ratio of masses to \hbar as in independent of \hbar. For instance, in the case of the effective action for a scalar field with mass m and scale \mu the loop expansion takes the form \Gamma[\varphi;\nu_{m},\nu_{\mu}]=\sum_{k\geq 0}\hbar^{k}\Gamma_{k}[\varphi;% \nu_{m},\nu_{\mu}]\ , (1) where \nu_{m}:=\frac{m}{\hbar}, \nu_{\mu}:=\frac{\mu}{\hbar} are \hbar independent (see sect. 8.3 of [3]). This holds true for any mass term in QFT. As highlighted by Itzykson and Zuber, even at the level of the Klein-Gordon equation, one should consider [\partial_{x}^{2}+(mc/\hbar)^{2}]\varphi=0\ , (2) (see pg. 288 of [4]). Thus, dimensional analysis reveals that even at the classical level, a constant with the dimension of action is necessary, indicating that mass has a quantum origin. Given that mass also serves as the gravitational charge, this provides evidence that QM and GR share a common foundation. Here, we focus on intriguing similarities that emerge at the cosmological level. The reduction of GR to a system with finite degrees of freedom, achieved by considering cosmological configurations, enables a direct comparison with QM. This approach has given rise to the field of quantum cosmology, with numerous methodologies explored in the literature [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. A quantum framework for gravity is also expected to shed light on various unresolved issues in modern cosmology [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] and potentially address the initial singularity problem [21]. As shown in [22], for non-flat spatial scalar curvature, there is a unique possible linear form derivable from the Friedmann equations. In this construction, conformal time plays a central role, analogous to the Hamiltonian characteristic function. The initial key insight of our investigation is that, as a result of redshift, the solutions to this equation mirror the structure of the first-order WKB expansion. From this observation, we reconstruct the exact equation that, in the WKB approximation, reduces to the linear form introduced in [22], thereby obtaining the wave function for free-falling particles. The complete quantum effects are encoded within the geometry, specifically in the quantum version of the scale factor. This resolves the classical singularity encountered when the scale factor vanishes. We examine the radiation-dominated context, where these quantum solutions intriguingly connect to Seiberg-Witten theory, introducing a \Gamma(2) invariance of the complexified time t(\tilde{\Psi})=t(\Psi)\ , (3) suggesting a periodicity related to uniformization theory. This indicates that certain structures in Seiberg-Witten theory, such as instanton contributions and monopole condensations, have cosmological counterparts. These findings are also linked to resurgence theory and complex metrics as developed by Kontsevich, Segal, and Witten."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07939v1,One-loop N-point correlators in pure gravity,"In this work we propose a simple algebraic recursion for the complete one-loop integrands of N-graviton correlators. This formula automatically yields the correct symmetry factors of individual diagrams, taking into account both the graviton and the ghost loop, and seamlessly controlling the related combinatorics.","Achieving a satisfactory quantum description of gravity has long been a major aspiration in theoretical physics. As a quantum field theory, earlier research has introduced seminal works (e.g. Feynman:1996kb ; Weinberg:1964kqu ; Weinberg:1964ew ; Weinberg:1965rz ; Weinberg:1965nx ; DeWitt:1967yk ; DeWitt:1967ub ; DeWitt:1967uc ), but we were soon confronted with an inconvenient observation: gravity is not renormalizable tHooft:1974toh . From an effective field theory (EFT) perspective, this is not an obstacle but rather a source of valuable lessons using perturbation theory (see Donoghue:2022eay and references therein). In ordinary gauge theories, perturbative computations using a traditional diagrammatic approach are incumbered by gauge redundancies. This is even more pronounced in gravity, which in addition contains an infinite number of field theory vertices and non-trivial field redefinitions (e.g. Ananth:2007zy ; Knorr:2023usb ). While these redundancies appear to be unavoidable in a Lagrangian formulation, modern scattering amplitudes techniques have long abandoned them. The so-called on-shell methods (see e.g. Travaglini:2022uwo ; Brandhuber:2022qbk ; Bern:2022wqg ) have revolutionized the area, enabling the systematic computation of S-matrices based on just a few ingredients (particle content, global symmetries, factorization, unitarity). A paradigmatic example is the double copy Bern:2008qj ; Bern:2010ue . Beyond on-shell results, there is increased interest on graviton correlators in different contexts: renormalization group analysis, form factors, curved backgrounds (including AdS/CFT), and gravitational EFTs, to name a few. Since the role of gravitons is firmly established in modern theoretical physics, going off the mass-shell is an important step. This is especially relevant in the exciting new era of gravitational waves and black hole observations. An off-shell formulation would naturally lead to a sounder description of the quanta of gravity, whether or not they can be detected Rothman:2006fp ; Dyson:2013hbl . At the same time, it could further expose the shortcomings of a particle/field description in lieu of a more overarching model such as string theory Weinberg:2021exr . Current off-shell methods are few and limited. The string-inspired world-line formalism Schubert:2001he , for instance, is presently well-suited to compute only the irreducible part of one-loop correlators Bastianelli:2013tsa ; Ahmadiniaz:2012xp ; Ahmadiniaz:2020jgo ; Ahmadiniaz:2023vrk . In spite of ongoing interest (e.g. Bastianelli:2022pqq ; Brandt:2022und ), state-of-the-art loop computations with off-shell gravitons are still inneficiently based on diagram expansions, as in Goroff:1985sz ; Goroff:1985th . Some time ago, we established a recursive technique to compute one-loop correlators in colored theories Gomez:2022dzk via an extension of the perturbiner method Rosly:1996vr ; Rosly:1997ap . The underlying idea is to generate scattering trees from field equations. This has been long known at tree level Boulware:1968zz (also Berends:1987me ; Bardeen:1995gk ; Cangemi:1996rx ), and the perturbiner streamlined the procedure (see Mafra:2015gia ; Lee:2015upy ; Mafra:2015vca ; Mafra:2016ltu ; Mafra:2016mcc ; Mizera:2018jbh ; Garozzo:2018uzj ; Lopez-Arcos:2019hvg ; Gomez:2020vat ; Guillen:2021mwp ; Gomez:2021shh ; Ben-Shahar:2021doh ; Cho:2021nim ; Escudero:2022zdz ; Lee:2022aiu ; Cho:2022faq ; Cho:2023kux ; Damgaard:2024fqj for a series of recent developments and applications). The quantum (off-shell) step of Gomez:2022dzk involved a controlled sewing procedure to recursively generate one-loop integrands. These results relied heavily on the color ordering (like in bi-adjoint scalar and Yang-Mills theories), and could not be applied to colorless fields. In this work we finally report a breakthrough in the recursive construction of one-loop N-graviton correlators. The perturbiner offers a natural solution to the problem of defining a recursion encompassing the infinite number of graviton vertices Gomez:2021shh . Our proposal is based on an elegant solution to the expected overcounting of Feynman diagrams generated by the sewing procedure, ultimately taming their combinatorial nature. We show that our formula automatically generates the fully off-shell integrands, with both graviton and ghost loops. As a side result, we also propose a formula for one-loop amplitudes, automatically removing tadpoles and external-leg bubbles."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07846v1,"A study on the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz scenario through
quadrics of kinetic energy","A detailed description of the asymptotic behaviour in the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) scenario is presented through a simple geometric picture. The Lagrangian version of the dynamics governed by the BKL equations is described in terms of trajectories inside a conical subset of the corresponding space of the generalised velocities. The calculations confirm that the initial conditions of decreasing volume inevitably result in total collapse, while oscillations along paths reflecting from a hyperboloid, similar to Kasner’s solutions, occur on the way. The exact solution, found in our previous work, proves to be the only one that shrinks to a point along a differentiable path. Therefore, its instability means that the collapse is always chaotic. The collapse of the universe along asymptotics of exact Kasner’s solutions is proved to be impossible for solutions of the BKL equations.","The Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz scenario [1] was an answer to an important question: do the Einstein equations have solutions which describe the universe tending to (or stemming from) a cosmic singularity, for a considerable set of initial (or, respectively final) conditions? If they do, what is the behaviour of the universe in the neighborhood of the singularity? Rather than “considerable” the authors used the term “generic solution”, as corresponding to a subset having nonzero measure in the space of initial (or final) conditions of the proper dimensionality (equivalently: with the proper number of arbitrary constants). The equations in question read \frac{d^{2}\ln a}{dt^{2}}=\frac{b}{a}-a^{2},~{}~{}~{}~{}\frac{d^{2}\ln b}{dt^{% 2}}=a^{2}-\frac{b}{a}+\frac{c}{b},~{}~{}~{}~{}\frac{d^{2}\ln c}{dt^{2}}=a^{2}-% \frac{c}{b}, (1) subject to the constraint \frac{d\ln a}{dt}\;\frac{d\ln b}{dt}+\frac{d\ln a}{dt}\;\frac{d\ln c}{dt}+% \frac{d\ln b}{dt}\;\frac{d\ln c}{dt}=a^{2}+\frac{b}{a}+\frac{c}{b}\,. (2) Here \,a=a(t),\,b=b(t) and \,c=c(t) are the so-called directional scale factors proportional to length scales in the synchronous reference system, while the time parameter t is the proper time rescaled by the volume scale (zero of the proper time corresponds to the limit t\to\infty if the initial state has zero volume). The evolution of the scale factors defines the dynamics of the characteristic lengths in three principal directions while the universe tends to the singularity. Due to time-reversibility of equations (1)–(2), they may describe both expansion of the universe starting from the singularity and its final collapse. In this paper, we consider the asymptotics t\to\infty. Numerous papers, were devoted to the analysis (both analytic and numeric) of the asymptotic behaviour of the universe in the BKL scenario, e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4]. A Hamiltonian approach was analyzed in detail in [5], and a comparison with the diagonal mixmaster universe was done in [6]. The scenario was discussed in detail, on a broad background of related Bianchi models, in the book by Belinski and Henneaux [7]. Compared to those analyses, the goal of this paper is rather modest: we provide a simple geometric picture, which yields some useful exact results on the BKL scenario, staying within physics described by the BKL equations (1), (2). Relatively little attention has been devoted to the possibilities inherent in the equations themselves. Exact solutions (6) were not known until the author’s work with Piechocki [8]. Recently, other explicit solutions were found for special cases, where a or b/a, or c/b are equal to zero [9]. It seemed to be very likely that a more detailed analysis of the equations (1), (2), could yield interesting results about their solutions and consequently on physics of the universe in the described regime. This analysis is performed in this paper, with the stress on the asymptotic behaviour near the singularity. It includes the question of the chaotic character of the approach to the singularity, which was first discussed in [10]. In this paper, we provide a rigorous proof that the exact solution (6) is the only one which is differentiable down to the limit t\to\infty. Since this solution was found to be unstable in [8], it means that the approach according to the BKL equations is always chaotic. This paper is structured as follows: In section II, the earlier results are shortly summarised. These include the origin of the equations (1), (2), and their basic properties, as well as the exact solution from [8]. Section III contains description of methods, especially the geometric tool of the present analysis, which is the cone of the kinetic part of the Lagrangian (further called “kinetic energy”). Section IV contains (in IV.2) one of the main results, which is uniqueness of the exact solution (6) as the only one which allows for the collapse of the universe having differentiable length scales. In Section V, the Kasner-like and quasi-Kasner solutions are described. The other main result, stating that the BKL equations do not allow for asymptotics of the exact Kasner solutions, is discussed in Subsection V.2. Lengthy proofs have been postponed to two appendices."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07713v1,Wormhole-Induced ALP Dark Matter,"Non-perturbative gravitational effects induce explicit global symmetry breaking terms within axion models. These exponentially suppressed terms in the potential give a mass contribution to the axion-like particles (ALPs). In this work we investigate this scenario with a scalar field charged under a global U(1) symmetry and having a non-minimal coupling to gravity. Given the exponential dependence, the ALP can retain a mass spanning a wide range, which can act as a dark matter component. We specify pre-inflationary and post-inflationary production mechanisms of these ALPs, with the former from the misalignment mechanism and the latter from both the misalignment and cosmic-string decay. We identify the allowed parameter ranges that explain the dark matter abundance for both a general inflation case and a case where the radial mode scalar drives inflation, each in metric and Palatini formalisms. We show that the ALP can be the dominant component of the dark matter in a wide range of its mass, m_{a}\in[10^{-21}~{}\mathrm{eV},\,\mathrm{TeV}], depending on the inflationary scenario and the U(1) breaking scale. These results indicate that ALPs can be responsible for our dark matter abundance within a setup purely from non-perturbative gravitational effects.","Among beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories, axion or axion-like particles (ALPs) have been obtaining much attention due to their unique characteristics.111In this work, the term ‘axion’ refers to the QCD axion which is particularly motivated to solve the string CP problem and have a designated coupling to Standard Model fields. Other than that, we will use the terminology ‘ALP’. First of all, the existence of the axion has the potential to address two major unsolved problems in particle physics and cosmology, namely the strong CP problem Peccei:1977hh ; Peccei:1977ur ; Wilczek:1977pj ; Weinberg:1977ma and the nature of dark matter Preskill:1982cy ; Abbott:1982af ; Dine:1982ah . For the latter case, frameworks that generalize beyond the QCD axion can also provide good dark matter candidates. These ALP models are generally associated with global U(1) symmetries, where the ALP mass is determined by the symmetry-breaking terms and can span a much wider range. In general, at the very least, all global symmetries are expected to be explicitly broken in the presence of gravity Kallosh:1995hi ; Banks:2010zn ; Witten:2017hdv ; Harlow:2018jwu ; Harlow:2018tng . One definite origin of the symmetry breaking is coming from non-perturbative gravitational effects, which include gravitational instantons represented by Euclidean wormhole solutions Lee:1988ge ; Giddings:1989bq ; Abbott:1989jw ; Coleman:1989zu ; Kallosh:1995hi ; Hebecker:2016dsw ; Alonso:2017avz ; Hertog:2018kbz ; Hebecker:2018ofv ; Loges:2022nuw ; Andriolo:2022rxc ; Loges:2023ypl ; Jonas:2023ipa ; Kanazawa:2023xzy ; Martucci:2024trp ; Hertog:2024nys . For the QCD axion scenario, this explicit PQ symmetry breaking becomes another source in addition to the QCD instanton effects, which shifts the vacuum expectation value (vev) away from the desired value that solves the strong CP problem, leading to the ‘axion quality problem’ Dine:1986bg ; Kamionkowski:1992mf ; Barr:1992qq ; Holman:1992us ; Ghigna:1992iv . However, the possible implications of gravitational global symmetry breaking reach out to any Goldstone bosons, including ALPs beyond the QCD axion. These symmetry breaking terms can be a universal source giving the mass of general pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) Alonso:2017avz ; Alvey:2020nyh . These now massive ALPs can then be a dark matter component, in analogy to axion dark matter. A nonzero initial angle induces a misalignment mechanism Preskill:1982cy ; Abbott:1982af ; Dine:1982ah , and cosmic strings associated with the global symmetry can also emit ALP dark matter particles Sikivie:1982qv ; Vilenkin:1984ib ; Davis:1986xc ; Vincent:1996rb ; Kawasaki:2014sqa ; Vilenkin:1986ku , with the mass, in this case, being solely determined through gravitational effects. The mass range highly depends on the wormhole action value, which itself depends on the axion model context. Especially, in Refs. Hamaguchi:2021mmt ; Cheong:2022ikv ; Cheong:2023hrj , it was shown that a large non-minimal coupling to gravity with coupling \xi significantly alters the wormhole properties with respect to minimal gravity cases. This motivates the necessity to rigorously revisit the possible effects of these gravitational instantons on ALP DM. In this paper, we explore the possibility that non-perturbative gravitational effects can induce explicit global symmetry breaking in ALP models. Specifically, we consider a global U(1) scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity, and investigate how the resulting ALP mass, determined by exponentially suppressed symmetry breaking terms, can span a wide range. Notably, for \xi=0, the wormhole-induced ALP mass resulting from explicit U(1) symmetry breaking is too large to be a viable dark matter candidate. This also emphasizes the need to introduce a non-minimal coupling as a minimal mechanism to suppress the U(1) global symmetry breaking caused by the wormhole. Our study covers both pre-inflation and post-inflation production mechanisms. We examine the allowed parameter spaces that explain the dark matter abundance, considering both general inflationary scenarios and cases where the radial mode scalar drives inflation. Our analysis includes both the metric and Palatini formalisms, and we demonstrate that ALPs can account for the observed dark matter density over a broad range of mass and symmetry breaking scales, driven purely by non-perturbative gravitational effects. This paper is organized as follows. We first review the wormhole properties within an analytic framework, and obtain the ALP mass expression in Section 2. In Section 3, we further analyze the ALP dark matter production mechanisms, considering the global symmetry breaking scale. We then present possible parameter ranges that explain our dark matter abundance after identifying relevant constraints for both general inflation in Section 4 and the case when the radial mode of the complex scalar being the inflaton field in Section 5. In Section 6, we conclude with possible further implications of these wormhole dark matter candidates."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07693v2,Diving into a multi-band holographic superconductor,"In this paper, we consider the interior structure of a multi-band holographic superconductor model. We focus on the holographic superconductor system with two scalar fields which correspond to two s-wave order parameters in the dual condensed matter system. With two s-wave order parameters, the boundary system has more interesting behaviors which can also be reflected in black hole interior structure. We find the Einstein-Rosen bridge collapse and Josephson oscillations of two scalar fields inside the horizon. For the region near the singularity, we find that the metric still presents Kasner form and there is also Kasner transition behavior. However, when two scalar fields coexist, the Kasner exponents and Kasner transition formula will be different from the single scalar field case. The different interior structures between multi-band holographic superconductor and single-band holographic superconductor we find in this work further confirms that the black hole interior is important to reflect the properties of dual condensed matter systems.","AdS/CFT correspondence provides a useful tool to understand the strongly coupled condensed matter systems using dual gravitational framework Maldacena:1997re ; Aharony:1999ti . One prominent example is the holographic superconductor first raised in Ref.Hartnoll:2008vx ; Hartnoll:2008kx which is an s-wave superconductor model. The physical meaning of this holographic superconductor is as follows. From the bulk side, when gauge field and charged scalar fields are added, the original background without scalar hair (Reissner-Nordstrom black hole) will become unstable to form scalar hairs as we tune the temperature or chemical potential of the gravitational system. This spontaneous generated scalar hair can be understood as the order parameter of superconducting phase transition at the boundary by using AdS/CFT dictionary. Based on Ginzburg-Landau theory, this gravitational model mimics the superconducting phase transition. After the first discovery of this s-wave holographic superconductor model, there are many further generalizations to superconductor models with different types of order parameters, such as p-wave superconductor model Gubser:2008wv ; Cai:2013aca and d-wave superconductor model Chen:2010mk ; Benini:2010pr . However, many realistic high T_{c} superconductor systems are characterized by multi Fermi surfaces which means that there should be multiple order parameters in order to describe these systems PhysRevLett.3.552 ; 10.1143/PTP.29.1 . So many theoretical frameworks have also been established in condensed matter theory to understand multi-band superconductor models which have multiple order parameters PhysRevLett.106.047005 ; PhysRevB.85.134514 . Holography provides a simple way to describe superconductors with multiple order parameters and many holographic models involving coexistence of multiple order parameters have been constructed. Ref.Basu:2010fa builds a simple model to describe multi-band superconductor holographically. In this model, there are two charged scalar fields coupled to the same U(1) gauge field. It has been shown in Ref.Basu:2010fa that there are cases where these two s-wave order parameters coexist. As this work was done in the probe limit, Ref.Cai:2013wma generalized this result to fully back-reacted case and found that the coexistence region will enlarge when increasing the back-reaction. This multi-band model is s+s type, there are also many further generalizations to the coexistence of s+p order parameters Nie:2013sda , p+p order parameters Donos:2013woa and s+d order parameters Li:2014wca . Ref.Cai:2015cya gives a comprehensive review of the development of holographic superconductor model. Above discussions regarding these holographic superconductor models only consider the black hole exterior region. This is because for the holographic study of condensed matter systems at finite temperature, the boundary state is a mixed state whose gravitational dual is the black hole exterior part. Thus it seems that black hole interior region is not related to these studies. However, the boundary mixed state can be purified to be a pure state. The most well-known purification is canonical purification and the resulting pure state is the thermo-field double state which reads |TFD\rangle=\sum_{i}e^{-\beta E_{i}/2}|E_{i}\rangle_{L}|E_{i}\rangle_{R} (1) Once upon purification, the dual gravitational system of this pure state is the eternal AdS black hole (AdS wormhole) which contains the black hole interior part Maldacena:2001kr ; Maldacena:2013xja .For different systems with different Hamiltonians, the energy spectrum E_{i} will be different which leads to different properties of thermo-field double state. Certainly, this will also influence the interior structure of corresponding black holes and thus the features of black hole interior should also be important to illustrate the properties of boundary system. Based on this consideration, many holographic investigations of boundary system have also been done from black hole interior point of view Cai:2020wrp ; Hartnoll:2020fhc ; Hartnoll:2020rwq ; An:2021plu ; Liu:2021hap ; Cai:2021obq ; An:2022lvo ; Gao:2023zbd ; Cai:2023igv ; Cai:2024ltu ; Carballo:2024hem ; Caceres:2023zhl ; Hartnoll:2022rdv ; Caceres:2021fuw ; Xu:2023fad ; Gao:2023rqc ; Arean:2024pzo ; Caceres:2024edr . For holographic superconductor model, Ref. Hartnoll:2020fhc investigated the interior structure of s-wave holographic superconductor proposed in Hartnoll:2008kx . They found that the black hole interior structure changes drastically after the superconducting phase transition. The original Cauchy horizon disappears due to the presence of scalar hair. And moreover, they also found a series of critical phenomena inside the horizon which are called ""ER collapse"" and ""Josephson oscillation"", these phenomena are most prominent near the critical temperature T_{c}. For the region near the singularity, there are also new behaviors. The metric takes the form of anisotropic Kasner universe and for unstable Kasner region, there also exists Kasner inversion behavior which follows the BKL transition rule Belinsky:1970ew . It has also been found that different boundary models have different interior structures, for example the s-wave holographic superconductor model with exponential-type scalar potential and p-wave holographic superconductor model all bear distinct interior structures Cai:2021obq ; An:2022lvo ; Cai:2023igv ; Cai:2024ltu . Thus the black hole interior structures are very useful to characterize the distinct features of the boundary model. Besides these progress, the investigations regarding the interior structure all focus on the single order parameter case. There is still no research on the interior structure of multi-band holographic superconductor model. From condensed matter point of view, the physics of multi-band superconductor will be very different from single-band superconductor, understanding this difference holographically is a very interesting question. As the black hole interior structure can be a sensitive probe to the boundary model, thus we will investigate the interior structure of multi-band holographic superconductor in this paper. For simplicity, we will firstly focus on the multi-band holographic superconductor with two charged scalar fields. We find that with one additional scalar field, the Josephson oscillation behavior, Kasner geometry and Kasner transition behavior will all bear new features compared to single scalar field case. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec.2, we first review the multi-band holographic superconductor with two competing scalar fields which have different mass and charge. We will show the three different types of coexistence behavior for different choice of parameters. In Sec.3, we will choose one specific coexistence scenario as a representative and investigate the interior structure of this hairy black hole with multiple scalar fields. We show the ER collapse, Josephson oscillation and Kasner behavior inside this black hole and describe its difference with the single scalar field case. In Sec.4, we conclude our paper and give some future directions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07647v1,"Primordial black holes 
and induced gravitational waves from logarithmic non-Gaussianity","We investigate the formation of primordial black hole (PBH) based on numerical relativity simulations and peak theory as well as the corresponding scalar induced gravitational wave (SIGW) signals in the presence of logarithmic non-Gaussianities which has recently been confirmed in a wide class of inflation models. Through numerical calculations, we find certain parameter spaces of the critical thresholds for the type A PBH formation and reveal a maximum critical threshold value. We also find that there is a region where no PBH is produced from type II fluctuations contrary to a previous study. We then confirm that SIGW signals originated from the logarithmic non-Gaussianity are detectable in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna if PBHs account for whole dark matter. Finally, we discuss the SIGW interpretation of the nHz stochastic gravitational wave background reported by the recent pulsar timing array observations. We find that PBH overproduction is a serious problem for most of the parameter space, while this tension might still be alleviated in the non-perturbative regime.","\Acp PBH are hypothetical compact objects that might have been formed in the early universe [1, 2]. Although various formation scenarios have been discussed (e.g., the formation in the matter-dominated universe [3], the formation from the isocurvature perturbation [4, 5], and the formation from a resonant instability of cosmological perturbation during a preheating [6, 7]), the widely discussed one is the gravitational collapse of the highly dense regions in the radiation-dominated universe. \AcpPBH can be formed in a wide range of masses unlike astrophysical black holes, and they can provide a sizable amount of dark matter (DM). The mass range between [10^{-15}M_{\odot}\text{--}10^{-11}M_{\odot}] is often called the PBH Dark Matter window because it can account for all the DM according to the current observational constraints [8, 9, 10]. \AcpPBH are not only promising DM candidates but can also potentially explain other cosmological and astrophysical phenomena. For instance, they could constitute the seeds for the supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei or galaxies [11], be relevant sources of gravitational wave (GW) events in ground-based detectors [12, 13, 14, 15] and in pulsar timing array (PTA) observations [16, 17, 18, 19], have a role on explaining baryogenesis [20, 21, 22], and even stand as the exotic object present in the solar system [23, 24]. In addition to these motivations, recently, more precise studies focusing on the relationship between GWs and PBHs have been actively discussed (see, e.g., Ref. [25]). The large primordial perturbations necessary for PBH formation can induce GWs through the second-order interactions between the scalar and tensor metric perturbations. The frequency of GWs is related to the PBH mass, as both of them depend on the size of the Hubble horizon at the reentry. In particular, our main interest relies on the mass band of the PBH mass window corresponding to the frequency band of space-borne interferometers, such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) [26], Decihertz Gravitational Wave Observatory (DECIGO) [27], Taiji [28], and TianQin [29]. In fact, it was pointed out that LISA can detect the SIGW signal when the PBHs in the mass range of the DM window occupy the entire DM [30, 31]. Interestingly, the detectability of milihertz SIGW is robust against non-Gaussianity, which has also been widely studied [30, 32, 33, 34, 35]. On the theoretical side, recently, the curvature perturbations \zeta having a non-Gaussian exponential tail in their probability density function have come to be discussed [36, 37, 38, 39]. One typical model that realizes such a non-Gaussian curvature perturbation is the ultra slow-roll inflation. The primordial curvature perturbation produced during the ultra slow-roll phase could have sufficiently large amplitudes for PBH formations and have an exponential-tail distribution which asymptotically follows P(\zeta)\propto\exp(-3\zeta) in the large \zeta limit. It is explained by the logarithmic relation \zeta=-(1/3)\ln{(1-3\zeta_{g})} between the curvature perturbation \zeta and a certain Gaussian random field \zeta_{g}. A more general form of a logarithmic type curvature perturbation can be expressed as \zeta=-(1/\gamma)\ln{(1-\gamma\zeta_{g})} with a constant parameter \gamma. We call this the logarithmic non-Gaussianity relation. This logarithmic non-Gaussianity can be found in a class of the constant roll inflation model which is the generalized model of the ultra slow-roll inflation [40, 41, 42, 43, 44], as well as in the curvaton scenario [45]. In the constant roll scenario, the primordial scalar power spectrum can be blue-tilted and it could realize the efficient PBH formation [46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]. The probability density function of the logarithmic type curvature perturbations has the exponential tail P(\zeta)\propto\exp(-\gamma\zeta) for \gamma>0, and follows the Gumbel tail as P(\zeta)\propto\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\gamma^{2}\sigma^{2}}\mathrm{e}^{-2\gamma% \zeta}\right) with the variance \sigma^{2}=\braket{\zeta^{2}_{g}} for -3/2<\gamma<0 [42, 44]. Although the influence of the exponential tail in the ultra slow-roll model (i.e., \gamma=3) on the PBH formation and the corresponding SIGW signals have been studied in Refs. [53, 34], the PBH formation and the related SIGW signals in general parameter space are unknown. Additionally, as PBHs may be overproduced when trying to explain the nHz SGWB observed by PTAs as induced by the curvature perturbation [16], a negative non-Gaussianity is implied [54]. This also motivates us to study the PBH formation in the logarithmic non-Gaussianity with \gamma<0. In this work, we investigate the PBH formation when there is logarithmic non-Gaussianity, based on the numerical relativity and peak theory. The corresponding SIGW spectrum is also calculated analytically. This paper is organized as follows. We describe the process of PBH formation including the considered peak profile, threshold estimation, and computation of abundances in Sec. 2. Next, in Sec. 3, we briefly review the perturbative formula for the SIGW with the primordial scalar non-Gaussianities based on Ref. [34] and provide the predicted signal in relation to current and future experiments. We investigate the detectability for the SIGW with the logarithmic non-Gaussianity in light of PBH DM scenario by the LISA. We also perform the parameter estimation for SIGW in light of the logarithmic non-Gaussianity based on the recent PTA results on the stochastic gravitational wave background, and discuss the compatibility of the abundance of PBHs. Finally, we provide our conclusions in Sec. 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07552v1,Landscape of Modular Cosmology,"We investigate the global structure of the recently discovered family of SL(2,\mathbb{Z})-invariant potentials describing inflationary \alpha-attractors. These potentials have an inflationary plateau consisting of the fundamental domain and its images fully covering the upper part of the Poincaré half-plane. Meanwhile, the lower part of the half-plane is covered by an infinitely large number of ridges, which, at first glance, are too sharp to support inflation. However, we show that this apparent sharpness is just an illusion created by hyperbolic geometry, and each of these ridges is physically equivalent to the inflationary plateau in the upper part of the Poincaré half-plane.","The idea that string theory inspired supergravity has a kinetic term with SL(2,\mathbb{R}) symmetry of the form {n\over 4}\,{\partial\tau\partial\bar{\tau}\over({\rm Im}\tau)^{2}} (1) was proposed in Ferrara:1989bc . The integer n here is related to the Kähler curvature of SL(2,\mathbb{R})/U(1) coset space111 Much later this same integer 3\alpha=n in case of cosmological \alpha-attractors was proposed and studied in Ferrara:2016fwe ; Kallosh:2021vcf as a target of the future cosmological experiments, like LiteBIRD LiteBIRD:2022cnt . These are 7 cases n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7 of Poincaré disks related to the upper half-plane by a Cayley transform. which is \mathbb{R}_{K}=-{2\over n}. The proposal in Ferrara:1989bc concerning supergravity potentials was that SL(2,\mathbb{R}) symmetry can be broken down, due to world-sheet instantons, to its discrete subgroup SL(2,\mathbb{Z}). This led to the conclusion that potentials depend on modular forms, like holomorphic modular function j(\tau), holomorphic Dedekind function \eta(\tau), and an almost holomorphic regularized Eisenstein function \hat{G}_{2}(\tau,{\rm Im}\tau). This symmetry of supergravity in Ferrara:1989bc was dubbed “target space modular invariance” to distinguish it from duality symmetry in string theory. SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) invariant cosmological theories are described by a four-dimensional bosonic actions S(\tau,\bar{\tau})=\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\Big{(}{R\over 2}+{3\alpha\over 4}\,{% \partial\tau\partial\bar{\tau}\over({\rm Im}\tau)^{2}}-V(\tau,\bar{\tau})\Big{% )}\,. (2) They depend on a single complex field \tau(x)=\tau_{1}+i\tau_{2}, where \tau_{1} and \tau_{2} are functions of 4 space-time coordinates x^{\mu}. Each term in the action is SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) invariant when \tau\to{a\tau+b\over c\tau+d},\qquad a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{Z}\,,\quad ad-bc=1\ . (3) It was proposed in Casas:2024jbw to study SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) invariant cosmological theories with plateau potentials. Their potential was given by a specific function of the Dedekind function and \tilde{G}_{2} Eisenstein modular form of weight 2. In Kallosh:2024ymt , we studied SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) cosmological plateau-type models of general type, depending on SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) invariant Klein’s j-function and Dedekind function. We have shown that these models, as well as the model of Ref. Casas:2024jbw , represent a novel class of \alpha-attractors studied earlier in Kallosh:2013yoa ; Galante:2014ifa ; Carrasco:2015uma ; Carrasco:2015rva ; Carrasco:2015pla ; Kallosh:2021mnu . We continue to study SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) inflationary models in KalLin2024 ; CKLR . The early studies of target space modular invariance in Font:1990nt revealed an important feature of modular invariant potentials: they have an infinity of degenerate minima, saddle points, and maxima, whose positions are related to each other by modular SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) transformations. It was observed there that the choice of the minimum leads to a spontaneously broken target-space modular invariance. Cosmological inflation models based on SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) invariant action in Eq. (2) were studied in Schimmrigk:2014ica ; Schimmrigk:2016bde ; Schimmrigk:2021tlv . In particular, a model of j-inflation was proposed in Schimmrigk:2014ica ; Schimmrigk:2016bde ; Schimmrigk:2021tlv . A global structure of the potential of j-inflation was investigated in Schimmrigk:2021tlv . It was observed there that the potential near the boundary at {\rm Im}\,\tau\to 0 has an intricate structure reminiscent of a fractal structure. But the contour plot of the potential has to be complimented by the behavior of the hyperbolic metric, which diverges as the saddles approach the real axis. The difference between j-inflation studied in Schimmrigk:2014ica ; Schimmrigk:2016bde ; Schimmrigk:2021tlv and the new SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) invariant models developed in Kallosh:2024ymt is that j-inflation potentials at large \tau_{2} grow exponentially in \tau_{2}, i.e. double exponentially in the canonically normalized inflaton field, whereas in Kallosh:2024ymt the potentials depending on j(\tau),\eta(\tau) approach a plateau. Therefore, in j-inflation, inflation begins at a saddle point, whereas in Kallosh:2024ymt , inflation starts at the plateau, which has the same large-field behavior as the \alpha-attractor potentials. Here we will study the landscape of SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) cosmology. The existence of this landscape, for example, of the infinite number of minima of the potentials, or saddle points, is due to the fact that the value of the potential is the same after the modular transformation. Namely, any point \tau^{\prime}={a\tau+b\over c\tau+d} with arbitrary numbers a,b,c,d with ad-cb=1 is a modular image of any original point \tau since V(\tau^{\prime})=V(\tau). But the plateau of the potential is a big area; for example, in the fundamental domain in Fig. 1, it is a grey area at large y. From the first glance at the plot of the SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) 3D potentials in Kallosh:2024ymt , we find that in Cartesian coordinates, there is one plateau and many ridges. This is a consequence of the fact that the metric in the hyperbolic space in Cartesian coordinates blows up near the boundary y=0 in the half-plane. Therefore, evaluating the shape of the potential without taking into account the metric may be misleading. In this paper, we will develop new tools which will help us to address this issue. Figure 1: Tessellation of the hyperbolic plane \tau=x+iy, (\ -\infty<x<\infty,\,y>0) shows vertical bands which repeat each other. The grey area is a fundamental domain, -0.5\leq x\leq 0.5; \tau\bar{\tau}\geq 1, the other bands are shifted by 1 or -1 and repeated. There is a symmetry under reflection: x\to-x. The proliferation of the images of the points in the boundary of the fundamental domain in the grey area is a result of the eternal continuation of the geodesics, either vertical or semi-circular ones, towards the boundary y\to 0, see Wikipedia. Note that in the cosmological setting in space-time, as opposed to string theory on the world-sheet, \tau=\theta+i\exp{\sqrt{2/3\alpha}\,\varphi} is a space-time dependent complex scalar field \tau(x^{\mu}). One should solve equations of motion, defining the evolution of scalars \theta(t) and \varphi(t) in time. During our investigation of inflation starting at the inflationary plateau in the fundamental domain, we have found that after inflation, the scalar fields roll down and cross the boundary of the fundamental domain, its lower arc, where the minima of the potentials in Casas:2024jbw ; Kallosh:2024ymt are located. Their subsequent evolution, including the process of reheating, takes the scalars out of the fundamental domain. This is not surprising: the whole hyperbolic half-plane is geodesically complete, but the fundamental domain is not. Moreover, as we have found out in Kallosh:2024ymt , inflation in these models may begin outside of the fundamental domain. Thus, if we want to fully understand the cosmological evolution in this scenario, we should explore the global structure of the potential in the entire half-plane. This is the main goal of our investigation."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07304v1,Phase Space of Binary Black Holes from Gravitational Wave Observations to Unveil its Formation History,"Gravitational Wave (GW) sources offer a valuable window to the physical processes that govern the formation of binary compact objects (BCOs). However, deciphering such information from GW data is substantially challenging due to the difficulty in mapping from the space of observation to the space of numerous theoretical models. We introduce the concept of BCO Phase-Space that connects the observable space to the evolution trajectories of the BCO formation channels with cosmic time and apply it to the third GW transient catalog (GWTC-3) that brings new insights into probable astrophysical formation scenarios of nearly 90 events. Our study reveals that two events, GW190425 and GW230529, show an overlap with a BCO Phase Space trajectory of the same formation channel arising from a sub-solar mass black hole scenario that has grown into a higher mass by accretion, hinting towards the common primordial origin of both these sources. Though the actual formation channel is yet to be confirmed, with the availability of more GW events, the BCO Phase Space can delve into distinguishing features of different formation channels for both astrophysical and primordial origin and opens the possibility of bringing new and deeper insights on the formation and evolution of BCOs across all observable masses over most of the cosmic time.","Acknowledgments The authors express their gratitude to Michela Mapelli for reviewing the manuscript and providing useful comments as a part of the LIGO publication policy.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07295v1,"Smooth extremal horizons are the exception,
not the rule","We show that the general charged, rotating black hole in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory has a singular extremal limit. Only the known analytic solutions with exactly zero charge or zero angular momenta have smooth extremal horizons. When the two angular momenta are not equal and both are scaled to zero, the solution approaches a new family of static, nonspherical extremal black holes. We also consider general black holes in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, and show that they also have singular extremal limits except for one special value of the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term (the one fixed by supergravity). Combining this with earlier results showing that extremal black holes have singular horizons in four-dimensional general relativity with small higher derivative corrections, and in anti-de Sitter space with perturbed boundary conditions, one sees that smooth extremal horizons are indeed the exception and not the rule.","The five-dimensional (5D) generalization of the Kerr-Newman solution, describing charged rotating black holes, is not known. The 5D solution should contain four parameters: a mass M, charge Q, and two angular momenta, J_{\phi},J_{\psi}, corresponding to rotations in two orthogonal planes. Exact solutions to the 5D Einstein-Maxwell equations are known only when some of these parameters vanish. When J_{\phi}=J_{\psi}=0, one has the static 5D generalization of the Reissner-Nordström solution Tangherlini:1963bw , and when Q=0, one has the vacuum Myers-Perry solutions Myers:1986un . Both of these solutions have smooth extremal limits (when J_{\phi},J_{\psi} are both nonzero). If one adds a Chern-Simons term to the action with its coefficient fixed by supergravity, the general four-parameter family of black hole solutions is known Chong:2005hr , and again has smooth extremal limits. Given these results, one is tempted to conclude that the generic 5D (spherical111We will consider only (asymptotically flat) black holes with horizon topology S^{3}.) rotating charged black hole will have a smooth extremal limit. The goal of this paper is to show that this intuition is completely wrong. We will show that generic 5D black holes have singular extremal limits. More precisely, black hole solutions to the 5D Einstein-Maxwell equations with nonzero Q,J_{\phi},J_{\psi} develop curvature singularities on their horizon in the extremal limit. This is probably why, despite considerable effort over the decades since the Myers-Perry solution was discovered (see Deshpande:2024vbn for a recent discussion), no one has found its charged generalization analytically. If one adds a Chern-Simons term with a coefficient \lambda normalised so that \lambda=1 is the supergravity value, then extremal black holes remain singular as one increases \lambda, except for the precise value \lambda=1. We find it remarkable that by studying black holes in a theory without fermions, one can select the value of \lambda required by supersymmetry. General relativity seems to know about supergravity. There are two different types of curvature singularities that can arise depending on the parameters. For |\lambda|<1, generic extremal black holes have diverging tidal forces and diverging electric fields for infalling observers as they approach the horizon. However, all scalars constructed from the curvature and Maxwell field do not blow up and remain finite. This is directly analogous to the singularities that are found for extremal black holes in four dimensions when small higher curvature corrections are added to general relativity Horowitz:2023xyl ; Horowitz:2024dch . Similar singularities are found for extremal black holes in 4D anti-de Sitter space with perturbed boundary conditions Horowitz:2022mly . The remarkable thing about five dimensions is that the generic extremal black hole is singular even in the simplest Einstein-Maxwell theory, without higher derivative corrections or perturbed boundary conditions. When |\lambda|>1, the singularity becomes stronger, and curvature scalars do blow up. We also find that for all \lambda, if one of the angular momenta vanish, then the extremal limit is singular in this strong sense. This is a well known property of 5D Myers-Perry black holes, but we will see that it continues to hold when any charge is added. In particular, if one adds an arbitrarily small amount of angular momentum in one plane to a 5D Reissner-Nordström black hole, the extremal horizon has diverging curvature scalars. When the curvature scalars remain finite, the metric and vector potential are C^{0} but not C^{1} at the extremal horizon. Since the horizon becomes infinitely far away in spacelike directions, one can define a near-horizon geometry. When Q\to 0, it approaches the Myers-Perry near-horizon geometry. It is natural to expect that when the angular momenta vanish, it will approach the 5D Reissner-Nordström near-horizon geometry. However this is incorrect. We find that the solution approaches the more general static U(1)\times U(1) symmetric near-horizon geometries Kunduri:2009ud when J_{\phi} and J_{\psi} both vanish. These metrics involve a squashed S^{3}, and were originally interpreted as the near-horizon geometries of a nonrotating extremal black hole in a background electric field. We will show that the same geometries arise (without a background electric field) for an extremal black hole in the limit J_{\phi},J_{\psi}\to 0, with the amount of squashing determined by the ratio J_{\phi}/J_{\psi}. This implies that there are static, asymptotically flat extremal black holes that are not spherically symmetric! These near-horizon geometries are smooth, but the exact metrics differ from them by a term than can be written \rho^{\gamma}h where \rho is an affine distance to the horizon, h is a smooth tensor field, and the scaling dimension, \gamma, is determined by the field equations. We will show that for |\lambda|<1, \gamma is not an integer and lies in the range 0<\gamma<1/2, except for a couple of special cases (corresponding to the known analytic solutions). Similarly, the vector potential has power law behavior near the horizon with the same exponent. This is the origin of the diverging tidal forces and diverging electric fields for observers crossing the extremal horizon. Even though curvature scalars remain finite, this singularity is strong enough that Einstein’s equation cannot be defined even in a distributional sense. For larger coefficients of the Chern-Simons term (|\lambda|>1), curvature scalars diverge and there is no near-horizon geometry.222Strictly speaking, there is a solution with the symmetries of a near-horizon geometry, but it does not arise in the asymptotically flat solution. We do not obtain these results by finding the general 5D rotating charged black hole solution explicitly. Even the general near-horizon geometry is not known analytically. Instead, we use a combination of numerical and perturbative arguments to establish our results. For example, in the case of pure Einstein-Maxwell theory, we start with the Myers-Perry near-horizon geometry and add charge perturbatively. We find that the black hole entropy does not depend on the charge and is given by333We set G_{5}=1 throughout this paper. S_{1}=2\pi\sqrt{|J_{\phi}J_{\psi}|}\,. (1) We also start with the general static U(1)\times U(1) symmetric near-horizon geometry and add angular momenta perturbatively. The entropy is then given by {S_{2}}=\frac{4\sqrt{\pi}}{3^{3/4}}|Q|^{3/2}+\frac{3^{3/4}\pi^{3/2}}{4}\frac{% \left|J_{\phi}J_{\psi}\right|}{|Q|^{3/2}} (2) Although this is initially derived just for small angular momenta, when we numerically compute the general near-horizon geometry, we find that it holds exactly for all angular momenta until S_{1}=S_{2}. This occurs when \left|J_{\phi}J_{\psi}\right|=\frac{16\ |Q|^{3}}{3\sqrt{3}\pi} (3) When |J_{\phi}J_{\psi}| exceeds this bound, the entropy is given by (1) exactly. So there are two branches of near-horizon geometries (when \lambda=0) which meet at (3). The fact that these two branches have simple entropy formulas strongly suggests that there is an analytic solution for the general near-horizon geometry in this case. Finding this solution explicitly remains an open problem. In the special case J_{\phi}=J_{\psi}, there is enhanced symmetry and the analytic solution is known Blazquez-Salcedo:2013yba . Our entropy formulas (1) and (2) reduce to the known expressions in this case. After finding the near-horizon geometries of the extremal solutions, we compute the scaling dimensions \gamma. We again first do this perturbatively for small charge and small angular momenta, and then compute \gamma numerically for the general case. Finally, we numerically construct the full asymptotically flat, near extremal solutions and show that the horizon becomes singular as one approaches extremality. In the next section we introduce the one parameter family of 5D theories that we will consider, labelled by the coefficient of a Chern-Simons term. In section 3 we solve the field equations to determine the near-horizon geometries. The scaling dimensions are computed in Section 4, and the full asymptotically flat solutions are constructed in Section 5. Section 6 contains some discussion of these results, and the Appendices compute some of the higher scaling dimensions of the near-horizon geometries with zero charge or zero angular momenta."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07288v1,Emergent Geometry from Quantum Probability,"Carrying the insights of conditional probability to the quantum realm is notoriously difficult due to the non-commutative nature of quantum observables. Nevertheless, conditional expectations on von Neumann algebras have played a significant role in the development of quantum information theory, and especially the study of quantum error correction. In quantum gravity, it has been suggested that conditional expectations may be used to implement the holographic map algebraically, with quantum error correction underlying the emergence of spacetime through the generalized entropy formula. However, the requirements for exact error correction are almost certainly too strong for realistic theories of quantum gravity. In this note, we present a relaxed notion of quantum conditional expectation which implements approximate error correction. We introduce a generalization of Connes’ spatial theory adapted to completely positive maps, and derive a chain rule allowing for the non-commutative factorization of relative modular operators into a marginal and conditional part, constituting a quantum Bayes’ law. This allows for an exact quantification of the information gap occurring in the data processing inequality for arbitrary quantum channels. When applied to algebraic inclusions, this also provides an approach to factorizing the entropy of states into a sum of terms which, in the gravitational context, may be interpreted as a generalized entropy. We illustrate that the emergent area operator is fully non-commutative rather than central, except under the conditions of exact error correction. We provide some comments on how this result may be used to construct a fully algebraic quantum extremal surface prescription and to probe the quantum nature of black holes.","At its most fundamental level, quantum theory is a study of non-commutative probability. Instead of working with classical probability distributions and random variables, one is forced by nature to replace these notions with states on Hilbert spaces and non-commuting observables. Despite the drastic differences between classical and quantum probability, they are synthesized in the language of von Neumann algebras [1, 2, 3] with Abelian algebras encoding ordinary measure spaces, while non-Abelian ones encode what are often referred to as non-commutative measure spaces. In both its commutative and non-commutative avatars, the study of probability leads naturally to questions in information theory [4, 5, 6, 7]. The answers to these questions invariably center around the computation of measures of entropy. Entropic measures have been found to be universal across a wide array of different fields, which is a testament to the ubiquity of information theory. A seminal result in classical probability theory is Bayes’ law [8]: the joint probability distribution of two random variables can be decomposed into the product of a marginal and a conditional probability distribution. Measures like the entropy and the relative entropy inherit this decomposition and factorize into sums of marginal and conditional contributions. The act of reducing a total distribution into these components relies upon the ability to ‘integrate out’ one of the variables, akin to the partial trace of quantum mechanics. More generally, this operation is described by a classical conditional expectation. On the other hand, given a von Neumann algebra that encodes the quantum observables of two distinct subsystems, we are not guaranteed any factorization due to entanglement. Moreover, there are several distinct quantum operations that resemble classical conditional expectations. These considerations severely complicate the problem of promoting Bayes’ theorem and the enterprise of conditional probability to the quantum realm. Notwithstanding these challenges, the main contribution of this note is to derive a version of Bayes’ law that is valid for any von Neumann algebra independent of its type classification or factorizability. This allows us to decompose (relative) density operators, which are algebraic analogues of probability distributions, into a non-commutative product of marginal and conditional operators. In turn, this factorization gives rise to a quantum notion of marginal and conditional entropy which enhances the computation and interpretation of various quantum information theoretic quantities. The non-commutativity of the underlying quantum probability theory manifests itself in a series of new terms appearing in the quantum conditional (relative) entropy which signal the entanglement between subsystems. A principal application of our non-commutative Bayes’ theorem quantifies the relative entropy between states under the application of a completely positive map. Such maps are ubiquitous in quantum information because they preserve the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory; for example, measurement can be modeled by such ‘quantum operations’ [9]. The relative entropy factorizes as a sum of the relative entropy between states before the application of the quantum operation and a leftover term which defines the quantum conditional relative entropy. A cornerstone of quantum information theory is the data processing inequality, which tells us that the relative entropy between states must decrease under the application of a quantum operation [10, 11].111In other words, quantum operations serve to make states less distinguishable. The quantum conditional relative entropy therefore provides an exact quantification of the information which is lost under the application of the quantum operation. This is in direct analogy with the classical conditional relative entropy which quantifies information loss under the application of a classical channel. In the context of quantum error correction, the conditional relative entropy quantifies obstructions to the invertibility of a noisy quantum channel [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. One of the areas which has benefited enormously from the incorporation of quantum information theoretic tools is the study of quantum gravity. Among the central problems in this field is understanding the microscopic origin of entropy and entanglement and its relationship to the emergence of spacetime geometry. Hawking radiation [17] provided a short-lived puzzle regarding the second law of thermodynamics applied to black holes. Given that black holes both (1) have an entropy proportional to their area [18] and (2) radiate and shrink away, it seems that the entropy is allowed to decrease. However, this points to an enhancement of the entropy by a term which measures the entropy of the radiated particles themselves. The quantity combining both the area and the radiation entropy is called the generalized entropy [19], and satisfies the second law of thermodynamics [20]. The generalized entropy may be interpreted as a harbinger of holography. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, bulk physics is encoded in a non-local way in a boundary theory. The problem of building geometry from the data of a holographic CFT amounts to identifying boundary observables which are dual to geometric quantities. The seminal work of Ryu-Takayanagi [21] identified the entropy of the vacuum on a CFT subregion with the generalized entropy of a particular bulk subregion including the contribution of an extremal area term. In [22], it was recognized that such a decomposition of the entropy is reminiscent of exact quantum error correction. This observation was given an algebraic treatment in [23], where it was shown that exact complementary error correction implies the existence of a conditional expectation222This is a strict form of quantum conditional expectation, as we will discuss in the body of the note. mapping from the boundary to the bulk which implements the holographic map algebraically. The appearance of the area is a generic feature of the factorization of states in the code-subspace of such a conditional expectation. Unfortunately, these results were largely derived under stringent conditions that do not immediately apply to quantum field theory and gravity. Namely, the algebras involved are typically assumed to be of type I, and the existence of conditional expectations are taken as a given. A byproduct of these strong assumptions is that the emergent area operator is pushed into the center of the bulk algebra. As we shall address, the centrality of the area operator is an indication that important quantum gravitational effects are being suppressed. On the other hand, exciting developments in the algebraic approach to quantum field theory and gravity have presented an alternative, purely Lorentzian, derivation of the generalized entropy by means of a mathematical operation called the modular crossed product [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. One remarkable feature of the modular crossed product is that it regulates familiar divergences in the von Neumann entropy of quantum field theories and gravity by appending a new operator to a QFT subregion algebra which plays the role of a regulated area. One might hope that this approach to the generalized entropy is compatible with the quantum error correcting perspective addressed above. Unfortunately, the modular crossed product utilized in this setting does not admit a conditional expectation to the original algebra that was used to construct it. Thus, if there is error correction in this case it is at best approximate. This brings us to the second main application of our non-commutative Bayes’ theorem; it provides an approach to the generalized entropy which bridges the gap between the two points of view here described. Given an inclusion of von Neumann algebras i:N\hookrightarrow M in which M is assumed to be semi-finite, we can use our formalism to express the density operator of a state on M as a non-commutative product of its associated marginal and conditional densities. The entropy of such a state can immediately be factorized into a sum of the ‘entropy’ of the marginal state333This entropy will require careful interpretation if N is a type III algebra. and the expectation value of an operator which, in gravitational contexts, we interpret as the area. In this derivation, the area is a fully quantum object. In fact, we will show that the area is not central unless the state in question belongs to the code-subspace of a conditional expectation. In other words, the area operator becomes central only when exact quantum error correction is allowed. Using this approach, we can reproduce the entropy computations of [22, 23] under the assumption of exact complementary recoverability, and the entropy computations of [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] when the algebra M is the modular crossed product of a type III algebra.444In fact, this approach allows for the generalized entropy to be derived for a more broad set of states than those which are considered in [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. In both cases the expectation value of the area operator computes the quantum conditional entropy, thereby unifying the information theoretic nature of the geometric contribution to the generalized entropy. What’s more, additional contributions to the quantum conditional entropy beyond the classical/exact error correcting case capture quantum gravitational backreaction. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we review the classical version of Bayes’ law and demonstrate how it leads to a factorization of both the entropy and the relative entropy. We introduce the classical data processing inequality, discuss its role in defining sufficient statistics, and identify the classical relative conditional entropy as quantifying the information gap. This section provides a benchmark for the remainder of the note which seeks to upgrade its insights to the context of general von Neumann algebras. In Section 3 we review the necessary mathematical background for deriving our main result. First, we introduce completely positive maps and discuss different special cases which can be understood as quantum notions of conditional expectations including strict conditional expectations and generalized conditional expectations. In Section 3.2 we recall the definition of the Petz dual of a quantum channel, and identify generalized conditional expectations as Petz duals of inclusion maps. This provides a mechanism for factorizing states on arbitrary von Neumann algebras into the composition of a marginal state and a quantum channel. In Section 3.3 we provide an overview of the interplay between Petz dual maps and quantum error correction. We establish that a generalized conditional expectation becomes a strict conditional expectation if and only if it satisfies a modularity property that predicates a large degree of tensor factorizability. This is closely related to exact quantum error correction. By contrast, we regard generalized conditional expectations as giving rise to only partial factorizability of algebras, and by extension approximate quantum error correction. We present Petz’s criterion for the sufficiency of a quantum channel with respect to a family of states. This is naturally related to a saturation of the data processing inequality. Finally, in Section 3.4 we review Connes’ spatial theory for states on von Neumann algebras which is an enhancement of Tomita-Takesaki theory. We describe a generalization of spatial theory which allows us to define the spatial derivative of one completely positive map with respect to another. In Section 4, we derive our main result. Our novel contribution is to develop a chain rule for spatial derivatives which relates the spatial derivative between compositions of completely positive maps to products of the spatial derivatives of the maps being composed. In the special case where we regard states on an algebra M as a composition of a marginal state on N and a quantum channel from M to N, our chain rule allows us to write down a formula for the relative density operator for states on M in terms of the relative density operator of their marginal states on N acted upon adjointly by an operator we define as the relative conditional density. This is the non-commutative form of Bayes’ law. In Section 5, we use our non-commutative Bayes’ law to show that the area term appearing in the generalized entropy formula can be understood as a quantum conditional entropy in both the exact quantum error correcting regime and the modular crossed product for subregion algebras. Building upon this point, we provide an outline as to how our work might be used to enrich our understanding of holographic subregion duality and black hole physics beyond the semiclassical limit. We conclude in Section 6 in which we summarize and contextualize our results, and provide suggestions for future work."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07281v4,The Milky Way accretion history compared to cosmological simulations,"Galactic halos are known to grow hierarchically, inside out. This implies a correlation between the infall lookback time of satellites and their binding energy. Cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between the infall lookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, with a small scatter. Gaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf satellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic energies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites and those of the galaxies that were previously accreted by the Milky Way. This can be compared to cosmological simulations for the first time. The relation of the infall lookback time versus binding energy we found in a cosmological simulation matches that for the early accretion events when the simulated total Milky Way mass within 21 kpc was rescaled to 2 \times\ 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}. This agrees well with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from the rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear outliers to this rescaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In other words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to Sgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them were accreted much later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also found that the subhalo systems in some cosmological simulations are too dynamically hot when they are compared to identified Milky Way substructures. This leads to an overestimated impact of satellites on the Galaxy rotation curve.","In the hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation, structures grow inside out (Gott, 1975). This means that newcomers have lower binding energies than satellites that entered a main galaxy host at early epochs. Because of the host mass growth, first-comers are naturally most strongly bound (Rocha et al., 2012; Boylan-Kolchin et al., 2013). Cosmological simulations recovered a tight linear correlation between the lookback infall time and the logarithm of the binding energy, showing an evolution of more than 1 dex, and with a scatter of only 0.13 dex (Rocha et al., 2012). The slope of this correlation is consistent with the slope estimated for the Milky Way (MW) accretion history. Assuming the MW mass model from Eilers et al. (2019, total mass of 8.3\times 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}), Hammer et al. (2023, see their Fig. 6) determined this relation for the MW. The authors accounted for globular clusters (GCs) associated with the bulge, Kraken, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), and Sgr infall and adopted the associations made by Malhan et al. (2022) and Kruijssen et al. (2020). According to the latter study, these events occurred 12.5\pm0.5, 11.5\pm0.5, 9\pm1, and 5\pm1 Gyr ago, respectively. The relation between their lookback infall time and the logarithm of their binding energy was found to be linear, which agrees with cosmological simulations. The relation was used by Hammer et al. (2023) to infer that the binding energies of MW dwarf galaxies are far lower than the binding energy of GSE GCs (by a factor of 6 on average). This prevented them from having been accreted \sim 9 Gyr ago. Extrapolating the relation from bulge to Sgr GCs toward the dwarf energy regime, Hammer et al. (2023) concluded that most dwarf infall lookback times should be shorter than 3 Gyr. The relation could also constrain the MW mass, because the more massive a galaxy, the deeper its potential well. This allows it to capture satellites with lower binding energies (e.g., Leo I could be bound if the MW were very massive; Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2013). Recent Gaia measurements of the MW rotation curve (RC) provided 8.3\times 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} (Eilers et al., 2019) and 2.06^{+0.24}_{-0.13}\times 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} (Jiao et al., 2023) for an adopted Navarro et al. (1997, Navarro, Frenk & White, hereafter NFW) and Einasto (1965, see also ) mass profile, respectively. However, the NFW mass profile is too shallow in the disk outskirts, and it is rejected at 3\sigma level by RC measurements from the 3rd Gaia data release (hereafter Gaia DR3), which also revealed a decline beyond 19 kpc that is consistent with Keplerian expectations (Wang et al., 2023; Jiao et al., 2023; Ou et al., 2024). The consideration of the MW gravitational potential as being almost equivalent to a point mass111The best-fit Einasto index found by Jiao et al. (2023) is consistent with a Gaussian cutoff of the dark matter density profile. beyond 19 kpc has profoundly impacted the cosmological community, for whom the MW halo-limiting radius was generally assumed to range from 150 to 300 kpc. However, the MW is not entirely axisymmetric or in dynamical equilibrium, as is assumed when resolving the Jeans equation to derive the rotation curve. In particular, the disk shows many substructures, including ridges, warps, and flares, in particular, in its outer range, with different upward or inward velocities, and a significant difference in the stellar rotational velocity above and below the disk (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2021, and references therein). Recently, Koop et al. (2024) suggested that the MW disk is so perturbed by passages of satellites that its rotation curve cannot be used to predict its mass. However, the regularity of the MW rotation curve until \sim19 kpc suggests that nonequilibrium mechanisms are not sufficiently strong to perturb its dynamics significantly, although they could be a serious concern beyond this radius. The goal of this paper is to verify which MW mass can be consistent with the relation between lookback infall time and the binding energy of satellites after we compare the mass to the masses obtained in cosmological simulations. Furthermore, we assess the accretion epoch of dwarf galaxies, and we verify whether satellites may impact the disk stability when they pass near the disk. Section 2 tests the accretion history of the MW, including that of dwarf galaxies, and compares it to the history determined from high-resolution cosmological simulations. Section 3 discusses the pertinence of cosmological simulations for a retrieval of the MW properties and its accretion history, and for identifying whether satellites may have affected its disk dynamics. We then summarize our main conclusions. In this paper, R_{\rm 200c} is the virial radius for which the enclosed DM mass, dubbed M_{\rm 200c}, corresponds to an overdensity of 200 times the critical density. The total mass includes M_{\rm 200c}, to which we added the baryonic component, in a similar way as Eilers et al. (2019). The orbital energies correspond to the addition of the kinetic energy provided by Gaia proper motions and radial velocities with the potential energy of the considered mass distribution. To calculate the potential, we followed Rocha et al. (2012), who assumed that the DM-halo potential rises to zero at 1 Mpc. We therefore assumed that the DM potential associated with a given virial mass M_{\rm 200c} must reach zero at the rescaled radius of 1\,(M_{\rm 200c}/1.4\times 10^{12})^{1/3}\,\rm Mpc, where 1.4 \times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} is the DM-halo mass M_{\rm 200c} of Rocha et al.222The M_{\rm 200c} value was converted from the Rocha et al. (2012) M_{\rm 200m}=1.9\times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}, which corresponds to an overdensity of 200 times the mass density.. The total mass (or potential) is the sum over the DM and the bulge and disk components. As an example, detailed equations are given in Appendix A for an NFW DM-halo component. Figure 1: Relation between the infall lookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, for which black dots represent the subhalos that are associated with the Rocha et al. (2012) simulation, the solid line represents the best fit, and the dashed lines show its one \sigma scatter. The binding energies of dwarf galaxies (blue triangles) and of GCs associated with MW events (red dots with corresponding labels in magenta) are calculated using the observed kinetic energy together with the potential of the main halo. The blue triangles indicate the location of dwarf galaxies with a very good accuracy (<0.1 dex) in binding energy, and for which we adopted the predicted dwarf infall time of Barmentloo & Cautun (2023). Top panel: Relation as derived from the Rocha et al. (2012) dark-matter-only simulations. Bottom panel: Same as the top panel, but we added a baryonic mass (6.2\times\ 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) after a slight rescaling of the dark matter halo mass from 1.4 \times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} to 1.34 \times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} (see Appendix A). In the bottom right corner of the panel, the numbers indicate the predicted time for GCs associated with the bulge, GSE, and Sgr when they are inserted into the halo potential, as well as the probability that they lie in the distribution of simulated subhalos."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07164v1,"Gravitational wave propagation beyond General Relativity: 
geometric optic expansion and lens-induced dispersion","The nature of gravity can be tested by how gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted, detected, and propagate through the universe. Propagation tests are powerful, as small deviations compound over cosmological distances. However, GW propagation tests of theories beyond Einstein’s general relativity (GR) are limited by the high degree of symmetry of the average cosmological spacetime. Deviations from homogeneity, i.e. gravitational lenses, allow for new interactions, e.g., between standard GW polarization and new scalar or vector fields, with different spin. Therefore, GW lensing beyond GR offers novel tests of cosmological gravity. Here we present the theory of GW propagation beyond GR in the short-wave expansion, including corrections to the leading-order amplitude and phase for the first time. As an example, we compute the dispersive (frequency-dependent) corrections to all metric and scalar field perturbations in Brans-Dicke, the simplest modified theory exhibiting GW dispersion. GW lensing effects are too small to observe in Brans-Dicke theories compatible with solar system and binary pulsar limits. Nevertheless, our formalism opens the possibility of novel tests of gravity, including dark-energy theories and screening mechanisms.","Einstein’s General Relativity (GR) has been remarkably successful in describing gravitational phenomena on a wide range of systems, across vastly different scales. However, open questions remain on both extremely small and large scales. Small-scale/high-energy problems of GR include the nature of spacetime singularities and the quantum completion of the theory. On cosmological scales, GR has led to the need to include dark matter and dark energy, accounting for 95% of the universe’s content today [1, 2, 3, 4]. In particular dark energy, responsible for cosmic acceleration [5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 9, 10, 11], could be interpreted as a breakdown of the attractive nature of gravity on the largest scales. This hypothesis has resulted in a widespread investigation of alternative theories [12, 13, 14], as well as an ambitious observational program to test them using cosmological observations [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. The detection of GWs [24] opened a new frontier in the study of gravitational physics, both illuminating the foundations of GR and casting away alternative theories to the shadows. Observed GW signals are emitted by relativistic compact objects, thus probing the regime of strong-field and dynamical gravity [25, 26, 27]. In addition to emission, GW propagation across the universe are highly sensitive to other properties of gravity, such as the GW speed [28] and the graviton mass [29]. GW propagation tests probe gravitational interactions directly and can achieve high sensitivity, as anomalous effects accumulate over cosmological distances. Most crucially, they apply directly to theories that modify cosmological dynamics, constraining many dark-energy theories [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. Many GW propagation tests, including measuring the anomalous speed and amplitude, are limited by require an electromagnetic counterpart or otherwise determining the redshift of the source. Moreover, only a handful of effects exist on the homogeneous and isotropic Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological background [42, 43] that describes the average universe. GW propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes, i.e. GW lensing, drastically extend the range of phenomena that can be used to test gravity. The basic principle is that lenses/inhomogeneities break the FRW symmetries, allowing interactions between fields of different spin. In alternative theories, this means that the GR standard degrees of freedom (d.o.f.), the +,\times metric polarizations, mix with new fields such as scalars or vectors. In addition to the many gravitational lensing effects in GR [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57], lens-induced effects provide a powerful discriminant between theories through novel wave-optic pheonomena. Interactions with new fields involving two derivatives cause lens-induced birefringence (LIB), a difference in speed between the + and \times components of GWs [58]. The absence of birefringence in GW data provided constraints on cosmological theories of gravity comparable to those based on the GW speed [59]. Related birefringent effects are predicted in strong gravitational fields in GR [60, 52, 53], as well as in parity-violating theories [61]. Although progress has been made to characterize GW lensing beyond GR [58, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], computational difficulties and the wide landscape of theories have prevented a systematic characterization of these phenomena. One of the ways in which the theory of GW lensing beyond GR needs to be developed is by including frequency-dependent propagation effects. Most analyses rely on the geometric optics (GO) approximation [67, 63, 62, 68, 69, 60, 70, 71], which holds when the signal’s wavelength is significantly smaller than the local curvature scale, the i.e. short-wave approximation. In this regime, GWs travel along null geodesics, and their polarization is parallel-transported along them [60, 69, 51]. Corrections beyond geometric optics (bGO) [72, 73, 74, 75, 55, 76] include lens-induced dispersion (LID) on GW signals. Such modifications, by the nature of the short-wave approximation, are frequency-dependent and can be probed by GW interferometers.The characterization of the bGO regime beyond GR remains an open problem. A significant step forward was the first explicit computation of bGO corrections in GR [72, 73], showing how bGO effects modify the amplitude and phase of GWs and discussing the emergence of apparent additional scalar polarizations modes, absent in the geometric optics limit. GW lensing beyond GR offers potential for even richer phenomena due to the presence of additional degrees of freecom [77]. In this work, we extend the study of GW lensing beyond GR, developing a formalism that incorporates bGO corrections that describe dispersive phenomena. For simplicity, we focus on the Brans-Dicke theory as an example of scalar-tensor models [78, 79]. Using the short-wave expansion approximation, we compute the bGO corrections to the leading-order scalar observables for tensor and scalar waves passing through a point-like gravitational lens. The work is organized as follows: In Sec. II we will introduce a general framework describing the full-propagation of the gravitational and scalar radiation. By employing the short-wave approximation we will show the general equations, order by order in the expansion parameter, the equations governing the geometric optics regime and the first corrections to it. Sec. III will be devoted to review calculations for GR, thus introducing the null-tetrad formalism and thereby presenting the geometric and beyond geometric optics equations and the respective formal solutions for the gravitational radiation. In Sec. IV we will present the full propagation in the BD theory and show the solution in the geometric optics regime of the leading-order scalar and tensor amplitude. Then we will present, for the first time up to our knowledge, the general expression describing beyond geometric optics (bGO) corrections. In Sec. V, we will explicitly evaluate the dispersive bGO corrections, analytically, in the special case of a point-like lens, reviewing the GR case shown in Ref. [73] and subsequently extending to BD.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07147v1,Thermodynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Black Holes and Ensemble-averaged Theory,"In this paper, using the ensemble-averaged theory, we define the thermodynamic free energy of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. This approach derives the gravitational partition function by incorporating non-saddle geometries besides the classical solutions. Unlike the sharp transition points seen in free energy calculated via saddle-point approximation, the ensemble-averaged free energy plotted against temperature shows a smoother behavior, suggesting that black hole phase transitions may be viewed as a small-G_{N} (Newton’s gravitational constant) limit of the ensemble theory. This is similar to the behavior of black hole solutions in Einstein’s gravity theory in AdS spacetime. We have obtained an expression for the quantum-corrected free energy for EGB-AdS black holes, and in the six-dimensional case, we observe a well-defined local minimum after the transition temperature which was absent in the earlier analysis of the classical free energy landscape. Furthermore, we expand the ensemble-averaged free energy in powers of G_{N} to identify non-classical contributions. Our findings indicate that the similarities in the thermodynamic behavior between five-dimensional EGB-AdS and Reissner-Nordström-AdS (RN-AdS) black holes, as well as between six-dimensional EGB-AdS and Schwarzschild-AdS black holes, extend beyond the classical regime.","The thermodynamics of black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetime holds a unique position within the study of quantum gravity, as it interlaces principles from gravitation, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics. A notable example is the AdS/CFT correspondence, a powerful framework that enables the study of gravitational systems via dual quantum field theories. Within this framework, the Hawking-Page phase transition—a first-order transition between radiation and black hole states in Schwarzschild-AdS black holes immersed in a thermal bath Hawking (1983)—finds a dual interpretation. This transition corresponds to the confinement/deconfinement phase transition in a quark-gluon plasma within the boundary quantum field theory Witten (1998). Such insights from AdS/CFT have significantly expanded our understanding of quantum gravity and provide an avenue to address the black hole information paradox. Furthermore, the negative cosmological constant characterizing the AdS spacetime gives rise to complex phase structures, a field now known as black hole chemistry Kubiznak et al. (2017). Through this framework, the holographic duality extends from black holes to conformal field theories (CFT) Maldacena (1998); Witten (1998), to phenomena in quantum chromodynamics Kovtun et al. (2005), and even to condensed matter systems, particularly those with strong coupling Hartnoll et al. (2008, 2007). When a black hole is treated as a thermal system, drawing analogies with conventional thermodynamics in any diffeomorphism-invariant gravity theory is straightforward. However, the microscopic description of the black hole event horizon, and the related phase transition behavior is formidable. Despite extensive progress in black hole thermodynamics, the statistical foundation of these phase transitions remains elusive. Although the thermal properties of black holes in classical geometry are well understood, developing a full statistical framework is ongoing. The Euclidean path integral method, with a partition function approach, presents a promising avenue Gibbons and Hawking (1977); Gibbons et al. (1978); Hawking (1978). Yet, integrating quantum gravity effects within this framework remains a complex task. In the path integral formulation of gravity, the saddle point approximation identifies action extrema, corresponding to the global minimum of the on-shell Euclidean action. While on-shell geometries provide insights into classical black hole thermodynamics, off-shell geometries must be considered to fully capture the subtleties of black hole phase transitions. Recent work has explored the ensemble-averaged description of black hole thermodynamics by including non-classical contributions to the path integral Cheng et al. (2024, 2024). Inclusion of non-saddle contributions to the partition function results modified expression for the free energy and one does not observe a sharp phase transition point. In this construction, the black hole phase transition is interpreted as the small G_{N} limit of ensemble averaged theory. In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics of EGB-AdS black holes beyond the classical limit by applying the ensemble-averaged theory. EGB theory is the natural extension of general relativity with higher-curvature contributions Lovelock (1971). Also, it presents a rich thermodynamic structure. Notably, the thermodynamic behavior of five-dimensional EGB black holes resembles that of Reissner-Nordström-AdS black holes, while six-dimensional EGB black holes share similarities with Schwarzschild-AdS black holes. However, these correspondences have been explored only within the classical limit. Here, we extend this analysis to examine whether these thermodynamic parallels persist beyond the classical framework. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II, we examine the classical thermodynamics of black holes in a generic D-dimensional EGB-AdS spacetime. Sec.III extends this analysis using the ensemble-averaged theory, evaluating the gravitational partition function by including non-saddle geometries, in contrast to the usual approach that relies on the saddle-point approximation. We present numerical results for the ensemble-averaged free energy of five- and six-dimensional EGB-AdS black holes for various values of G_{N}. In Sec.IV, we expand the free energy in powers of G_{N} and identify the quantum corrections at subleading and sub-subleading orders. Finally, in Sec.V, we discuss our findings and conclude."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07060v1,Running Hubble constant: evolutionary Dark Energy,"We discuss an evolutionary dark energy model, based on the presence of non-equilibrium effects on the dark energy constituents, which are described via a bulk viscosity contribution. We implement the proposed dynamics by the analysis of the 40-bins Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) Pantheon sample data, in order to outline the existence of a running Hubble constant with the redshift. Via a fitting procedure, we determine the value of the additional parameter that our model possesses with respect a standard \Lambda Cold Dark Matter (\LambdaCDM) scenario. As important result, the evolutionary dark energy proposal seems more appropriate to describe the binned SN analysis with respect to the \LambdaCDM Hubble parameter, i.e. a non running value for the Hubble constant over the bins.","References (1) Eleonora Di Valentino, Olga Mena, Supriya Pan, Luca Visinelli, Weiqiang Yang, Alessandro Melchiorri, David F.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07045v1,The effective speed of sound in cosmological perturbation theory,"In a multi-field/fluid cosmological system consisting of a number of minimally coupled canonical scalar fields, non-canonical scalar fields and barotropic perfect fluids, we introduce a new definition of effective speed of sound of the entire system for describing the evolution of cosmological perturbations. This effective speed of sound is not just gauge invariant but also a background dependent quantity and therefore can be treated as a parameter to quantify perturbations in such multi-field/fluid systems. It is with this effective speed that the gauge invariant Bardeen potential and the curvature perturbation propagate at scales much smaller than the sound horizon. Further, the effective speed of sound defined in this paper generalizes the one defined by Garriga and Mukhanov for a single non-canonical scalar field to a system consisting of many minimally coupled barotropic perfect fluids, canonical and non-canonical scalar fields. Moreover, just like in the case of a single pure-kinetic non-canonical scalar field, this effective speed of the sound of the total system turns out to be identically equal to the total adiabatic speed of sound when the dynamic of the universe is driven by a number of pure kinetic non-canonical scalar fields making such a system tantamount to a system of equivalent multi barotropic perfect fluids. We also derive a set of equations which governs the evolution of perturbations in a general multi-field/fluid universe containing barotropic perfect fluids, canonical and non-canonical scalar fields. Using these equations we show that, in the large scale limit (k=0 scales), if the perturbations are initially adiabatic, then it continues to remain so at that scales throughout the evolution of the universe. Consequently, at that scales, such multi-field/fluid universe dynamically behaves as if it contains only a single barotropic perfect fluid.","Within the framework of Einstein’s general theory of relativity, the current understanding of the evolution of the universe, from inflationary epoch to the present accelerated expansion phase, is reasonably well established and is in concordance with the observational data [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The expansion of the universe is driven by different components at various stages of its evolution. Scalar field drives the inflationary phase [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] followed by the radiation and cold dark matter dominated expansion phase which can be described as barotropic perfect fluids. By definition, barotropic perfect fluids are perfect fluids whose pressure is only a function of energy density at the background as well at all orders of perturbations [16, 17]. The nature of dark energy [18, 19, 20], driving the late time accelerated expansion of the universe, is not well understood, however, many models of dark energy such as cosmological constant and scalar field dark energy etc. are viable as far as observational data are concerned [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Scalar fields having standard form of the lagrangian are classified as canonical scalars whereas those having a lagrangian which is a general function of the kinetic term X=(1/2)\partial_{\mu}\phi\partial^{\mu}\phi and the scalar field \phi are classified as non-canonical scalars [27]. Non-canonical scalar field have widely been studied to model inflation [28, 29] and also as a model of dark energy driving the late time accelerated expansion of the Universe [30, 31]. Unlike the canonical scalar field models of inflation with monomial power law potentials of the form V(\phi)=V_{0}\phi^{n}, non-canonical scalar field models with \mathcal{L}=X^{\alpha}-V_{0}\phi^{n}, where \alpha and n are constants, can leads to observationally viable values for scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio for integral values of n such as n=2 and n=4 [32, 33]. This is possible in non-canonical scalar field models because of it smaller speed of sound which consequently lowers the tensor-to-scaler ratio to a value well within the observational bounds [34, 35, 36]. Further, non-canonical scalar can also drive the late time accelerated expansion of the universe [37] and can also provide a unified description of dark matter and dark energy [38, 39, 40]. However, it is impossible to uniquely determine the fundamental nature of the non-canonical lagrangian merely from cosmological observations as two different non-canonical scalar fields models can leads to same observational effects [41]. For each type of matter content of the Universe, one can define an equation of state parameter w as the ratio of the pressure to the energy density. It is also possible to define the equation of state parameter of the total system consisting of different types of matter content in the universe. Once the equation of state parameter and its evolution is known, the rate of expansion of the universe can be determined from Friedmann equations. In addition to w, the effective speed of sound of matter content is an important parameter which determines the evolutions of perturbations in cosmological perturbation theory. For barotropic perfect fluids, the effective speed of sound is related to the equation of state parameter whereas for canonical scalars, it is identically equal to unity [42]. For non-canonical scalars, the effective speed of sound can take any value depending on the form of its lagrangian [27]. In a multi-fluid/field system, although, it is possible to define the effective speed of sound of each matter content separately, it is not known how, in a similar way, one can define an effective speed of sound of the total system. In cosmological perturbation theory, simply defining the square of speed of sound as the ratio of perturbation in pressure \delta p to that in energy density \delta\rho does not work in all cases. This is because both \delta p and \delta\rho are gauge depended quantities and in the case of scalar fields, the gauge in which \delta\rho=0 does not coincide with the gauge in which \delta p=0. Consequently, the speed of sound defined as \delta p/\delta\rho becomes infinite in that gauge and therefore this definition of speed of sound being gauge dependent is ambiguous. The speed of sound must depend on the property of matter not on the choice of gauge. One therefore defines the speed of sound as ratio of a gauge invariant pressure perturbation to the corresponding gauge invariant perturbation in energy density [41]. The speed of sound thus defined for a single scalar field or barotropic perfect fluid is not just gauge invariant but also a background depended quantity. In the case of multi-field system, it is possible to define an effective speed of sound as the ratio of pressure perturbation to the energy density perturbation in the comoving gauge [43, 44, 45]. However, this defines the speed of sound in a particular gauge and it also a space depended quantity. We, in this paper, introduces a new definition of the effective speed of sound of a multi-field/fluid driven universe which is not just gauge invariant but space independent (or k independent) and a background dependent quantity. Being a background dependent quantity, it can be treated as a parameter to quantify cosmological perturbations in a single or multi-field/fluid driven universe. This paper is organized as follows. In the following section we briefly review the first order cosmological perturbation with scalar degree of perturbations. All the quantities required to describe scalar degree of cosmological perturbations, their corresponding gauge invariant quantities and the equations governing their evolutions are described in that section. In Sec. III, we discuss the evolution of cosmological perturbation when the dynamics of the universe is driven by a single matter content which could be a barotropic perfect fluid or a scalar field (canonical or non-canonical scalar field. In that section, the effective speed of sound is introduced by considering the fact the relation between the quantities describing the matter perturbation must be independent of the choice of gauge. This analysis is extended in the case of a two-fluid/field driven Universe in Sec. IV and further extended to the multi-fluid/field system in Sec. V. In Sec. VI, the evolution curvature perturbation in the multi-fluid/field system is described and it is shown that at small scales it satisfies a wave equation with same speed of sound defined in Sec. V. A closed set of equations governing the evolution of perturbations in a multi-fluid/field driven universe is described in Sec. VII . Further, in Sec. VIII, it is shown that, in a multi-fluid/field system, if the perturbations are adiabatic at the super horizon scales, it will remain so throughout the evolution of the universe. In Sec. IX, the evolution of effective speed of sound in unified dark sector models are discussed. Finally in Sec. X, the main results of this paper are summarised. The conventions and the notations used in this paper are as follow. All the cosmological perturbations are described on a spatially flat Freidmann Robertson Walker metric with the metric signature (+, - , - , -).

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06988v1,Solution of Einstein Field Equations for Anisotropic Matter with Vanishing Complexity: Spacetime Metric Satisfying Karmarkar Condition and Conformally Flat Geometry,The solution of Einstein’s field equations for static spherically symmetric spacetime metric with anisotropic internal stresses has been obtained. The matter has vanishing complexity and a spacetime metric that satisfies the Karmarkar condition and is conformally flat. It has been noted that there is only one solution that meets these three conditions. This has been shown as a proof of the theorem.,"In 2018, Herrera [1] introduced a novel definition of complexity for the static spherically symmetric self-gravitating fluid distribution. Andrade and Andrade [2] examined the complexity factor in gravitational decoupling with minimal geometric deformation. Sharif and Tariq [3] have investigated the solution of Einstein-Maxwell field equations for the evaluation of self-gravitating system. The static anisotropic stellar models with vanishing complexity have been studied by Contreras et. al. [4] , Bogadi et. al. [5] , Rej et. al. [6] , Das et. al. [7] and Das et. al. [8]. The embedding problem is of geometrical significance, which was first discussed by Schlai [9] . The first isometric embedding theorem was proposed by Nash [10] . In order to embed a 4-dimensional spacetime metric in a 5-dimensional Euclidean space, Karmarkar [11] derived the condition that includes curvature components. This spacetime metric is said to be class-I. The models satisfying the Karmarkar condition attracted the attention of many researchers, viz., Maurya et. al. [12] , Bhar et. al. [13] , Maurya et. al. [14] , Francisco et. al. [15] , Ratanpal et. al. [16]. If all components of the Weyl tensor are zero, the spacetime metric is regarded as conformally flat. The conformally flat spacetime can be found in the work of Herrera et. al. [17] , Manjonjo et. al.[18] and Manjonjo et. al.[19]. In this work, we investigated a solution for a static spherically symmetric anisotropic fluid distribution with vanishing complexity and a spacetime metric that satisfies the Karmarkar condition and is conformally flat. The work is organised as follows: Section 2 contains a description of the complexity factor, the Karmarkar condition, and the conformally flat spacetime metric. Section 3 describes the solution for interior static spherically symmetric stellar structure with vanishing complexity as well as spacetime metric satisfying Karmarkar condition and is conformally flat. We concluded the work in Section 4."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06975v1,Comment on “Attractor solutions in scalar-field cosmology” and “How many -folds should we expect from high-scale inflation?”,"It was claimed in Ref. Remmen:2013 that in the spatially flat cosmological case there exists a unique conserved measure (up to normalization) on the effective phase space (\phi,\dot{\phi}) for scalar-field with m^{2}\phi^{2} potential through the proof of the existence of a unique solution to the differential equation (44) with a unique physical solution in the low-energy limit. Moreover, in Ref. Remmen:2014 it was also claimed that a unique physical solution to the same differential equation was found in the high-energy limit. In this comment, we reexamine these claims. We obtain general physical solutions to the equation (44) both in the low-energy and high-energy limit, which include the asymptotic solutions in Ref. Remmen:2013 and Ref. Remmen:2014 as special cases. Therefore, we conclude that following the constructions in Ref. Remmen:2013 there actually exist infinitely many conserved measures for the scalar-field with m^{2}\phi^{2} potential.","I General solution to Eq. (44) in Ref. Remmen:2013 in the low-energy limit On spatially flat Friedmann-Robterson-Walker background, the cosmological dynamics of general relativity with scalar field potential V(\phi)=m^{2}\phi^{2} can be studied in the two dimensional phase space \left(\phi,\dot{\phi}\right) in which \dot{\phi}\equiv\frac{d\phi}{dt} with t the proper time. The Hamiltonian flow vector field is given by v^{a}=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)^{a}. Denoting x\equiv\phi,y\equiv\dot{\phi}, the measure on phase space \left(x,y\right) is a two-form \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ab} that can be written as \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ab}=f\left(x,y\right)(\mathrm{d}x)_{a}\wedge(\mathrm{d}y)% _{b} (1) for some function f. Conservation of the measure along v^{a} is provided by \mathcal{L}_{v}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ab}=0,which can be expressed as \nabla_{a}\left(fv^{a}\right)=0. (2) Figure 1: Solutions for the Klein-Gordon equation \ddot{\phi}+\sqrt{\frac{3\kappa}{2}}\sqrt{\dot{\phi}^{2}+m^{2}\phi^{2}}\dot{% \phi}+m^{2}\phi=0. Solid lines denote the attractive separatrices which approach \dot{\phi}=\pm\sqrt{\frac{2}{3\kappa}}m at large field values. Plots are in (\phi,\dot{\phi}) space, in units where \kappa=1 and m=0.25M_{\text{Pl}}. As seen from Fig. (1), all trajectories converge at the origin (x=0,y=0), therefore, to describe the dynamics, it is convenient to reparametrize the vector field in terms of polar coordinates \left(r,\theta\right) defined by \displaystyle r \displaystyle= \displaystyle\sqrt{y^{2}+m^{2}x^{2}}, \displaystyle x \displaystyle= \displaystyle\phi=\frac{r}{m}\cos\theta,\qquad y=\dot{\phi}=r\sin\theta. (3) Then, the measure can be written as \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ab}=\frac{fr}{m}(\mathrm{d}r)_{a}\wedge(\mathrm{d}\theta)% _{b}. (4) Using the the equations \displaystyle\frac{\partial r}{\partial t} \displaystyle= \displaystyle-3Hr\sin^{2}\theta, (5) \displaystyle\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial t} \displaystyle= \displaystyle-\left(m+3H\sin\theta\cos\theta\right). (6) in which H is the Hubble parameter and \dot{r}\equiv\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{d}t}. The Hamiltonian flow vector field can be expressed as \small\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)^{a}=-3rH\sin^{2}\theta\left(% \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\right)^{a}-\left(m+3H\sin\theta\cos\theta\right)% \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\right)^{a}. (7) Thus, Eq. (2) can be expressed as \frac{3\sin^{2}\theta}{r}\frac{\left(\partial Hr^{2}f\right)}{\partial r}+% \frac{\partial\left[f\left(m+3H\sin\theta\cos\theta\right)\right]}{\partial% \theta}=0. (8) Using the Friedmann equation \displaystyle H^{2}=\frac{\kappa}{6}r^{2} (9) where \kappa=8\pi G and noticing that in an expanding Universe H=\sqrt{\frac{\kappa}{6}}r, Eq. (8) becomes \frac{\sin^{2}\theta}{r}\frac{\partial\left(r^{3}f\right)}{\partial r}+\frac{% \partial\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3\kappa}}mf+r\sin\theta\cos\theta f\right)}{% \partial\theta}=0, (10) which is Eq. (44) obtained in Ref. Remmen:2013 . In the low-energy limit r\rightarrow 0, we have \sqrt{\frac{2}{3\kappa}}\frac{m}{r}\gg 1, Eq. (10) is approximated by \frac{\sin^{2}\theta}{r}\frac{\partial\left(r^{3}f\right)}{\partial r}+\sqrt{% \frac{2}{3\kappa}}m\frac{\partial f}{\partial\theta}=0, (11) which has the solution f=\frac{1}{r^{3}}\Psi\left(\alpha\right), (12) in which \alpha\equiv\theta-\frac{1}{2}\sin(2\theta)+2\sqrt{\frac{2}{3\kappa}}\frac{m}{r} (13) and \Psi\left(\alpha\right) denotes an arbitrary function of the variable \alpha. Moreover, as can be deduced from Eq. (10), this equation remains unchanged under the transformation \theta\rightarrow\theta+\pi (or (x,y)\rightarrow(-x,-y)), which implies that the solution should also be symmetric under this transformation. Hence, \Psi(\alpha) should be a periodic function with period \pi. Using Eq. (4), the measure becomes \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ab}=\frac{\Psi(\alpha)}{mr^{2}}(\mathrm{d}r)_{a}\wedge(% \mathrm{d}\theta)_{b}. (14) The other way to obtain the approximate solution in Eq. (14) is as follows. We parameterize the trajectories in the phase space (\phi,\dot{\phi}) using the variables (\beta,t) such that \beta is a constant along each trajectory, i.e.,\mathcal{L}_{v}\beta=0. According to \mathcal{L}_{v}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ab}=0, the measure \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ab} satisfies \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ab}\propto(\mathrm{d}\beta)_{a}\wedge(\mathrm{d}t)_{b}. (15) \beta can be expressed as a function of r and \theta, which satisfies \frac{\mathrm{d}\beta}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{\partial r}{\partial t}\frac{% \partial\beta}{\partial r}+\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial t}\frac{\partial% \beta}{\partial\theta}=0. (16) It is easy to check that in the low-energy limit \frac{\mathrm{d}\alpha}{\mathrm{d}t}=0, hence, we find that in the low-energy limit \beta=\Phi(\alpha) where \Phi(\alpha) is an arbitrary function of \alpha, thus we have \displaystyle(\mathrm{d}\beta)_{a}\wedge(\mathrm{d}t)_{b} \displaystyle\propto \displaystyle\Phi^{\prime}(\alpha)\left(\frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial r}\frac% {\partial t}{\partial\theta}-\frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial\theta}\frac{% \partial t}{\partial r}\right)(\mathrm{d}r)_{a}\wedge(\mathrm{d}\theta)_{b} (17) \displaystyle= \displaystyle\frac{4\sqrt{2}\Phi^{\prime}(\alpha)}{\sqrt{3\kappa}r^{2}}(% \mathrm{d}r)_{a}\wedge(\mathrm{d}\theta)_{b}. Comparing Eq. (17) with Eq. (14), we find \Phi^{\prime}(\alpha)\propto\Psi(\alpha). A conserved measure \boldsymbol{\omega}_{a} on the space of trajectories can be constructed from the phase space measure by defining \boldsymbol{\omega}_{a}\equiv\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ab}v^{b}, then obviously we have \mathcal{L}_{v}\boldsymbol{\omega}_{a}=0, and it is not difficult to show that on any surface transverse to those trajectories \int_{\mathcal{S}}\boldsymbol{\omega}_{a}=\int_{\mathcal{S}^{\prime}}% \boldsymbol{\omega}_{a}=\int_{\mathcal{S}}\boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}}_{a}=\int% _{\mathcal{S}^{\prime}}\boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}}^{\prime}_{a}, (18) in which the surfaces \mathcal{S} and \mathcal{S}^{\prime} are passed through by the same bunch of trajectories only once, and measure \boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}}_{a} and \boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}}^{\prime}_{a} represent respectively the restriction of \boldsymbol{\omega}_{a} on \mathcal{S} and \mathcal{S}^{\prime}. Considering two concentric circles \mathcal{C} and \mathcal{C}^{\prime} (centered at the origin of the space (mx,y)) with radius r and r^{\prime} respectively, since all of the phase space orbits pass through \mathcal{C} or \mathcal{C}^{\prime} only once, using Eq. (18) and (4), we have \oint_{\mathcal{C}^{\prime}}\boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}^{\prime}}_{a}=\oint_{% \mathcal{C}}\boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}}_{a}=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{1}{m}\sqrt{% \frac{3\kappa}{2}}fr^{3}\sin^{2}\theta d\theta. (19) With suitable normalization constant A, we define P(\theta,r)\equiv\frac{A}{m}\sqrt{\frac{3\kappa}{2}}fr^{3}\sin^{2}\theta (20) as the probability distribution function. Substituting the result in Eq. (12) into Eq. (19), we find that in the low-energy limit the integral becomes 1=\int_{0}^{2\pi}P(\theta,r)d\theta=\sqrt{\frac{3\kappa}{2}}\frac{A}{m}\int_{0% }^{\pi}\Psi(\alpha)d\alpha, (21) therefore, to obtain a well defined probability distribution function, \Psi(\alpha) should also be a positive definite function and the integral of \Psi(\alpha) over a period must be finite. Substituting (12) into Eq. (10), we obtain the solution of f, \displaystyle f=\frac{1}{r^{3}} \displaystyle\Bigg{[}\Psi\left(\alpha\right)\left(1-\sqrt{\frac{3\kappa}{2}}% \frac{r}{m}\sin\theta\cos\theta\right) (22) \displaystyle~{}-\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3\kappa}{2}}\frac{r}{m}\sin^{4}\theta% \Sigma\left(\alpha\right)+\mathcal{O}\Bigg{]}, in which A\in\mathbb{R}, \Sigma\left(\alpha\right)\equiv\frac{\mathrm{d}\Psi\left(\alpha\right)}{% \mathrm{d}\alpha} and \mathcal{O} contains higher order terms of \sqrt{\frac{3\kappa}{2}}\frac{r}{m}. In Ref. Remmen:2013 , the authors assumed that in the low-energy limit \frac{\partial f}{\partial\theta}=0, using this assumption, they claimed to obtain a unique solution (see Eq. (53) in Ref. Remmen:2013 ): f\rightarrow B\left(\frac{1}{r^{3}}-\sqrt{\frac{3\kappa}{2}}\frac{r}{m}\sin% \theta\cos\theta\right), (23) where B\in\mathbb{R}. Then, according to the Cauchy-Kowalevski theorem Kowalevski:2009 ; Nandakumaran:2020 , there exists a unique analytic solution to the evolution equation (10). Comparing the solution (23) with our solution , we find that when \Psi(\alpha)=C (where C\in\mathbb{R}) the solution (23) can be reproduced. However, the assumption \frac{\partial f}{\partial\theta}=0 in the low-energy limit is too restrictive. To observe this, we rewrite Eq. (11) as \left(\sqrt{\frac{3\kappa}{2}}\frac{r}{m}\sin^{2}\theta\right)r\frac{\partial(% r^{3}f)}{\partial r}+\frac{\partial(r^{3}f)}{\partial\theta}=0. (24) In the low-energy limit, although the prefactor \sqrt{\frac{3\kappa}{2}}\frac{r}{m}\sin^{2}\theta\ll 1, r\frac{\partial(r^{3}f)}{\partial r} may be large, causing the first term comparable to the second term on the left hand side of Eq. (24). Indeed, as we see from Eq. (12) and (13), any \Psi(\alpha) can satisfy this condition. Then, according to the Cauchy-Kowalevski theorem, there exist infinitely many analytic solutions to the evolution equation (10)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06957v1,Orthogonal splitting in degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories,"We explore a comprehensive analysis of the formalism governing the gravitational field equations in degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories. The propagation of these theories in the vacuum has a maximum of three degrees of freedom and is at most quadratic in the second derivative of the scalar field. We investigate the gravitational field equation for spherically symmetric anisotropic matter content along with its non-conserved equations. Our analysis focuses on the evaluation of structure scalars to assess their behavior under Einstein’s modification. We present a realistic mass contribution that sheds light on both geometric mass and total energy budget evaluations for celestial objects. Ultimately, we discuss two viable models restricted as minimal complexity and conformal flatness to enhance the scientific contribution of the present manuscript.","The theory of General Relativity (GR) einstein1915feldgleichungen ; bonnor1981junction ; scientific2016tests provides an all-encompassing explanation for the nature of space, gravity and matter. The basic principles of the structure and geometry of spacetime are covered by GR. The Friedmann equations, derived from the Einstein field equations, depict how the universe evolves in a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime. The conventional model of the early universe, which involves epochs dominated by radiation giudice2001largest and matter freese2002cardassian ; kokubu2018effect , can be adequately explained through GR. Modern astrophysics has brought to our attention the undeniable fact that a significant amount of “dark matter” and “dark energy” huterer1999prospects ; padmanabhan2003cosmological ; amendola2010dark exist. These mysterious entities are necessary for justifying observable cosmic dynamics farajollahi2011cosmic ; sami2012cosmological and large-scale structures tegmark2004cosmological ; springel2006large ; carrasco2012effective . Without them, we may continually face a gap between theories and observations. Therefore, acknowledging this discovery leads us towards understanding the fundamental principles of the cosmos in an entirely different level. New approaches for classifying increasingly complex alternative theories to Einstein’s are needed for better analysis. With the inclusion of extra degrees of freedom, modified Einstein models have become harder to analyze. Therefore, it has become essential to develop new techniques that can classify these diverse models and make them more manageable. This can also help us to grasp the attributes of the theory, problems that might arise, and its observable effects. In short, it may enhance our insight into the prevailing alternative theories of gravity capozziello2008extended ; capozziello2011extended ; astashenok2015extreme . For creating models of inflation and dark energy, a scalar tensor theories (STT) bronnikov1973scalar ; goenner2012some of gravity could be considered helpful. These theories have been widely used in attempts to get beyond GR because of their simplicity. Horndeski rabochaya2016note ; ogawa2020relativistic developed STT by combining Lagrangian with a scalar field. This scalar field involves a second-order derivative. Also, it has the constraint that the Euler-Lagrange equations cannot exceed second order. These are four-dimensional theories that describe a scalar interacting with a spin-2 tensor field. According to these theories, the metric interacts with an additional scalar degree of freedom, which could promote cosmic expansion. Scalar fields combined with gravitational fields make up non-minimally coupled and higher-order components through conformal transformations maeda1989towards ; capozziello1998recovering ; gottlober1990sixth ; crisostomi2016extended . Regarding velocities, the Hessian matrix of the Lagrangian is referred to as “degenerate.” A degenerate Hessian matrix suggests that there are main limitations since the system of momenta cannot be reversed. The “Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor Theories” (DHOST) were presented by Langlois and Noui langlois2016degenerate . Second-order derivatives of the scalar field are permitted by DHOST theories. These theories permit higher-order Euler-Lagrange equations, and they must only have one scalar degree of freedom in order to prevent Ostrogradski instabilities. These instabilities are frequently observed in systems with higher-order time derivatives. Furthermore, they are connected with additional degrees of freedom (ADF). Crisostomi et al. crisostomi2019cosmological examined cosmic solutions and the factors that affect their stability in DHOST theory. Moreover, they investigated the fixed points of dynamics and identified the prerequisites for the presence of a de-Sitter attractor in late times. In modified gravity models defined by DHOST theories, Boumaza et al. boumaza2020late investigated the late cosmic development from the non-relativistic matter-dominated period to the dark energy era. Additionally, they determined the areas of parameter space where the models exhibit perturbation stability. Thipaksorn and Karwan thipaksorn2022cosmic addressed the cosmic evolution using the fixed points from the dynamical analysis of the scaling DHOST theory. They determined that these theories also meet the condition that the gravitational wave propagation speed is equal to the speed of light. Furthermore, gravitational waves (GW) do not decay to dark energy disturbances in addition to the scaling solutions. Langlois langlois2019dark considered the self-gravitating objects in the context of DHOST theories. Moreover, he observed that these theories could be an efficient approach to explain the dark energy in cosmology. Achour et al. achour2020hairy analyzed the prospect of exploring new areas of the solution space of DHOST theories through the implementation of disformal field redefinitions. Furthermore, they evaluated various novel solutions. These solutions include asymptotically locally flat black holes with a deficit solid angle and stealth solutions. In addition to the traditional Einstein-Hilbert term, Langlois langlois2021quadratic found a surprisingly simple reformulation of quadratic DHOST theories. These theories are based on a Lagrangian, including a few geometrical terms related to the three-dimensional constant hypersurfaces. Boumaza and Langlois boumaza2022neutron investigated the neutron stars in the context of DHOST theories. In order to explain the equation of state of the neutron star matter, they employed many equations of state. In each instance, they numerically estimated the neutron star profile using arbitrary values of energy density and modified gravity parameters. Frusciante et al. frusciante2019tracker examined quadratic DHOST theories that meet degeneracy conditions. He chose this theory to avoid Ostrogradsky instability, constraining GW speed and determining the bound on the decay of GW to dark energy perturbations. Furthermore, they generated the most generic Lagrangians capable of reproducing tracking and scaling characteristics individually. In the quadratic DHOST theories, Takahashi and Motohashi takahashi2021black investigated perturbations regarding the stealth Schwarzschild-de-Sitter solution. In addition to that, they investigated the sound speed in the neighborhood of the black hole (BH). Subsequently, they discovered that the gradient instability manifests itself in either the radial or angular direction. Chen et al. chen2021testing investigated the disformal Kerr BH frequency in quadratic DHOST using the relativistic precession model. Moreover, they found out that there is an almost negative disformal parameter in the range of 1. They do so under some restrictions and keeping in mind the GRO J1655-40 observational data. On cosmic scales, the complexity factor is particularly significant for self-gravitating systems. These systems exhibit a variety of properties that have been extensively researched, including energy density, pressure, stability, mass-radius ratio, and brightness. To explore the complexity of the stellar structure the probability distribution has been reformulated in the form of energy density sanudo2009complexity ; de2012entropy . However, energy density alone is insufficient to characterize complexity since the primary factor pressure component of the energy-momentum tensor, which is critical in the development of self-gravitating systems, is lacking herrera2018new . Herrera herrera2009structure conducted the study of self-gravitating relativistic fluids with spherical symmetry in a systematic manner. The approach relies on scalar functions that are obtained from the orthogonal separation of the Riemann tensor. According to this, the total number of scalars are five for dissipative and anisotropic fluids, which can be reduced to two when considering dissipationless dust or static anisotropic fluids. Furthermore, only one scalar remains for static isotropic fluids. Also, a new notion of complexity has been presented by him herrera2018new for relativistic fluid distributions with static spherically symmetric properties. The underlying premise assumes that a less complex system pertains to a homogeneous energy density and isotropic pressure in the fluid. As an apparent indicator of complexity, the scalar Y_{TF} emerges as a viable candidate for measurement purposes. Yousaf et al. yousaf2023quasi examined the quasi-static evolution of self-gravitating structures under strong curvature regimes, considering higher-order curvature gravity and the Palatini formalism of f(R) gravity. Furthermore, the role of vorticity and structure scalars in revealing fluid anisotropy effects and the influence of Palatini-based factors on shearing motion is highlighted. Eventually, they performed a comparison-based study to explore the effects of distinct curvature factors on the propagation of axial sources. Several researches has been done on this vast topic of complexity by Herrera and different authors lopez1995statistical ; crutchfield2000comment ; herrera2018definition ; herrera2019complexity ; herrera2019complexitya ; bhatti2021electromagnetic ; jasim2021anisotropic ; brassel2021inhomogeneous ; gumede2021first ; yousaf2022f ; yousaf2023role Motivated by the work of Herrera herrera2009structure and the significance of scalar-tensor theories, we will construct the unique notion of complexity within the context of DHOST theory. This manuscript is organized in such a manner that Sec. II presents the comprehensive mathematical formalism of theory with couplings between the scalar field and the Einstein tensor, extracting the compact form of modified field equations in the context of DHOST theory. In Sec. III, we adapt a well-suited spherically symmetric anisotropic matter content in order to evaluate the modified field equations and non-conserved equation. The major goal of our manuscript, i.e., to obtain the set of structure scalars, is determined in Sec. IV. Section V deals with the calculation of different masses. In Sec. VI, physical models under the constraint of minimal complexity and the conformal flatness are discussed. Lastly, the summary as well as the final outcomes of our investigations are described in Sec. VII. This manuscript will ultimately open up the field of astrophysics to work in this modified gravity using a variety of geometries. This study may assist in further unravelling the enigma of the universe."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06945v1,Toward Gravitational Lensing in Modified Theories of Gravity,"In this study, we investigate gravitational lensing within modified gravity frameworks, focusing on the Hu-Sawicki f(R) and normal branch Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) models, and we compare these results with those obtained from general relativity (GR). Our results reveal that both modified gravity models consistently enhance key lensing parameters relative to GR, including the Einstein radius, lensing optical depth, and time delays. Notably, we find that the Hu-Sawicki f(R) and nDGP models yield significantly larger Einstein radii and higher lensing probabilities, especially at greater redshifts, indicating an increased likelihood of lensing events under modified gravity. Our analysis of time delays further shows that the broader mass distributions in these frameworks lead to pronounced differences in high-mass lens systems, providing potential observational markers of modified gravity. Additionally, we observe amplified magnification factors in wave optics regimes, highlighting the potential for gravitational wave (GW) lensing to differentiate modified gravity effects from GR predictions. Through these findings, we propose modified gravity theories as compelling alternatives to GR in explaining cosmic phenomena, with promising implications for future high-precision gravitational lensing surveys.","Gravitational lensing describes how the path of null waves originating from a distant source is altered as they pass near a massive object. This change in direction results from the gravitational field of the massive lens, which bends the path of these waves in line with general relativity (GR). This phenomenon, affecting both electromagnetic (EM) waves and gravitational waves (GWs), can produce interference patterns and distinct image structures shaped by the characteristics of the lens and the configuration of various potential light paths. Gravitational lensing thus offers a valuable tool in astrophysics and cosmology, influencing how we detect and interpret all forms of radiation from distant sources (Wambsganss, 1998; Bartelmann, 2010; Cunha and Herdeiro, 2018; Chowdhuri et al., 2023; Takahashi and Nakamura, 2003; Hou et al., 2020; Diego et al., 2021). Lensing of EM waves has already transformed cosmological studies by enabling precise measurements of dark matter distributions, identifying faint celestial objects, and even detecting exoplanets around distant stars Bond and et al. (2004); Massey et al. (2010a); Welch and et al. (2022). Since the landmark 2015 detection of GW event GW150914 by LIGO-Virgo, we now recognize that GWs also undergo lensing, a process which holds the potential to further enhance our cosmological understanding by providing new insights into the distribution of mass in the Universe and the properties of dark matter Maggiore (2007); Liao et al. (2022). For example, lensed GWs can address issues such as the mass-sheet degeneracy that limits EM lensing Cremonese et al. (2021) and open new avenues for testing gravitational theories, such as through the study of GW birefringence and propagation speed Ezquiaga and Zumalacárregui (2020); Baker and Trodden (2017). One of the most profound implications of gravitational lensing lies in its potential to reveal the nature of dark matter Massey et al. (2010b); Vegetti et al. (2023). In cosmology, dark matter remains an elusive but critical component of the Universe, inferred from gravitational interactions observed in galactic and sub-galactic structures. Studies suggest that sub-galactic dark matter halos could serve as strong lenses for compact background sources, producing characteristic milli-arcsecond scale lensing effects Loudas et al. (2022). By observing these “milli-lenses,” one can test dark matter models, such as cold dark matter halos, whose lensing effects could vary based on the properties of null waves Jung and Shin (2019). Thus, gravitational lensing provides a unique lens through which to investigate dark matter structures and distributions that are otherwise invisible to direct observation. In gravitational lensing research, selecting suitable dark matter halo models is crucial Tizfahm et al. (2024). Dark matter halo formation scenarios have been discussed in various models, e.g., White (2022); Delos and Silk (2023); Del Popolo and Fakhry (2023); Fakhry et al. (2023a); Del Popolo and Fakhry (2024). In this regard, recent studies have demonstrated that realistic dark matter halo models yield predictions more closely aligned with contemporary cosmological data, see, e.g., Fakhry et al. (2021, 2022a, 2022b, 2023b); Fakhry and Del Popolo (2023); Fakhry et al. (2023c); Fakhry (2024); Fakhry et al. (2024a, b). Yet, while GR has successfully described gravitational lensing, it encounters challenges in accounting for the dark sector of the Universe, where large amounts of unseen dark matter are required to explain observed gravitational effects, see, e.g., Tucker and Wang (1998); Srivastava et al. (2023). As the exact nature of dark matter remains unknown, modified gravity theories have gained attention by offering explanations for these observations without invoking dark matter, see, e.g., Brans and Dicke (1961); Dvali et al. (2000); Moffat (2006); Sotiriou and Faraoni (2010); Harko et al. (2011); Xu et al. (2019). Such theories propose that gravitational behavior might differ on galactic or cosmic scales, suggesting that the apparent need for dark matter could instead reflect limitations in our understanding of gravity. These alternative frameworks provide an exciting path to explore whether modifications to gravity itself could explain lensing phenomena and reveal new aspects of cosmic structure Schmidt (2008); Nzioki et al. (2011); Gao et al. (2019); Ren et al. (2021); Kuang et al. (2022); Kalita et al. (2023); Davies et al. (2024). In this work, we focus on two widely studied modified gravity models: the Hu-Sawicki f(R) gravity model Hu and Sawicki (2007) and the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) model Dvali et al. (2000). Both models propose modifications to GR that allow for differences in gravitational effects at large scales. For instance, the Hu-Sawicki model introduces a functional form of the Ricci scalar that mimics GR on local scales but can drive cosmic acceleration without dark energy on larger scales Sawicki and Hu (2007); Santos et al. (2012); Hu et al. (2016); MacDevette et al. (2022). In contrast, the nDGP model suggests a braneworld scenario where our Universe exists within a four-dimensional “brane” embedded in a higher-dimensional space, resulting in gravity that behaves normally on small scales but changes at cosmic distances Liu et al. (2021); Song et al. (2024). These modified theories predict subtle but measurable deviations from GR in gravitational lensing signals, offering potential tests of their validity. For example, f(R) gravity could lead to enhanced lensing effects, while the nDGP model could yield scale-dependent changes in lensing across different distances. In this work, we examine gravitational lensing under the Hu-Sawicki f(R) and nDGP models, analyzing how each theory impacts key observables such as Einstien radius, lensing strength, and time delays in strong lensing systems. By comparing these predictions to GR, we aim to identify distinct signatures that could be detected by next-generation observational tools, such as advanced GW and EM lensing observatories Euclid Collaboration et al. (2024); Shajib et al. (2024). These efforts could ultimately clarify whether GR or modified gravity better explains the cosmos, potentially advancing our understanding of the Universe’s structure. The work is structured as follows: Section II presents the theoretical foundations of the Hu-Sawicki f(R) and nDGP models, highlighting key distinctions from GR. Section III describes our methods for calculating lensing properties in these modified gravity frameworks, including screening mechanisms to limit effects in high-density regions. Section IV details our findings, and Section V concludes with a summary and suggestions for future research."

In the existing formulation of fluid-gravity correspondence of a null surface, we have only the momentum conservation relation in the form of the Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation. The other relations, such as the energy conservation relation, continuity relation, etc., are almost non-existent and are discussed sporadically in literature for stretched horizons. Furthermore, the fluid-gravity correspondence is not formulated from a suitable energy-momentum tensor in the conventional manner. In the paper, we address these issues. By giving the energy conservation relation, we improve the fluid-gravity analogy on a generic null hypersurface. Additionally, by introducing a suitable energy-momentum tensor, which forms the basis of the entire fluid description, we formulate the entire fluid description of the null surface. Moreover, we provide the expression of continuity relation in the context of fluid-gravity correspondence. The entire analysis has been done for a generic null surface, which differs from the existing stretched horizon approach and, thereby, expands the scope of applicability for any arbitrary null surface.","Numerous signs in the literature point to the possibility that gravitation is not a fundamental force but rather an “emergent phenomenon”. The concept came from Sakharov’s work [1], and numerous other researchers later supported it [2, 3, 4]. These are some of the arguments that support this paradigm: (i) The thermodynamic laws can be directly linked to the field equations of many classes of gravitational theories [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], (ii) The action functional of various theories can be identified as the free energy of the spacetime [13, 14, 15, 16, 17], (iii) Obtaining field equations from a thermodynamic extreme principle [18, 19], (iv) Possibility of obtaining the idea of energy equipartition theory for defining the microscopic degrees of freedom [20, 21, 22], (v) Dynamical equations for gravitation manifesting as the Navier-Stokes-like equation for wide class of theories [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], (vi) Association of every solution of Navier-Stokes (NS) equation in d dimension with a “dual” solution of Einstein’s equation in d+1 dimensions [29] (also see [30, 31, 32]) etc. By taking various projections of Einstein’s equation on the null surface, it is possible to establish the emergent nature of gravity more directly. Given that the normal, say l^{a}, generates the null surface, the auxiliary null vector is k^{a}, and the induced metric q_{ab}=g_{ab}+l_{a}k_{b}+l_{b}k_{a} defines the null surface’s spatial cross-section, it can be demonstrated the following facts: • The projection G_{ab}l^{a}l^{b} is related to Raychaudhuri’s equation, which plays a pivotal role in proving the second law of black hole (BH) thermodynamics (namely the area increase theorem). • For the metric in Gaussian null coordinate (GNC), the projection G_{ab}l^{a}k^{b} was shown [10, 27] to manifest as the first law. Later, this has been established in a covariant manner [33] and also extended to scalar tensor theory [12] and Einstein-Cartan theory [34], thereby, interpreting G_{ab}l^{a}k^{b} as a thermodynamic relation. • The other projection G_{ab}l^{a}q^{b}_{c} provides Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation [23, 24], which is related to the hydrodynamic description of gravitational dynamics on the null surface. Such interpretation works beyond Einstein’s gravity (e.g. see [28, 35]). All of the aforementioned phenomena demonstrate, in general, how gravitational theories are similar to two other completely uncorrelated important theories of (emergent) physics: fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. Notwithstanding several drawbacks, including the inability to find agreement regarding the microscopic degrees of freedom, the thermodynamic interpretation is remarkably reliable and consistent. This is not the case and even not fully complete, however, when considering fluid-gravity correspondence for a generic null surface and interpreting gravity as an emergent phenomenon. The DNS equation is currently the only relation that, from an emergent-gravity perspective, can support fluid-gravity correspondence (for a generic null surface). This DNS equation is related to the dynamical equation of a generic null surface and looks similar to the dynamical equation of fluid i.e. momentum conservation relation of the Navier-Stokes equation. Since both fluid, as well as gravity, still remain far from being completely well understood, one expects such a tantalizing connection might reveal several crucial information of about each other, i.e. acquiring knowledge in one domain might provide insight for a better understanding of another. 444In fact, it is because of the earlier connection that drives us in this work to find analogous relations, which are there in fluid dynamics but are missing in null hydrodynamics. However, there appear several missing links and inconsistencies in the pursuit of correlating gravity with Navier-Stokes fluid. In the following, we enlist them. 1. As mentioned above, the main idea that revolves around the correspondence of gravitation with fluid dynamics is the fact that the gravitational equations (such as Einstein’s equation in GR) take the form of an NS-like equation when it is projected on a null surface and it is known as the DNS equation among the physicists. Although NS and DNS equations look alike, the NS equation and the DNS equation are not exactly equivalent. DNS equation contains a Lie-derivative as opposed to the convective derivative in the NS equation, and if the Lie-derivative is replaced by the convective derivative, there appear terms that do not have any fluid-dynamic interpretation. Although Padmanabhan [26] demonstrated that these extra terms, which undermine the fluid-dynamic argument, disappear in a local inertial frame when a particular metric is used, there is no justification for why this frame must be chosen. 2. As previously stated, the DNS equation resembles the fluid mechanics momentum conservation equation. The other crucial relations, like the “continuity equation” or the “energy conservation relation,” are not yet available, in contrast to classical fluid mechanics. Therefore, the fluid-gravity analogy’s emergent-gravity perspective (for a generic null surface) appears to be lacking. Hence, for a robust understanding and complete description, one must look for the existence of similar relations from the dynamics of gravity. 3. In the description of relativistic fluid dynamics, the energy-momentum tensor of fluid (EMT) is extremely crucial. The entire fluid dynamics revolve around the EMT. In fact, the energy conservation and the momentum conservation relation is obtained directly by taking a suitable projection of EMT conservation (i.e., \nabla_{a}T^{ab}_{(fluid)}=0). A similar energy-momentum tensor is also present in the membrane paradigm [36] and in Carroll dynamics [37, 38], both of which seeks to have a fluid interpretation for the stretched horizon, which is, generally, a timelike surface and becomes null at certain limit. On the contrary, in the context of a generic null surface, which was shown earlier (via DNS equation) to have a connection with NS fluid, a systematic approach using EM tensor is not yet introduced. Thus, one can ask whether a similar energy-momentum tensor exists for the hydrodynamic description of a generic null surface. If such an energy-momentum tensor exists, one can put null hydrodynamics and conventional fluid mechanics on equal footing. In addition, it can be considered to be a significant development as it can be applicable to any null surface (as opposed to the timelike surface being null only at a certain limit). 4. While correlating the DNS equation with the NS equation, the geometric quantities are identified with the fluid parameters (such as the non-affinity parameter the pressure, and so on). However, the consistencies of such identifications have not been checked thoroughly. One needs to look for other hydrodynamic equations of the null surface (other than the existing DNS equation) and check whether previous identifications are consistent with the new equations. In doing so, one can obtain a robust understanding of fluid-gravity correspondence. 5. Although DNS equation is consistent with the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound (i.e. \eta/s\geq 1/4\pi, where \eta is the shear viscosity coefficient and s is the entropy density), the bulk viscosity coefficient (\zeta) in DNS equation turns out to be negative (in GR, \zeta=-1/16\pi), implying the instability of fluid while subject to compression or expansion. Therefore, again one needs to find other hydrodynamical equations of null surfaces to check whether the earlier identification is correct. Even if one accepts a specific choice of coordinate to relate DNS with NS (as proposed by Padmanabhan [26]), the other issues, especially 2 and 3, remain unaddressed. Until one resolves these issues, the fluid interpretation of a null hypersurface remains incomplete. This is because in three space dimensions the usual fluid is described by five independent parameters which are determined by five equations. The dynamical equation of fluid, which is the momentum conservation equation (namely NS), provides three equations; while the energy conservation and continuity relations give other two equations. Other than this, the NS fluid is the non-relativistic version of relativistic viscous fluid. The latter one is described through an energy-momentum tensor and correspondingly a non-relativistic version of this tensor exists for NS. Till now this direction has not been illuminated and, therefore, gravity-fluid connection, from the viewpoint of emergent phenomenon, cannot be considered to be on equal footing. Thus, the connection between gravity and fluid lacks a clear understanding and complete picture, unlike the thermodynamic description. For all these reasons, the fluid-gravity correspondence must be re-investigated thoroughly. Our primary objectives in this paper are twofold: (i) Finding an analogous of EMT, which should lie in the center while obtaining the hydrodynamical description of gravity, and (ii) Obtaining hydrodynamical equations on the null surface other than the DNS equation and check whether the earlier identifications are consistent. With regard to finding EMT for a generic null hypersurface, the following background ideas can be helpful. It is known that for a spacelike surface \mathcal{T} (defined by a timelike normal, say n_{a}), true dynamical degrees of freedom are the components of induced metric (not of the metric tensor) and the true dynamical information are embedded in its conjugate quantity. The situation is subtle for the null surface as one cannot define an induced metric on the null surface due to its degenerate property. However, accounting for an auxiliary null vector, one can define an induced metric q_{ab} on the cross-section of the null surface (upon which both the null generator l^{a} and the auxiliary null vector k^{a} are the normals). Then, it can be argued that the true dynamical quantities for the null surface are q_{ab} and the null generator l^{a} (for more details, see [39, 40]). Therefore, the true dynamical information should be embedded in the quantities \mathcal{P}_{ab} and \mathcal{P}^{(l)}_{a}, which are conjugate to q^{ab} and l^{a} respectively. Thus, we expect the possible hydrodynamical description on a null surface should be connected to both \mathcal{P}_{ab} as well as \mathcal{P}^{(l)}_{a}. Recently, in literature [41, 42, 43] the Brown-York-like tensor is defined for the null surface which consists of both \mathcal{P}_{ab} and \mathcal{P}^{(l)}_{a}. We find that such a gravitational quantity is a suitable entity that plays the analogous role of EMT for the effective fluid description of gravity on the null hypersurface. Pertaining to the other objective, let us provide the following discussions. The other relations, that indicated fluid-gravity analogy, such as the energy conservation, continuity equation, etc. are discussed sporadically in literature. It is noteworthy that the previous attempts are formulated for the stretched horizon, which is null only at a certain limit. The formulations on the stretched surface have two distinct approaches. The old approach relates gravity with NS fluid via membrane paradigm [44, 45, 46] and the recent approach relates gravity with Carroll fluid [37, 38]. As mentioned earlier, these two formalisms are constructed for the stretched horizon and have not been generalized for a generic null surface. As a result, the existing approaches for the generic null surface merely rely on the similarity of the DNS equation with the momentum conservation relation of the NS equation and, hence, is incomplete (for the reasons mentioned earlier). In this paper, we provide a systematic description of fluid-gravity correspondence for a generic null surface. Our argument does not rely merely on finding the similarity between null dynamical equations with the Navier-Stokes equation and identifying the fluid parameters based on analogy. Instead, we follow a conventional approach of fluid dynamics, which is centered around the null Brown-York energy-momentum tensor– similar to the fact that the fluid-dynamic description is centered around the energy-momentum tensor of the fluid. We show that some of the fluid parameters can be identified naturally from the different components of null BY tensor, which agrees with the previous identification which was based on analogy. Furthermore, embracing the usual route of fluid dynamics, where the fluid equations (such as the energy conservation equation, momentum conservation equation, etc., which are known as the Navier-Stokes equation) can be obtained from the suitable projection of EMT, we show that the entire fluid-gravity description for a generic null surface can be formulated from the conservation of null BY tensor. Using this approach, not only do we obtain the age-old Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation, but we also show that the other relations, such as the energy conservation relation and the continuity equation can also be obtained. The paper is presented in the following parts. In the following 2, we have discussed the prerequisite knowledge on the part of fluid dynamics as well as on the geometry of the null surface, which will be useful for subsequent discussions. In 3, we introduce the Brown-York formalism– first the original one (valid for the timelike surface) and then its recent null extension. In 4, we discuss how the null Brown-York-like tensor provides the description of fluid-gravity correspondence, where we derive the Damour-Navier-Stokes equation, continuity equation as well as the Null-Raychaudhuri equation from the null Brown-York tensor. In 5, we show the connection of our result with the recent works on Carroll dynamics. Finally, we provide the discussions related to our analysis in 6. Let us describe the notations and conventions used. We will be working with the mostly positive (-,+,+,+) signature of the metric and employ the geometrized unit system where c,\hbar and G have been set to one. The lowercase Roman alphabets a,b,\cdot\cdot\cdot represent the four-dimensional spacetime indices. The spatial indices on any three-dimensional spacelike surface are designated with the lowercase Latin alphabets \mu,\nu,\cdot\cdot\cdot. The indices on the null surface will be designated with the lowercase Latin alphabets, with a tilde over them \tilde{\mu},\tilde{\nu},\cdot\cdot\cdot. The uppercase Roman alphabets A,B,\cdot\cdot\cdot will be reserved for the coordinates of a spatial two-dimensional cross-section/cut of the null surface."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06841v1,Particle creation and evaporation in Kalb–Ramond gravity,"In this work, we examine particle creation and the evaporation process in the context of Kalb–Ramond gravity. Specifically, we build upon two existing solutions from the literature yang2023static and Liu:2024oas , both addressing a static, spherically symmetric configuration. For this study, we focus on the scenario in which the cosmological constant vanishes. To begin, the corrections to Hawking radiation for bosonic modes are examined by studying the Klein–Gordon equation in curved spacetime. Through the calculation of Bogoliubov coefficients, we identify how the parameter \ell, which governs Lorentz symmetry breaking, contributes a correction to the amplitude associated with particle production. Within this approach, the power spectrum and Hawking temperature are derived. Additionally, we obtain expressions for the power spectrum and particle number density by analyzing Hawking radiation from a tunneling viewpoint. A parallel approach is applied to fermionic modes. Finally, we examine black hole evaporation, finding that the black hole lifetime in these cases can be determined analytically.","A fundamental principle in modern physics, Lorentz symmetry holds that physical laws apply consistently across all inertial frames. This symmetry is extensively validated through experimental and observational evidence; however, certain high–energy scenarios in theoretical physics propose that it may not be absolute. Various frameworks — such as loop quantum gravity 2 , string theory 1 , non–commutative field theory 4 ; araujo2023thermodynamics ; heidari2023gravitational , Hořava–Lifshitz gravity 3 , massive gravity 6 , Einstein–aether theory 5 , very special relativity 8 , and f(T) gravity 7 — explore conditions under which Lorentz invariance is no longer maintained. Two main types of Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) are recognized: explicit and spontaneous bluhm2006overview . In the case of explicit breaking, Lorentz invariance is absent in the Lagrangian density itself, causing physical laws to differ across specific reference frames. On the other hand, spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the Lagrangian density remains Lorentz–invariant, yet the system’s ground state does not uphold this symmetry bluhm2008spontaneous . Research on spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking 12 ; KhodadiPoDU2023 ; AraujoFilho:2024ykw ; 13 ; 11 ; 9 ; 10 ; filho2023vacuum is grounded in the framework of the Standard Model Extension, where the simplest theoretical approaches are represented by bumblebee models KhodadiEPJC2023 ; 12 ; 10 ; 1 ; 11 ; 13 ; KhodadiEPJC20232 ; CapozzielloJCAP2023 ; KhodadiPRD2022 . In these models, a vector field known as the bumblebee field acquires a non–zero vacuum expectation value (VEV), establishing a preferred spatial direction and thus breaking local Lorentz invariance for particles. This symmetry breaking has significant implications, especially for thermodynamic properties aa2021lorentz ; paperrainbow ; aa2022particles ; araujo2021higher ; araujo2021thermodynamic ; araujo2022does ; aaa2021thermodynamics ; anacleto2018lorentz ; petrov2021bouncing2 ; reis2021thermal ; araujo2022thermal . An exact solution for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime within bumblebee gravity is introduced in Ref. 14 . In a comparable manner, a Schwarzschild–like solution has been extensively analyzed from several angles, including studies on gravitational lensing 15 , accretion dynamics 18 ; 17 , quasinormal modes 19 , and Hawking radiation 16 . Building upon earlier work, Maluf et al. derived an (A)dS–Schwarzschild–like solution that does not require strict vacuum conditions 20 . In a similar manner, Xu et al. introduced additional types of static, spherically symmetric bumblebee black holes by incorporating a background bumblebee field with a non–zero time component. This allowed them to investigate the thermodynamic properties and observational signatures of these solutions, as outlined in Refs. 24 ; 23 ; 22 ; 21 . An alternative framework for studying LSB involves the rank–two antisymmetric tensor field, known as the Kalb–Ramond field 42 ; maluf2019antisymmetric , which naturally emerges in bosonic string theory 43 . When this field is coupled to gravity in a non–minimal way and develops a non–zero VEV, it induces spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. In 44 , a solution is provided for a static, spherically symmetric configuration within this context. Subsequent research examined the motion of massive and massless particles near this static spherical Kalb–Ramond black hole 45 . Additionally, 46 investigates gravitational lensing and shadow patterns produced by rotating black holes influenced by the Kalb–Ramond field. In addition, Ref. yang2023static presents a set of new exact solutions for static and spherically symmetric spacetimes, developed both with and without a cosmological constant. These ones are constructed within a framework where the Kalb–Ramond field has a non–zero vacuum expectation value. Later, Ref. Liu:2024oas reveals an alternative black hole configuration that had not been previously explored in yang2023static . Furthermore, Hawking’s work established a crucial connection between quantum mechanics and gravity, laying the groundwork for quantum gravity theory o1 ; o11 ; o111 . His research revealed that black holes can emit thermal radiation and slowly diminish over time, a phenomenon known as Hawking radiation eeeOvgun:2019ygw ; gibbons1977cosmological ; eeeKuang:2017sqa ; eeeKuang:2018goo ; eeeOvgun:2019jdo ; eeeOvgun:2015box . This result, derived from quantum field theory near a black hole’s event horizon, has significantly advanced the study of black hole thermodynamics and quantum processes in strong gravitational fields sedaghatnia2023thermodynamical ; o9 ; o6 ; araujo2024dark ; o4 ; o3 ; o7 ; aa2024implications ; araujo2023analysis ; o8 . Later, Kraus and Wilczek o10 , followed by Parikh and Wilczek o13 ; o12 ; 011 , interpreted Hawking radiation as a tunneling effect within a semi–classical framework. This approach has since been widely applied across various black hole models, offering important perspectives on black hole properties johnson2020hawking ; senjaya2024bocharova ; vanzo2011tunnelling ; calmet2023quantum ; mirekhtiary2024tunneling ; anacleto2015quantum ; mitra2007hawking ; silva2013quantum ; medved2002radiation ; del2024tunneling ; zhang2005new ; touati2024quantum . In this manner, this study investigates particle creation and black hole evaporation within the framework of Kalb–Ramond gravity. We build on two established solutions from the literature yang2023static ; Liu:2024oas , both of which describe static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, focusing specifically on cases where the cosmological constant is zero. Our analysis begins by exploring corrections to Hawking radiation for bosonic modes through the Klein–Gordon equation in curved spacetime. By calculating the Bogoliubov coefficients, we demonstrate how the Lorentz symmetry–breaking parameter \ell modifies the amplitude for particle production. This approach allows us to derive expressions for both the power spectrum and the Hawking temperature. We further analyze the power spectrum and particle number density using a tunneling perspective on Hawking radiation, applying a similar methodology to fermionic modes. Lastly, we investigate black hole evaporation, showing that, under these conditions, the black hole’s lifetime can be calculated analytically."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06834v1,Renormalisation in maximally symmetric spaces and semiclassical gravity in Anti-de Sitter spacetime,"We obtain semiclassical gravity solutions in the Poincaré fundamental domain of (3+1)-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime, PAdS4, with a (massive or massless) Klein-Gordon field (with possibly non-trivial curvature coupling) with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary. Some results are explicitly and graphically presented for special values of the mass and curvature coupling (e.g. minimal or conformal coupling). In order to achieve this, we study in some generality how to perform the Hadamard renormalisation procedure for non-linear observables in maximally symmetric spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions, with emphasis on the stress-energy tensor. We show that, in this maximally symmetric setting, the Hadamard bi-distribution is invariant under the isometries of the spacetime, and can be seen as a ‘single-argument’ distribution depending only on the geodesic distance, which significantly simplifies the Hadamard recursion relations and renormalisation computations.","Quantum field theory (QFT) in Anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS) has gained substantial attention in the past years. This is undoubtedly in part because of its relevance in the AdS/CFT correspondence [1] and holography, but also because AdS is interesting its own right. To mention two of its important features, first, AdS is a maximally symmetric spacetime, which allows one to put abstract techniques of QFT in curved spacetimes in a computationally accessible setting. Second, AdS is interesting because it is not a globally hyperbolic spacetime, but instead a good testbed to see how techniques developed for QFT in globally hyperbolic spacetimes should be relaxed. To mention some of the recent work, Dappiaggi and his collaborators have written a number of papers dealing with the construction of Klein-Gordon states with Robin boundary conditions in the Poincaré fundamental domain (PAdS) [2] and in the universal cover (CAdS) [3] of AdS. The case with dynamical Wentzell boundary conditions at the boundary of PAdS was studied in collaboration with one of us in [4, 5]. Dynamical boundary conditions not only appear naturally in holographic renormalisation [6], but are also central for the experimental verification of the dynamical Casimir effect [7], as explained in [8, 9, 10]. Some rigorous results in the algebraic QFT framework appear in [11]. Results on the propagation of singularities of Hadamard states that extend Radzikowski’s microlocal spectrum condition in globally hyperbolic spacetimes [12] to asymptotically AdS spacetimes appear in [13, 14]. Results from those papers allow for the construction of Hadamard states in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in [15]. (See also the thesis of Marta [16].) The behaviour of renormalised observables in AdS has been studied extensively in the literature by Winstanley and collaborators [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. The expectation value of the Klein-Gordon stress-energy tensor in CAdSn (n=2,\ldots 11) is calculated in [17] with Neumann boundary conditions. The expectation value of the massless conformally coupled Klein-Gordon field squared with Robin boundary conditions at zero and finite temperature is studied in [18]. Under the same conditions, [19] deals with the stress-energy tensor, and very recently [20] studies the back-reaction corrections to AdS spacetime. The renormalised Klein-Gordon field squared with general mass and curvature coupling is studied in [21]. Expectation values for the stress-energy tensor, current and field-squared for fermions are studied in [22] and in [23] in the vacuum and in the case of finite temperature. The work of Pitelli and collaborators has emphasised the interplay between boundary conditions and spacetime symmetries. They have studied the field squared in [24] with hybrid Dirichlet-Robin boundary conditions. [25] deals with the stress-energy tensor in PAdS2 with Robin boundary conditions (see also [26, 27] for a study on the particle production in PAdS2). The point is that states with generic Robin (or more general) boundary conditions are not invariant under the isometries of spacetime, unlike their Dirichlet or Neumann counterparts. The construction of QFT in AdS is also important to understand QFT in relevant quotient spacetimes, such as the BTZ black hole in n=3 spacetime dimensions. Studies on semiclassical backreaction in BTZ appear in [28, 29]. In this paper, we are concerned with obtaining exact semiclassical gravity solutions in anti de-Sitter spacetime. More precisely, we shall work in the Poincaré fundamental domain of AdS in four spacetime dimensions, PAdS4. Our interest stems from many angles. First of all, this is a natural extension to previous work by one of use finding semiclassical solutions in de Sitter spacetime [30], which are relevant to the cosmological constant problem, and to the related paper [31]. Second, our paper serves as a proof of concept that semiclassical gravity can be defined in so-called globally hyperbolic spacetimes with timelike boundaries, in the sense of Aké Hau, Flores and Sánchez [32]. These are spacetimes where boundary conditions on the timelike boundary render wave equations well posed. We are also motivated by two further questions, which we plan to address in the future. The first one has to do with the construction of semiclassical gravity solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. A natural approach is to use Fefferman-Graham expansions, starting from semiclassical gravity in AdS at the lowest order, and then perturbatively construct the solutions near the timelike boundary. The second question has to do with whether semiclassical AdS has better or worse stability properties than its classical counterpart [33, 34]. As a way to achieve our goal of obtaining semiclassical gravity solutions in AdS, we study in some generality how to perform renormalisation, via Hadamard subtraction, in maximally symmetric spacetimes for the Klein-Gordon field with arbitrary mass and curvature coupling. We pay special attention to the stress-energy tensor, as this is the key observable appearing on the ‘right-hand side’ of the semiclassical Einstein field equations. This is an addition to the literature in its own right, as it encompasses a number of situations of interest in a unified framework (see, for example, the literature cited above). This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 first provides a review of the Klein-Gordon theory in maximally symmetric spacetimes, and then gives a particularly useful representation for the Hadamard bi-distribution in this class of spacetimes, by showing that it is invariant under the spacetime isometries, and that it is a function of (half the square of) the geodesic distance only. Sec. 3 is concerned with renormalisation in maximally symmetric spacetimes. Asymptotic expansions of the Hadamard coefficients are presented to sufficient accuracy to perform the renormalisation of the stress-energy tensor in n=4 spacetime dimensions. A simplified expression for the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor is given. The effects of changes in the renormalisation scale and the flat spacetime limit (as the radius of curvature tends to infinity) for the stress-energy tensor are studied. Sec. 4 then applies the previous techniques to obtain, in closed form, the vacuum expectation value of the Klein-Gordon stress-energy tensor in PAdS4 with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Sec. 5 then presents some semiclassical solutions in PAdS4. Our final remarks appear in Sec. 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06706v2,Gravitational Wave Propagation in Starobinsky Inflationary Model,"In this work, we linearize the field equations in the f(R) theory using the Starobinsky model, R+R^{2}/(6m^{2}), and explore the impact of modifications to the gravitational field equations on the propagation and structure of gravitational waves. An equation for the trace of the perturbation was then derived and decomposed with the aid of an auxiliary field that obeyed the pure wave equation and was sourced by the matter-energy distribution, while also acting as a fictitious source for generating the actual perturbation via the Klein-Gordon equation. The fields were expressed in terms of Green’s functions, whose symmetry properties facilitated the solution of the trace equation. This trace value was then substituted into the linearized field equation to determine the perturbation tensor in terms of a modified or effective matter-energy distribution. We subsequently calculated the components of the quadrupole moment tensor as well as the perturbation tensor for a binary star system and compared them to the General Relativity case. The results indicate that the amplitude of the oscillation depends on the orbital parameters, specifically: the angular frequency and radius of the system. This suggests that high-frequency binary systems could be promising candidates for detecting the effects of this modified gravity theory.","In recent decades, modified gravity theories have emerged as a significant alternative for explaining cosmological phenomena tied to fundamental physics [1, 2]. These theories are motivated by the need to expand our understanding of gravity to address problems that General Relativity (GR) cannot solve without invoking dark matter and dark energy, such as the accelerated expansion of the universe [3, 4] and the dynamics of large-scale structures [5, 6]. Among these, f(R) theories generalize the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian by introducing nonlinear terms in the Ricci scalar R, offering new perspectives on the curvature effects of spacetime across various gravitational regimes [7, 8, 9]. Viable models within f(R) gravity theories [10, 11, 12], show promise in addressing both cosmological and astrophysical phenomena beyond standard GR [13, 14, 15, 16]. These models introduce a broader range of gravitational behaviors that remain consistent with observations while avoiding many of the issues found in alternative theories [5, 17, 18, 19]. Consequently, f(R) gravity provides a compelling framework for exploring modifications to GR, with applications ranging from large-scale cosmic expansion to localized strong gravitational fields, such as black holes, where they predict modified horizon structures and unique stability properties [20, 21, 22]. In this sense, Starobinsky’s model [23], f(R)=R+\alpha R^{2}, with \alpha being a parameter; initially proposed within the framework of cosmic inflation, stands as one of the earliest alternatives to scalar-field inflation models [24, 25]. This model is characterized by the inclusion of an R^{2} term, introducing new degrees of freedom in the field equations, resulting in additional modes that can impact the early Universe’s behavior [26, 24], particularly during inflation, where quantum effects may play a significant role [27, 28], as well as in producing perturbations that affect the evolution of large-scale structures such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. With the successful detection of gravitational waves [29], the framework of f(R) gravity could gain significant attention [30, 31, 32, 33], since important works have been developed in order to explore how these modified theories could influence wave propagation, polarization modes, and potential deviations from predictions in GR [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. Hopefully the next-generation detectors will allow to observe a wider range of astrophysical events, providing further evidence of gravitational waves and their properties [40, 41]. These advancements may reveal distinctive features in gravitational wave signals that could indicate the influence of f(R) modifications, potentially setting them apart from standard relativistic predictions. Considering this context, we focus this work on linearizing the field equations of f(R) gravity in the Starobinsky model within the weak-field approximation, analyzing the propagation of perturbations under this modified gravity theory to identify distinctive differences between this model and GR. This paper is organized as follows: in Section II, we linearize the field equations of the f(R) theory for the model R+R^{2}/(6m^{2}) in the weak-field regime, expressing the field equations in terms of the perturbation \bar{h}_{\mu\nu} relative to the background Minkowski metric. In Section III, we solve the trace equation using Green’s functions and auxiliary fields. In Section IV, we calculate the components of \bar{h}_{\mu\nu}, considering both the massive contribution induced by the quadratic term and the propagation effects of the field. Then, in Section V, we calculate the perturbation found for a binary star system, and its differences compared to GR. Finally, in Section VI, we discuss and analyze the results."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06694v1,Is graviton shot noise detectable?,"Direct detection of gravitons in gravitational experiments, including gravitational wave observatories, has been all but ruled out given the weak coupling between the gravitational field and matter. Here we propose an alternative: looking not for the presence but for the absence of graviton shot noise in gravitational wave data. Gravitational wave experiments detect very weak signals that correspond to a surprisingly small number of gravitons even at the relatively low frequencies that characterize signals from gravitational wave events. A detailed calculation, which also yields results that are consistent with the existing literature, demonstrates that graviton shot noise may be present at detectable levels in gravitational wave observations. The absence of elevated noise levels due to graviton shot noise, in turn, would indicate that gravity is not a quantum field theory with a conventional perturbative expansion at low energies.","One of the greatest challenges for modern quantum theories of gravitation is detection. Gravity is exceedingly weak. Even if the entire Earth was used as a “perfect” graviton detector, it would not register more than roughly one atomic transition every billion years, mainly from the capture of solar thermal gravitons Dyson (2013). Such estimates seem to place any possible attempt to detect gravitons firmly beyond reach, in the realm of science-fiction, not practical science. Nonetheless, it might be possible to detect gravitons. Or, at the very least, establish stringent limits that, while not necessarily confirming the existence of gravitons, can potentially rule out quantum theories of gravity by a failure to detect a key signature of gravitons. As we shall see, conceivably the data are already in our hands. The detection of numerous gravitational wave events by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) experiment, specifically very “clean” signals from binary black hole and neutron star mergers, may be well-suited to check for the presence of a specific type of noise: graviton shot noise. Professional low-light photographers are familiar with the problem of shot noise. When individual sensors, such as the pixels in a digital camera, are weakly illuminated, the number of photons captured by the sensor during the exposure time may be limited. This introduces the well-known Poisson-type shot noise that can make low light photographs acquire an unwelcome grainy appearance. Shot noise is a frequently discussed subject in the literature of gravitational wave detection. The shot noise that is investigated in those discussions is shot noise associated with the optical measurement signal. The detected signal can be very weak, as the laser beam used in the interferometer will have covered the length of a multi-kilometer detector arm a great number of times, therefore, shot noise is of concern when interferometery is performed. The existence of shot noise is independent of the specifics of the quantum theory of light. It is a consequence of quantization itself, notably that the amount of energy absorbed by the sensor is deposited in discrete units, or quanta. Individual photon energies are of course determined by the well-known expression E_{\gamma}=\hbar\omega where \hbar is the reduced Planck constant and \omega is the angular frequency. This same relationship applies to all massless particles, including hypothetical gravitons that, we expect, would appear as the quanta of gravitational radiation in the weak field, low energy limit, assuming of course that gravitation is governed by a quantum field theory in the first place. And while actual details obviously differ, fundamentally a gravitational wave detector is no different from a single pixel in the low-light photographer’s camera: it absorbs signal energy one quantum at a time. Therefore, if gravity is indeed quantized, shot noise will be present. This raises an obvious question: What is the magnitude of graviton shot noise in LIGO detections of gravitational wave events? Is this shot noise detectable? In the following, we shall argue that indeed, shot noise is necessarily present in the gravitational wave signal, and that moreover, its detection is within the capabilities of existing gravitational wave observatories. Of course, the presence of Poisson noise does not confirm quantum gravity. However, the absence of shot noise may be viewed as powerful evidence against a quantum theory of gravitation. It is in light of this possibility that, in the following, we evaluate the amount of energy that an instrument or medium absorbs when it interacts with a gravitational wave signal. We begin our investigation in Section II by attempting to calculate the opacity of a medium to a gravitational wave that passes through it. Our calculation is purely classical, yet, as we shall see, it yields a result that is in close agreement with Dyson’s famous estimate of the rate of graviton detection. Next, in Section III we apply our approach to estimate the graviton shot noise that may be observed in a gravitational wave experiment. We derive the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio and compare it against other major known noise sources specific to the LIGO experiment. Finally, we offer our conclusions in Section IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06628v3,Estimating the strength of Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry by solar system tests,"In this paper, we study four classical tests of Schwarzschild space-time with Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry. We performed detailed calculations of the first-order corrections induced by the non-commutative parameter on planetary orbital precession, light deflection, radar wave delay, and gravitational redshift. The study showed that the impact of the non-commutative parameter on timelike geodesics is significantly greater than its effect on null geodesics. Using precise experimental observations, the allowable range for the non-commutative parameter is ultimately constrained within \Theta\leq 0.067579\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{m}^{2}, which is given by Mercury’s orbital precession. This result aligns with the view that \sqrt{\Theta} is on the order of the Planck length. Moreover, the constrained parameter range exceeds the Planck scale by a significant margin.","Non-commutative geometry is a kind of quantum gravity theories noncomu1 ; noncomu2 ; noncomu3 ; noncomu4 ; noncomu5 ; noncomu6 ; noncomu7 . Unlike in normal quantum mechanics, non-commutative geometry posits that space-time coordinate operators themselves are non-commutative, as described by a relation \left[\hat{x}^{\mu},\hat{x}^{\nu}\right]=\mathrm{i}\hat{\Theta}^{\mu\nu}, with \hat{\Theta}^{\mu\nu} being an anti-symmetric constant matrix. The parameter \sqrt{\Theta} represents the minimum scale of space-time. While the precise value of \Theta remains undetermined, \sqrt{\Theta} is generally considered to be on the order of the Planck length commutator ; planck-length . There have been extensive research conducted to study the influences brought by non-commutative geometry in theories of gravity gr1 ; gr2 ; gr3 ; gr4 ; gr5 ; gr6 ; gr7 ; gr8 . An especially intriguing perspective is that, due to non-commutative effects, the mass distribution of a point particle, originally concentrated at a single point, is instead modified as a continuous distribution spread throughout the entire space. This offers a theoretical avenue for potentially addressing the black hole singularity problem. Two alternative forms of such matter distributions are commonly considered: the Lorentzian distribution \rho=\frac{M}{\left(4\pi\Theta\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\exp\left(-\frac{r^{2}}{4% \Theta}\right) lorentziandistribution and the Gaussian distribution \rho=\frac{M\sqrt{\Theta}}{\pi^{\frac{3}{2}}\left(r^{2}+\pi\Theta\right)^{2}} gaussiandistribution1 ; gaussiandistribution2 ; gaussiandistribution3 . When \Theta approaches zero, these two distributions both converge to a Dirac delta function M\delta^{3}\left(x\right), leading to the standard Schwarzschild space-time. There have been many studies investigating the properties of black holes in the background of non-commutative geometry gr1 ; gr2 ; gr3 ; gr4 ; lorentziandistribution ; gaussiandistribution1 ; gaussiandistribution2 ; gaussiandistribution3 ; Gaussianthermo ; optics ; thermo1 ; thermo2 ; thermo3 ; thermo4 ; Horizon-scale ; gr9 ; gr10 ; gr11 ; gr12 ; gr13 . The effect of noncommutative geometry on the classical orbits of particles in a central force potential was investigated in centralpotential . Moreover, because the commutator of coordinate operators being a nonzero constant \Theta matrix is incompatible with Lorentz symmetry noncomu1 , non-commutative geometry may offer valuable insights into the breaking of Lorentz covariance, which has also attracted much interest of researchers. lorentz1 ; lorentz2 ; lorentz2 ; lorentz3 ; lorentz4 ; lorentz5 ; lorentz6 . Since its inception, general relativity has undergone extensive experimental verification. Four of the most renowned tests include the precession of Mercury’s orbit, light deflection, gravitational redshift, and radar wave delay. Due to the gravitational effects, light will undergo a deflection when it passes near massive celestial bodies. It is noteworthy that the coordinate speed of light is not necessarily equal to the speed of light in a vacuum c. Combined with the fact that light bends in a gravitational field, this causes an observer to detect a time delay when receiving a radar wave emitted from their location and then reflected back. On the other hand, the variation in clock rates at different positions within a gravitational field results in a frequency shift of light waves, as they represent oscillations of the electromagnetic field. Additionally, because the time-like geodesics in Schwarzschild space-time does not satisfy the Binet equation in Newton’s mechanics, a correction at the scale of the Schwarzschild radius emerges. Consequently, the motion trajectory of a planet in Schwarzschild space-time deviates from a closed elliptical orbit, with its semi-major axis shifting periodically. Although \sqrt{\Theta} is considered to be on the order of the Planck length \ell_{p}(\simeq 1.616\times 10^{-35}\mathrm{m}), it is still crucial to investigate the possible values of the non-commutative parameter. In BTZgravastar , the authors study the relationship between the noncommutative parameter and the cosmological constant by constructing a BTZ gravastar in non-commutative geometry, and obtain a relatively precise parameter constraint. In this work, we study the parameter constraints of Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry using solar system tests. Investigating the constraints on this parameter provided by the classic experiments in the Solar System is of meaningful interest. Moreover, calculating the four classical tests of general relativity within the framework of non-commutative geometry is valuable for studying the impact of non-commutative geometry on the motion of time-like particles and light rays. This article is organized as follows. In Sect. II, we substitute the Lorentzian distribution into the Einstein equation to obtain the metric of Schwarzschild space-time in non-commutative geometry. In Sect. III, we conduct detailed calculations of four classical experiments in Schwarzschild space-time with the Lorentzian distribution, including planetary orbital precession, light deflection, radar wave delay, and gravitational redshift effects. By selecting more precise experimental values, we determine the range of the non-commutative parameter. Finally, we give our conclusion and outlook in Sect. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06489v1,Varying Newton’s constant: a cure for gravitational maladies?,"We show that a slowly varying Newton’s constant, consistent with existing bounds, can potentially explain a host of observations pertaining to gravitational effects or phenomena across distances spanning from planetary to the cosmological, relying neither on the existence of Dark Matter or (and) Dark Energy, nor on any expected high proportions of either of them in the Universe. It may also have implications at very short distances or quantum gravity scales.","Newton’s theory of gravity and its subsequent relativistic formulation by Einstein, viz. General Relativity (GR), are among the most successful physical theories in explaining gravitational phenomena spanning from the planetary scale all the way to the galactic and cosmological scales. However, despite being largely successful, these theories have significant limitations, notably the following: (i) the need for an as-yet unidentified entity known as Dark Matter (DM) for explaining gravitational phenomena observed at the galactic scales and beyond, (ii) the requirement of a small, positive cosmological constant or more generally, Dark Energy (DE), also of an unknown origin, in order to explain observations at the cosmological scales, and (iii) the challenge in constructing a self-consistent quantum theory of gravity, notwithstanding the success of perturbative quantum field theory in describing the other fundamental forces of nature. Our objective in this paper is to explore potential resolutions to some of these issues (specifically the first two, which would be relevant for the third one as well) by making a reasonable proposal that the Newton’s constant G may not strictly be a ‘constant’, but may instead vary slowly with space and possibly with time as well. Of course, any such proposal must need to be consistent with the known experimental bounds of observable effects ranging from the planetary and astrophysical scales to the cosmological scale. While there exist huge volumes of literature on gravitational theories incorporating a variation or a scale-dependence of G, which we shall discuss in some detail in the section 2 below, the one we propose is a simple Taylor expansion in the radial coordinate r, about an arbitrarily chosen origin r=0. Presuming the zeroth order term in the expansion to be the experimentally measured Newton’s constant at terrestrial and planetary scales, the physical relevance of a few higher order terms can be realized at once, under certain stipulations. For instance, the first order term, if stipulated to be positive definite, modifies the Newtonian gravitational potential by a logarithmic term, well-known for providing an alternative to the dark matter (DM). The second order term, on the other hand, modifies the Newtonian force by a constant term, which can be interpreted as that due to a gravitational retardation, similar to what one encounters in electrodynamics. The third order term in the expansion, if stipulated to be negative definite, leads to the perception of an effective positive cosmological constant, the most favoured candidate for dark energy (DE). Beyond the third order though, any of the individual expansion terms in G(r) cannot be readily interpreted, regardless of any stipulation. Henceforth, limiting our attention to this order in the expansion, we endeavor to examine whether such an expansion can lead to any observable effect(s) of significance in astrophysics and cosmology. The paper is organized as follows: starting with the general layout of the gravitational theory involving the radial expansion of G in section 2, we discuss the consequences at different length scales, specifically, in accounting for astrophysical effects, such as the flatness of the rotation curves of galaxies, the galactic or cluster mass estimation via gravitational lensing and from the perspective of the virial theorem, as well as the cosmological dynamics, in section 3. A detailed cosmological study is then carried out in this context, albeit in a quasi-Newtonian framework, in section 4, and consequently the parameter estimation using standard statistical techniques and the combination of two widely used observational data-sets, for various emerging cosmological scenarios. A comparative study of such scenarios is also done by resorting to three statistical indicators, viz. the minimized \chi^{2} per degree of freedom (dof), AIC and BIC. Possible small scale effects of the varying G are then discussed briefly in section 5, before summarizing and concluding with a discussion on the open issues, work that remains to be done and works that are in progress, in section 6. A possible embedding of the varying G in a covariant framework is illustrated in the Appendix."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06265v1,Gravitational Wave and Quantum Graviton Interferometer Arm Detection of Gravitons,"This paper explores the quantum and classical descriptions of gravitational wave detection in interferometers like LIGO. We demonstrate that while a simple graviton scattering model fails to explain the observed arm displacements, both the classical gravitational wave approach and a quantum graviton energy method successfully predict the correct results. We provide a detailed analysis of why the quantum graviton energy approach succeeds, highlighting the importance of collective behavior and the quantum-classical correspondence in gravitational wave physics. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the quantum nature of gravity and its observable effects in macroscopic physics.","An important problem in modern physics is to understand the role of quantum physics in gravity. A quantum gravity based on the quantization methods of effective quantum field theory assumes that the quantum particle is a graviton. The problem that has beset this approach has been the lack of experimental data allowing for a test of any quantum gravity predictions. At the basic level the length and time scales associated with Newton’s gravitational constant G are l_{p}=\sqrt{G\hbar/c^{3}}\approx 10^{-35}m and t_{p}=l_{p}/c\approx 10^{-44}s. In effective field theory (EFT) and quantum mechanics, these scales are far beyond the reach of observational experiments, when single or a few gravitons are describing calculations of graviton scattering amplitudes and cross sections [1, 2]. In refs. [3], an attempt was made to replicate the stochastic Brownian motion detection of gravitons by proposing experiments to detect the stochastic spatial displacement \Delta x of a test mass by a large number of collective coherent gravitons. Several proposals have been made for experiments to detect gravitons without resorting to a physically unrealistic large mass detector or accelerator [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22, 6, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23]. The detection of gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatories LIGO-Virgo-Kagra [24] marked a milestone in physics, confirming a key prediction of Einstein’s general relativity. These detections, resulting from cataclysmic events such as black hole mergers, involve enormous energies on the order of 10^{47} J, yet produce incredibly small measurable displacements in the LIGO interferometer arms, on the scale of 10^{-18} m. This paper addresses a fundamental question in the quantum-classical correspondence of gravitational waves: How can we reconcile the quantum nature of gravity, described by gravitons, with the classical wave behavior observed in detectors? We explore three approaches to this problem: (1) A simple graviton scattering model, (2) The classical gravitational wave description, (3) A quantum graviton energy approach. We demonstrate that while the first approach fails to explain the observed displacements, both the classical wave description and the quantum graviton energy method successfully predict the correct results. This success of the quantum graviton energy approach, despite the failure of the simple scattering model, provides valuable insights into the nature of quantum-classical correspondence in gravitational physics. Our analysis sheds light on the collective behavior of gravitons, the importance of coherence in gravitational wave detection, and the fundamental ways in which gravitational waves interact with matter. These findings contribute to our understanding of quantum gravity and its observable effects in macroscopic systems. We demonstrate how the quantum graviton energy approach to detecting gravitons succeeds in predicting the measured observatory measurement of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra arms displacement \Delta L\sim 10^{-18}m."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06257v1,Schouten-Codazzi Gravity,"We propose a new phenomenological second order gravity theory to be denoted as ”Schouten-Codazzi’ Gravity” (SCG), as it is based on Schouten and Codazzi tensors. The theory is related, but is clearly distinct from Cotton Gravity. By assuming as source the energy momentum of General Relativity, we form a second order system with its geometric sector given by the sum of the Schouten tensor and a generic second order symmetric tensor complying with the following properties: (i) it must satisfy the Codazzi differential condition and (ii) it must be concomitant with the invariant characterization based on the algebraic structure of curvature tensors for specific spacetimes or classes of spacetimes. We derive and briefly discuss the properties of SCG solutions for static spherical symmetry (vacuum and perfect fluid), FLRW models and spherical dust fluids. While we do recognize that SCG is “work in progress” in an incipient stage that still requires significant theoretical development, we believe that the theory provides valuable guidelines in the search for alternatives to General Relativity.","Detection of dark sector sources and understanding their fundamental properties is a major research topic in contemporary theoretical physics. Unfortunately, progress on this task has remained elusive, thus motivating the search of gravity theories alternative to General Relativity. Among the various alternatives, J. Harada [1] proposed in 2021 a third order theory, “Cotton Gravity”, based on the third rank Cotton tensor [2, 3]. Harada’s theory can be derived from the conformal action [4] varying the connection and keeping the metric fixed. Harada showed that all solutions of General Relativity are also solutions of the new theory, derived a Schwarzschild-like exact solution and used [5] the weak field limit to fit galactic rotation curves without assuming the existence of dark matter. 111Harada proposed a separate theory denoted by ”Conformal Killing Gravity” (CKG) [6, 7] (see also [8]), which is a manifestly distinct from “Cotton Gravity”.. However, Harada’s Cotton Gravity theory has received little attention, since it exhibits serious shortcomings [9]: it cannot be applied to non-trivial conformally flat spacetimes (such as FLRW models) because the Cotton tensor vanishes identically when the Weyl tensor vanishes [10, 11]. It leads to underdetermination in highly symmetric spacetimes and presents ambiguities in identifying field sources (see [9] and a response in [12]). An alternative formulation was found by Mantica and Molinari [13], based on the known fact that the field equations of Cotton Gravity result by demanding that the second order Schouten tensor S_{ab} and its associated source tensor {\cal T}_{ab} (linearly related to the energy momentum tensor of GR) are both Codazzi tensors (i.e. satisfy the Codazzi differential condition). Mantica and Molinari also examined the mathematical properties of Codazzi tensors: their relation with curvature tensors [14, 15, 16] and in [13] their compatibility with different fluid sources and solutions of General Relativity. In another article these authors used their paramerization to examine and classify Friedman equations of various alternative theories [17]. However, as long as the Schouten tensor is subjected to the condition to be itself a Codazzi tensor, the parametrization of Mantica and Molinari is simply the usage of different intermediate variables for the same Cotton Gravity theory. In the present article we propose a second order phenomenological theory: “Schouten-Codazzi Gravity” (SCG), that is related, but is clearly distinct from Cotton Gravity, since it follows from a modification of the roles of the Schouten and Codazzi tensors in the formulation of Cotton Gravity by Mantica and Molinari. We do not demand that the Schouten tensor S_{ab} and its source tensor {\cal T}_{ab} to be both Codazzi tensors, as this would necessarily lead back to Cotton Gravity field equations. Instead, we form new second order field equations with the energy momentum of General Relativity and the geometric sector (left hand side) given by the Schouten tensor plus a generic symmetric tensor {\cal F}_{ab} subjected to the following conditions: it must (i) encode the invariant symmetries that characterize the geometric sector of the field equations for specific spacetimes (or classes of spacetimes) and energy momentum tensors and (ii) satisfy the Codazzi differential condition. It is important to justify the specific build up of the generic tensor {\cal F}_{ab}. Condition (i) follows from the common algebraic structure of second order symmetric tensors in spacetime manifolds, which includes all Ricci-like tensors like its trace-free form, the Einstein and Schouten tensors [18, 19, 20]. Since the generic {\cal F}_{ab} must be prescribed to determine the field equations, it must be functionally related before solving the field equations to the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Ricci and Ricci-like tensors in an algebraic decomposition in orthonormal or suitable null tetrads. This decomposition is conventionally encoded in a Segré-Weiler and/or Plebañski notation [21, 22] (see summary in Chapter 5 of [10]) and relates to all curvature and energy momentum tensors [23, 24, 25, 26, 27] (even in f(R) theories [28]). Condition (ii) allows to fully determine the functional relation between {\cal F}_{ab} and eigenvalues of the Ricci or Ricci-like tensors through its compliance with the Codazzi differential condition. Besides this fact, Codazzi tensors are Riemann and Ricci compatible, proven by Mantica and Molinari in [14, 15, 16] and also in their cited references. We also consider the results on the compatibility between Codazzi tensors and different forms of energy momentum tensors discussed in [13] and in Chapter 37 of [10]. Following the steps outlined above, we probe the phenomenological SCG theory by obtaining exact solutions for three classes of spacetimes: static spherical symmetry (vacuum and perfect fluids), FLRW spacetimes and general spherical solutions with a dust source, with {\cal F}_{ab} prescribed in terms of the eigenvalues of the Ricci or Einstein tensors before solving the field equations. These analytic solutions generalize known general relativistic solutions with same symmetries. In the static vacuum case, we recover the Schwarzschild-like solution found by Harada [1], plus a solution that violates Birkhoff’s theorem, but has unphysical features. In static perfect fluid spacetimes the extra free parameters introduce significant modifications to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equilibrium equation. In the FLRW models SCG introduces an extra linear accelerating term that can be useful in observational Cosmology. We briefly comment on the physical properties of these solutions, but a deeper examination would require a separate article. While SCG does not require the computation of the Cotton tensor, we can still recover Cotton Gravity by applying the Codazzi differential condition to the second order field equations. Hence, all SCG solutions (including the ones we derived) are a restricted subset of solutions of Cotton Gravity, which being a third order theory contains many more solutions that are not solutions of the proposed theory. However, SCG solutions avoid the underdetermination seen in Cotton Gravity [9, 12]. Evidently, the present article is a first step to explore the viability of the proposed SCG theory. We openly recognize that our proposal is still in an incipient stage, it is “work in progress’ that requires much more theoretical development. There are still elements of ambiguity and potential underdetermination and we still need to show that its field equations can be derived from a variational principle. Since it is a second order theory, it avoids “phantom” solutions that plague hight order theories, also its field equations are much more tractable than those of Cotton Gravity or alternative theories of higher order derivatives. The shortcomings of Cotton Gravity emerge from the properties of the Cotton tensor, but these can be avoided or (at least) significantly ameliorated because it does not require the computation of this tensor. The theory we have presented is logically self-consistent and has a well defined correspondence limit with General Relativity (the vanishing of the prospective Codazzi tensor). Therefore, we believe that it merits further development. The section by section content of this paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the field equations of SCG to highlight its difference with Cotton Gravity. Section 3 summarizes the invariant classification of second order symmetric tensors in 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds. Section 4 summarizes the properties of Codazzi tensors. Section 5 discusses the problems of assuming an “effective” Einstein format for the field equations of SCG. Section 6 derives various exact solutions as ’test cases’ to probe SCG. We summarize in Section 7 the geometric properties of the Codazzi and Schouten tensors. A final discussion and our conclusions are stated in Section 8, while A and B provide details on calculations done in Section 6."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06188v1,The thermodynamic profile of AdS black holes in Lorentz invariance-violating Bumblebee and Kalb-Ramond gravity,"Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) is a topic of significant interest in quantum gravity and in extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Recently, new classes of black hole solutions have been proposed, involving vector fields and rank-two antisymmetric tensor fields that acquire nontrivial vacuum expectation values, resulting in the Bumblebee and Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity models, respectively. These models exhibit novel geometric structures and differ in notable ways from standard Einstein gravity. In this study, we examine neutral anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes within the context of LIV backgrounds, focusing on their thermodynamic properties through two distinct approaches. The first approach utilizes the free energy landscape framework, revealing substantial modifications to the conventional Hawking-Page phase transition. Specifically, LIV effects can alter the stability regimes of black holes and thermal AdS phases, potentially leading to overlapping thermodynamic regimes that would otherwise remain distinct. This suggests that LIV introduces complex modifications to the phase behavior of black holes, offering new insights into their stability characteristics. The second approach involves thermodynamic Ruppeiner geometry, which provides a window into the microstructure of black holes via a well-defined scalar curvature. In general, LIV effects are negligible for larger black holes, which behave like an ideal gas with no significant interactions among their constituents. However, at shorter length scales, the presence of LIV can induce multiple stable and unstable phase transitions, depending on the specific gravity model and the magnitude of LIV effects considered. Finally, we analyze particle emission rates associated with Hawking evaporation in these models. While Bumblebee and Kalb-Ramond gravity share several similarities, we identify distinctive signatures arising from their underlying physical mechanisms. These differences may provide key observational and theoretical constraints for testing LIV effects in black hole physics.","Central to the foundations of modern physics, Lorentz symmetry posits the equivalence of physical laws across all inertial frames. Its testable aspects have consistently demonstrated it to be a fundamental symmetry governing physical phenomena in the Universe Mariz et al. (2023); Tasson (2014). However, recent advancements in various domains of physics have indicated potential violations of this symmetry. Notable examples include string theory Kostelecky and Samuel (1989a); Bluhm and Kostelecky (2005), loop quantum gravity Alfaro et al. (2002); Gambini and Pullin (1999), noncommutative field theory Carroll et al. (2001), massive gravity Dubovsky et al. (2005), Einstein-Aether theory Jacobson and Mattingly (2001), and Hořava-Lifshitz gravity Horava (2009). Such findings have significant implications for our understanding of fundamental physics. These efforts can be viewed as part of the ongoing endeavor to unify gravity with quantum field theory and particle physics, encapsulated in the effective field theory known as the Standard Model Extension (SME) Liberati (2013). Within this framework, it is commonly posited that potential signatures of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) may emerge near the Planck scale Kostelecky (2004), providing a promising avenue for the pursuit of a consistent theory of quantum gravity. Some of the earliest efforts to comprehend the electromagnetic sector of the SME are documented in the literature Colladay and Kostelecky (2001); Kostelecky and Lehnert (2001); Kostelecky and Lane (1999); Yoder and Adkins (2012). Similarly, investigations into the electroweak Colladay and McDonald (2009); Mouchrek-Santos and Ferreira (2017) and strong interactions Abazov et al. (2012); Berger et al. (2016) within the SME framework have also gained traction in recent years. Furthermore, significant efforts have been devoted to understanding the gravitational aspects of the SME Bluhm and Kostelecky (2005); Bailey (2009); Tso and Bailey (2011); Maluf et al. (2013); Bluhm et al. (2008a); Bailey and Kostelecky (2006). In addition to this theoretical framework, experimental and observational investigations into Lorentz violation are also being pursued Amelino-Camelia et al. (1998); Mattingly (2005); Tasson (2014); Addazi et al. (2022); Piran and Ofengeim (2024); Cao et al. (2024). Nontrivial LIV can arise in either an explicit or spontaneous manner. Explicit violation occurs when the Lagrangian density of a theory lacks Lorentz symmetry, resulting in physical laws that take different forms in different reference frames. In contrast, spontaneous violation of Lorentz symmetry arises when the Lagrangian density retains Lorentz symmetry, yet the ground state of the physical system does not Kostelecky (2004). Our focus here is on spontaneous symmetry breaking, which can occur for various reasons. A notable example involves a vector field acquiring a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV), resulting in a preferred directionality in spacetime and thus spontaneously breaking local Lorentz invariance for particles. These entities are referred to as Bumblebee fields, and the associated framework within the gravitational sector is commonly known as Bumblebee gravity Kostelecky and Samuel (1989b, c); Bailey and Kostelecky (2006); Bluhm et al. (2008b). Over the past decade, Bumblebee gravity has assumed a prominent role in black hole physics. Casana et al. Casana et al. (2018) proposed a solution for a spherically symmetric black hole within the framework of Bumblebee gravity, which was subsequently extended to incorporate a cosmological constant Maluf and Neves (2021). Several important dynamics of these models—such as thermodynamics Mai et al. (2023); An (2024), Hawking radiation Kanzi and Sakallı (2019), gravitational lensing Ovgün et al. (2018), accretion phenomena Yang et al. (2019); Cai and Yang (2023), field propagation and quasinormal modes Oliveira et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2023), and gravitational waves Amarilo et al. (2024)—have unveiled a rich array of interesting phenomenological implications of LIV. Additionally, observational imprints of Bumblebee gravity in relation to the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) were examined in Xu et al. (2023). Another intriguing scenario for spontaneous LIV arises from a rank-two antisymmetric tensor field present in bosonic string theories, known as the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field Kalb and Ramond (1974); Altschul et al. (2010). This field has been extensively studied in various contexts, particularly its implications for black hole dynamics Kao et al. (1996); Kar et al. (2003); Chakraborty and SenGupta (2017); Kumar et al. (2020), cosmology Nair and Thomas (2022), and braneworld scenarios Mukhopadhyaya et al. (2004); Fu et al. (2012). This gravitational model, commonly referred to as KR gravity, also posits a nonzero VEV for the KR field, which spontaneously breaks Lorentz invariance. Recently, spherically symmetric black hole solutions in KR gravity have been derived in Refs. Lessa et al. (2020); Yang et al. (2023a), with additional generic extensions identified in Liu et al. (2024). Similar to Bumblebee gravity, the black hole solutions in KR gravity have provided significant insights into LIV. These findings have far-reaching consequences for the photon sphere, shadow radii, and particle orbits Filho et al. (2024); Duan et al. (2024); Du et al. (2024), as well as for lensing effects Junior et al. (2024); Filho (2024) and quasinormal modes Guo et al. (2024). Some cosmological implications of KR gravity have been explored in Maluf and Neves (2022). Additionally, the thermodynamic aspects of these black hole solutions in KR gravity have been addressed in a few studies Duan et al. (2024); Liu et al. (2024). LIV physics, being integral to various fundamental aspects of symmetries associated with spacetime geometries Mariz et al. (2023), has also played a significant role in reexamining the Bekenstein-Hawking thermodynamics of classical black hole geometries. LIV effects contribute to black hole geometry in ways that source thermodynamic phenomena. Notably, the entropy-area scaling of the Bekenstein-Hawking framework remains preserved in classical black hole geometries within LIV backgrounds Yang et al. (2023a); Duan et al. (2024); Liu et al. (2024). Nevertheless, LIV frameworks yield insights into novel physics. For instance, it has been observed that anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes in LIV contexts may not adhere to the reverse isoperimetric inequality Cvetic et al. (2011), which posits that the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole maximizes entropy relative to other black hole solutions. Over the past few decades, black hole thermodynamics indeed emerged as a significant area of exploration. However, despite this progress, it remains only partially understood Davies (1978); Page (2005). This is particularly true for the case of a negative cosmological constant—specifically, AdS space—which is treated as thermodynamic pressure Dolan (2011a, b). This framework has led to a class of thermodynamic phenomena, including the Hawking-Page phase transition Hawking and Page (1983) in neutral black holes. Similarly, charged black holes exhibit van der Waals-like phases Chamblin et al. (1999a, b); Kastor et al. (2009). This intriguing aspect of black hole thermodynamics is commonly referred to as extended phase space thermodynamics—or more engagingly, black hole chemistry Kubiznak et al. (2017). Various methods have been proposed over time to understand the thermodynamic degrees of freedom associated with black holes. A notable approach is thermodynamic geometry Ruppeiner (1995, 2014), which has been extensively utilized in this context over the years. This approach aims to reveal the underlying microscopic constituents of the thermodynamic degrees of freedom of black holes. Free energy landscape theory Spallucci and Smailagic (2013); Li and Wang (2020) has also provided valuable insights in this area Ali et al. (2023); Li and Wang (2023); Liu et al. (2023). Additionally, Lyapunov exponents Guo and Li (2020); Du et al. (2024); Yang et al. (2023b); Kumara et al. (2024) have recently been proposed as a means to understand black hole thermodynamic phase transitions. The powerful role of black hole thermodynamics in probing quantum aspects of spacetime motivates the study of AdS black holes within LIV frameworks, with the simplest cases being neutral black holes in Bumblebee gravity as proposed in Ref. Maluf and Neves (2021) and in KR gravity described in Refs. Yang et al. (2023a); Liu et al. (2024). For this analysis, we utilize the well-established free energy landscape approach Spallucci and Smailagic (2013); Li and Wang (2020) to demonstrate how LIV effects lead to significant modifications in the conventional understanding of Hawking-Page transition theory. Additionally, to investigate the microstructure of black holes, we apply Ruppeiner thermodynamic geometry, calculating the associated scalar curvatures to identify potential stability and instability regimes across different black hole sizes. Subsequently, we compute the energy emission rates, demonstrating the impact of LIV on these rates. Concerning the operational definitions, we note that the KR black hole solution proposed in Yang et al. (2023a) is “symmetric” with respect to its metric components, whereas the solution in Liu et al. (2024) is asymmetric111The terms “symmetric” and “asymmetric” KR models are our convention introduced to distinguish between these two formulations.. This choice of metric symmetry significantly influences the resulting geometric and thermodynamic structure, as we will discuss in detail. The organization of this work is as follows. In the next section, we provide a study of LIV Bumblebee and KR gravity, including key definitions and a description of the horizon geometry for black holes within these gravitational frameworks. Section III addresses the computation of essential thermodynamic potentials and examines the physical implications of LIV effects. In Section IV, we analyze how LIV modifies the Hawking-Page phase transition. Section V is dedicated to the free energy landscape analysis for these black holes, exploring the impact of LIV on their thermodynamic stability. We then investigate the thermodynamic curvature analysis in Section VI to assess how LIV influences microstructural interactions. Energy emission rates are computed in Section VII, providing insights into LIV’s effects on black hole radiation. Finally, Section VIII presents a summary of our key findings and their broader implications."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06164v1,A Fluid-Membrane Description of the BTZ Black Hole,"The 2+1 dimensional Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole has proved to be a remarkably efficient tool to test ideas about quantum aspects of gravity and holography. Here, we provide a classical fluid-membrane description of this geometry, both in static and rotating versions, that defines a dynamical viscous Newtonian fluid with non-trivial transport coefficients, mimicking the black hole. The membrane paradigm for black holes in four or more dimensions usually yields fluids with a negative bulk viscosity, which is a problem because it yields decreasing total entropy in thermal processes according to Stokes’ hypothesis. However, the (rotating) BTZ black hole has a zero bulk viscosity and is amenable to a physically viable fluid membrane description at thermal equilibrium.","For an external observer, the spacetime inside the event horizon of the black hole, including the event horizon, is out of reach of observations. This basic fact led researchers to introduce an effective description of the black hole by a timelike fluid-membrane infinitesimally close to the event horizon. Being a timelike codimension one hypersurface, the fluid has observable properties local in time, unlike the event horizon which is highly nonlocal in time [1]. The origin of the membrane paradigm111The name ”membrane paradigm” was coined in [3], and the authors worked out many details about the membrane description. approach can be traced back to 1979 when Damour published a paper on black holes titled ""Eddy’s Currents"" [2]. The membrane has electrical conductivity, shear \& bulk viscosities through transport coefficients [3]. A careful calculation on the horizon led to Ohm’s law, Joule’s law, and the non-relativistic Navier-Stokes equation [4]. More recently, an action formulation of the membrane paradigm was given by Parikh and Wilczek [5] who considered the Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) boundary term, not as a term to be added to the boundary at infinity but as a boundary term on a timelike hypersurface that envelopes the event horizon. Since the surface is not null, it has a non-degenerate metric, it provides a good approximation to the behavior of the true event horizon. This membrane approach has been carried out for four-dimensional black holes, and recently we constructed a membrane picture of a non-Einsteinian black hole [6] in four dimensions. Here we shall find the membrane that mimics the Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole [7]: a (2+1) dimensional Einstein spacetime, with a negative cosmological constant, that admits a black hole structure; moreover acts as a final state of a collapsing matter [8]. The existence of the cosmological constant drastically affects the construction of the membrane, one requires a regularized energy-momentum tensor on the boundary. The structure of this paper is as follows, in the first section we briefly review the membrane paradigm of black holes. In the second section, we reformulate the 2+1+1 splitting ideas in 4D black holes to the 1+1+1 splitting of (2+1)-D BTZ black holes, we will identify its transport coefficients as if the stretched horizon is a viscous Newtonian fluid. In the third section, we will apply the paradigm to the black hole’s rotating version. The rotating BTZ black hole will again have a zero bulk viscosity by the approach [9]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06075v2,Barrow Cosmology and Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis,"Using thermodynamics-gravity conjecture, we present the formal derivation of the modified Friedmann equations inspired by the Barrow entropy, S\sim A^{1+\delta/2}, where 0\leq\delta\leq 1 is the Barrow exponent and A is the horizon area. We then constrain the exponent \delta by using Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) observational data. In order to impose the upper bound on the Barrow exponent \delta, we set the observational bound on \left|\frac{\delta T_{f}}{T_{f}}\right|. We find out that the Barrow parameter \delta should be around \delta\simeq 0.01 in order not to spoil the BBN era. Next we derive the bound on the Barrow exponent \delta in a different approach in which we analyze the effects of Barrow cosmology on the primordial abundances of light elements i.e. Helium {}^{4}\textit{He}, Deuterium D and Lithium {}^{7}\textit{Li}. We observe that the deviation from standard Bekenstein-Hawking expression is small as expected. Additionally we present the relation between cosmic time t and temperature T in the context of modified Barrow cosmology. We confirm that the temperature of the early universe increases as the Barrow exponent \delta (fractal structure of the horizon) increases, too.","After the discovery of the black hole thermodynamics as well as four laws of black hole mechanics Bardeen ; Bekenstein ; Hawking , the profound connection between gravity and thermodynamics has been speculated. In particular, the derivation of the Einstein field equation of gravity from the first law of thermodynamics by Jacobson Jacobson , reveals that gravity is nothing but the thermodynamics of spacetime at large scales. The deep connection between gravity and thermodynamics has been confirmed in different setups Verlinde ; Padman ; Padmann . In the background of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, it has been shown that Friedmann equations describing the evolution of the universe can be translated to the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon Eling ; Akbar ; MAkbar ; Cai ; Asheykhi ; Sheykh . The studies were also generalized to the modified cosmological models, based on the modification of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law of entropy associated with the horizon Paranj ; Jamil ; Caiii ; Wang ; Setare ; Fan ; Tsheykhi . An interesting modification to the area law was proposed by J. D. Barrow, who argued that black hole horizon may have a fractal structure due to quantum fluctuations JohnD . In this viewpoint, quantum-gravitational effects may deform the black hole horizon which can be described by a fractal structure as a first approximation JohnD . Consequently the black hole entropy gets a deviation from the standard Bekenstein-Hawking area law, and is modified as John S_{h}=\left(\frac{A}{A_{0}}\right)^{1+\delta/2}, (1) where A is the horizon area and A_{0} is the Planck area. The exponent \delta ranges in the interval 0\leq\delta\leq 1, and it shows the amount of quantum-gravitational deformation effects John ; HawkingS ; Hooft . The extreme values \delta=1 stands for the most deformed and intricate structure, while for \delta=0, the area law of entropy will be restored (A_{0}\rightarrow 4G) Shey1 . In the framework of thermodynamics-gravity conjecture, it was argued that one can derive the friedmann equations of FRW universe by applying the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon. In this derivation, the entropy expression plays a crucial role. Any modification to the area law, shall modify the corresponding Friedmann equations. Therefore, by applying the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon, and using the modified Barrow entropy (1) instead of Bekenstin-Hawking one, one can get the modified Friedmann equations Shey1 which leads to a so-called modified Barrow cosmology Shey2 . The Barrow exponent \delta con be constrained by using observational data. For example, using BBN data one can impose constraints on the exponent of Barrow entropy John . It was shown that the Barrow exponent should be \delta<1.4\times 10^{-4} in order not to spoil the BBN epoch. This implies that the deviation from standard area law of entropy should be small as expected John . BBN refers to the process that took place in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was extremely hot and dense. BBN occurred roughly between the very first centiseconds after the Big-Bang (\sim 0.01 sec) and a few hundred seconds (\sim 3 minutes) after it. During BBN, the temperature of the universe allows for nuclear reactions to occur, leading to the formation of light elements such as H, He and Li. As the universe expanded and cooled, these reactions slowed down and eventually stopped, resulting in the abundance of these light elements observed today. Hence BBN, together with cosmic microwave background radiation provide a strong evidence of the hot, dense state of the early universe. In general, the principles of BBN allows to impose strict constraints on various cosmological models. The main idea is to demand consistency between theoretical predictions, and BBN observational data. In this regard, the deviation of the freeze-out temperature in comparison to standard cosmological model can be calculated. This allows to compare the theoretical results of the modified cosmological models with the observational constraints on \left|\frac{\delta T_{f}}{T_{f}}\right|John ; Luciano ; Anish . A modified cosmological model can also affect the primordial abundances of aforementioned light elements in the early universe Anish . It is important to note that although the standard BBN theory successfully explains the observed amounts of elements like Helium and Hydrogen, it encounters significant issues when it comes to Lithium Boran . This leads to what is known as the cosmological Lithium problem, which is a highly debated topic in the modern cosmology. It is interesting to check whether this problem can be addressed in the framework of the modified cosmology or not. The aim is to investigate the the cosmological Lithium problem in the background of the modified cosmology, to check under which conditions and which values for the model parameter, it can be alleviated. Our aim in this paper is to explore the implications of Barrow cosmology on the BBN and derive constraints on Barrow exponent \delta. In this regards, we can check the viability of the Barrow cosmology by imposing the BBN conditions. The most important difference between this work and the approach presented in John is that we modify the left-hand side of the Friedmann equations (the geometry side), while in John the authors modify Friedmann equations in such a way that the Barrow entropy correction appears as an additional energy density \rho_{de} and pressure p_{de} which resemble dark energy components in the right-hand side of the Friedmann equations. Additionally, in deriving the modified Friedmann equations from first law of thermodynamics, we neglect the integration constant, while in John the integration constant is interpreted as the cosmological constant which influences the dynamics of the universe. Furthermore, we should also note that different approximations were employed in our approach compared to that in John . We also present the relation between cosmic time t and temperature T in the early universe and in the context of the modified Barrow cosmology which is novel and has not been addressed in the literature. We will see that the temperature of the early universe increases as the fractal structure of the boundary of our universe increases. The structure of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we apply the first law of thermodynamics, dE=T_{h}dS_{h}+WdV on the apparent horizon, and construct the modified Friedmann equations based on Barrow entropy. In section III, we use BBN data in the background of the modified barrow cosmology to constrain the Barrow exponent \delta. We also present the relation between time and temperature in the context of Barrow cosmology in this section. We finish with closing remarks in section V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06007v1,Quantum corrected black holes: testing the correspondence between grey-body factors and quasinormal modes,"Grey-body factors and quasinormal modes are two distinct characteristics of radiation near black holes, each associated with different boundary conditions. Nevertheless, a correspondence exists between them, which we use to calculate the grey-body factors of three recently constructed quantum-corrected black hole models. Our findings demonstrate that the grey-body factors are significantly influenced by the quantum corrections for some of the models under consideration, and the correspondence holds with reasonable accuracy across all three models. We confirm that the grey-body factors are less sensitive to the near-horizon corrections of the spacetime, because the grey-body factors are reproduced via the correspondence using only the fundamental mode and the first overtone.","Grey-body factors and quasinormal modes of black holes are two distinct characteristics that arise from different boundary conditions. Grey-body factors measure the fraction of total radiation flux that penetrates the potential barrier and reaches a distant observer. They are calculated under the assumption that both incoming and outgoing radiation exist between the event horizon and the peak of the potential barrier. These boundary conditions correspond to a scattering problem and are frequently used in the analysis of black hole Hawking radiation [1, 2, 3, 4] or superradiance phenomena [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In contrast, quasinormal modes are complex proper oscillation frequencies of black holes that do not permit incoming radiation either from the event horizon or from infinity. These modes dominate the black hole’s response to external perturbations during the ringdown phase and are observed by gravitational wave interferometers [12, 13]. Despite their differing boundary conditions, recent research suggests a potential link between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors in the high-frequency regime [14, 15]. Grey-body factors, in fact, appear to be more stable geometric characteristics than quasinormal modes when small static deformations of the geometry are imposed [16, 17]. An exact correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors has been established in the high-frequency limit for spherically symmetric black holes [18] and extended to certain axially symmetric black holes [19]. This correspondence is precise in the eikonal limit and is based on the WKB approximation. Consequently, in cases where the eikonal limit is not accurately described by the WKB method—such as in some theories with higher curvature corrections [20, 21, 22]—the correspondence may fail or may only apply to those parts of the spectrum that are well approximated by the WKB method [23]. However, even for cases that support this correspondence, the accuracy of the relationship beyond the eikonal limit remains an open question. To test this correspondence, it is necessary to select a range of black hole models and compare the grey-body factors derived from precise quasinormal mode calculations with accurate grey-body factors obtained numerically or through other sufficiently precise methods. In this work, we employ the 6th-order WKB approach [24, 25, 26] as a reliable method, at least for gravitational perturbations beginning from \ell=2, as demonstrated in numerous studies on both quasinormal modes and grey-body factors [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. To test the correspondence, we consider a quantum-corrected black hole for which quasinormal modes have been previously calculated. The literature on various models of quantum-corrected black holes, their quasinormal spectra, and grey-body factors is extensive (see, for example, [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 37, 50]). The specific black hole models we examine in this test were recently obtained in [51, 52] following the general Hamiltonian constraints approach [53, 54]. This framework yields two qualitatively distinct solutions. The first solution addresses the long-standing issue of general covariance in spherically symmetric gravity, which arises when constructing a semiclassical model of black holes within canonical quantum gravity [51]. In this context, two distinct black hole models are proposed, each depending on the choice of a quantum parameter. The second solution emerges within the framework of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder model in loop quantum cosmology, where the energy-momentum tensor contributes quantum corrections to the Schwarzschild spacetime [52]. While quasinormal modes for these black hole models have been examined in several recent studies [55, 56, 57, 57, 58, 59], no similar analysis has been conducted for grey-body factors, except in [60], where grey-body factors were estimated for certain test fields. However, that study did not include gravitational perturbations, and were calculated with the low order WKB method implying insufficient accuracy. Thus, our work not only tests the correspondence but also supplements the existing literature on grey-body factors of quantum-corrected black holes. Using the precise values of quasinormal modes found in [61], we calculate the grey-body factors of the gravitational field through the correspondence developed in [18] up to order \ell^{-2}. We then compare these results with the 6th-order WKB formula, which is known to be highly accurate for gravitational perturbations. Our findings demonstrate that the correspondence is a sufficiently precise and effective tool for determining the grey-body factors of black holes, maintaining an error below a few percents for the near extreme black holes and within one percent for moderate values of the quantum coupling. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly describe the three black hole models and the wave equation for axial gravitational perturbations. Sec. III presents the calculation of grey-body factors using the correspondence with quasinormal modes and test of the accuracy of this correspondence. Finally, in the Conclusions, we summarize and discuss our results."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05911v1,Field Equations in Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity,"We investigate the effects of Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet gravity on fundamental metrics. This theory involves perturbative corrections to general relativity, as well as two scalar fields, the axion and the dilaton, that arise from Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet gravity modifications respectively. The combined Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is motivated by a wide range of theoretical and phenomenological perspectives, including particle physics, string theory, and parity violation in the gravitational sector. In this work, we provide the complete set of field equations and equations of motion of the Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity theory for a suite of fundamental metrics (Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker, Schwarzschild, spherically symmetric, and perturbed Minkowski), under no prior assumptions on the behavior of the fields. The full set of field equations and equations of motion can be numerically solved and applied to specific observables under certain assumptions, and can be used to place constraints on the Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity theory.","Einstein’s theory of general relativity (GR) has been shown to agree remarkably well with observations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Despite these successes, there are strong theoretical and experimental arguments that point to the need for extensions to the current formulation of GR. From the theoretical point of view, challenges toward a quantum theory of gravity suggest that GR may require modifications in the strong field regime [10]. These corrections are generally motivated from a high-energy ultraviolet theory that at low energies leads to corrections to GR as an effective field theory (see e.g. [11]). Moreover, there are a wide range of modified gravity theories and extensions to GR that may be motivated from the fact that GR is non-renormalizable at high energies (for a review on the topic see e.g., [12, 13]). From the experimental side, although tests of GR such as the observations of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration have thus far not observed significant deviations, modified gravity theories can have a variety of effects on gravitational waves, which can be characterized by modifications to the gravitational wave amplitude and/or phase. Extensive work has been done to derive the gravitational wave modifications induced by certain modified gravity theories, with the idea that such effects may be detectable by future generation detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) [14] or Einstein Telescope (ET) [15]. However even though gravitational wave waveforms can be used to test GR, the experimental indication that gravity may not be described exactly by GR comes from cosmology. Even though the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric is admitted as a solution to the field equations of GR, the presence of a dark energy with a negative equation of state, imposed by a plethora of independent experiments, is rather unsettling and has led to many ideas on how GR can accommodate such behavior on the largest scales [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. More recently, ever increasing precision observations of the expansion rate of the universe has led to a disagreement between different cosmological observations [21]. Dubbed as the Hubble and S_{8} tensions, the experimentally obtained value of the present-day expansion of the universe measured locally [22] seems to be in a disagreement with the value inferred from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [23] under a \Lambda Cold Dark Matter (\Lambda\text{CDM}) cosmological model [24]. A disagreement (albeit at a lesser significance) is also showcased in amplitude measurements of the variance of fluctuations on scales of 8\text{h}^{-1}\text{Mpc} (\sigma_{8}), or equivalently S_{8} (S_{8}\equiv\sigma_{8}\sqrt{\Omega_{m}/0.3}, where \Omega_{m} is the matter density in the universe) [25], obtained from the CMB [23] and late universe measurements of a wide range of low redshift probes [26, 27, 28]. Solutions to the observed disagreements have been explored extensively in literature [29, 30], from the reshuffling of energy densities at different epochs in the expansion history, such as early dark energy [31], or changes in the microphysics that governs the universe at small scales, e.g., decaying dark matter [32]. A different method of proposed solutions can be motivated from a change in our understanding of spacetime as used in cosmology, with modifications to GR having also been proposed as alternatives to inflation, dark matter, and dark energy (e.g., [13, 33, 34, 35]). In GR, the spacetime manifold is the central object of study; different assumptions when solving the Einstein field equations result in different solutions. If one modifies GR, then the field equations will also be modified, thus changing their solutions. At each position in the manifold, there is a choice to be made besides the coordinate system; one must also choose the values that dictate the geometrical and casual structure of the manifold, i.e. what metric the manifold takes [36]. The equations of motion provide a prescription to describe past and future events through the geometrical connection between curvature and stress-energy, since energy-momentum from all sources affects the geometry of spacetime. As such, modifications to the field equations can be thought of as additional effects to the geometry through changes to the curvature and stress-energy, describing regions of the manifold where unmodified GR is ill-defined. It is thus appealing to explore the effects of such modifications under various metrics. One well-studied modification of GR is Chern-Simons gravity111In almost all instances in this paper, we will be referring to the dynamical formulation of Chern-Simons gravity, known as dynamical Chern-Simons gravity [37]., which can be motivated from the context of particle physics [38, 39] and leptogenesis [40, 41], as well as in other areas such as string theory [42, 43, 44] and loop quantum gravity [45, 46, 47]. Furthermore, from a phenomenological perspective, such a theory could give rise to parity violation in the gravitational sector [48, 49, 37, 50, 51] and the CMB [52, 53, 54, 55, 56]. Gauss-Bonnet gravity is another well-motivated modified gravity theory, initially arising from an attempt to generalize GR [57, 58, 59, 60]; it has also been suggested to arise from string theory [61, 62, 63, 64, 65]. Its phenomenological implications have been extensively studied, including its predicted effect on compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars [66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74], and its implications for inflation [75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80]. It is well-known that Gauss-Bonnet gravity appears in the 4D gravitational theory predicted by heterotic string theory [81, 82, 83, 84]222In string theory, the heterotic string is a mixture of the right-moving sector of the superstring and the left-moving sector of the bosonic string., but recently it was shown that Gauss-Bonnet gravity alone cannot be the full theory in four dimensions, as it lacks an axion field. However, an axion field can arise from Chern-Simons gravity; thus, the full 4D gravitational theory coming from the heterotic string is in fact a combination of Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet gravities, a result that does not depend on the choice of compactification [85]. We refer to this theory as Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet (CS-GB) gravity. It is imperative to attempt to obtain an experimental signature of any modification to GR. In this paper, we study how field equations are changed in CS-GB gravity, in a set of commonly used and in some ways testable metric inputs. This can be thought of as a first attempt in quantifying “observational” signatures of CS-GB gravity. In a subsequent paper, we plan to solve the resulting field equations under observational constraints and thus obtain a direct handle at the level to which CS-GB gravity is an allowed modification to GR. The outline for this paper is as follows: after reviewing the theory and modified field equations in Sec. II, we compute the effects of the modified theory on various metrics in Sec. III. We discuss directions for future work and conclude in Sec. IV. Throughout this paper, we use geometric units such that G=c=1, and we assume a (-,+,+,+) metric signature; Greek letters (\mu,\nu,…) range over all spacetime coordinates, Latin letters (i,j,…) range over spatial indices, square brackets denote anti-symmetrization over indices, and derivatives take the form \partial_{\alpha}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\alpha}}."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07173v1,"Optical Properties, Quasinormal Modes and Greybody factors of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes","We investigate the temperature, photon and shadow radii, quasinormal modes (QNMs), greybody factors, and emission rates of deformed AdS black holes, focusing on the effects of the deformation parameter \alpha and control parameter \beta. Increasing \alpha enhances the oscillation frequency and damping rate of gravitational waves, while \beta shows non-linear behaviour. Electromagnetic perturbations exhibit similar trends, though with lower frequencies and damping rates. Greybody factors are mainly influenced by multipole moment l and \alpha, with \beta having a more subtle effect. These findings provide insights into black hole dynamics, mergers, and gravitational wave emissions.","The study of black holes has captivated scientists for decades due to their extreme gravitational properties, but their importance extends beyond gravity. Black holes are now recognized as crucial objects for understanding thermodynamic principles in the most extreme conditions of the universe. Black hole thermodynamics, a field that merges the principles of classical thermodynamics with general relativity, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics, has emerged as a fascinating and vital area of research. It not only deepens our understanding of black hole behaviour but also serves as a potential gateway to formulating a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity. Black hole thermodynamics began with a groundbreaking insight by J. D. Bekenstein, who, in the early 1970s, proposed that black holes should possess entropy. His work established a direct relationship between the area of a black hole’s event horizon and its entropy, indicating that the surface area of the horizon could be a measure of the disorder or information content of a black hole Bekenstein:1972tm . This idea transformed the way scientists viewed black holes, not merely as objects that consume matter and energy, but as thermodynamic entities that obey laws analogous to those of classical thermodynamics. Building upon Bekenstein’s work, Stephen Hawking made a revolutionary discovery in 1974 when he demonstrated that black holes can emit radiation, now famously known as Hawking radiation. This radiation arises from quantum mechanical effects near the event horizon, where particle-antiparticle pairs are created, and one of the particles escapes while the other falls into the black hole. Over time, this process causes the black hole to lose mass and eventually evaporate Hawking:1975vcx . Hawking’s discovery challenged the traditional notion of black holes as objects from which nothing can escape and introduced a connection between black hole thermodynamics and quantum mechanics. This discovery also implied that black holes possess a finite temperature, related to their mass and surface area, adding to the richness of their thermodynamic properties Wald:1999vt . The relationship between the area of a black hole’s event horizon and its entropy, formulated by Bekenstein and Hawking, is now considered a cornerstone of black hole thermodynamics. Their collaboration helped define the four laws of black hole thermodynamics, which closely parallel the classical laws of thermodynamics. These laws govern the behaviour of black hole systems in terms of temperature, entropy, and energy conservation Bekenstein:1973ur ; Wald:1999vt ; Bardeen:1973gs ; Georgescu:2021dyo . Specifically, the second law of black hole thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of a black hole cannot decrease, is analogous to the second law of thermodynamics, which dictates that the total entropy of a closed system never decreases. As the field progressed through the 1980s and 1990s, black hole thermodynamics became more intricately connected with quantum mechanics. One of the most significant developments during this period was the introduction of the holographic principle, which postulates that all the information contained within a volume of space can be represented on the boundary of that space. This idea suggests that the physics inside a black hole, or even a more general region of spacetime, can be understood in terms of information encoded on its boundary, hinting at deeper connections between gravity and quantum field theory Wald:1999vt . This concept found concrete application in the AdS/CFT correspondence, a powerful tool in theoretical physics that relates a gravitational theory in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space to a conformal field theory (CFT) on its boundary. Such correspondences have proven invaluable in studying black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity. In recent years, research has continued to explore black hole thermodynamics across a variety of theoretical frameworks, including modified theories of gravity such as string theory and loop quantum gravity Ashtekar:2004eh ; Dvali:2011aa . These modified theories often lead to generalizations or deformations of the traditional thermodynamic laws that apply to black holes. For example, when incorporating the generalized uncertainty principle, a modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to account for quantum gravitational effects, the entropy and temperature of black holes are modified, leading to potentially observable consequences Amelino-Camelia:2000stu ; Ali:2009zq ; Yang:2023nnk . These generalized uncertainty principles are particularly relevant in the context of small black holes or black holes that form in high-energy regimes, such as those potentially produced in particle accelerators. Furthermore, external factors such as electromagnetic fields or the presence of a cosmological constant can significantly alter the thermodynamic behaviour of black holes. For instance, the presence of a cosmological constant, which leads to anti-de Sitter or de Sitter space solutions, introduces new thermodynamic properties and phase transitions in black holes. Such phase transitions, which are akin to those found in classical thermodynamics (such as the transition between solid, liquid, and gas phases), are observed in various black hole solutions, including charged, rotating, and higher-dimensional black holes Kubiznak:2012wp ; Hendi:2012um ; Teitelboim:1985dp ; Gunasekaran:2012dq ; Cvetic:1999ne ; Chamblin:1999tk . In these systems, changes in parameters like charge, angular momentum, or cosmological constant can lead to critical phenomena and phase transitions, which have been a topic of intense study in recent years. For example, research on rotating Kerr-AdS black holes using holographic techniques has provided insights into their phase transitions and thermodynamic properties Gong:2023ywu . Similarly, accelerating black holes and those in lower-dimensional spacetimes offer simplified contexts for studying thermodynamic stability and transitions, contributing to the broader understanding of black hole microstructures Sokoliuk:2023pby ; Singh:2023hit ; Blagojevic:2023kqj ; Xiao:2023lap ; Wu:2022whe . Such studies are crucial for understanding the nature of black hole entropy and the information paradox, one of the most significant unresolved issues in theoretical physics. Phase transitions and critical phenomena have been extensively investigated in black hole thermodynamics Gunasekaran:2012dq ; Cvetic:1999ne ; Chamblin:1999tk . Various types of black holes in different modified gravity theories have also been found to exhibit a wide range of phase transitions Wei:2012ui ; Altamirano:2014tva . Through holographic techniques, rotating Kerr-AdS black holes have been analyzed for their phase transitions and thermodynamic properties Gong:2023ywu , while three-dimensional accelerating black holes provide a more simplified context for such studies Tian:2023ine . The authors of Ref. Sokoliuk:2023pby examined AdS black holes, focusing on their microstructures and stability, contributing to insights related to the AdS/CFT correspondence. In Ref. Singh:2023hit , thermodynamic curvature transitions across different ensembles in charged AdS2 black holes were explored. Charged black holes with scalar fields challenge the no-hair theorem, affecting their entropy, temperature, and phase transitions, as discussed in Ref. Blagojevic:2023kqj . Furthermore, the Iyer-Wald formalism has been used to derive thermodynamic laws for AdS-Kerr black holes, addressing controversies in the field, as studied in Ref. Xiao:2023lap . The impact of topological properties on black hole thermodynamic stability has also been considered Wu:2022whe ; Wei:2021vdx ; Rizwan:2023ivp . Critical points of charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes in AdS were classified in Ref. Yerra:2022alz . Additional studies include the tunneling of charged bosons from noncommutative charged black holes, from which the rate and Hawking temperature were derived Ovgun:2015box , the formulation of thermodynamics and computation of dual stress-energy tensors for accelerating black holes in AdS Anabalon , and the generalization of non-relativistic black hole solutions to include electric charge, exploring their properties Jusufi . In summary, black hole thermodynamics not only enhances our understanding of the fundamental properties of black holes but also plays a central role in the quest for a theory of quantum gravity. Through the study of black hole entropy, temperature, and phase transitions, physicists are uncovering profound connections between gravity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics. As research continues to evolve, black hole thermodynamics remains a fertile ground for exploring some of the deepest questions in theoretical physics. In addition to the thermodynamic properties of black holes, their quasinormal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are critical for understanding the dynamics and observational signatures of these enigmatic objects. Quasinormal modes represent the characteristic oscillations that black holes undergo when they are perturbed Konoplya:2003ii ; Lambiase:2024lvo ; Konoplya:2023ppx ; Konoplya:2023aph ; Konoplya:2022hll ; Konoplya:2019hlu . These oscillations are damped over time due to the emission of gravitational waves, and the frequencies and damping rates of the QNMs are determined by the black hole’s mass, charge, and angular momentum. The study of QNMs provides invaluable insights into the stability of black holes, as well as their interactions with external perturbations. Furthermore, QNMs are directly related to the ringdown phase of gravitational wave signals detected by observatories such as LIGO and Virgo. By analyzing the QNMs from observed gravitational waves, scientists can infer the parameters of the black hole, offering a unique observational tool for testing general relativity in the strong-field regime and exploring potential deviations from it in modified theories of gravity. Closely related to QNMs are greybody factors, which describe the modification of Hawking radiation as it escapes from the black hole’s gravitational well. In the absence of any scattering, Hawking radiation would have a perfect blackbody spectrum, but greybody factors account for the fact that some of the radiation is scattered back into the black hole by the spacetime curvature. This scattering alters the spectrum of the emitted radiation and provides important corrections to the pure Hawking radiation spectrum. The study of greybody factors is crucial for understanding the energy emission rates of black holes and for exploring potential observational signatures of black holes in the universe. Together with QNMs, greybody factors enrich our understanding of black hole thermodynamics and play a key role in connecting theoretical predictions with astrophysical observations, particularly in the era of gravitational wave astronomy. In this paper, we adopt the metric signature (-,+,+,+) and use geometrical units where c=G=\hbar=1. After this brief introduction, the paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we provide a concise overview of the deformed black hole solution. Section III examines the Hawking temperature of the black hole and explores the remnant radius and mass. In Section IV, we analyze the photon sphere radius based on the motion of light and derive the black hole’s shadow radius. Section V investigates the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the black hole spacetime, while Section VI focuses on the greybody factors. The emission rate of the black hole is discussed in Section VII. Finally, in Section VIII, we conclude with a brief summary and discussion."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07109v1,Conservation Law and Trace Anomaly for the Stress Energy Tensor of a Self-Interacting Scalar Field,"We consider a self-interacting, massive, real scalar field on a four-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime and the associated stress-energy tensor. Using techniques proper of the algebraic approach to perturbative quantum field theory, we study the associated, Wick-ordered, quantum observable. In particular we generalize a construction, first developed in the free field theory scenario by Moretti in [Mor03], aimed at exploiting the existing freedoms in the definition of the classical stress-energy tensor, in order to define a quantum counterpart which is divergence free. We prove that this procedure can be adapted also to cubic or quartic self-interactions, at least up to order \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{3}) in perturbation theory. As in the free field scenario, the price to pay for ensuring that the quantum stress-energy tensor is divergence free is the emergence of a trace anomaly, which is here computed for a quartic self-interaction.","In the realm of classical and quantum field theory both on flat and on curved, globally hyperbolic, spacetimes, one of most relevant observables is the stress-energy tensor. On the one hand, it encodes the information of the energy content of the underlying physical system, while, on the other hand, it is the source term for the Einstein equations, hence capturing how matter fields influence the spacetime geometry. At a classical level, among its properties, the most notable one is that, if one considers on-shell field configurations, it is divergence free. This is a feature which encodes energy-momentum conservation and it is essential for Einstein’s equations to be well-posed since also the Einstein tensor is per construction divergence free. When one switches from the classical to the quantum realm, the scenario changes drastically. As a matter of fact, even considering for simplicity a non-interacting real scalar field, the stress-energy tensor is quadratic in the field configuration and therefore its quantum counterpart cannot be defined directly since it would involve ill-defined products of distributions. The way out from this obstruction lies in considering Wick ordered products of the underlying fields. While, on Minkowski spacetime, this procedure is usually implemented in terms of normal ordering of the annihilation and creation operators, on a generic curved background this approach is no longer feasible. The algebraic approach to quantum field theory, see e.g. [BDFY15], is a framework which is best suited to discuss the quantization of a field theory on a globally hyperbolic spacetime. One can summarize it as a two-step procedure. In the first one, one identifies a suitable *-algebra of observables \mathcal{A} which encodes all structural properties, such as covariance, dynamics, locality and the canonical commutation or anti-commutation relations. In the second one, one selects an algebraic state, that is a positive and normalized functional on \mathcal{A}, which allows to recover the standard probabilistic interpretation proper of quantum theories via the renown GNS theorem. Among the plethora of possible states, only a handful can be recognized as being physically sensible. They are characterized by the Hadamard property which is a constraint on the singular structure of the underlying two-point correlation function [KM14]. In turn, this guarantees that the quantum fluctuations of all observables are finite and that it is possible to identify a local and covariant algebra of Wick polynomials, see also [HW01, HW02]. This last feature is particularly noteworthy since it entails the possibility of giving a local and covariant definition of a Wick-ordered, quantum stress energy tensor. Yet, in order to ensure covariance, the procedure of constructing a Wick polynomial consists of the subtraction of the singular, covariant component of the two-point function of a Hadamard state. This is known as Hadamard parametrix and it has two notable properties. On the one hand, it is a bi-solution of the underlying equation of motion only up to a smooth remainder, while, on the other hand, its definition is not unique and this leads to the existence of regularization freedoms in the construction of Wick polynomials [KM14]. The first property has notable consequences in the definition of the quantum stress-energy tensor since being divergence free relied at a classical level on choosing on-shell configurations. Therefore this feature is no longer automatically assured when considering the Wick-ordered, quantum stress-energy tensor. Yet, at the same time, consistence with Einstein’s equations entails that one cannot give up on it with a light heart. Still considering a free scalar field, this problem has been thoroughly investigated and solved in the literature, for example in [HW05] using the principle of general local covariance and exploiting the freedoms in the definition of the Hadamard parametrix. In this work, we consider instead a complementary approach discussed in [Mor03]. The starting point is the observation that, in the definition of the classical stress-energy tensor, there is an underlying freedom. Calling P_{0} the Klein-Gordon operator and \phi the underlying scalar field, one can always add a contribution of the form \eta g_{\mu\nu}\phi P_{0}\phi, where \eta\in\mathbb{R}, while g is the background metric. If one considers at a classical level on-shell configurations, this term is vanishing, conserved and traceless. Yet, when promoting it at a quantum level, these features are lost due to Wick ordering. In [Mor03] it is shown that, if and only if one sets \eta=\frac{1}{3}, then the Wick-ordered quantum stress-energy tensor is divergence free. The price to pay for this result is that, at the level of trace, an additional, state independent contribution appears. Since this depends only on the mass of the field and on the geometry of the underlying background, this is known as trace (or conformal) anomaly, see [Wal78] and see also [FFFL24] for a generalized, universal notion of the trace anomaly for theories which are not conformally invariant at the classical level. This feature is not proper only of a scalar field theory but it appears also in the analysis of other models, see e.g. [DHP09, FZ19] for the investigation of spinor fields. As far as free field theories are concerned, these results lead to a satisfactory scenario, but, the situation is less crystal clear if one considers instead interacting models. In this paper we analyze a self-interacting, real and massive scalar field on a four-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime and we investigate the structural properties of the associated stress-energy tensor. While, at a classical level nothing changes, the non linear nature of the dynamics alters drastically the behavior of the system at a quantum level. We shall work within a framework known as perturbative algebraic quantum field theory (pAQFT). This has been developed mainly in the past fifteen years, see e.g. [BDFY15, DF01, Rej16], and it represents a mathematical formalization of the perturbative approach to interacting field theories which has the notable property of being directly applicable also to models on curved backgrounds. It is worth mentioning that pAQFT has been very successful in making precise several aspects of perturbation theory, especially in connection to Epstein-Glaser renormalization, see also [BDF09] and in developing an algebraic approach to gauge theories [FR12, FR13]. It is also versatile enough to allow proving the convergence of the perturbative series in certain instances such as the sine-Gordon model, see [BK18, BPR23], but also [BDR23] for a recent application of pAQFT to the realm of complex systems. Yet, if one restricts the attention to Minkowski spacetime, pAQFT is still seen by several groups working in theoretical physics as a mathematically complicated framework, which is furthermore intrinsically developed in position space and, therefore, it loses at a computational level several of the advantages brought by Feynman diagrams. We are strongly convinced that this viewpoint does not make justice of pAQFT, in particular of its potentialities in better clarifying some conceptual aspects of quantum field theory. In particular, in this work we will be interested in studying the stress-energy tensor at a quantum level for a real and massive scalar field with a cubic or a quartic self-interaction. Exactly as in the free field scenario, the necessity of replacing classical products of fields with suitable Wick polynomials leads to a loss of the conservation law codified by the stress-energy tensor being divergence free. Using the framework of pAQFT and adapting the approach advocated in [Mor03], we will show that it is still possible to add at a classical level a term which is on-shell vanishing, conserved and traceless. Yet, at a quantum level, it allows us to codify that the quantum stress-energy tensor is divergence free. Since we will be working in perturbation theory, we will prove this statement up to order \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{3}) in the coupling constant, although there are no structural hurdles to go at higher order, except for an exponential increase in the computational complexity due to the insurgence of new contributions. Furthermore, as in the free field scenario, the price to pay for ensuring the property of being divergence free is the presence of an anomalous term in the quantum trace of the stress-energy tensor, which we compute explicitly to second order in perturbation theory for a quartic self-interaction. From a physical viewpoint the problem under investigation is of interest since the trace anomaly plays a crucial rôle in the computation of a property of the energy momentum tensor (EMT) known as D-term – see [May24, PS18]. Unlike other EMT form factors, the D-term is not framed by fundamental properties of particles, like mass or spin, but, being related to the variation of the spatial components of the spacetime metric, it can be expressed in terms of the stress-energy tensor. However, in view of the complexity of hadronic structures and of computations in quantum chromodynamics, it is convenient to study the D-term in the case of simpler theories. For instance, the D-term of a free, scalar field theory on Minkowski spacetime has been computed in the literature – see [HS17]. Therefore, the next sensible step is to investigate how the D-term associated to the scalar theory changes under an infinitesimally small interaction. This question has been addressed up to one-loop order in [May24], where it was shown that the D-term for the \Phi^{4} theory is strongly affected by interactions. The same finding was obtained for the \Phi^{3} theory, suggesting that this behavior should be independent from the type of interaction. This discussion entails that the D-term must be the particle property most sensitive to the variations of the dynamics in a system. As a consequence, we expect that it can be retrieved from the trace anomaly of the interacting stress-energy tensor and this represents a key motivation for the realization of this work. The paper is organized as follows: in Section 1.1 we recollect some basic notions concerning the functional spaces which are mainly used in the algebraic approach to perturbative quantum field theories, while in Section 1.2, we define Hadamard states. We highlight their microlocal properties and we introduce the notions of Hadamard and of Feynman parametrices, the latter necessary to define a time-ordered product. In Section 2 we introduce the key ingredients of pAQFT. In Section 2.1 we explain how quantization can be seen as a deformation of a classical algebra of observables. This allows us to discuss interacting theories, see Section 2.2, by means of the S-matrix and of the Bogoliubov map introduced in Section 2.2.1. We present an explicit example in Section 2.2.2. In Section 3 we revert our attention to free field theories and we rewrite the approach of [Mor03] in the language of functionals. The main results of this work are discussed instead in Section 4 where we consider a massive, real scalar field with a cubic or with a quartic self-interaction. We prove that a generalization of the work of [Mor03] to these cases is possible and we show that the Wick-ordered, quantum stress-energy tensor is divergence free up to order \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{3}) in perturbation theory. In addition we compute for a quartic self-interaction the corrections to the trace anomaly. In the appendix we survey the key concepts at the heart of microlocal analysis, which represents one of the main mathematical tools that we use in this work. 1.1 Functional spaces This section is devoted to an outline of the preliminary tools necessary for the analysis of a free as well as of an interacting quantum field theory within the formalism of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory – (p)AQFT. We begin by defining the main objects of such approach, which are functional spaces. Let \mathcal{M}\equiv(\mathcal{M},g) be a d-dimensional, d\geq 2, globally hyperbolic spacetime and we call configuration space, the set \mathcal{E}(\mathcal{M})\equiv C^{\infty}(\mathcal{M}) endowed with the Fréchet topology induced by the family of seminorms. ||f||_{k,C}:=\sup\{|f^{(k)}(x)|,x\in C\}. Adopting a terminology typical of pAQFT, we call space of functionals on \mathcal{E}(\mathcal{M}), its topological dual \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M})\equiv\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathcal{M}), (1.1) which is the space of compactly supported distributions on \mathcal{M}. It can be equipped with a natural notion of Fréchet derivative, whose definition we recall for the reader’s convenience. Definition 1.1 (Functional derivative). Let \mathcal{M} be a globally hyperbolic spacetime and let \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M}) be the space of functionals as per Equation (1.1). Given F\in\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M}), we call k-th order functional derivative of F the functional-valued distribution F^{(k)}\in\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathcal{M}\times...\times\mathcal{M};\mathcal{% F}(\mathcal{M})),k\geq 1 such that F^{(k)}(\eta_{1}\otimes...\otimes\eta_{k};\varphi):=\frac{\partial^{(k)}}{% \partial s_{1}...\partial s_{k}}F(\varphi+s_{1}\eta_{1}+...+s_{k}\eta_{k})\big% {|}_{s_{1}=...=s_{k}=0}, for all \varphi,\eta_{j}\in\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{M}), j=1,...,k. Furthermore, we call directional derivative along \eta\in\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{M}) as \delta_{\eta}:\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M})\rightarrow\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M}),\,\,% \,\,[\delta_{\eta}F](\varphi):=F^{(1)}(\eta;\varphi). (1.2) The structures introduce are tailored to the study of a real scalar field, which is the key objection under investigation in this paper. We remark that it is possible to generalize the whole construction to the case of an arbitrary, finite rank, real or complex vector bundle, but we avoid delving in this topic since it is too far from the scopes of this work. Although the space of functionals as per Equation (1.1) can be endowed with an algebra structure with respect to the pointwise product, one of the pillars of our framework consists of exploiting the possibility of deforming this structure in such a way to encode suitable information on the specific physical model under scrutiny. Yet, this leads to considering the product among the derivatives of the underlying functionals and a suitable class of distributional kernels. Due to Hörmander’s criterion – see Appendix A –, this operation is not always well-defined. Therefore, in order to bypass this hurdle, we need to impose constraints on the singular structure of the functionals. In the following we shall make extensive use of concepts and tools proper of microlocal analysis. A succinct summary is available in Appendix A, while an extensive analysis can be found in [Hör03]. Definition 1.2 (Microcausal functionals). Let \mathcal{M} be a globally hyperbolic spacetime and let \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M}) be the space of functionals of a real scalar field thereon. We call microcausal functionals the elements of \mathcal{F}_{\mu c}(\mathcal{M}):=\left\{F\in\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M})\,|\,F^{(% k)}\in\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathcal{M}^{k}),WF(F^{(k)})\subset G_{k}(\mathcal{% M}),\forall k\in\mathbb{N}\right\}, (1.3) where F^{(k)} denotes the k-th functional derivative of F as per Definition 1.1 while G_{k}(\mathcal{M}):=T^{*}(\underbrace{\mathcal{M}\times...\times\mathcal{M}}_{% k}\setminus\left(\bigcup_{x\in\mathcal{M}}(V^{+}_{x})^{k}\cup\bigcup_{x\in% \mathcal{M}}(V^{-}_{x})^{k}\right), (V^{\pm}_{x})^{k} being the counterpart in T^{*}_{x}(\underbrace{\mathcal{M}\times...\times\mathcal{M}}_{k}) of the future (+) and past (-) light cones at x\in\mathcal{M}. In addition we denote by \mathcal{P}_{\mu c}(\mathcal{M}) the collection of all polynomial functionals, namely F\in\mathcal{P}_{\mu c}(\mathcal{M}) if there exists \overline{k}\in\mathbb{N} such that F^{(k)}=0 for all k\geq\overline{k}. Among these functionals, two notable subclasses can be identified. Definition 1.3 (Regular functionals). Let \mathcal{M} be a globally hyperbolic spacetime and let \mathcal{F}_{\mu c}(\mathcal{M}) be as per Definition 1.2. A regular functional is an element of \mathcal{F}_{reg}(\mathcal{M}):=\left\{F\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu c}(\mathcal{M})\;|% \;F^{(k)}\in\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{M}^{k})\hookrightarrow\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(% \mathcal{M}^{k}),\forall k\in\mathbb{N}\right\}. (1.4) Definition 1.4 (Local functionals). Let \mathcal{M} be a globally hyperbolic spacetime and let \mathcal{F}_{\mu c}(\mathcal{M}) be the space of microcausal functionals as per Definition 1.2. Let us denote the spacetime support of a functional F\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu c}(\mathcal{M}) by supp(F):=\{x\in\mathcal{M}\,|\,\forall U\in\mathcal{N}_{x},\exists\eta,\theta% \in\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{M}):supp(\eta)\subset U,F(\eta+\theta)\neq F(\eta)\}, (1.5) \mathcal{N}_{x} being the set of all open neighborhoods of x\in\mathcal{M}. We call local functional an element of \mathcal{F}_{loc}(\mathcal{M}):=\left\{F\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu c}(\mathcal{M})\,|% \,F^{(1)}\in\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{M})\hookrightarrow\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(% \mathcal{M}),supp(F^{(k)})\subset Diag_{k}(\mathcal{M}),\forall k\in\mathbb{N}% \right\}, (1.6) where Diag_{k}(\mathcal{M}):=\left\{\underbrace{(x,...,x)}_{k}\in\mathcal{M}^{k}\,|% \,x\in\mathcal{M}\right\}. Similarly to Definition 1.2, we denote by \mathcal{P}_{loc}(\mathcal{M}) the collection of all local and polynomial microcausal functionals. Let us discuss an informative example to illustrate the definitions given so far. Example 1.5. Let \mathcal{M} be a globally hyperbolic spacetime and choose f\in\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{M}). We can construct the smeared real scalar field as \displaystyle\Phi_{f} \displaystyle:\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{M})\rightarrow\mathbb{C}, \displaystyle\phi \displaystyle\mapsto\Phi_{f}(\phi):=\int_{\mathcal{M}}d\mu_{x}\,\phi(x)f(x), (1.7) where d\mu_{x} is the metric-induced volume measure. A direct computation of the functional derivatives of \Phi_{f} yields \displaystyle\Phi_{f}^{(1)}(\phi) \displaystyle:=[\delta_{\phi}\Phi_{f}](\phi)=\int_{\mathcal{M}^{2}}d\mu_{x}\,d% \mu_{y}\,\delta_{2}(x,y)f(x), \displaystyle\Phi_{f}^{(k)}(\phi) \displaystyle=0,\,\forall k\geq 2, where \delta_{2}(x,y) is the formal integral kernel of the Dirac delta \delta_{2}\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathcal{M}\times\mathcal{M}). Since supp(\delta_{2})\subset Diag_{2}(\mathcal{M}), we can infer that \Phi_{f}\in\mathcal{F}_{loc}(\mathcal{M}),\forall f\in\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{M}). Remark 1.6. It is possible to generalize Definition 1.4 as highlighted in [Rej16, Def. 3.14]. More precisely one could call local any functional F such that, for every \phi_{0}\in\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{M}) there exists an open neighborhood U_{\phi_{0}}\in\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{M}) as well as k\in\mathbb{N} such that for all \phi\in U_{\phi_{0}} F(\phi)=\int\limits_{M}\alpha_{j^{k}_{x}(\phi)}, where j^{k}_{x}(\phi) is the k-th jet prolongation of \phi while \alpha is a density-valued function on the underlying jet bundle. This allows to define precisely functionals which appear in the definition of quantities of physical interest such as the stress-energy tensor. As an example consider \partial_{\mu}\Phi\partial_{\nu}\Phi[\phi,h]=\int\limits_{\mathcal{M}}d\mu_{x}%"
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07035v1,Inferring jet physics from neutron star—black hole mergers with gravitational waves,"Neutron star—black hole (NSBH) mergers that undergo tidal disruption may launch jets that could power a gamma-ray burst. We use a population of simulated NSBH systems to measure jet parameters from the gravitational waves emitted by these systems. The conditions during the tidal disruption and merger phase required to power a gamma-ray burst are uncertain. It is likely that the system must achieve some minimum remnant baryonic mass after the merger before a jet can be launched to power a gamma-ray burst. Assuming a fiducial neutron star equation of state, we show how Bayesian hierarchical inference can be used to infer the minimum remnant mass required to launch a gamma-ray burst jet as well as the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to detect a gamma-ray burst. We find that with 200 NSBH observations, we can measure the minimum disk mass to within 0.01\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}} at 90% credibility. We simultaneously infer the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to within 13\,\mathrm{{}^{\circ}} at 90% credibility. We conclude that upcoming upgrades to the LIGO observatories may provide important new insights into the physics of NSBH jets.","Figure 1: Schematic explaining the possible fates of an NSBH merger, depending on the binary parameters. We are interested in answering the question: what threshold remnant baryonic mass is required to launch a GRB jet? We consider the remnant mass and orientation of the system as the only two requirements to measure a GRB from an NSBH merger, however we note that in reality there may be other requirements that need to be satisfied to successfully launch a GRB jet. Neutron star—black hole (NSBH) mergers probably make up at least three of the \gtrsim 90 gravitational-wave events published by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA (LVK) collaboration (Abbott et al., 2021a, 2023a, 2023b, b; Abac et al., 2024).111We refer to the two NSBH detections described in Abbott et al. (2021b) and the recent NSBH binary merger GW230529 (Abac et al., 2024), although 1–2 more NSBH mergers could be counted in the third gravitational-wave catalog (Abbott et al., 2023b). If the black hole in an NSBH system is sufficiently light or spinning rapidly, the neutron star may tidally disrupt. The disruption could provide a progenitor for a gamma-ray burst (GRB) (e.g., Mochkovitch et al., 1993; Janka et al., 1999; Nakar, 2007) by launching a relativistic jet. To date, the only confirmed GRB+gravitational-wave multi-messenger detection was the binary neutron star merger GW170817 (Abbott et al., 2017, 2017) and the corresponding GRB 170817A (Goldstein et al., 2017). Tidal disruption alone is probably not sufficient for the system to launch a jet and for the jet to be detected on Earth as a GRB. We consider two requirements for an NSBH merger to launch a jet that can be measured by gamma-ray observatories at Earth. First, the NSBH must have disrupted and produced a remnant mass large enough to launch a jet that is powered for long enough to break through the merger ejecta material. The required disk mass is likely on the order of a few percent of a solar mass, but this threshold mass is not precisely known (e.g., Lee & Ramirez-Ruiz, 2007). Typical disk mass threshold values used in the literature lie between 0.03 and 0.08 solar masses (Pannarale & Ohme, 2014; Stone et al., 2013; Zappa et al., 2019). Second, the GRB jet must be launched with an opening angle and inclination that makes it possible to be viewed from Earth. It is likely that the binary mergers’ inclination angle must be close to on-axis, i.e, the orbital angular momentum axis is pointed towards Earth, for the GRB jet to be observed (e.g., Chen & Holz, 2013; O’Connor et al., 2024). However, the discovery of a GRB with the off-axis multi-messenger signal GW170817 (Abbott et al., 2017, 2017; Finstad et al., 2018; Ghirlanda et al., 2019) means that jets can be observed off-axis to some degree, perhaps at a reduced luminosity and delayed rise time compared to an on-axis counterpart (e.g., Granot et al., 2002). The maximum viewing angle is also unknown as it depends on uncertain jet physics. We summarize the possible outcomes for NSBH mergers in Figure 1, highlighting the requirements that need to be satisfied before a GRB can be observed. The strict physical requirements for disruption means that disrupting binaries are likely a small minority of NSBH systems (e.g., Zhu et al., 2022; Drozda et al., 2022; Biscoveanu et al., 2023), however, future detectors such as Cosmic Explorer (Reitze et al., 2019) and Einstein Telescope (Maggiore et al., 2020) will allow us to observe a population of potentially disrupting binaries (e.g., Gupta et al., 2023a), some with multi-messenger counterparts. In this Letter, we describe how data from upcoming gravitational-wave observatories can be used to infer the minimum remnant mass and maximum viewing angle to detect a GRB jet with minimal assumptions about the jet physics. We examine a possible population of NSBH mergers that could be detected by a proposed upgrade to the LIGO detectors called A♯ (Fritschel et al., 2024). A♯ will improve on the LVK design sensitivity (Aasi et al., 2015; Acernese et al., 2015; Akutsu et al., 2020) by a factor of approximately two in strain and is intended as a precursor instrument to Cosmic Explorer (Reitze et al., 2019), and is slated to observe in the early 2030s. We show that we can resolve the minimum remnant mass to launch jets and constrain the maximum jet viewing angle with a population of NSBH mergers observed by A♯ in one year, provided some mergers have a multi-messenger counterpart. We note that in some systems a jet could be launched without an accompanying GRB, but for this work we exclusively consider GRB jets. The remainder of this Letter is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe our simulated population that we use to infer the threshold remnant mass. In Section 3 we describe the mathematical framework for our hierarchical inference model. We describe our results in Section 4 and discuss the implications for these results in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07020v1,Premerger observation and characterization of massive black hole binaries,"We demonstrate an end-to-end technique for observing and characterizing massive black hole binary signals before they merge with the LISA space-based gravitational-wave observatory. Our method uses a zero-latency whitening filter, originally designed for rapidly observing compact binary mergers in ground-based observatories, to be able to observe signals with no additional latency due to filter length. We show that with minimal computational cost, we are able to reliably observe signals as early as 14 days premerger as long as the signal has accrued a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 8 in the LISA data. We also demonstrate that this method can be used to characterize the source properties, providing early estimates of the source’s merger time, chirp mass, and sky localization. Early observation and characterization of massive black holes is crucial to enable the possibility of rapid multimessenger observations, and to ensure that LISA can enter a protected operating period when the merger signal arrives.","The late 2030s will see the first data from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational-wave observatory [1, 2]. LISA will enable us to observe the gravitational-wave spectrum between \sim 10^{-4} Hz and \sim 10^{-1} Hz and allow the observation of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena [3]. One of the primary science motivators for LISA, and the focus of this work, is the observation of Massive Black Hole Binary (MBHB) mergers. LISA will have peak sensitivity to MBHB mergers with total mass between 10^{4} and 10^{7}M_{\odot} [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The problem of observing and characterizing MBHB mergers with LISA has been explored over the last two decades, primarily in the context of the ongoing LISA Data Challenges (formerly called the Mock LISA Data Challenges) [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Such signals are expected to have a very large signal-to-noise ratio, rendering the identification of sources trivial [3]. However, this large signal-to-noise ratio makes the characteriziation of these sources, as performed using numerical Bayesian analysis toolkits, challenging [3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The main problems that need to be solved in advance of LISA’s launch are how to characterize these signals in the presence of a large number of other overlapping signals—LISA’s “Global Fit” problem [16]—and how to produce waveforms with sufficient accuracy [17]. Tackling these well known problems is not the focus of this work. The large signal-to-noise ratio of MBHB mergers offers another interesting science possibility. In particular, these systems may be observable in the days (or even weeks) before they merge [18, 19]. If it were possible to identify these systems before they merge, and constrain the sky location where the signal originates from, it would open up the possibility of alerting electromagnetic astronomers that a MBHB merger is about to occur [18, 19]. As MBHB mergers can occur in gas-rich environments, the gravitational-wave signal may be accompanied by EM emission [20]. One of the Science Objectives for the LISA Mission is to “Identify the electromagnetic counterparts of massive Black Hole binary coalescences” with a stated aim to alert astronomers hours to days before merger [2]. In addition, it would be very useful for operation of the LISA satellite to know that an MBHB merger is imminent. LISA science data will contain schedulded interruptions due to antenna re-pointing or discharge of test masses. If we know the merger time of a MBHB in advance, LISA can enter a protected period in which scheduled interruptions are rearranged [2]. Depending on ground station availability, LISA can also enter a low-latency period in which data is downloaded in quasi-real time for the merger itself [2]. The topic of premerger observation of MBHBs and in particular the ability to localize MBHBs premerger has been explored already in the literature (for e.g. [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 18, 19, 27, 28, 29]). However, the majority of these works are carried out using Fisher Matrix analyses, or Bayesian inference using waveforms that are abruptly terminated in the frequency domain. As we will discuss and explain in detail below, traditional likelihood computations would require waiting for additional data (up to a day) to arrive before one can accurately whiten the waveforms and compute a matched filter. We do note the recent works of [29, 30], which propose a direct search using convolutional neural networks and could provide an alternative to the methods presented here. In this work, we present an end-to-end method for identifying and characterizing MBHB signals before merger. This method incorporates methodology developed by the GstLAL search team in the context of ground-based searches [31], to allow us to analyse LISA data immediately as it arrives. We illustrate the utility of the method by demonstrating the recovery of signals added to simulated LISA noise between 0.5 and 14 days before merger. We also demonstrate that this method can be used to characterize these simulated signals without needing to wait for additional data to arrive, by interfacing with one [32] of the Bayesian inference toolkits now available for LISA parameter estimation [33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. We highlight the importance of having LISA data available below 10^{-4}\,Hz: Many signals will have dominant mode emission <10^{-4}\,Hz in the days before merger, and so having sensitivity below this will be crucial for early identification and localization. The layout of this work is as follows: In section II we explore the motivation for this work and describe the data and noise curves that we will consider. In section III we describe our new technique for observing and characterizing MBHB systems in the days to weeks before merger, applying techniques developed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) context to achieve minimal latency. In section IV we demonstrate that we can effectively observe MBHB mergers, as soon as the accrued signal-to-noise ratio becomes larger than 8, with insignificant computational cost. In section V we apply Bayesian parameter inference tools to demonstrate that this method can be used to provide rapid premerger constraints on the value of the MBHB’s sky location, chirp mass and time of arrival. Finally, we conclude in section VI. All of our results and figures are fully reproducible, with the code used to make them publicly available.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06678v1,Stationary acoustic black hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis,"In this article, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with the idea of finding solutions that could possibly correspond to a so-called acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes. Those are flows with horizons where the speed of the flow goes from sub-sonic to super-sonic. This is because sound cannot go back from the supersonic to the subsonic region. The speed of sound plays the role of the speed of light in a gravitational black hole, an important difference being that there are excitations that can go faster than the speed of sound and therefore can escape the sonic black hole. Here, the motion of the BEC is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). More concretely, we discuss singular Stationary solutions of Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with Circular symmetry) and 3D (with Spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to study the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity of the condensate to see whether they cross, indicating the potential existence of a sonic analog of a black/white hole. We discuss numerical techniques used and also study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions to see how well they agree with numerical solutions. We also study how the resurgent transseries plays a role in these solutions.","The main purpose of this paper is to study solutions to a differential equation that appears in the context of black holes simulations using supefluids. In [PhysRevLett.46.1351] Unruh proposed the idea of studying acoustic black holes as a way to bring quantum phenomena such as Hawking radiation [HawkingS.W.1975Pcbb] closer to experimentation. This challenge was subsequently taken up by various experimental groups, for example [Steinhauer2014] and [MunozdeNova2019], and more recently [Tamura:2023mby]. A setup where one expects to see such quantum phenomena is in acoustic black holes produced by the motion of a superfluid (Bose-Einstein condensate) at ultra-cold temperatures. In this work, we consider the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with coupling g and without an external potential [NozieresPinesBEC], that describes the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)}{\partial t}=-\frac{% \hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}\psi\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)+g{\lvert\psi\left(% \vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)\rvert}^{2}\psi\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right) (1.1) Small perturbations follow a dispersion relation [NozieresPinesSound]: E=\hbar\omega=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar^{2}\lvert\vec{\mathbf{q}}\rvert^{2}}{2m}\left(% \frac{\hbar^{2}\lvert\vec{\mathbf{q}}\rvert^{2}}{2m}+2gn\right)} (1.2) where, n is the density, \vec{\mathbf{q}} is momentum, and \omega is the frequency. From equation (1.2), we get E\approx c\hbar\lvert\vec{\mathbf{q}}\rvert when \frac{\hbar^{2}\lvert\vec{\mathbf{q}}\rvert^{2}}{2m}<<2gn which is a long-wavelength approximation. In that case, the excitations are phonons with speed of sound c=\sqrt{\frac{ng}{m}} (1.3) Now if we write the current density \vec{\mathbf{j}}\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)=-\frac{i\hbar}{2m}\left({\psi}% ^{*}\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)\vec{\nabla}\psi\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t% \right)-\psi\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)\vec{\nabla}{\psi}^{*}\left(\vec{% \mathbf{r}},t\right)\right) (1.4) from (1.1) and substitute \psi\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)=\sqrt{n\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)}{% \mathrm{e}}^{i\theta\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)}{\mathrm{e}}^{-i\mu t} into it as in [NozieresPinesVelocity], we get the fluid velocity as \vec{v}\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)=\frac{\vec{\mathbf{j}}\left(\vec{% \mathbf{r}},t\right)}{n\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right)}=\frac{\hbar}{m}\vec{% \nabla}\theta\left(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t\right) (1.5) Our main focus is to find stationary solutions to the equation (1.1) corresponding to acoustic black holes in two (and three) spatial dimensions. We assume an infinite-size fluid that undergoes an inward radial flow with a magnitude of radial velocity v(r). The magnitude of the inward velocity vanishes at infinity and increases as r decreases. If, below a certain radius r_{h}, the magnitude of inward velocity is larger than the speed of sound (v(r<r_{h})>c) then r_{h} acts as an acoustic horizon [PhysRevA.99.023850], and sound waves cannot escape from that region. In principle, the flow can again become subsonic at even smaller radius. In addition, the density will become singular (\rho\rightarrow\infty) at some point r=r_{0}\geq 0. In practice, when the density is large, the fluid is removed by atomic collisions so that \rho remains finite. A similar problem is discussed in [PhysRevA.109.023305], wherein the singularity is removed by including a three-body recombination term and an external potential. However, our study focuses on singular solutions as an approximation to non-singular ones. We do not expect to find analytical solutions and therefore we employ a combination of asymptotic series expansion and numerical techniques. When the series expansion alone does not contain all the information about the system, more advanced mathematical techniques are required to extract the information about non-perturbative corrections. These non-perturbative corrections show up when the asymptotic perturbative series has factorially divergent coefficients. Furthermore, when the differential equation is nonlinear in the dependent variable, non-perturbative corrections keep appearing with increasing powers and also bring in their own factorially divergent perturbative series multiplying them. This is known as a transseries ([10.1155/S1073792895000286], [10.1215/S0012-7094-98-09311-5]) that needs to be resummed using the Laplace-Borel transform to get the most general solution. The phenomenon of resurgence in the transseries is also required for the most general solution ([Aniceto2015], [DORIGONI2019167914], [Costin_2019], and [PhysRevD.92.125011]) to be real. This allows us to check properties of the numerical solutions that can be obtained with standard methods such as Newton iteration with Chebyshev collocation. Resurgent transseries and its Borel summation have been used for various problems such as the nonlinear equation for Bjorken flow in conformal hydrodynamics [PhysRevD.92.125011], Painlevé equation [Costin_2019] and many others."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06582v1,Vacuum energy and cosmological constant in QFT in curved spacetime,"The cosmological constant term (CC), \Lambda, is a pivotal ingredient in the standard model of cosmology or \LambdaCDM, but it is a rigid quantity for the entire cosmic history. This is unnatural and inconsistent. Different theoretical and phenomenological conundrums suggest that the \LambdaCDM necessitates further theoretical underpinning to cope with modern observations. An interesting approach is the framework of the ‘running vacuum model’ (RVM). It endows \Lambda with cosmic dynamics within a fundamental framework since it is based on QFT. In the RVM, the vacuum energy density (VED) appears as a series of powers of the Hubble function and its derivatives, \rho_{\rm vac}(H,\dot{H},...). In the current universe, \rho_{\rm vac} changes as \sim H^{2}. Higher order effects {\cal O}(H^{4}), on the other hand, can be responsible for a new mechanism of inflation (RVM-inflation). On the practical side the RVM can alleviate the cosmological tensions on \sigma_{8} and H_{0}. An intriguing smoking gun signature of the RVM is that its equation of state can mimic quintessence, as recently observed by DESI, so the vacuum can be the sought-for dynamical DE. At a deeper theoretical level, the RVM-renormalized form of the VED can avoid extreme fine tuning related to the well-known cosmological constant problem. Overall, the RVM has the capacity to impinge positively on relevant theoretical and practical aspects of modern cosmology.","The peak point of the cosmological constant (CC) term, \Lambda, in Einstein’s equations was its actual measurement at the end of 20th century using type Ia Supernovae (SnIa) luminosity distances. The nonvanishing positive value that was obtained provided for the first time evidence of the accelerated expansion of the Universe [1]. As of its introduction by Einstein in the field equations [2], \Lambda remains a fundamental ingredient of GR. And after more than a century it is still at the core of modern cosmology since it is a key element of the concordance model of cosmology, \LambdaCDM [3]. Despite the more general notion of Dark Energy (DE) was introduced much later to ‘explain’ the speeding up of the universe, within the standard model \Lambda provides the simplest candidate for DE. Nowadays, very precise measurements have been performed [4] on \Lambda or, equivalently, on the value of the associated parameter \Omega^{0}_{\rm vac}=\rho^{0}_{\rm vac}/\rho^{0}_{c}. The vacuum energy density (VED) is associated to \Lambda through the relation \rho^{0}_{\rm vac}=\Lambda/(8\pi G_{N}), where G_{N} is Newton’s constant and \rho^{0}_{c}=3H_{0}^{2}/(8\pi G_{N}) is the critical density in our time, where H_{0} is the current value of the Hubble parameter. The observational value of \Omega^{0}_{\rm vac} is found to be around 0.7. Despite \Lambda is taken from granted within the \LambdaCDM, it undercovers a great source of mystery. To start with, its nature and its origin remain undisclosed at the fundamental level. Naive estimations within quantum field theory (QFT) lead to ‘gargantuan’ values that cannot be minimally reconciled with observations. This abhorrent mismatch is usually said to stem from calculations of the zero-point energy (ZPE) associated to matter fields and also from the Higgs potential of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. If m is the mass of one of such SM fields, contributions to the ZPE of order m^{4} are expected[5]. Since the observational value of the VED lies around \rho_{\rm vac}\sim 10^{-47} GeV4 in natural units, comparison with \sim m^{4} for any particle of the SM, even the lightest ones, leads to nonsense. For example, for the electron field we find a difference of 34 orders of magnitude: \rho_{\rm vac}^{\rm obs}/m_{e}^{4}\sim 10^{-34}. The problem persists when comparing with the ground state energy of the effective Higgs potential, leadibng to 56 orders of discrepancy: V_{\rm eff}, we find \rho_{\rm vac}^{\rm obs}/\langle V_{\rm eff}\rangle\sim 10^{-56}. These two examples, describe in a conspicuous way what is known as the ‘Cosmological Constant Problem’ (CCP) [6]. Far from being a mere artifact produced by the simplicity of \Lambda in the cosmological model, the difficulties seem to lie in the very conception of vacuum energy in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and affects all forms of DE and not just the vacuum energy[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] 222For an informal, but rather vivid, introduction to the Cosmological Constant Problem, see e.g. [13].. Another aspect of this intriguing topic is the fact that, at the present time, \rho_{\rm vac}^{\rm obs} and the energy density associated to Cold Dark Matter (CDM), \rho_{\rm CDM}, are observed to be of the same order of magnitude, despite the fact that \rho_{\rm CDM} is assumed to decrease with the expansion as a^{-3} (a being the scale factor), whereas \rho_{\rm vac} maintains constant. This is the so-called cosmic coincidence problem [14], although not everybody agrees that this is a real problem [15]. There are other worrisome problems with the concordance model of more practical nature. For example, there are tensions with the measurement of the current Hubble parameter H_{0}\equiv 100h km/s/Mpc (h\simeq 0.7) and the growth of LSS structures. The growth rate is usually tracked by means of the parameters S_{8} or \sigma_{8}, related to the root mean square fluctuations of the matter density in spheres of size 8h^{-1} Mpc. The \LambdaCDM predicts an excess of structure formation at low redshift at a level of \sim 2-3\sigma with respect to actual measurements. The H_{0}-tension, on the other hand, is more serious. It involves an acute disagreement between the value of H_{0} inferred from CMB observations (which make use of fiducial \LambdaCDM cosmology) and the corresponding value extracted from the local (distance ladder) measurements. The two types of measurements of H_{0} lead to inconsistencies of \sim 5\sigma c.l. See e.g. [16, 17] for reviews on these tensions. It is still not known if these tensions are the result of systematic errors, but the possibility that new physics may be ultimately responsible for the observed deviations from the \LambdaCDM predictions cannot be excluded at all. A wide panoply of strategies have been proposed in the literature to alleviate some of the above tensions, see the above mentioned references. In this work, we review exclusively the running vacuum model (RVM) approach, which provides a fundamental framework to tackle fundamental cosmological problems as well as the mentioned tensions with tested efficiency, see [18] and [19, 20]. Let us also mention a RVM-inspired model (wXCDM) [21] which recently provided a very robust fit to the data, being also consistent with quintessence-like behavior near our time, as reported by DESI[22]. The model wXCDM is inspired in the old \LambdaXCDM framework [23], a composite DE system in which the RVM is entangled with an extra X component (behaving as ‘phantom matter’) with which it can exchange energy. The idea of ‘composite running vacuum’ appears fruitful and highly efficient to account for the observations and to cut down the tensions, see [24] and references therein. As said, in this work we review recent advances in the arduous task of understanding the CCP and the role played by the vacuum in cosmology. Our framework is QFT. We shall, however, not consider quantum gravity here, but QFT in cosmological spacetime, specifically Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime with flat three-dimensional hypersurfaces. The main results have been presented in [25, 26, 27, 28], see also [12] for a comprehensive review. These studies show that the VED is dynamical in QFT since it depends on the Hubble rate and its derivatives, \rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H,\dot{H},...)– denoted hereafter simply as \rho_{\rm vac}(H). These studies also show that contrary to naive expectations there are no Zeldovich type terms of the form \sim m^{4} like those mentioned at the beginning. Hence we can avoid extreme fine tuning, in contradistinction to the standard folklore on these matters. The RVM thus leads to an effective form of the \LambdaCDM in which the physical value of \Lambda ‘runs’ smoothly with the cosmic expansion thanks to the quantum matter effects. Such a running, in fact, can be conceived as a renormalization group running, see [10] and references therein. As a result, the quantum vacuum does not remain rigid throughout the cosmic history. To put it in a nutshell: there is no such thing as a ‘cosmological constant’ in the QFT context. Interestingly, the running nature of the vacuum has also been accounted for in the context of low-energy effective string theory [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34] 333 See also the forthcoming comprehensive review [35].. In all these formulations, the physical \Lambda appears as a mildly running quantity since it originates from quantum effects. Nonetheless the consequences on the \LambdaCDM behavior with a running \Lambda are not negligible; and in fact they can be essential to cure the cosmological tensions. Here, however, we shall exclusively focus on the QFT approach. For a more comprehensive review encompassing as well the low energy stringy effects on the vacuum dynamics, see [35]. Despite many curious attempts existing in the literature, to discuss about the CCP in flat spacetime makes no sense at all. Thus, in what follows we study the RVM renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) in cosmological FLRW spacetime. We demonstrate that the values of the VED at different scales are related by a smooth function of the Hubble rate, H, and this function does not contain quartic powers \sim m^{4} of the masses, a fact that drastically eliminates the need for fine tuning. We also discuss the RVM mechanism for inflation based on the higher powers of H. In addition, we show the consequences for the equation of state of the vacuum in an expanding universe, which no longer remains near -1 but can display quintessence-like behavior owing to the quantum corrections."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06356v1,Measuring cosmic curvature with non-CMB observations,"The cosmic curvature \Omega_{K} is an important parameter related to the inflationary cosmology and the ultimate fate of the universe. In this work, we adopt the non-CMB observations to constrain \Omega_{K} in the \LambdaCDM model and its extensions. The DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, DES type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometer, and strong gravitational lensing time delay data are considered. We find that the data combination favors an open universe in the \LambdaCDM model, specifically \Omega_{K}=0.108\pm 0.056 at the 1\sigma confidence level, which is in 2.6\sigma tension with the Planck CMB result supporting our universe being slightly closed. In the \LambdaCDM extensions, the data combination is consistent with a spatially flat universe. However, the central value of \Omega_{K} is positive and has a significant deviation from zero. We adopt the Akaike information criterion to compare different cosmological models. The result shows that non-flat models fit the observational data better that the flat \LambdaCDM model, which adds evidence to the argument that flat \LambdaCDM is not the ultimate model of cosmology.","Whether our universe is spatially open, flat or closed is a fundamental issue in cosmology. A non-zero curvature would have profound implications for the primordial inflation paradigm and the ultimate fate of the universe. Measuring the sign and value of \Omega_{K} is of great significance for understanding the evolution of the universe and the nature of dark energy. The question has gained a lot of interest in the past few years, particularly in light of the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations Aghanim et al. (2020); Park and Ratra (2019); Handley (2021); Di Valentino et al. (2019); Efstathiou and Gratton (2020). It is found that the CMB data alone favor a slightly closed universe, \Omega_{K}=-0.044_{-0.015}^{+0.018} Aghanim et al. (2020). Spatial flatness is an indicator of inflation. If the universe is not flat, this would cast serious doubt on the possibility that inflation could have happened. This deviation from the flat universe is interpreted as the undetected systematics or new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology, i.e., the \Lambda cold dark matter (\LambdaCDM) model. The ability of CMB data to constrain \Omega_{K} is limited by the geometrical degeneracy which can be broken by including other observational data Zaldarriaga et al. (1997); Efstathiou and Bond (1999); Bond et al. (1997). For instance, the CMB data combined with the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements give \Omega_{K}=0.0007\pm 0.0019, suggesting that our universe is flat to within the 1\sigma confidence level Aghanim et al. (2020). This is inconsistent with the result of CMB data alone. Some people expressed doubts about the soundness of such combinations, believing that there may be a “curvature tension” in the current data Handley (2021). Of course, there are different voices. Efstathiou and Gratton claimed that the CMB data are consistent with a flat universe Efstathiou and Gratton (2020). Whether this tension exists is still an open question. It should be pointed out that in addition to the possible curvature tension, there are other measurement inconsistencies that do exist between early- and late-universe observations, such as the measurements for the Hubble constant H_{0} and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum (see Ref. Verde et al. (2019) for a review). Remarkably, the H_{0} value measured by the Cepheid-supernova distance ladder is in above 5\sigma tension with that inferred from the CMB observation assuming \LambdaCDM Riess et al. (2022). When combining observations for parameter constraints, it is necessary to consider the measurement inconsistencies between the data. The existence of these tensions reduces the rationality of combining CMB with late-universe probes for measuring the curvature parameter. The motivation of the present work is to constrain the curvature parameter using only the late-universe observations. The mainstream late-time probes include BAO (standard ruler), type Ia supernova (SN, standard candle) and cosmic chronometer (CC, standard clock). For a long time before, these non-CMB observations could not well constrain the curvature parameter. However, the situation may have changed. Recently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration released the high-precision BAO data based on the precise observations of galaxies, quasars, and Lyman-\alpha forests Adame et al. (2024a, b, c). Earlier, the Dark Energy Survey (DES) program published the high-quality samples of SN Ia discovered during its five-year operation Abbott et al. (2024). Furthermore, more than 30 CC data have been available for cosmological parameter inference so far Moresco et al. (2022). We will utilize the data from these three probes. To further tighten the constraints, we will also consider the strong gravitational lensing time delay (TD) observations Suyu et al. (2010); Jee et al. (2019); Suyu et al. (2014); Chen et al. (2019a); Wong et al. (2017); Birrer et al. (2019); Rusu et al. (2020); Shajib et al. (2020); Agnello et al. (2017). These four probes observe the universe from different perspectives, and combining them is expected to break cosmological parameter degeneracies, thereby narrowing the constraints. Currently, many curvature measurements are achieved after making assumptions about the nature of dark energy, i.e., dark energy behaves like a cosmological constant \Lambda with an equation of state (EoS) of w=-1. However, the observational data leaves room for dark energy EoS to deviate from -1, which weakens the persuasiveness of the \Omega_{K} constraints assuming \LambdaCDM, since \Omega_{K} and w are strongly degenerate. In addition, many people believe that \LambdaCDM is not the ultimate model of cosmology. On one hand, it has some theoretical problems Weinberg (1989); Sahni and Starobinsky (2000); on the other hand, the CMB results for \LambdaCDM are in tension with some late-universe observations Verde et al. (2019). Cosmologists have conceived many theories beyond it to solve the problems and reconcile the tensions Guo et al. (2019). It is necessary to measure the curvature parameter in those extended models. In this work, we shall consider some typical extensions to the \LambdaCDM model, mainly for the evolutionary behavior of dark energy. We shall also consider the possible interaction between dark energy and dark matter. This paper focuses on measuring the cosmic curvature in \LambdaCDM and its extensions using the non-CMB observations, and study the impact of various extensions on \Omega_{K} constraints. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We briefly describe the methodology in Sec. II. Sec. III contains the observational data we adopted.

formulas and bounds in oscillating backgrounds II: Constraints on the spectral index and gravitational dark matter production","The reheating temperature plays a crucial role in the early universe’s evolution, marking the transition from inflation to the radiation-dominated era. It directly impacts the number of e-folds and, consequently, the observable parameters of inflation, such as the spectral index of scalar perturbations. By establishing a relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the spectral index, we can derive constraints on inflationary models. Specifically, the range of viable reheating temperatures imposes bounds on the spectral index, which can then be compared with observational data, such as those from the Planck satellite, to test the consistency of various models with cosmological observations. Additionally, in the context of dark matter production, we demonstrate that gravitational reheating provides a viable mechanism when there is a relationship between the mass of the dark matter particles and the mass of the particles responsible for reheating. This connection offers a pathway to link dark matter genesis with inflationary and reheating parameters, allowing for a unified perspective on early universe dynamics.","The relation between the reheating temperature and the spectral index of scalar perturbations plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of the early universe, particularly in the context of inflationary cosmology Guth (1981); Linde (1982). Inflation, a rapid expansion of the universe in its earliest moments, produces scalar perturbations, which later evolve into the large-scale structures we observe today, see for instance Refs. Barrow and Turner (1981); Spokoiny (1984); Steinhardt and Turner (1984); Lucchin and Matarrese (1985); Hawking (1985); Lyth (1985); Belinsky et al. (1985); Mijic et al.

The spectral index, n_{s}, characterizes the distribution of these perturbations and offers insights into the physics of the inflationary period. In addition, the number of e-folds between the horizon crossing and the end of inflation is influenced by the reheating temperature, T_{\rm reh}. Since the spectral index n_{s} depends on this last number of e-folds, the reheating temperature impacts the predicted value of n_{s}. Higher reheating temperatures generally reduce the duration of the reheating phase, leading to fewer e-folds and a lower predicted value of the spectral index, while lower reheating temperatures result in more e-folds and a higher spectral index. As a consequence, by studying the connection between T_{\rm reh} and n_{s}, different inflationary models can be tested and compared with the observational data, such as the measurements from the Planck satellite Akrami et al. (2020). This relationship serves as a valuable tool for constraining models of inflation, and only those predicting a viable range of n_{s} consistent with observations, are considered plausible. In the context of gravitational reheating and considering a heavy scalar quantum field conformally coupled to gravity, the created particles must decay into lighter ones to reheat the universe. First, continuing with our previous work de Haro et al. (2024), we derive the formula for the reheating temperature as a function of the decay rate and the mass m_{\chi} of the produced particles, identifying viable values of m_{\chi} and the range of possible reheating temperatures. Using this range and considering the relationship between the reheating temperature and the spectral index, we are able to constrain the latter. Indeed, these spectral index values are more tightly constrained than those obtained experimentally by Planck’s data Akrami et al. (2020). On the other hand, in the absence of strong couplings between the inflaton and standard particles, gravitational reheating can produce a non-thermal spectrum of particles, including potential dark matter candidates. This mechanism is especially intriguing in models where dark matter particles have minimal interactions with ordinary matter. During gravitational reheating, dark matter production can occur efficiently through gravitational interactions alone, providing a natural and model-independent production pathway. This scenario could help explain the relic density of dark matter observed today without requiring direct couplings to the inflaton field. Having in mind this fact, we investigate the gravitational production of dark matter within the framework of gravitational reheating. Specifically, we consider two distinct scalar fields conformally coupled to gravity, which generate two types of particles with different masses. One type decays into lighter particles, facilitating the reheating of the universe, while the other, a candidate for explaining the dark matter content, does not decay. In this work, we determine the range of particle masses that yield both a viable reheating temperature and a present-day value for the cold dark matter energy density, thereby contributing to a more complete understanding of the dark matter and energy composition of the universe. The paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we use the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method in the complex plane to analytically calculate the \beta-Bogoliubov coefficient, the key component for determining particle production. In Section III, we constrain the viable values of the spectral index by relating it to the reheating temperature through the last few e-folds. In Section IV, we derive an analytical formula for the reheating temperature when reheating occurs via gravitational particle production. This formula allows us to identify the viable mass range for the produced particles and further constrain the spectral index. Section V addresses the gravitational production of dark matter, where we establish the relationship between the mass of dark matter and that of the scalar field responsible for gravitational reheating. Finally, in Section VI we summarize the present work. Throughout the manuscript we use natural units, i.e., \hbar=c=k_{B}=1, and the reduced Planck’s mass is denoted by M_{\rm pl}\equiv\frac{1}{\sqrt{8\pi G}}\cong 2.44\times 10^{18} GeV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06170v1,The effect of pressure anisotropy on quark stars structure in the Starobinsky model,"The structure and stability of quark stars (QSs) made of interacting quark matter are discussed in this study, taking color superconductivity and perturbative QCD corrections into account. By combining this EoS with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, we explore the mass-radius (M-R) relations of QSs. The analysis is conducted within the framework of R^{2} gravity, where the gravity model is described by f(R)=R+aR^{2}. Our primary goal is to investigate how variations in the R^{2} gravity parameter a affect the mass-radius and mass-central density (M-\rho_{c}) relationships of QSs. Furthermore, we study the dynamical stability of these stars by analyzing the impact of anisotropy parameters \beta and the interaction parameter \lambda derived from the EoS, on their stability. Our results demonstrate that the presence of pressure anisotropy plays a significant role in increasing the maximum mass of QSs, with potential implications for the existence of super-massive pulsars. These findings are in agreement with recent astronomical observations, which suggest the possibility of neutron stars exceeding 2M_{\odot}.","The study of compact objects, such as QSs, has driven extensive research efforts due to their unique role as astrophysical laboratories for high-density matter and potential indicators of physics beyond general relativity (GR). Numerous modified gravity theories have been proposed to address fundamental cosmological questions, including dark energy and inflation. Among these theories, the Starobinsky model, which augments the Einstein-Hilbert action with a term proportional to the Ricci scalar squared, f(R)=R+aR^{2}, offers a simple yet compelling framework. This model not only addresses early-universe inflation but is also compatible with cosmic microwave background data, making it a promising candidate for investigating gravitational interactions at astrophysical scales [1, 2]. Astrophysical observations of supermassive neutron stars [3, 4] and recent gravitational wave detections, such as GW190814 [5], suggest the need for theories that extend GR in strong-field regimes [6]. These detections challenge traditional models, particularly in describing stellar structures under high densities and extreme conditions. In this context, the f(R) models [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and their particular realization in Starobinsky gravity offer insight into stellar stability and compactness properties that may deviate from GR predictions, thus making them attractive for modeling compact stars like QSs [22, 23, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. The gravitational wave signal from GW 190814 has initiated the possibility on the secondary object as a neutron star with a mass 2.6 M_{\odot}. The modified gravity theories have been proposed on this phenomena [22, 23] Another essential aspect of QS structure is pressure anisotropy, where the radial pressure, P_{r}, differs from the tangential pressure, P_{\perp}. Pressure anisotropy in compact stars is a natural consequence of various physical phenomena, including strong magnetic fields, rotation, and interactions among particles at ultra-high densities [24, 25]. In quark matter, pressure anisotropy affects the star’s mass-radius relation, stability, and compactness, making it crucial to include such anisotropic features when studying QSs under modified gravity [16, 26]. Indeed, pressure anisotropy has been shown to significantly alter the maximum mass and radius of compact stars, highlighting its relevance in the structure of QSs modeled within the Starobinsky framework [27]. This paper aims to investigate the effect of pressure anisotropy on the structural properties of QSs within the Starobinsky model. We employ a quark matter equation of state (EoS) tailored for anisotropic conditions, combined with the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) [28] equations in Starobinsky gravity, to analyze the impact on mass-radius relationships and compactness. Our results extend existing studies on compact stars in f(R) theories by specifically addressing how anisotropy modifies the predictions of Starobinsky gravity regarding QS structure. The plan of the paper is as follows: In Sec. II, we formulate the problem and derive the field equations for Starobinsky’s model under spherical symmetry. Section III presents the anisotropic quark matter EoS used in this study. In Sec. IV, we discuss our numerical results, focusing on the mass-radius relationship and stability conditions under varying anisotropic parameters. Section VI provides concluding remarks and future perspectives. Throughout the paper, we adopt the signature (-,+,+,+), and set c=1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05912v1,Do we live on the End of the World?,"We propose a scenario of a de Sitter universe living on an End-of-the-World brane. Motivated by the Swampland programme and in particular the Cobordism Conjecture, we consider a compact region of AdS5 nucleating from nothing, with a dS4 living on its boundary. We show that it can equivalently be interpreted as an up-tunnelling from AdS5 with cosmological constant \Lambda\to-\infty, following Brown and Dahlen’s proposal for ‘nothing’. Their picture naïvely leads to the conclusion that the brane has infinite negative tension. But we show that it becomes finite and positive once we employ holographic renormalization, recovering the Bubble of Something where the domain wall becomes a boundary of spacetime. The same holds true in any number of dimensions and, moreover, at the level of metric perturbations. This provides motivation for alternative routes of obtaining cosmology from quantum gravity or string theory using domain walls, departing from conventional vacuum approaches.","A wealth of observational evidence points to a universe that is undergoing an accelerated expansion Planck:2018vyg ; SupernovaCosmologyProject:1998vns ; SupernovaSearchTeam:1998fmf , consistent with a late time de Sitter (dS) vacuum. However, constructing dS vacua from the top down remains a great challenge in modern physics. Despite many interesting attempts to obtain them directly from fundamental theory (for example Kachru:2003aw ; Louis:2012nb ; Cicoli:2013cha ; Blaback:2013ht ; Antoniadis:2019rkh ; Cribiori:2019hrb ; Crino:2020qwk ), there is little doubt that they are hard to find and even harder to do so consistently, with full perturbative control. Indeed, the path towards finding dS vacua in string theory must get round a number of no-go theorems Maldacena:2000mw ; Kutasov:2015eba ; Green:2011cn and is paved with a range of potential pitfalls. For a sample of some of the things that can go wrong, see Moritz:2017xto ; Gautason:2013zw ; Bena:2009xk ; Danielsson:2014yga ; Michel:2014lva ; Liu:2024sgb . As a result of these difficulties, it has been conjectured that dS vacua may even be fundamentally incompatible with, at the very least, string theory Obied:2018sgi ; Ooguri:2018wrx ; Andriot:2018wzk ; Garg:2018reu . Or in other words, they lie in the Swampland of gravitational effective field theories. Although this view is not without nuance and opposition (see, for example, Hebecker:2018vxz ; Akrami:2018ylq ; Casse:2022ymj ), it is safe to say that the debate surrounding dS remains both lively and multi-faceted; for recent reviews on this topic, we refer the reader to Danielsson:2018ztv ; Dine:2020vmr ; Berglund:2022qsb ; VanRiet:2023pnx . Obtaining a model of quintessence in string theory, where the late time acceleration is due to a dynamical scalar field in slow roll, is arguably even more challenging Cicoli:2018kdo ; ValeixoBento:2020ujr ; Hebecker:2019csg ; Cicoli:2021fsd ; Cicoli:2021skd ; Hebecker:2023qke ; Cicoli:2024yqh . In this work, we will attack the problem of obtaining dS slightly differently to the mainstream approach found in the literature. Typically, you take your favourite string theory, compactify on some Calabi-Yau, add necessary ingredients such as fluxes and branes, and then check that the resulting effective theory is robust against g_{s} and \alpha^{\prime} corrections. Whilst it goes without saying that heroic efforts have been made in this direction, such a strategy also involves a preliminary choice: that we expect our universe to truly represent a vacuum state of the full theory. If the Landscape is vast, this is by no means inconceivable. But by making this choice, we omit by default a separate possibility that could perhaps be as numerous as (if not more than) the number of vacua: transitions between them. To emphasise, if some moduli locally tunnel between different vacuum configurations, it gives rise to domain walls partitioning these spatially separated regions. The question then becomes whether we can straightforwardly put dS on one of these domain walls. We advocate that the answer to this question is yes. Local physics on a domain wall is necessarily sensitive to the spacetime regions that it delimits and typically demands a certain hierarchy of scales between them in order to recover any realistic cosmology. One of our goals with this work is to skip this additional requirement by focusing on a very particular process: the decay of nothing into something. In other words, we consider the absence of spacetime and its content as the initial state and allow it to nucleate a bubble of spacetime. Although bizarre at first glance, it is instructive to first discuss the inverse process where spacetime decays to nothing, also known as the “Bubble of Nothing”. In the earliest version by Witten Witten:1981gj , he demonstrates that the Kaluza-Klein vacuum admits an instability that allows it to decay via bubble nucleation. As one approaches the bubble from the outside, the size of the internal S^{1} dynamically shrinks until it reaches zero size and ‘pinches off’. This zero-size locus, called an End-of-the-World (ETW) brane, becomes a new boundary of the spacetime in the sense that any point inside the bubble is infinite geodesic distance away. A way to understand this is by recognising that the lower-dimensional gravitational coupling diverges, \kappa_{4}^{-2}\sim\mathrm{Vol}(S^{1})\kappa_{5}^{-2}\to 0. In other words, there is effectively no spacetime inside the Bubble of Nothing, as the name suggests. The reversed process described by the same instanton, dubbed the “Bubble of Something”, should describe the creation of a spacetime from nothing. Alongside Bubbles of Nothing and ETW branes, they have gained a lot of traction within the Swampland programme in recent years Friedrich:2023tid ; Angius:2023uqk ; Blumenhagen:2023abk ; Huertas:2023syg ; Blanco-Pillado:2023aom ; Blanco-Pillado:2023hog ; Delgado:2023uqk , seeded by the Cobordism Conjecture McNamara:2019rup . Mathematically, cobordism is an equivalence relation between compact manifolds; two manifolds of the same dimension, say \mathcal{M} and \mathcal{M}^{\prime}, are said to be cobordant if there exists a manifold of one dimension higher, \mathcal{W}, whose boundary is the disjoint union of the two, \partial\mathcal{W}=\mathcal{M}\sqcup\mathcal{M}^{\prime}. Taking Witten’s Bubble of Nothing as an example, the pinching off of the S^{1} can be seen as a cobordism to nothing, since S^{1} is itself a boundary. The Cobordism Conjecture then states that, in quantum gravity, the group consisting of all such equivalence classes contains only the trivial element, i.e. any compactification can be related to nothing by a cobordism. In that regard, the conjecture predicts that the associated ETW branes must be included in the spectrum of domain walls. If that is the case, it appears natural for us to consider whether they can also serve as braneworlds. This will be the focus of our work. An interesting proposal was made by Brown and Dahlen that ‘nothing’ can in fact be thought about as Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space with \Lambda\to-\infty, where \Lambda is the cosmological constant Brown:2011gt . Or equivalently, take the AdS length scale to zero, \ell\to 0. It is appealing to ask whether this interpretation resonates with ideas from the Swampland programme. The subtlety in taking this limit, however, is that it by design leads to diverging quantities, potentially spoiling the effective description. For example, the brane tension will turn out to be negative for up-tunnelling processes, and we will show how it diverges in the aforementioned limit. The same was pointed out in Friedrich:2023tid where the authors necessitate some renormalization procedure to make the Brown-Dahlen interpretation consistent. The need to renormalize should not be unexpected. After all, the classical gravity description is not expected to hold in the limit where \ell\to 0, and so divergences are expected to occur from pushing the effective field theory beyond its regime of validity. The main part of this work will be to show precisely how to realise the required renormalization using holography. Before outlining the content of this paper, allow us to contrast with another similar idea, namely the “dark bubble cosmology” Banerjee:2019fzz ; Banerjee:2020wix ; Banerjee:2020wov ; Banerjee:2021qei ; Banerjee:2021yrb ; Danielsson:2022fhd ; Danielsson:2022odq ; Danielsson:2022lsl ; Banerjee:2022ree ; Basile:2023tvh ; Danielsson:2023alz ; Banerjee:2023uto ; Danielsson:2024frw . It is important to stress that it is inherently different from what we will discuss – however, the intuition shares similar features and will be of benefit to keep in mind. The motivation for the dark bubble stems from the non-supersymmetric AdS Instability Conjecture Ooguri:2016pdq , which poses that any such AdS geometry supported by fluxes, must possess an instability. Provided this statement, the dark bubble considers the decay \mathrm{AdS}_{5}^{+}\to\mathrm{AdS}_{5}^{-} (here we use +/- to denote the parent/daughter vacua) via the nucleation of a spherical co-dimension one brane. If there is a hierarchy \Lambda_{-}<\Lambda_{+}<0 between bulk cosmological constants, i.e. it is a down-tunnelling process, the junction conditions admit positive tension bubble walls and finite nucleation rates. Many aspects of the dark bubble have been explored in recent years, including black holes Banerjee:2021qei ; Danielsson:2024frw , gravitational waves Danielsson:2022fhd , electromagnetism Basile:2023tvh , and string theory embeddings Danielsson:2022odq ; Danielsson:2022lsl . In the spirit of Brown and Dahlen, the Bubble of Something can be viewed as an up-tunnelling event with \Lambda_{+}<\Lambda_{-}<0, and \Lambda_{+}\to-\infty. As we have already mentioned above, this naïvely requires a bubble wall of negative tension to support the transition. However, this is only true for the bare tension – the properly renormalized tension turns out to be positive. Of course, the Bubble of Something as an up-tunnelling is inherently different from the dark bubble scenario, where down-tunnelling occurs. We would also like to highlight two additional, differing features, which will play a pivotal rôle in our discussion. First is the fact that the dark bubble requires the non-normalizable graviton zero mode in order to give the correct effective graviton propagator on the bubble. This can be sourced by radially stretched bulk strings attached to the bubble. For our model, we will argue that the non-normalizable mode is not needed to recover the usual four-dimensional gravity, and that it is nevertheless suppressed in the \Lambda_{+}\to-\infty limit. Second is the emphasis that the dark bubble is fundamentally different from the Randall-Sundrum models Randall:1999vf ; Kaloper:1999sm , since there is no \mathbb{Z}_{2} symmetry across the brane. They are, in fact, asymmetric braneworlds Padilla:2004mc ; Padilla:2004tp ; Gergely:2003pn ; Gergely:2004ax with a well-defined notion of “inside” and “outside” Banerjee:2022ree . Another way to see this is that only the outside patch occupied by the initial vacuum state possesses a conformal boundary. Similarly, we will also argue that the Bubble of Something, despite it also admitting an inside and outside patch, can be interpreted as a one-sided version of a Randall-Sundrum like model. Finally, we would like to emphasise the rôle played by Euclidean methods in delivering a dS universe on a bubble wall. In D dimensions, the dominant instanton is expected to exhibit O(D) symmetry Coleman:1977th ; Oshita:2023pwr , with the domain wall corresponding to a (D-1)-dimensional spherical hypersurface at fixed radius. Upon Wick rotating this solution to Lorentzian signature, we see that the sphere becomes an expanding bubble wall with a (D-1)-dimensional dS geometry. The plan for the rest of this paper is as follows: in Section 2 we will compute the Bubble of Something instanton in two ways – first by interpreting ‘nothing’ as a vanishing contribution to the action, and second by considering it as AdS and subsequently taking the limit \Lambda\to-\infty. We discuss multiple interpretations of the instanton and provide the dS solution on the ETW brane. In Section 3 we argue that the infinities associated with the limit are artefacts of an unrenormalized theory. We give a basic introduction to holographic renormalization and use it to show that the different interpretations of Section 2 are equivalent. We also discuss metric perturbations and the localisation of gravity on the brane in each case. Appendix A provides a verification that these results can also be obtained from standard braneworld computations."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05906v1,"Galaxy Tomography with the Gravitational Wave Background 
from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries","The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar timing arrays suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole binary population. Although the observed spectrum generally aligns with predictions from orbital evolution driven by gravitational wave emission in circular orbits, there is a discernible preference for a turnover at the lowest observed frequencies. This turnover could indicate a significant hardening phase, transitioning from early environmental influences to later stages predominantly influenced by gravitational wave emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. By analyzing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we assess how the gravitational wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile prior to disruption by binary ejections, accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. Our findings suggest a parsec-scale galactic center density around \displaystyle 10^{6}\,M_{\odot}/\textrm{pc}^{3} across most of the parameter space, offering insights into the environmental effects on black hole evolution and combined matter density near galaxy centers.","Recent advances by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), leveraging precise measurements of timing residuals within a galactic-scale detector, have ushered in a new era of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) detection. The SGWB, defined by a superposition of incoherent gravitational waves (GWs), initially emerged as a common-spectrum process [1, 2, 3, 4]. Subsequent data provided robust evidence of a quadrupolar correlation function [5, 6, 7, 8], famously known as the Hellings-Downs curve [9], further affirming the SGWB’s presence and characteristics. The observed spectrum of the SGWB is consistent with expectations for a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), dominated by binaries with comparable mass ratios, total masses in the range of \displaystyle 10^{9.2-10.4}\,M_{\odot}, and redshifts from \displaystyle 0.15 to \displaystyle 0.9 [10, 11], where \displaystyle M_{\odot} represents the solar mass. Although the spectrum is consistent with a steady spectral slope driven by GW emission from circular binaries, it also suggests a low-frequency turnover [10, 12]. This feature implies an acceleration in the rate of orbital hardening, offering a potential solution to the final parsec problem [13, 14]. Possibilities include interactions with environmental factors—such as gas [15, 16], stars [17], and dark matter (DM) [18]—and the impact of significant initial orbital eccentricities [19, 20, 21]. An intriguing aspect of environmental interactions involves the role of stars and particle DM, which are noted for their potentially high density in galactic centers (GCs) [22, 23, 24]. Both stars and DM can be expelled from the system through gravitational slingshots during encounters with binary components, thereby extracting orbital energy [17]. This process involves three-body scattering, where the energy extraction efficiency is significantly higher than that of two-body dynamical friction [25], especially when the binary components have comparable masses and are sufficiently close. Such three-body slingshot interactions can substantially alter the density profile of the GC, particularly flattening the inner distribution [18, 26]. This underscores the importance of considering the co-evolution of the density profile and the binary orbit. A pivotal study by Ref. [27] demonstrates that the orbital hardening rate observed in N-body simulations can be effectively approximated by results from scattering experiments [17] within environments characterized by the GC distribution at the SMBHB influence radius [28] prior to disruption. In this study, we examine the impact of initial GC density profiles and SMBHB eccentricities on the SGWB spectrum, utilizing NANOGrav’s 15-year dataset to constrain the parameter space of these two factors."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05893v1,"Physics, Philosophy, ”Observers” and Multiverses","We comment on the fact that certain mathematical models that have been proposed in the quantum gravity literature, may not be subject to experimental checks, even if they turn out to be mathematically well defined. This means that they would be indistinguishable from other models, with a smaller number of quantum states. These considerations follow from very general properties of quantum measurement theory and classical gravity.","At the moment, science has no complete understanding of the emergence of life from non-living matter, let alone of the emergence of what we call conscious self awareness from more primitive forms of life. In particular, we do not really know the role that language plays in what we call consciousness or intelligence111See for example, octopi.. What we do know is that language played an extremely important role in the development of conscious awareness and intelligence for homo sapiens on the planet Earth. We also know that language is the most important tool our species uses to further our genetically imprinted urges toward lying, cheating and fantasizing. This was perhaps said best by Francis Bacon at the dawn of the re-invention of science in western Europe. The trouble, Bacon explained, is that everything, even the framing of experiments, begins with language, with words; and words have a fatal tendency to substitute themselves for the facts they are supposed merely to report or reflect. While men believe that their reason governs words, in fact words react on the understanding; that is, they shape rather than serve rationality. Even precise definitions, Bacon lamented, don’t help because the definitions themselves consist of words, and those words beget others and as the sequence of hypotheses and calculations extends itself, the investigator is carried not closer to but ever further way from the independent object he had set out to apprehend. In Bacon’s mind the danger of words going off on their own unconstrained-by-the-world way was but one example of the deficiencies we have inherited from the sin of Adam and Eve. In men’s love of their own words (and therefore of themselves), he saw the effects ”of that venom which the serpent infused and which makes the mind of man to swell.” As an antidote he proposed his famous method of induction, which mandates very slow, small, experimental steps; no proposition is to be accepted until it has survived the test of negative examples brought in to invalidate it. In the evolution of scientific thought since Bacon’s time we have come to accept two different methods of scientific reasoning as acceptable definitions of truth. The first is essentially the Baconian one: everything must be subjected to experimental test. This has been modified by the notion of what we now call effective theories. We’ve found, over and over again, that the fundamental conceptual foundations of our theories of physics are wrong, despite their agreement with experiment over a wide range of conditions. The reason for this is that the more correct theory, which replaces them in regimes where they fail, is based on concepts unfamiliar to our everyday intuition. It is more complex, and is well approximated by the ”wrong” effective theory, within a certain range of conditions. So we never throw out the wrong theory, just accept its limitations. The second accepted definition of truth is mathematical rigor. Once a proof has been properly vetted, all mathematicians will be able to follow it and verify its validity by following a set of well defined rules. There also seems to be a mysterious[1] way in which mathematical concepts ”inhabit” the physical world, so that we can use the tools of mathematics to prove truths about ”reality”. However, here we are entering into treacherous territory and are in danger of crossing the boundary between science and philosophy that Francis Bacon tried so hard to establish. Mathematics quite obviously has many things in it that have nothing to do with the real world. We don’t yet know what they all are, and it would be a mistake to jump to conclusions. If some genius in the 19th century had realized that complex linear algebra defined a new kind of probability theory, in which Bayes’ rule of conditional probabilities was not true, that person would have been laughed out of the university and sent to an insane asylum. If you had asked me in graduate school whether I thought there would ever be any use in physics for a concept called ”modular tensor categories” (which didn’t yet exist) I would have said no. The mathematicians from whom I learned category theory called it ”abstract nonsense”, a technical term. Nonetheless, it’s clear that ”there are more things in mathematicians’ philosophy than are dreamed of in heaven and earth”. In this brief note I want to note two popular subjects in contemporary high energy theoretical physics, where I think mathematical philosophizing has ignored the Baconian injunction to submit hypotheses to careful tests. I’ve discussed one of these at length before[2] but recently attended a conference where it was clear that not all of those points had come across. The other is the recently fashionable discussion of ”observers” of finite regions of space-time in terms of the crossed product construction of Type II factors from Type III factors in algebraic quantum field theory. I will begin with the latter. I much prefer the terminology ”detector” to ”observer”, since it avoids all of the confusion about the connection of quantum mechanics to consciousness that has generated so much nonsense in popular literature222See the novel Dark Matter by Blake Crouch, and the even sillier TV adaptation on Apple+ , for a recent example. . As first appreciated by von Neumann, and made more precise by work on decoherence in the 1960s and 1970s, a detector is a large quantum system, with many collective variables called pointers. Each pointer corresponds to a large subsystem with of order e^{N} states and N is a reasonably large power of 10. One can think of N as the number of atoms in the pointer. For concreteness we imagine the system the detector is supposed to probe is made up of q-bits and that each pointer variable is two valued. The commutators of the pointer variables are proportional to inverse powers of N, and the interference terms between different quantum histories of the pointer variables are exponentially small in N. If this is the case, the quantum predictions for probabilities of observations made on the pointer variables obey stochastic differential equations, with small fluctuation terms and the probabilities satisfy Bayes’ conditional probability rule with accuracy exponential in N.. If there is one independent pointer variable per q-bit in the system, then the detector can make a complete measurement of the quantum state of the system. A measurement is a unitary operation that creates a completely entangled state between the q-bits of the system and the two valued pointer variables of the detector. One then uses Bayes’ rule to make conclusions about interactions between the pointer variables of the detector and those of other macroscopic systems. The rules of classical probability theory apply and apart from the usual worries about not being able to do an infinite number of re-runs of each experiment we have a completely comprehensible theory of prediction of the quantum behavior of the system being measured. It’s immediately obvious that a detector cannot detect everything about the quantum state of a universe, or part of the universe that contains itself, because the pointer variables are by definition insufficient to differentiate the quantum states of the detector. However, simple things that we know about how to construct mathematical models of detectors, and about the classical physics of gravitation, tell us that the a priori constraints on the notion of a detector in a theory of quantum gravity are much more severe than the above self evident statements. Mathematical models of systems with pointer variables, which apply to the real world, are all cut off versions of quantum field theories, most rigorously constructed on a lattice. The pointers are made from averages of local fields (typically conserved densities) over large regions. However, it has been known for a long time333I first heard this argument from G. ’t Hooft some time in the 1980s, but it surely pre-dates that. that most of the states that a quantum field theory assigns to a large space-time region have a large semi-classical backreaction. If we use the expectation value of the stress tensor in those states to compute a gravitational field, it forms a black hole larger than the original region. Imposing some kind of cutoff to avoid such black holes in a fixed size causal diamond, one finds that the logarithm of the number of remaining states scales like (\frac{A_{\diamond}}{G_{N}})^{\frac{d-1}{d}}, (1.1) where A_{\diamond} is the volume of the largest spacelike d-2 surface on the boundary of the diamond. In an important paper[3] Cohen, Kaplan and Nelson showed that omitting all of the offending states from QFT did not affect the agreement between QFT and the most precise experiments ever done. Further refinements of their result can be found in[4] and indicate that it is unlikely any disagreement will ever be found, because the effect can be pushed away by different choices of the field theory cut off. On the other hand, a variety of arguments[5] suggest that the actual entropy in a diamond is given by \frac{A_{\diamond}}{4G_{N}}. This means that, in principle, the number of quantum states in any detector is smaller by a factor of order e^{-(\frac{A_{\diamond}}{4G_{N}})^{\frac{1}{d}}}, (1.2) than the number of states in the diamond, while the number of pointer variables is exponentially smaller than the number of states in the detector. The situation in de Sitter space is demonstrably worse, and if the conjectures of[7][8][14][15][17] are correct, any causal diamond for non-negative cosmological constant, and any diamond smaller than the AdS radius for negative c.c. behaves quite analogously. For dS space of radius R, localized objects with mass M correspond to constrained states where of order MR (in units where \hbar=1) q-bits are frozen relative to the empty diamond density matrix. Furthermore, most of the states of mass M are black holes, which do not have a lot of pointer variables and cannot serve as useful detectors. So, at least in dS space, the more complex and sophisticated a detector we build, the smaller the subspace of the full Hilbert space we are allowed to probe. This problem comes on top of the restrictions we’ve already discussed. In light of these a priori constraints coming from semi-classical restrictions on the validity of the QFT description of the space of states in a localized region of space-time, it appears that any attempt to model a detector by a quantum mechanical degree of freedom with a continuous spectrum grossly overcounts the actual capabilities of any physically realizable detector. The mathematical basis for that model of detectors was the crossed product construction of Type II_{\infty} algebras from the Type III_{1} algebras assigned to causal diamonds by quantum field theory. It should be noted that this construction, although it allows certain operators to have finite traces, actually enlarges the Type III_{1} algebra, which certainly violates the spirit of what the arguments about black holes lead us to expect of the modification of QFT by gravity. It has been argued that the Type II_{1} truncation of the crossed product that has been proposed for dS space[12] only contains (in perturbation theory) the non-local BRST invariant sub-algebra of field theory operators. If this is true, it is at least consistent with the intuition that gravitational effects drastically reduce the number of physical operators. The question at issue here is whether any of these objects, which apart from the non-renormalizability of gravity, are mathematically well defined in perturbation theory, actually correspond to things that a physical detector in real dS space could detect. The longest lived physical detectors in a universe like our own travel along some time-like trajectory in a Schwarzschild dS space-time. The Schwarzschild-dS space is associated with some local group of galaxies, the trajectory of whose center of mass is decohered by the many quantum states of the galaxies’ constituents. This trajectory is not exactly a geodesic because of the interaction of the local group with Gibbons-Hawking radiation, even after all other macroscopic bodies have gotten microscopically close to the local group’s cosmological horizon. If one considers the center of mass of the local group to be the position of a relativistic particle, it would be spread around the horizon of any geodesic’s causal diamond in a relatively short time by its own quantum fluctuations or the effect of interaction of Gibbons-Hawking radiation and redshifting of quasi-normal modes. This is probably irrelevant. The center of mass is entangled with all of the constituents of the local group, so it will define its own cosmological horizon until it collapses into a black hole (the latter time is the bound on the utility of our detector, which is some macroscopic subsystem in the local group) and radiates its degrees of freedom back to thermal equilibrium. As we’ve argued above, our detector can only access a finite amount of quantum information, smaller by multiple exponential factors than the Gibbons Hawking entropy of dS space. There’s certainly no meaning to talking about an infinite dimensional algebra of quantum operators that are accessible to measurement, even in principle. The Type II_{1} proposal for dS space or other finite area causal diamonds is thus a part of philosophy, and not physics. Even finite dimensional models which talk about a Hilbert space whose size is determined by the Gibbons Hawking entropy formula will only be amenable to partial experimental verification. Although this is tangential to the point of the present paper, I want to repeat a point that was made in[11]. Causal diamonds in QFT do not have density matrices because the singularity of field theory commutators on the light cone implies an infinite entanglement entropy. It also implies an infinite uncertainty (\Delta K)^{2} for the modular Hamiltonian. With any regularization scheme the ratio of these two quantities is finite and non-zero. There’s a class of regularization schemes that puts a UV cutoff on the momenta tranverse to the light cone, which obtains (\Delta K)^{2}=\langle K\rangle, essentially because they preserve a near horizon Virasoro symmetry[14][15]. A beautiful regularization scheme[16] that preserves higher dimensional conformal invariance, relates this ratio to a coefficient in the two point function of the stress tensor[18]. Remarkably, for all CFTs that have large radius holographic duals, the coefficient is again equal to 1[19] in agreement with a replica calculation[20]. This is the value predicted quite generally in quantum gravity by the arguments of[14][15] as generalized by[17]. The result (\Delta K)^{2}=\langle K\rangle has also been obtained recently for dS space by a replica trick[11]. For large black holes in AdS_{d}, the coefficient is instead d-2 because of the tensor network structure of the quantum theory and the dominance of the entropy by compressible modes of the tensor network. In all cases the expectation value and fluctuation of the modular Hamiltonian are rendered finite simultaneously and are proportional. The crossed product construction and its Type II_{1} deformation fail to give results resembling these. In the crossed product one makes the entropy finite but the fluctuation is infinite. The hypothesis that the density matrix is the unit matrix (originally made in[9][10][8]) gives zero fluctuation."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.03521v1,Asy Static Finite Distance,"Erasing a black hole leaves spacetime flat, so light passing through the region before any star forms and after the black hole’s evaporation shows no time delay, just like a flying mirror that returns to its initial starting point. Quantum radiation from a round-trip flying mirror has not been solved despite the model’s mathematical simplicity and physical clarity. Here, we solve the particle creation from worldlines that asymptotically start and stop at the same spot, resulting in interesting spectra and symmetries, including the time dependence of thermal radiance associated with Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac Bogolubov coefficients. Fourier analysis, intrinsically linked to the Bogolubov mechanism, shows that a thermal Bogolubov distribution does not describe the spin-statistics of the quantum field.","Investigating the fascinating dynamics of quantum fields through the frequency distribution of their spectra reveals important insight behind particle creation, especially from black holes [1]. One well-established method to investigate the fundamental mechanisms leading to particle creation from the quantum vacuum is the study of radiation from moving mirrors as an analog to black hole radiance [2, 3, 4]. To investigate fundamental physical phenomena, moving mirrors provide a simple model for addressing a wide range of complex problems. For example, they have helped understand the information loss problem [5, 6, 7, 8], entanglement harvesting [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], fluctuation-dissipation [15, 16], holography [17, 18, 19, 20, 21], conformal field theory [22], and complexity [23]. More generally, the dynamic Casimir effect (DCE) [24], wherein time-dependent (i.e., moving) mirrors interact with the quantum vacuum, resulting in particle production (see [25, 26, 27] for reviews), has an expanding literature helping confirm the effectiveness of the moving mirror model [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]; notably, study of partially reflective mirrors [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40], quantum radiation reaction forces [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50], and experimental verification [51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]. A largely unexplored aspect of the moving mirror model is closed-path motion. See Fig. 1 for an illustration. Such trajectories asymptotically start and stop at the same spot. Consider the unusual footprint of closed-path trajectories: • A spectrometer observes no Doppler shift (unlike motion from rest that ends with a constant velocity). • A light clock observes no time delay (unlike motion that is overall shifted by a distance traveled). • There is no asymptotic evidence that the motion ever happened, except by the particle and energy creation. A completely evaporated black hole leaves spacetime flat, with no residual curvature. To test this, one could compare the passage of light through the region before any star formed and after the black hole has fully evaporated; both scenarios should show no time delay. Similarly, a closed-path flying mirror should produce no time delay difference. Observed particle creation and energy emission are purely due to the mirror’s motion rather than its overall position or difference between the initial and end-state. Round-trip solutions have zero net displacements, which allows for understanding how motion alone (i.e., the non-asymptotic, intermediate movement) can influence particle production by quantum fields. A wide range of round-trip motions can occur, with some exhibiting oscillations that are gradually driven and damped, ultimately leading the object to settle at its equilibrium position, such as in the case of a modulated Gaussian or exponential decay [50, 58]. The highly constrained (see Table 1) perfectly reflecting round-trip mirror emits the same energy on both sides, unlike net-displaced asymptotically static mirrors. This theoretical symmetry is complemented by experimental potential, which favors a closed path for isolation and study (cf. classical acceleration temperature (CAT) in a box [59]). Confined accelerating mirrors could provide clear observational signals that can be analyzed to understand better the external effects of boundary conditions on quantum fields. Trajectories that asymptotically return to rest with a net positional shift (one-way flights) have been worked out (see ‘Evanescents’ in Table 2). However, the more restrictive Bogolubov transformation for round-trip trajectories has been intractable. This paper presents novel quantum radiative solutions for several closed-path trajectories. The non-relativistic regime allows analytical solutions of finite particle production from the quantum vacuum. The structure of the paper is as follows: in section II, we review only the essential formulas for confirming the time and frequency domain analysis of energy production from round-trip flying mirrors. For example, in Eq. (4), we state the Bogolubov betas are Fourier transforms of the trajectory. Section III (Gauss-Lorentz) is devoted to the spectral analysis of round-trip flying mirror radiation and some exciting spectra. Leveraging the insight gained from these examples, we compute round-trip trajectories that exhibit thermal Bogolubov distributions in section IV (Bose-Einstein) and section V (Fermi-Dirac). Finally, section VI summarizes the main findings. Units are c=\mu_{0}=\epsilon_{0}=1, where Planck’s constant \hbar is left unset to emphasize the quantum field effects. Figure 1: The Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Hyperbolic Secant trajectories, Eq. (10), Eq. (14), and Eq. (18), are plotted in phase space with maximum velocity 50%, 40%, and 30% the speed of light, respectively. Closed-path motion requires a finite orbit with a time-asymptotic approach to and from the origin: (position, velocity) \rightarrow(0,0)."
