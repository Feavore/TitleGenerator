https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10335v1,Topological vortices in planar S-TI-S Josephson junctions,"We discuss the Josephson vortices in planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) junctions, where the TI section is narrow and long. We are motivated by recent experiments, especially by those in junctions of Corbino ring geometry, where non-zero critical current was observed at low temperatures even if a non-zero phase winding number (fluxoid) was enforced in the ring by the perpendicular magnetic field. In this paper we focus on the “atomic” limit in which the low-energy bound states of different vortices do not overlap. In this limit we can associate the non-vanishing critical current with the irregularities (disorder) in the junction’s width. We also discuss the microwave spectroscopy of the Josephson vortices in the atomic limit and observe particularly simple selection rules for the allowed transitions.","The Majorana zero modes in artificial topological superconductors Kitaev (2001) have been in focus of both academic and industrial research for the last two decades. The leading proposals allowing for experimental realization are the 1-D semiconducting wires proximitized by regular superconductors Oreg et al. (2010); Lutchyn et al. (2010), the extended planar (2-D) Josephson junctions on the surface of a 3-D topological insulatorFu and Kane (2008, 2009)(Fu & Kane proposal) and the chains of magnetic adatoms on superconducting surfaces Nadj-Perge et al. (2013). All these systems have by now been studied experimentally (see, e.g., Ref. Aghaee et al., 2023 (and many earlier works) for 1-D wires, Ref. Yue et al., 2024 for the planar Josephson junctions and Ref. Nadj-Perge et al., 2014 for the chains of adatoms). This paper is dedicated to the study of the planar (Fu & Kane) platform and is motivated by the recent spark in the associated experimental activity Zhang et al. (2022); Yue et al. (2024); Park et al. (2024). Whereas Ref. Yue et al., 2024 addresses the Fraunhofer pattern in a long Josephson junction with open ends, in Refs. Zhang et al., 2022; Park et al., 2024 long Josephson junctions of Corbino geometry were investigated. We focus here on the Corbino geometry as it allows to avoid the complications related to the boundary conditions at the open ends. Indeed, in the Josephson junctions with the open ends one measures Yue et al. (2024) the standard Fraunhofer pattern since arbitrary magnetic flux is allowed in the junction. The simplest approach of integrating the local current-phase relation over the length of the junction might be a good first approximation, but might also miss the subtle effects related to the boundary conditions at the open ends, i.a., the 1-D Majorana modes having to hybridize there with the continuum of modes. The Corbino geometry avoids all these complications but, on the other hand, is subject to flux (fluxoid) quantization. Thus one cannot measure the full Fraunhofer pattern, but only the discrete points corresponding to the integer number of flux quanta, where naively the Josephson current should vanish. We aim at elucidating the recently observed Zhang et al. (2022); Park et al. (2024) non-vanishing Josephson currents in circular Corbino junctions when a non-zero number of flux quanta (fluxoids) are trapped in the ring. These should be closely related to the lifting of the zero nodes of the Fraunhofer pattern in the open-end junctions Yue et al. (2024). The fact that these Josephson currents emerge only at temperatures much lower than the superconducting gap, induced in the TI, leads us to believe that they are related to the low-energy Andreev states in the Josephson vortices (a.k.a. Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) statesCaroli et al. (1964)). To explain this phenomenon we examine the atomic limit of the Josephson vortex lattice created by an external magnetic field in the TI part of the junction Grosfeld and Stern (2011); Potter and Fu (2013); Hegde et al. (2020); Backens et al. (2022). We observe that irregularities (disorder) in, e.g., the width of the junction can explain the presence of the observed Josephson currents, as conjectured in Ref. Zhang et al., 2022. Moreover, our simple estimates reproduce correctly the magnitude of the current observed in the experiment Park et al. (2024). We also study the current profiles associated with the individual CdGM states and show how these are modified by the disorder. Finally, we investigate the microwave spectroscopy of the low-energy Andreev (CdGM) states. We predict very peculiar selection rules for the allowed transitions, characteristic for the Josephson vortices in long topological Josephson junctions."

To this end, we consider two coupled ferromagnets, one in the ground state and one in an inverted state with respect to an applied magnetic field. The resulting energetic instability leads to a quantum spin current in the vacuum state that is sustained by the creation of magnon-antimagnon pairs at the interface. We show that these quantum fluctuations imprint a steady-state entanglement onto the two dipole-coupled color centers through nonlocal dissipation. We derive conditions for establishing a maximally entangled Bell state. This entanglement is absent in thermal equilibrium.","References Chatterjee et al. [2021] A. Chatterjee, P. Stevenson, S.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09780v1,Random-Flux-Induced Topological Phase Transitions and Chern Insulators,"We study the relevance of random flux on stability and emergence of topological phases of matter. A particularly interesting model in the presence of random flux is the anisotropic Wilson-Dirac model in two spatial dimensions. We show that this model exhibits an intriguing topological phase transition from a weak topological insulator to a Chern insulator driven by random flux. We numerically establish a global phase diagram of this model in presence of random flux. We uncover the underlying mechanism of topological phase transitions with an analytical effective medium theory, illustrating momentum-dependent renormalizations of model parameters by random flux. This analysis allows us to identify quasi-critical phase points at transitions between weak and strong topological phases, where eigen states are extended in one spatial direction but localized in the other one. Our results describe a qualitatively new effect of disorder on topological phases of matter.","References Anderson (1958) P. W. Anderson, “Absence of diffusion in certain random lattices”, Phys.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09754v1,Coherent Magneto-Conductance Oscillations in Amorphous Topological Insulator Nanowires,"Recent experiments on amorphous materials have established the existence of surface states similar to those of crystalline three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) ([1, 2, 3]). Amorphous topological insulators are also independently of interest for thermo-electric and other properties. To develop an understanding of transport in these systems, we carry out quantum transport calculations for a tight-binding model of an amorphous nano-wire pierced by an axial magnetic flux, then compare the results to known features in the case of crystalline models with disorder. Our calculations complement previous studies in the crystalline case that studied the surface or used a Green’s function method ([4, 5]). We find that the periodicity of the conductance signal with varying magnetic flux is comparable to the crystalline case, with maxima occurring at odd multiples of magnetic flux quanta. However, the expected amplitude of the oscillation decreases with increasing amorphousness, as defined and described in the main text. We characterize this deviation from the crystalline case by taking ensemble averages of the conductance signatures for various wires with measurements simulated at finite temperatures. This striking transport phenomenon offers a metric to characterize amorphous TIs and stimulate further experiments on this class of materials.","Topological insulators (TIs) induced by spin-orbit coupling are of significant applied interest due to their potential utility in spintronics and novel quantum device applications [6, 7]. It is well known that TI surface states are robust in principle to the breaking of translational invariance through some amount of non-magnetic local disorder, including amorphous structure [8, 9, 10]. Recent experimental progress has demonstrated that an amorphous form of bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3), which is a well-studied TI in crystalline form, can have surface states that are visible in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and appear similar to those in the crystalline case.[1, 11] It is natural to ask whether other distinctive features that distinguish the topological insulator state from an ordinary insulator are present in the amorphous case. Aside from fundamental interest, this is of applied importance as amorphous materials can have practical advantages over crystalline ones, such as ready integration with conventional semiconductors. Here we are interested in characterizing a distinct transport phenomenon in an amorphous three-dimensional TI invariant under time-reversal (\mathcal{T}) symmetry. Such a state is characterized by a gapped bulk and a protected gapless surface state. The transport phenomenon we now explain has previously been studied in crystalline TIs[5, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15] and is a distinct, quantitative signature of the topological state. The surface state is modelled by a gapless Dirac fermion. However, if the system assumes the geometry of an infinite cylindrical wire then this mode is no longer protected and a gap emerges. This occurs due to the induced compatible spin structure on the cylindrical surface which encodes a \pi Berry flux and sets the fermion in the Ramond sector, that is, with periodic boundary conditions [16, 4, 17]. This implies that the fermionic modes occur in degenerate pairs while the \mathcal{T} symmetry protects only the parity of the number of surface modes. With these boundary conditions the modes are gapped. The protected gapless mode can be re-established by threading an additional \pi Berry flux through the bulk of the cylinder via a magnetic flux of magnitude h/2e. Such a wire thus exhibits conductance oscillations with period h/e, but with a half-period shift (a \pi phase shift) compared to conventional Aharonov-Bohm oscillations. This is also to be contrasted with the Sharvin-Sharvin [18] type weak localization oscillations of period h/2e [19]. Figure 1: (a) Cuboidal geometry of nano-wire with magnetic flux penetrating the bulk in the length of the wire. (b) The cubic unit cell for diamond used to assemble a crystalline wire. Figure 2: Oscillations of the conductance of the wire with a Fu-Kane-Mele type crystalline Hamiltonian for a sample of 5\times 5\times 40 unit cells with varying flux quanta. In [5], this effect was investigated by considering the effective theory of a 2D Dirac fermion in the presence of a Gaussian surface disorder potential. In Ref [4] a three-dimensional simulation of the effect was done with onsite surface disorder which also shows robustness of the conductance oscillations. The analysis there was done using a recursive Green’s function method. The conductance signal for a crystalline wire is reproduced in Figure 2. Experimentally, the predicted topological version of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations has been observed in topological insulator nanowires [12, 13, 14, 15] and provided a practical way to isolate effects of the topological surface states even when bulk conduction is nonzero, as is the case for most or all 3D TI materials as-grown. Since the bulk of the wire does not respond with the same period to the applied flux (indeed, as a continuous range of periods are present, the bulk contribution does not show regular oscillatory behavior), the oscillations are determined by surface state conduction. Among other generalizations, there is a superconducting version of the \pi-flux effect when the TI nanowire is proximitized by superconducting contacts.[20, 21] Here we investigate this effect for a 3D amorphous system using a scattering transport calculation. We use the geometry of a cuboid which is topologically equivalent to a cylinder as shown in Figure 1. We will start from the Fu-Kane-Mele [22] model for the 3D crystalline TI. Our method is to introduce connectivity defects into the lattice to ‘amorphize’ it. The amorphization procedure we employ locally preserves coordination number. We consider tight-binding models on these structures that have an exponentially decaying hopping amplitude, mimicking the dispersion of inter-atomic bonds. Models in this class conserve local order in the absence of long-range order. This is in contrast with the first models to predict topological phases in amorphous electronic systems, which do not conserve coordination number and construct hoppings between randomly arranged sites using the vector that connects them [9]. We choose to focus on models of the former type because they are more realistic [10] and have been invoked to find exact results on 2D amorphous systems. Results include proof of the persistence of spectral gaps in models of amorphous silicon [23, 24], prediction of a topological phase diagram for amorphous topological insulators [10], and the manifestation of flat band-like degeneracies in amorphous models of a platform relevant to topological photonics experiments [25]. In this work, we numerically investigate a 3D variation on these models hosted on an amorphized diamond structure. We first demonstrate the formation of the Dirac cone for an amorphous system by treating it as a super-cell, that is, imposing periodic boundary conditions in the long direction of the wire (see Figure 4) (henceforth {\bf\hat{z}}) and varying magnetic field. Then we use the Landauer formalism using the python package kwant [26, 27, 28] to find and characterize the conductance signatures of wires of these systems for different connectivity defect densities (as defined in the next section), sizes, and temperatures."

Starting from the real charge density waves (rCDWs) at the p-type Van Hove singularity, we conduct a thorough analysis of the post-pump dynamics by time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory. Our analysis uncovers distinct dynamical phenomena under linearly and circularly polarized pumps. Linearly polarized pumps induce directional preferences in the rCDWs, accompanied by an enhancement in the flat band. Unexpectedly, charge nematicity also emerges and receives maximal enhancement at a resonant pump frequency, which we understand with a Rabi-oscillation-like model. On the other hand, circularly polarized pumps suppress the rCDWs uniformly and triggers imaginary CDWs (iCDWs) with charge loop currents. Our results can be directly compared to the pump-probe experiments on the kagome metals AV3Sb5.","References Yin et al. [2022] J.-X. Yin, B. Lian, and M. Z.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10039v1,The Magnetic Dislocation in Photonics,"The dislocation created in the topological material lays the foundation of many significant findings to control light but requires delicate fabrication of the material. To extend its flexibility and reconfigurability, we propose the magnetic dislocation concept and unveil its properties in a representative model, which effectively combines the topological defect and edge mode at the magnetic domain wall. The results include distinct localization modes and robust light trapping phenomena with the rainbow feature where the eigen-energy of each light-trapping state can be linearly tuned by the magnetic dislocation. The conversion from the trapping state to edge modes can be harnessed by further adiabatically pumping light across an amount of the magnitude of the magnetic dislocation. Our work solves a fundamental problem by introducing magnetic dislocation with new light-manipulation flexibility, which may be implemented in a variety of platforms in photonic, acoustics, and optomechanics with dynamic modulations and synthetic dimensions.","Dislocation, as the topological defect, describes the distortion of the hosting lattice, usually characterized as the real-space topology that cannot be eliminated by local continuous modifications [1, 2, 3, 4]. Recently, it has been realized that the interplay between dislocations and band topology in topological materials brings novel ways in light manipulations against disorders [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], including the light-trapping [13], bulk probes of higher-order topological insulators [18], simulating three-dimensional topology [20, 22, 23, 24], controlling the topology of material [21], and probing the topology of the system [25, 26]. Previous studies have focused on the dislocation configurations from spatially designed topological defect [4, 5, 13, 21, 27, 28, 29, 30], which has limited reconfigurability, particularly in the optical regime [31]. The effective magnetic field for photonics provides a powerful approach to control the motion of light in a flexible way [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], with which the photonic analogy of quantum Hall effect can be realized in photonics platforms [33, 34, 35, 36]. As for dislocation in the hosting lattice, it has been indicated that the effective gauge potential generated from the geometrical dislocation is the main reason affecting the property of the topological defect mode [4]. It is, therefore, of fundamental interest to explore the direct dislocation in an effective magnetic field, namely magnetic dislocation, in photonics, which not only deepens the fundamental understanding of the dislocation mechanism but also shows new potential in reconfigurable light manipulation. In this work, we theoretically study the fundamental problem of the magnetic dislocation in a spatially uniform tight-binding (TB) lattice. The magnetic dislocation is introduced by designing non-continuously distributed hopping phases to construct a magnetic singularity in the underlying lattice without spatial defect, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The introduction of such artificial magnetic dislocation is in-principle different from previous models with dislocation well-defined in spatial structures [4, 39], but is universal to be possibly constructed for waves using recent experimental technologies in photonics [40, 41, 42], acoustics [43, 44], and optomechanics [45, 46, 47]. We unveil such concept of magnetic dislocation as the composition of two effective mechanisms, namely the topological defect and edge mode at the magnetic domain wall simultaneously. Therefore, by tuning the discontinuous hopping phase, light can be trapped at the singularity of the magnetic flux with the rainbow feature [48, 49], i.e., the eigen-energy of each light-trapping state varies with the tuning of the magnetic dislocation monotonically. Such light trapping state can be converted to edge modes by adiatically pumping the light. Our proposal can be generalized to all electromagnetic waves [50], which may trigger further research interest in topological defects with magnetic singularities and novel wave manipulations [51, 52, 53]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09985v1,Optical response of edge modes in time-reversal symmetric topological superconductors,"Topological superconductors and Majorana edge modes at their boundaries have been theoretically predicted. However, their experimental observation remains controversial. Recent theoretical studies suggest that chiral Majorana edge modes exhibit distinct spatially-resolved optical conductivity compared to chiral Dirac edge modes. In this work, we investigate the optical conductivity and spatially-resolved optical conductivity induced by Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes under time-reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry. We conduct numerical calculations and analytical calculations with edge effective theory for two-dimensional {\mathbb{Z}}_{2} topological insulators, strong topological superconductors, and topological crystalline superconductors. Our results show that even under time-reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes exhibit different optical responses.","Since the theoretical discovery of Majorana fermions in topological superconductors, their experimental realization has been awaited for the past decades. Representative examples of theoretical predictions include edge modes of one-dimensional p-wave superconductors [1] and two-dimensional p+{\mathrm{i}}p superconductors [2]. Indeed, enormous efforts have been made to realize these systems [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. One of the most difficult challenges is the detection of Majorana fermions. There exist a lot of proposals to solve this problem, such as zero-bias peaks in the differential conductance, the fractional Josephson effect, and the half-integer conductance plateau [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], and actual experiments have been conducted [19, 20, 21, 22]. However, results obtained using the existing methods are sometimes controversial due to the difficulty in distinguishing effects caused by Majorana fermions from those arising from other physical phenomena [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. Therefore, it is still important to develop new schemes to detect Majorana fermions. One of the promising routes for realizing topological superconductors is the proximity effect [29, 30]. For example, topological superconductivity has been proposed in hybrid systems composed of topological insulators and superconductors [31, 32]. Another proposal is the surface superconductivity proximity-induced by bulk superconductivity of topological materials [33, 34, 35]. In these cases, in addition to the difficulty of detecting Majorana fermions, it is crucial to distinguish between Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes, which originate from topological superconductors and insulators, respectively. Recently, Ref. [36] has theoretically proposed that the spatially-resolved optical conductivity, which measures the conductivity when light is applied to only part of the system, can distinguish between the Majorana edge mode in the p+{\mathrm{i}}p superconductor and the Dirac edge mode in a Chern insulator. Although both p+{\mathrm{i}}p superconductor and Chern insulator exhibit similar linear dispersions in their edge modes, the difference between Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes leads to distinct behaviors in the spatially-resolved optical conductivity. Topological superconductivity can coexist with time-reversal and/or crystalline symmetries. In such cases, unlike in p+{\mathrm{i}}p superconductors, the number of edge states is generally greater than one, which can potentially lead to more complex optical responses. For example, it is known that the lowest-energy optical excitation can occur in multiband superconducting systems. Since quantum spin Hall insulators do not exhibit optical excitations between edge states at the same momentum [37], the presence of such low-energy optical excitations in bulk-gapped superconductors may serve as a signature of Majorana edge modes. Even if such optical excitations do not occur, considering the success of spatially-resolved optical conductivity in p+{\mathrm{i}}p superconductors [36], it is reasonable to expect that spatially-resolved optical conductivity could also serve as a signature of Majorana edge modes in the presence of time-reversal and crystalline symmetries. However, the optical response of Majorana edge modes in superconducting systems with time-reversal and crystalline symmetries has not been fully investigated. To address this issue, in this work we study optical responses in various topological superconductors with time-reversal and crystalline symmetries [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. By combining symmetry analysis, numerical simulations, and analytical calculations, we compare the behavior of optical and spatially-resolved optical conductivities in systems with Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes. Our strategy is as follows. First, we diagnose whether or not low-energy optical excitations between edge modes with the same momentum can occur based on symmetry. If such optical excitations are allowed, the behavior is distinct from that in the two-dimensional {\mathbb{Z}}_{2} topological insulator [44, 45, 46, 47], as mentioned above. If such optical excitations are absent, we then examine the behavior of the spatially-resolved optical conductivity. We reveal that the spatially-resolved optical conductivity for topological superconductors generally depends on the energy of the incident photons in the low-energy regime, while that for \mathbb{Z}_{2} topological insulators does not depend. This finding suggests that optical conductivity and spatially-resolved optical conductivity could serve as valuable tools for the experimental observation of Majorana edge modes in a broader range of topological superconductors. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce our framework utilized throughout this paper. In Sec. III, we present the calculation results for the optical conductivity and spatially-resolved optical conductivity for the two dimensional {\mathbb{Z}}_{2} topological insulator, strong topological superconductor, and topological crystalline superconductor.

Both spherical droplets fully immersed in a second fluid and sessile droplets which are also in contact with a solid surface are studied. Our model combines a Cahn-Hillard formulation with incompressible fluctuating hydrodynamics; for sessile droplets the fluid-solid contact angle is specified as a boundary condition. Deterministic simulations with an applied body force are used to measure the droplets’ mobility from which a diffusion coefficient is obtained using the Einstein relation. Stochastic simulations are independently used to obtain a diffusion coefficient from a linear fit of the variance of a droplet’s position with time. In some scenarios these two measurements give the same value but not in the case of a spherical droplet initialized near a slip wall or in the case of sessile droplets with large contact angles (\geq 90^{\circ}) on both slip and no-slip surfaces.,"The study of microscopic fluid droplets has received considerable attentionBonn et al. (2009); Lohse and Zhang (2015); Qian, Arends, and Zhang (2019) due to its importance in applications such as additive manufacturingSun et al. (2023), heat transferPerumanath et al. (2020); Bureš and Sato (2022), biosensorsZhu and Fang (2013); Qiao et al. (2014) and, hydrogen storageOh, Han, and Kim (2015). Additionally, the interaction between nano-droplets and solid surfaces has been a subject of interest, with phenomena like wetting, spreading, and adhesion exhibiting unique features at near-molecular scales. Most of these studies have considered either the dynamics of spherical droplets floating in a medium or static sessile droplets on surfaces. There have been a number of nanoscale fluid simulations of surface wettingde Ruijter, Blake, and De Coninck (1999); Bertrand, Blake, and Coninck (2009) yet the Brownian motion of surface droplets has been investigated in only a few molecular dynamicsLi, Huang, and Li (2016); Niu, Huang, and Chen (2018); Zhao et al. (2022a) and Multiparticle Dissipative Particle DynamicChang, Sheng, and Tsao (2016); Chang et al. (2016) studies. In this paper we use a multiphase fluctuating hydrodynamic (FHD) modelChaudhri et al. (2014); Klymko et al. (2020); Gallo (2022); Zhao, Sprittles, and Lockerby (2019) to simulate fluid droplets in a fluid medium both on and near solid surfaces. The theoretical foundation of our model is the stochastic extension of the Navier-Stokes equations introduced by Landau and LifshitzLandau and Lifshitz (1959); de Zarate and Sengers (2007). In this regard it is similar to stochastic lubrication theory, which has been successful in describing capillary wave fluctuations and instabilitiesMecke (2001); Grün, Mecke, and Rauscher (2006); Zhang, Sprittles, and Lockerby (2021); Zhao et al. (2022b); Liu et al. (2023), however, our FHD formulation does not assume a thin film covering the entire surface. Our fluctuating multiphase formulation is based on the Cahn-Hillard modelCahn and Hilliard (1958); Anderson, McFadden, and Wheeler (1998) that describes a phase separated, binary liquid mixture. The deterministic form of this model is commonly applied to the study of droplet dynamics (e.g., surface impactKhatavkar et al. (2007)) and deterministic Cahn-Hillard Navier-Stokes calculations of droplet coalescence are found to be in excellent agreement with molecular dynamics simulations over the entire coalescence process, including the decay of the inertia-induced oscillation of the merged droplet Heinen et al. (2022). Our model uses a fluid-solid boundary condition derived from a surface free energy that specifies contact angle.Jacqmin (2000); Dong (2012) As originally shown by Seppecher Seppecher (1996); Sibley et al. (2013), in the diffuse interface model sessile droplets are not pinned because there is no dynamical singularity near the contact line, in contrast to a sharp interface model that has a singularity where the interface intersects the boundary.Huh and Scriven (1971); Bonn et al. (2009); Snoeijer and Andreotti (2013) The next section outlines the model, followed by a description of the algorithm and its validation. Numerical results for the mobility and diffusion coefficient of spherical and sessile droplets are then presented for a variety of scenarios. We report the conditions for which the diffusion coefficient obtained from Einstein relation using the measured mobility matches the value from the Brownian motion of the droplets as measured in the simulations as well as conditions in which they differ. We conclude with a summary of the current work and potential future studies."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09744v1,Measuring Hall voltage and Hall resistance in an atom-based quantum simulator,"The Hall effect [1, 2, 3, 4] has a paramount role in a wide range of disciplines, from applied sciences [5, 6] to the fundamental exploration of novel topological phases of matter [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In the solid state, this effect describes the emergence of a voltage drop perpendicular to the current flow in the presence of a magnetic field, leading to a transverse Hall resistance. Despite its fundamental nature, a full understanding and control of the Hall effect in interacting quantum systems is still lacking. This has led to the development of quantum simulators based on neutral atoms [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], where strongly correlated and universal manifestations of the Hall effect were recently unveiled [21, 22]. However, a direct measurement of the Hall voltage and of the Hall resistance in those systems was not achieved so far. Here, we demonstrate a technique for the measurement of the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator. From that we provide the first direct measurement of the Hall resistance in a non-electron-based system and study its dependence on the carrier density, along with theoretical analyses. Our work closes a major gap between analog quantum simulations and measurements performed in real solid-state systems, providing a key tool for the exploration of the Hall effect in highly tunable and strongly correlated systems.","References Ashcroft and Mermin [1976] N.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09741v1,2D Theoretically Twistable Material Database,"The study of twisted two-dimensional (2D) materials, where twisting layers create moiré superlattices, has opened new opportunities for investigating topological phases and strongly correlated physics. While systems such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been extensively studied, the broader potential of a seemingly infinite set of other twistable 2D materials remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we define “theoretically twistable materials” as single- or multi-layer structures that allow for the construction of simple continuum models of their moiré structures. This excludes, for example, materials with a “spaghetti” of bands or those with numerous crossing points at the Fermi level, for which theoretical moiré modeling is unfeasible. We present a high-throughput algorithm that systematically searches for theoretically twistable semimetals and insulators based on the Topological 2D Materials Database (2D-TQCDB). By analyzing key electronic properties, we identify thousands of new candidate materials that could host rich topological and strongly correlated phenomena when twisted. We propose representative twistable materials for realizing different types of moiré systems, including materials with different Bravais lattices, valleys, and strength of spin-orbital coupling. We provide examples of crystal growth for several of these materials and showcase twisted bilayer band structures along with simplified twisted continuum models. Our results significantly broaden the scope of moiré heterostructures and provide a valuable resource for future experimental and theoretical studies on novel moiré systems.","The discovery and study of two-dimensional (2D) materials have revolutionized condensed matter physics, opening new avenues for exploring quantum phenomena in reduced dimensions. One of the most exciting developments in the field is the concept of twistronics [1, 2, 3, 4], where a small twist between layers of 2D materials leads to the formation of moiré superlattices, fundamentally altering the electronic structure and interaction landscape, giving rise to novel phenomena. Twisting introduces periodic modulations and creates a moiré pattern that can drastically affect the low-energy electronic properties. The resulting moiré bands can become extremely flat due to the enlarged moiré unit cell, quenching the kinetic energy of electrons and thus enhancing the role of electron-electron interactions. These interactions can drive a wide range of topological and correlated phases, such as correlated insulating states [5], unconventional superconductivity [6], and fractional Chern insulators [7, 8, 9]. The prototypical example is twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) [10], where a “magic angle” twist between two graphene layers leads to the emergence of flat bands [6, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Beyond graphene, twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as twisted \chMoTe2 and \chWSe2, have also been shown to exhibit many different types of strongly correlated phases [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]. Despite the intense focus on TBG and TMD systems, many other potential moiré systems remain unexplored. Given the vast number of 2D materials with different crystal symmetries and electronic structures, there is a much larger space of twistable materials that could host rich correlated and topological physics [55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62]. The systematic exploration of this space is crucial to identifying new systems with novel properties that go beyond what has been observed in TBG and TMD moiré superlattices. However, a systematic approach is hindered by the lack of theoretical predictions. Many single-, double-, and multilayer systems exhibit highly complex band structures, lacking simple effective models such as the Dirac cone in graphene or the quadratic band edge in TMD materials. Twisting an already complicated band structure leads to moiré bands that are theoretically intractable, making it difficult to predict the so-called “magic” angles [10]. In the case of TBG, the prediction of the magic angle was crucial in realizing superconductivity (SC) in the system. Therefore, we define “theoretically twistable” materials as 2D exfoliable materials with “clean” band structures. For metals, this means point or line Fermi surfaces that can be modeled theoretically. For insulators, we require clean band minima or maxima. We also impose experimentally relevant conditions, such as a gap smaller than 3\text{\,}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}, as larger gaps would make forming good contacts difficult. Additional conditions, as described in the main text, are also applied. Figure 1: Moiré \mathbf{Q} lattices derived from different Bravais lattices and valleys. (A) shows the \mathbf{Q} lattices corresponding to the \Gamma and K valley in the hexagonal lattice. The K valley generates two sets of \mathbf{Q} lattices from the two time-reversal symmetry (TRS)-related K points, K_{1} and K_{2}, forming a honeycomb lattice in momentum space. (B) depicts the \mathbf{Q} lattice from the M valley in the hexagonal lattice, which results in a kagome lattice in momentum space, with three sublattices corresponding to the three C_{3}-symmetry-related M valleys. (C) presents the \Gamma and M valleys from the square lattice, both forming a square lattice in momentum space. (D) illustrates the \mathbf{Q} lattice generated by the X valley from the square lattice, forming two nested square lattices in momentum space given by the two C_{4}-related valleys X_{1} and X_{2}. (E) shows the \mathbf{Q} lattices for the \Gamma and Y valleys from the rectangular lattice. With these conditions, we develop a high-throughput algorithm to screen the Topological 2D Materials Database (2D-TQCDB) [63] for twistable materials. Our algorithm identifies candidates based on their electronic structures, focusing on semimetals and insulators that exhibit clean band structures suitable for theoretically predictable moiré engineering. By applying the algorithm, we have identified 61 clean twistable semimetals and 1568 twistable insulators, which we further classify into large classes based on their Bravais lattices, valley types, and spin-orbital coupling (SOC) splitting strength. We select representative materials for each universality class and present example twisted bilayer band structures alongside simplified moiré continuum models. We also offer experimental insights into the feasibility of realizing twistable materials, all these simple layers either exist or are predicted to exist. Complete data on the twisting properties of these materials are available on the 2D-TQCDB. This work not only provides a complete database of potential twistable materials but also broadens the scope of twistronics, paving the way for future experimental and theoretical investigations into novel 2D moiré systems."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09526v1,Binding energy of polaronic trions and biexcitons in CsPbBr nanocrystals,"The effect of polaron formation on the ground state of excitons, trions and biexcitons confined in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals is studied in the framework of effective mass Hamiltonians, using a Haken-like (Bajaj) potential for carrier-phonon coupling. The binding energy of trions agrees well with that observed in experiments, with position-dependent dielectric screening playing a significant role. For biexcitons, however, neither polaronic effects, nor dielectric confinement, nor electronic correlations –here accounted for with a variational Quantum Monte Carlo method– suffice to explain the large binding energies reported by single nanocrystal spectroscopy experiments. This result reinforces the hypothesis that biexcitons polarize the perovskite lattice differently from excitons and trions.","CsPbX3 (X=Cl,Br,I) nanocrystals (NCs) combine the outstanding optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites with the tunability of quantum and dielectric confinement.Akkerman et al. (2018a, b); Butkus et al. (2017); Caicedo-Dávila et al. (2023) Understanding the interactions among particles confined inside such systems is a prerequisite for eventual applications. In the last years, a large number of experimental studies have gone beyond exciton (X) complexes to address trions (X∗) and biexcitons (BX).Tamarat et al. (2023); Fu et al. (2017); Becker et al. (2018); Wang et al. (2015); Makarov et al. (2016); Castañeda et al. (2016); Aneesh et al. (2017); Yumoto et al. (2018); Ashner et al. (2019); Huang et al. (2020); Shen et al. (2021); Dana et al. (2021); Poonia et al. (2021); Lubin et al. (2021); Amara et al. (2023); Zhu et al. (2023); Cho et al. (2024); Kazes et al. (2024) The interest of X∗ is largely related to the fact that they combine the optical response of X with the high sensitivity to external electric fields of charged species, which is convenient for field-modulated devices.Ziegler et al. (2023) BX in turn are involved in several potential applications, including lasers, LEDs and quantum light sources.Wang et al. (2015); Zhu et al. (2023) Prospects of BX exploitation in CsPbX3 NCs are backed up by near-unity quantum yields, which result from the fast radiative rates outcompeting Auger processes.Utzat et al. (2019) The binding energy of X∗ and BX is a key figure quantifying the spectral shift of these species with respect to X, as well as the strength of the charge-X (for X∗) and X-X (for BX) interactions. Different experiments have provided very different estimates, especially in the case of BX, depending on the methodology, temperature and size inhomogeinity of the NCs.Lubin et al. (2021) In view of this, the most reliable measurements are arguably those provided by single NC emission spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures. For CsPbBr3 NCs with lateral sizes between 5 and 20 nm, these measurements reveal trion binding energies (\Delta_{X^{*}}) in the range of 7-25 meV, and biexciton binding energies (\Delta_{BX}) in the range of 25-40 meV.Tamarat et al. (2023); Fu et al. (2017); Becker et al. (2018); Zhu et al. (2023); Cho et al. (2024); Amara et al. (2023) Attempts to rationalize these values have been made using different theoretical models, with different descriptions of the dielectric screening and carrier-carrier interactions. In all cases, trion binding energies were in fair agreement with experiments, but biexciton ones were substantially and systematically lower.Zhu et al. (2023); Cho et al. (2024); Nguyen et al. (2020) This puzzling result prompted some authors to postulate that, in inorganic lead halide NCs, BX feel a lower effective dielectric constant than X.Zhu et al. (2023) The same hypothesis was adopted in later studies, for simulations to reproduce spectroscopic data.Cho et al. (2024) In this paper, we aim at providing more solid understanding on the origin of the unusually large \Delta_{BX} values. To that end, we carry out a theoretical description of X, X∗ and BX in cuboidal CsPbBr3 NCs. As in previous works, we rely on effective mass models to account for the influence of quantum confinementZhu et al. (2023); Cho et al. (2024); Nguyen et al. (2020), and on image charges to account for dielectric confinement.Cho et al. (2024) Two relevant refinements are however introduced in the model. The first one refers to electronic correlations. Because CsPbBr3 NCs are in the intermediate to weak confinement regime, carrier-carrier correlations are known to play a major role.Blundell and Guet (2022) Here we go beyond second-order perturbationNguyen et al. (2020) and configuration interaction methods,Zhu et al. (2023); Cho et al. (2024) as they have proved insufficient in other weakly confined nanostructures.Planelles (2017) Rather, we implement a variational Quantum Monte Carlo approximation.Planelles and Climente (2021); Macias-Pinilla et al. (2022) The second refinement refers to polaronic effects. Lead halide perovskites are known to have a soft lattice, such that carrier-lattice coupling becomes a significant physical factor in shaping the electronic structure. In bulk, carriers couple to optical phonons forming polarons,Puppin et al. (2020); Dai et al. (2024) which lead to a non-hydrogenic exciton spectrum.Menéndez-Proupin et al. (2015); Baranowski and Plochocka (2020); Baranowski et al. (2024) Polaron signatures are also expected in NCs, but lacking dedicated theoretical simulations, their effect is not clear yet. Based on different experimental results, some authors have suggested polarons may be responsible for large and attractive \Delta_{BX},Dana et al. (2021) large and repulsive \Delta_{BX},Poonia et al. (2021) and even break the crystal symmetry.Rossi et al. (2018) To shed light on this matter, here we include polaronic effects by means of a Haken-like potential, which takes into account the different dielectric screening at short and long distances from carriers.Menéndez-Proupin et al. (2015); Baranowski and Plochocka (2020) This approximation has proved successful in reproducing the excitonic features of bulk lead halide perovskites.Baranowski et al. (2024) Similar polaronic potentials have proved successfull in reproducing the binding energy of X, X∗ and BX in layered halide perovskites and nanoplatelets.Movilla et al. (2023); Climente et al. (2024a, b) Our calculations show that polaronic effects have a sizable influence on charge-X and X-X interactions. \Delta_{X^{*}} values in close agreement with spectroscopic data are obtained, with no need for an effective dielectric constant inside the NC. Nonetheless, \Delta_{BX} remain lower than those observed in experiments. Agreement is only reached if one assumes that X and BX polarize the lattice differently, for example by imposing greater polaron radius for BX."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09377v1,Chiral Light-Matter Interactions with Thermal Magnetoplasmons in Graphene Nanodisks,"We investigate the emergence of self-hybridized thermal magnetoplasmons in doped graphene nanodisks at finite temperatures when subjected to an external magnetic field. Using a semi-analytical approach, which fully describes the eigenmodes and polarizability of the graphene nanodisks, we show that the hybridization originates from the coupling of transitions between thermally populated Landau levels and localized magnetoplasmon resonances of the nanodisks. Owing to their origin, these modes combine the extraordinary magneto-optical response of graphene with the strong field enhancement of plasmons, making them an ideal tool for achieving strong chiral light-matter interactions, with the additional advantage of being tunable through carrier concentration, magnetic field, and temperature. As an illustration of their capabilities, we demonstrate that the thermal magnetoplasmons supported by an array of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption and chiral thermal emission.","A photonic structure is considered chiral if it cannot be superimposed onto its mirror image through translations or rotations [1]. Chiral photonic structures respond differently to the left- (LCP) and right-handed (RCP) circularly polarized components of the electromagnetic field, resulting in a phenomenon known as circular dichroism [2, 3]. This ability makes them ideal tools for the detection, identification, and manipulation of chiral molecules [4, 5, 6, 7], which is a problem of paramount importance in biotechnology [8]. Chiral photonic structures can also be employed to control and modify the polarization state of light [9, 3, 10] and to generate circularly polarized thermal radiation [11, 12, 13, 14]. These prospects have driven an intense research effort into developing different chiral photonic elements, including, among others, emitters [15, 16, 17], cavities [18, 19], absorbers [20, 21], metasurfaces [22, 23], and collective modes in periodic arrays [24, 25, 26]. Another approach to achieving circular dichroism involves the use of materials with a strong magneto-optical response. Among these, graphene—a single layer of carbon atoms—stands out as one of the most promising platforms due to its unique electronic properties [27, 28]. In the presence of an external static magnetic field directed normally to a graphene sheet, the optical conductivity of this material exhibits off-diagonal Hall components that result in an extraordinary magneto-optical response, as exemplified by reports of giant Faraday rotation [29, 30, 31]. Meanwhile, when doped with charge carriers, graphene nanostructures are able to support localized surface plamons [32]. These excitations, whose strength and frequency are determined by the level of doping, can boost light-matter interaction due to the extraordinary near-field enhancement and cross sections that they provide at terahertz and infrared frequencies [33, 34, 35, 36]. A notable example is the possibility of achieving perfect absorption using an array of graphene nanostructures arranged in a Salisbury screen configuration—a concept initially predicted theoretically [37] and later confirmed experimentally [38]. Due to the combined effects of charge carrier doping and applied static magnetic field, graphene nanostructures support magnetoplasmons that enable strong chiral light-matter interactions [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44]. In principle, the characteristics of these excitations are largely determined by the doping level and the strength of the static magnetic field [40, 45]. However, the linear band structure and two-dimensional (2D) nature of this material, which are at the origin of its high optoelectronic tunability, together with its low electronic heat capacity, facilitates substantial temperature-induced changes in the optical response of graphene nanostructures [46, 47, 48]. This characteristic presents new opportunities for controlling and manipulating graphene magnetoplasmons but demands exploring how the interplay of a static magnetic field, carrier doping, and temperature influences their behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate new strategies to thermally control chiral light absorption and emission using graphene magnetoplasmons. We demonstrate that, at finite temperature and in the presence of a perpendicular static magnetic field, the magnetoplasmons supported by graphene nanodisks undergo strong hybridization with transitions between thermally populated Landau levels that become more prominent at elevated electron temperatures, leading to the formation of hybrid thermal magnetoplasmons (TMPs). Our investigation is based on a semi-analytical formalism that describes the eigenmodes and the polarizability of magneto-optical 2D nanodisks, which we introduce here to fully characterize the properties of TMPs in isolated nanodisks. By combining this formalism with a coupled dipole model and transfer matrix calculations, we demonstrate that the TMPs supported by arrays of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption (i.e., perfect absorption for only one light handedness) when paired with a gold mirror in a Salisbury screen configuration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same system generates fully circularly polarized thermal radiation of a single handedness. These findings extend the known capability of graphene plasmons to mediate thermal emission [49, 50] and pave the way for developing novel nonreciprocal thermal emitters [51, 52, 53] capable of advancing solar energy harvesting technologies [54]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09376v1,Trions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides,"The reduced dielectric screening in atomically thin semiconductors leads to remarkably strong electron interactions. As a result, bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and charged excitons (trions), which have binding energies in the hundreds and tens of meV, respectively, typically dominate the optical properties of these materials. However, the long-range nature of the interactions between charges represents a significant challenge to the exact calculation of binding energies of complexes larger than the exciton. Here, we demonstrate that the trion binding energy can be efficiently calculated directly from the three-body Schrödinger equation in momentum space. Key to this result is a highly accurate way of treating the pole of the electronic interactions at small momentum exchange (i.e., large separation between charges). Our results are in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, while yielding a substantially larger ratio of the trion to exciton binding energies than obtained in recent variational calculations. Our numerical approach may be extended to a host of different few-body problems in 2D semiconductors, and even potentially to the description of exciton polarons.","Two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained significant attention due to their unique electronic, optical, and mechanical properties, and their potential for applications in next-generation technologies such as nanoelectronics, photonics, sensing, energy storage, and optoelectronics Britnell et al. (2013); Schaibley et al. (2016). Many of these properties can be attributed to the presence of strongly bound few-body complexes, such as excitons (electron-hole bound states) and trions (bound states of an exciton with an electron or a hole), which arise from the reduced screening of the Coulomb interaction due to quantum confinement and the relatively heavy carrier masses in these materials Velický and Toth (2017). In monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), exciton binding energies have been found to be several hundred meV He et al. (2014); Chernikov et al. (2014), while trion binding energies have been reported to reach values up to 20 to 40 meV Mak et al. (2013); Arora et al. (2019); Zhu et al. (2015); Yang et al. (2015a); Ross et al. (2013); Wang et al. (2014); Plechinger et al. (2015); Singh et al. (2016) (see Refs. Wang et al. (2018); Durnev and Glazov (2018) for recent reviews). These values are substantially larger than in traditional quantum wells, such as GaAs Finkelstein et al. (1996); Bracker et al. (2005); Bar-Joseph (2005) and CdTe Kheng et al. (1993); Huard et al. (2000); Portella-Oberli et al. (2004); Moody et al. (2014), where the trion binding energy is of the order of 0.5-3 meV, and ZnSe, where it can reach 10 meV Astakhov et al. (2002). Larger binding energies are desirable as they prevent thermal dissociation, thus increasing their stability at room temperature, which is important for practical applications Mueller and Malic (2018); Emmanuele et al. (2020). From a theoretical perspective, calculations of the trion bound state are challenging due to the singular nature of the electronic interaction, both at long and short distances. For the case of unscreened Coulomb interactions in three dimensions, a precise treatment of the long-range divergence in momentum space was proposed by A. Landé and realized by Kwon and Tabakin in their work on hadronic atoms Kwon and Tabakin (1978). The key idea is to subtract and add an appropriately chosen factor to the interaction potential in order to produce a well-behaved effective potential in the numerical solution. This method has been tried and tested in the treatment of the Coulomb two-body problem both in the context of nuclear physics Landau (1983); Norbury et al. (1994); Ivanov and Mitroy (2001) and 2D semiconductors Laird et al. (2022), and is numerically inexpensive and accurate. The technique can also be applied to the Rytova-Keldysh potential de la Fuente Pico et al. (2024), which accounts for the spatially inhomogeneous dielectric screening of Coulomb interactions in a monolayer TMD Rytova (1967); Keldysh (1979); Cudazzo et al. (2011). In this paper, we apply the Landé subtraction technique to the calculation of trion binding energies in two-dimensional semiconductors, focusing on parameters relevant to monolayer TMDs as well as traditional quantum wells. We supplement the subtraction scheme with a simple iterative Lanczos-type method Stadler et al. (1991); Demmel (1997); Hadizadeh and Bayegan (2007); Hadizadeh et al. (2012), which allows us to calculate the trion energy directly from the momentum-space Schrödinger equation. For the case of equal electron and hole masses and uniform dielectric screening—which, due to its high symmetry, is the most investigated scenario—we find the trion binding energy to be 0.122\varepsilon_{X} (with \varepsilon_{X} the exciton binding energy). This indicates a stronger binding than that obtained with variational wave functions which predict trion binding energies \sim 0.11\varepsilon_{X} Sergeev and Suris (2001a); Courtade et al. (2017), and agrees well with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations which predict \sim 0.12\varepsilon_{X} Szyniszewski et al. (2017). More generally, we calculate the trion binding energy in monolayer TMDs as a function of the dielectric screening length Rytova (1967); Keldysh (1979), again finding excellent agreement with QMC calculations Szyniszewski et al. (2017) while obtaining a larger trion binding energy than in variational calculations Courtade et al. (2017). We also find very good agreement with the exact diagonalization calculations of Ref. Fey et al. (2020) for the select TMD parameters chosen in that work. Due to their general nature, our numerical methods can be applied to a host of other few- and many-body problems in 2D semiconductors. The paper is organized as follows. The model is introduced in Sec. II and we demonstrate the Landé subtraction technique in Sec. III in the context of the exciton problem. We introduce the trion Schrödinger equation in Sec. IV, where we also apply the Landé subtraction technique and solve for the trion binding energies using a Lanczos-type algorithm. We conclude and give a brief outlook in Sec. V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09161v1,Nonlinear Hall Effect in KTaO Two-Dimensional Electron Gases,"The observation of a Hall effect, a finite transverse voltage induced by a longitudinal current, usually requires the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, for example through the application of an external magnetic field or the presence of long range magnetic order in a sample. Recently it was suggested that under certain symmetry conditions, the presence of finite Berry curvatures in the band structure of a system with time-reversal symmetry but without inversion symmetry can give rise to a nonlinear Hall effect in the presence of a probe current. In order to observe the nonlinear Hall effect, one requires a finite component of a so-called Berry dipole along the direction of the probe current. We report here measurements of the nonlinear Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases fabricated on the surface of KTaO3 with different surface crystal orientations as a function of the probe current, a transverse electric field and back gate voltage. For all three crystal orientations, the transverse electric field modifies the nonlinear Hall effect. We discuss our results in the context of the current understanding of the nonlinear Hall effect as well as potential experimental artifacts that may give rise to the same effects.","The Hall effect is one of the best-known phenomena in condensed matter physics, having been discovered by Edwin Hall more than 140 years ago. It manifests itself in simple conductors as a transverse voltage in response to a driving current and a perpendicular magnetic field. It can also be observed in magnetic materials in the absence of an external magnetic field, the so-called anomalous Hall effect [1]. Since its discovery, the Hall effect has been studied intensely both experimentally and theoretically in a variety of materials [2], with quantized versions of both the ordinary Hall effect[3] and the anomalous Hall effect [4] now well established. A unified picture of these various Hall effects can now be understood based on the underlying topology of the band structure of a material in the presence of external fields and currents [5]. In this picture, the nature of the Berry curvature \bm{\Omega}_{n}=\nabla\times\bm{A}_{n} of the bands is particularly important. Here \bm{A}_{n}(\bm{k})=i<u_{n\bm{k}}|\nabla_{\bm{k}}|u_{n\bm{k}}> is the so-called Berry connection [6], with u_{n\bm{k}} being the Bloch wavefunction of the band with index n and crystal momentum \bm{k}. The Hall response is related to the integral of the Berry curvature \bm{\Omega}(\bm{k}) over the entire Brillouin zone. In a system with time reversal symmetry, one can show that the Berry curvature is an odd function of \bm{k}, \bm{\Omega}(\bm{k})=-\bm{\Omega}(-\bm{k}), while in a system with space inversion symmetry, the Berry curvature is an even function of \bm{k}, \bm{\Omega}(\bm{k})=\bm{\Omega}(-\bm{k}).[6] Consequently, in a system with both time reversal and space inversion symmetry, \bm{\Omega}(\bm{k}) identically vanishes over the entire Brillouin zone, and there is no Hall response. In a system with time reversal symmetry, but broken space inversion symmetry, the Berry curvature is odd in \bm{k} so that its integral over the Brillouin zone again vanishes and there is no resulting Hall voltage. Thus, broken time-reversal symmetry appears to required be to observe a finite Hall voltage. The situation is different if there is an electric field \bm{E} applied to the sample, as might be generated by a measurement current. In this case one obtains a Hall response that is quadratic in E, i.e., a nonlinear Hall effect.[7] The velocity of an electron in a band with index n is given by[8] v_{n}(\bm{k})=\frac{1}{\hbar}\nabla_{\bm{k}}\mathcal{E}_{n}-\frac{d\bm{k}}{dt}% \times\bm{\Omega}_{n}(\bm{k}) (1) where the first term is the usual Bloch velocity of a band electron, and the second term is the anomalous velocity due to the Berry curvature. In a 2D crystal, \bm{\Omega} points out of the 2D plane, so that the anomalous velocity is in the plane of the crystal in a direction perpendicular to d\bm{k}/dt. In the presence of an electric field \bm{E}, the time evolution of \bm{k} is given by d\bm{k}/dt=-e\bm{E} in the semiclassical approximation. The current arising from the anomalous velocity is given by [9] \bm{j}=\frac{e^{2}}{\hbar}\int\frac{d^{2}k}{4\pi^{2}}\bigl{(}\bm{E}\times\bm{% \Omega}(\bm{k})\bigr{)}g(\bm{k}) (2) where g(\bm{k})=f(\bm{k})-f_{0}(\bm{k}) is the deviation of the electron distribution function f(\bm{k}) from its equilibrium value f_{0}(\bm{k}) due to perturbations from the driving field, \bm{E}. To first order in the low frequency limit, g(\bm{k}) is given by [10] g(\bm{k})=\left(-\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial\mathcal{E}}\right)\tau v_{\bm{% k}}\cdot e\bm{E} (3) where \tau is the scattering time and v_{\bm{k}} is the first term in Eqn. (1). The derivative of the electron distribution function ensures that the primary contribution to the current in Eqn. (2) comes from the Fermi surface. We have also dropped the band index in the equations above, simplifying to the case where only one band is important. One can see immediately that the current arising from the anomalous velocity is perpendicular (transverse) to \bm{E}, and that it is quadratic in \bm{E}, as noted earlier. Recalling that v_{\bm{k}}=(1/\hbar)\nabla_{\bm{k}}\mathcal{E}, we can rewrite -(\partial f_{0}/\partial\mathcal{E})v_{\bm{k}} as -(1/\hbar)\nabla_{\bm{k}}f_{0}. Taking all the k independent terms of Eqn. (2) out from under the integral, and writing it in scalar form, we obtain an expression for the transverse current in response to the electric field E \bm{j}=\frac{e^{3}\tau}{\hbar^{2}}E^{2}\int\frac{d^{2}k}{4\pi^{2}}(\nabla_{\bm% {k}}f_{0})\Omega_{k}. (4) Integrating by parts, one obtains \bm{j}=\frac{e^{3}\tau}{\hbar^{2}}E^{2}\int\frac{d^{2}k}{4\pi^{2}}f_{0}(\nabla% _{\bm{k}}\Omega_{k}) (5) assuming that \Omega_{k} is odd in k. Sodemann and Fu [7] identify the integral in Eq. 5 as the dipole moment of the Berry curvature, or Berry dipole. The resulting current is proportional to the Berry dipole, and responds to experimental handles that modify the stength of the dipole. Sodemann and Fu also note that the symmetry considerations for such a Berry dipole to exist (and hence for a nonlinear Hall effect to be observable) in a two-dimensional (2D) crystal are rather stringent: the crystal must have only a single mirror line, hosting the dipole perpendicular to that line [7]. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a putative Berry curvature in two different 2D crystals. The first one shown in Fig. 1(a) represents a crystal that has a single mirror line with a finite Berry curvature and a Berry dipole aligned along the k_{y} axis. The schematic of Fig. 1(b) represents a crystal with a three-fold rotation symmetry and three mirror lines, similar to the (111) KTO surface. Taking the integral over the full Brillouin zone as described in Eq. 5 yields no net Berry dipole in any direction. Thus the crystal of Fig. 1(a) will show a nonlinear Hall effect if an external electric field \bm{E} is applied in the direction shown, while the crystal of Fig. 1(b) will not. Figure 1: Schematic of a Berry curvature in a 2D crystal. Red denotes a positive Berry curvature, while blue denotes a negative Berry curvature. (a) A crystal with C_{2} symmetry with a single mirror line along k_{y}, with the electric field \bm{E} applied along k_{y}. (b) A crystal with C_{6} symmetry with three mirror lines, shown as the dotted lines (one is along the k_{y} axis). Modification of the Berry curvature of (a) with an additional electric field \bm{E}_{T} applied along the k_{x} direction, perpendicular to \bm{E}. (d) Similar modification of the Berry curvature of (b) with \bm{E}_{T}. The application of \bm{E}_{T} destroys the mirror symmetries. The application of an additional electrical field \bm{E}_{T} will modify an existing Berry dipole, as shown in Fig. 1(c). In a system where there is no net Berry dipole due to the existence of multiple mirror symmetry lines, the application of \bm{E}_{T} along one of these mirror symmetry lines can result in a net Berry dipole by effectively removing the remaining mirror symmetries, as shown schematically in Fig. 1(d) for the crystal of Fig. 1(b). Consequently, one expects to observe a nonlinear Hall effect in such a system that depends on the magnitude of the transverse electric field \bm{E}_{T}. Such a field dependent nonlinear Hall effect has recently been reported in WTe2 [11]. For devices in which a nonlinear Hall effect is observed in the absence of \bm{E}_{T}, the application of a transverse field might be expected to modify the magnitude of the observed effect, as shown schematically in Fig. 1(c). Note that even if \bm{E} and \bm{E}_{T} are not along the crystal axes of the crystal, one would still expect to observe a nonlinear Hall effect, although its dependence on \bm{E}_{T} might be more complicated. The quadratic dependence of the transverse current on the driving electric field enables an elegant way to isolate the nonlinear Hall effect, as emphasized by Sodemann and Fu [7]. If an ac measuring current I_{\omega} is used at a (low) frequency \omega, then the resulting nonlinear Hall voltage V_{T} will have components at dc and 2\omega. As thermoelectric and other effects may also result in dc contributions that are difficult to isolate, it is easier to focus on the 2\omega component of the Hall voltage, V^{2\omega}, which should have a quadratic dependence on the measuring current, V^{2\omega}\propto I_{\omega}^{2} for low values of I_{\omega}. However, it is important to note that there are other contributions that may result in a 2\omega signal that is quadratic in I_{\omega}. In particular, if the response V_{T}(I) is nonlinear in I, then a standard ac lock-in measurement will result in a 2\omega signal that is quadratic in I_{\omega}. Many materials that are not necessarily topological might have nonlinear current-voltage characteristics. Indeed, as observed by Webb, Washburn and Umbach [12] almost four decades ago, even devices made from conventional metals such as gold have significant response at harmonics of the probe current frequency. Thus it is important to identify characteristics of the second harmonic response that relate the observed signal to Berry curvature effects. We describe below the results of our measurements of the nonlinear Hall effect in KTaO3 (KTO) two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) with three different crystal surface orientations: (001), (110) and (111). We report measurements of both the first harmonic (V^{\omega}) and the second harmonic (V^{2\omega}) longitudinal and transverse voltage responses as a function of the ac drive current I_{\omega}, backgate voltage V_{g} as well as an additional dc current I_{dc} applied between the transverse voltage probes. The (001) and (111) crystal orientations nominally have more than one mirror line, so that according to the discussion above, no nonlinear Hall effect should be observed in the absence of the transverse current. For all three crystal orientations, however, we observe a second harmonic transverse voltage that is modified by I_{dc}. This transverse second harmonic signal is smallest for the (001) oriented sample, larger for the (110) sample and largest for the (111) sample. We discuss our results in terms of the current understanding of the nonlinear Hall effect and potential experimental artifacts."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09103v1,Magnetic response of topological insulator layer with metamaterial substrate induced by an electric point source,"Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with unique surface conductive properties that distinguish them from normal insulators and have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in electronics and spintronics. However, their weak magnetic field response in traditional setups has limited practical applications. Here, we show that integrating TIs with active metamaterial substrates can significantly enhance the induced magnetic field by more than 10^{4} times. Our results demonstrate that selecting specific permittivity and permeability values for the active metamaterial substrate optimizes the magnetic field at the interface between the TI layer and the metamaterial, extending into free space. This represents a substantial improvement over previous methods, where the magnetic field decayed rapidly. The findings reveal that the TI-metamaterial approach enhances the magnetic field response, unveiling new aspects of TI electromagnetic behavior and suggesting novel pathways for developing materials with tailored electromagnetic properties. The integration of metamaterials with TIs offers promising opportunities for advancements in materials science and various technological applications. Overall, our study provides a practical and effective approach to exploring the unique magnetic field responses of TIs, potentially benefiting other complex material systems.","The study of topological insulators (TIs), materials with a unique topological order, represents a significant step forward in developing new electronics. These materials are insulators internally but have conductive surfaces [1, 2, 3, 4]. The ability to have conductive edge states without an external magnetic field, as demonstrated in the quantum spin Hall effect in two-dimensional TIs, highlights their potential for transforming electronic devices. The special properties of TIs have created novel applications that are not possible with conventional insulators. Qi et al. [5] demonstrated that an electric charge near a TI surface induces a magnetic monopole due to the topological magneto-electric effect. Martín-Ruiz et al. [6, 7] used the Green’s function method to study boundary effects and special electromagnetic properties in TIs with Chern-Simons extended electrodynamics. The research by Lai et al. [8] explored the tunability of plasmons in TIs, showing their potential in plasmonics and spintronics. Wang et al. [9] discussed intrinsic magnetic TIs, such as MnBi2Te4, which combine magnetism with topological properties, leading to new quantum phenomena. Meanwhile, synthetic topological insulator structures [10, 11], such as nanowires and nanoribbons, are being explored in field-effect transistors (FETs), optoelectronic devices, memory storage devices and magnetoelectric devices [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. These structures exhibit enhanced surface conduction due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and can improve the performance of devices like photodetectors, spintronic, and quantum computing systems [17, 18, 19] by leveraging their unique surface properties and quantum effects. The novel magnetic field response of TIs is an area of growing interest due to its potential applications in advanced technology. The unique topological electromagnetic properties of TIs are key to understanding their novel magnetic field responses, although these effects are usually small. To enhance their electronic and magnetic properties, the development of layered structures incorporating TIs has been proposed [20]. In 2011, Burkov and Balents [21] proposed Weyl semimetal states in TI multilayers to achieve unusual electronic states. Further studies explored TI-ferromagnet multilayers [22] for efficient spin-orbit torque [23, 24], highlighting practical applications in spintronic devices [25]. In 2020, An et al. [26] demonstrated significant polarization rotation in multilayer TI structures, enhancing optical applications. Additionally, Ardakani and Zare (2021) [27] showed strong Faraday rotation using dielectric multilayers with a single TI layer with improved magnetic field interactions. Most of the work reviewed above focuses on the dynamic effects. In this work, we explore the novel magnetic field response of topological insulators (TIs) when exposed to a static electric point source. This static response, which couples electric and magnetic fields, distinguishes TIs from normal insulators more significantly than their dynamic behavior. However, as demonstrated by Qi et al. [5], the induced magnetic field by a TI is very weak, making it challenging to harness for practical applications. To address this challenge, we explore the magnetic field response of TIs in composite layered structures, particularly with metamaterials. Metamaterials have been a significant area of research since the late 20th century, with their unique properties offering potential for various technological applications. The concept was first theoretically proposed by Victor Veselago in 1968 [28], who suggested that materials could exhibit both negative permittivity and permeability, resulting in a negative refractive index. This idea, though intriguing, remained largely theoretical until the development of practical metamaterials in the early 2000s [29]. In 2000, Smith and Kroll [30] demonstrated negative refraction in left-handed materials, a groundbreaking experimental validation that paved the way for further research and development. Following this, Shelby et al. [31] provided experimental verification of a negative index of refraction using a metamaterial constructed from an array of copper split-ring resonators and wires. Liu et al. [32] introduced dynamic and tunable metamaterials that can be electrically controlled, using vanadium dioxide to achieve multifunctional control. This marked a significant advancement, enabling the modulation of metamaterial properties through external stimuli, thereby enhancing their practical applicability. Most recently, Castles et al. in 2020 [33] explored active metamaterials with static electric susceptibility less than one. This work demonstrated that active metamaterials could manipulate static electric susceptibility, a property that had been theoretically suggested but never experimentally confirmed until then. In this work, we focus on the magnetic response of TIs by integrating them with multi-layer composite structures with metamaterials. By employing the unique electromagnetic properties of TIs and metamaterials, we investigate the magnetic response induced by an electric charge. This study explores a novel approach to enhancing the magnetic field response of TIs, highlighting unique electromagnetic interactions within TIs and opening new avenues for their practical application in advanced technologies."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08996v1,High-yield electrochemical etching of nanometrically defined Fe STM tips,A reproducible procedure for creating STM tips with nanometrically defined apices out of 0.25mm iron wire is presented.,"The quality of data obtained during scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) operation is restricted by the tip’s properties.Binnig et al. (1982); Chen (2021) This implies that even under ideal conditions and with a suitable sample, the experiment will not produce the expected results if the probe does not have the required characteristics for a specific measurement. Most STM measurements require a straight apex structure with a nanometrically defined radius. Electrochemical etching is the most commonly used way to reproducibly create STM probes with sufficiently small apices out of metal wires. A more recent development involves using magnetic tips to study local spin-dependent properties,Wiesendanger et al. (1990); Wulfhekel and Kirschner (1999) Although there has been research on etching bulk iron tips,Haze et al. (2019) we found that the success rate of this procedure was insufficiently predictable. In this work, we focus on a specific high-yield procedure confirmed through detailed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) inspection. Throughout this study, we have identified several important factors that impact the success rate. Figure 1: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for a series of eight iron tips, etched one after another. Three different magnifications are presented for each specimen. Our approach is based on the method widely used for tungsten tip preparation, the lamellae drop-off technique described by Klein & Schwitzgebel.Klein and Schwitzgebel (1997) Following this work, we control the area of the electrochemical etching process by using a small volume of electrolyte suspended as a thin film inside a cathode shaped in the form of a ring. The weight of the wire suspended beneath the electrolyte film creates a gravity-driven stopping mechanism for the reaction, preventing blunting of the apex. Obtaining straight and nanometrically defined tip apices in a reproducible manner out of iron proved challenging and required slowing down the process in its final stage."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08947v1,Resonant second harmonic generation in a two-dimensional electron system,"We consider the nonlinear response of a disordered two-dimensional electronic system, lacking inversion symmetry, to an external alternating electric field. The application of an in-plane static magnetic field induces local contributions to the current density that are quadratic in the electric field and linear in the magnetic field. This current oscillates at twice the frequency of the external irradiation and there are two linearly independent vector combinations that contribute to the current density. This particular mechanism coexists with the topological Berry-dipole contribution to the second harmonic of the current density, which can be generated by quantum confinement. Additional nonlocal terms in the current density are possible in the regime away from the normal incidence. The total current exhibits a nonreciprocal character upon reversal of the magnetic field direction. We evaluate the magnitude of this effect by computing its dependence on the strength of spin-orbit coupling and the disorder scattering rate. Importantly, we show that these local second-harmonic contributions can be resonantly excited when the frequency of the external radiation approaches the energy separation between the spin-orbit split bands.","The continuing interest in nonlinear optical phenomena is driven by advances in optical measurement techniques Fülöp et al. (2010); Basov et al. (2011), as well as by the peculiar physics arising from the topological properties and nonreciprocity of quantum materials, as reviewed in Refs. Morimoto and Nagaosa (2016); Tokura and Nagaosa (2018); Nagaosa and Yanase (2024). In particular, nonlinear effects such as second harmonic generation in normal conductors and third harmonic generation in superconductors have become focal points of theoretical and experimental studies. For instance, in conventional superconductors, the application of terahertz pulses can excite both amplitude and phase modes Katsumi et al. (2023) and induce the inverse Faraday effect – i.e., the emergence of static magnetization caused by circularly polarized light Majedi (2021); Putilov et al. (2023); Mironov et al. (2021) (for a recent discussion, see also Ref. Dzero (2024) and references therein). In the nonlinear optical response, the electron current density \mathbf{j} can be phenomenologically expanded in powers of the driving electric field \mathbf{E}. In a centrosymmetric material, the leading nonlinear contribution starts at the cubic order, \mathbf{E}^{3}, unless the field is inhomogeneous. In such cases, quadratic terms are also possible, but they must include spatial gradients. Examples of allowed terms include \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{E}) and (\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{\nabla})\mathbf{E} Jha (1965). Depending on whether the field is static or alternating, various effects can emerge. From the cubic term, one can obtain phenomena such as static nonlinear conductivity, the Kerr effect, photocurrent, dc-induced second harmonic generation, and third harmonic generation Butcher (1991); Ivchenko (2005). Figure 1: Schematic of the system under consideration: electrons are confined to a quantum well, forming a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. The 2DEG is represented pictorially as a slab. The system is illuminated by light of frequency \omega and subjected to an in-plane static magnetic field \mathbf{H}. The combination of these two stimuli induces a second harmonic of the electrical current density, which flows in a direction defined by the vector product of the out-of-plane spin-orbit axis and the magnetic field. This current scales proportionally with the optical power illuminating the 2DEG. In contrast, in materials whose symmetry group includes a polar axis – common in those lacking inversion symmetry – the electron current density may contain terms that are quadratic in the field, even in a homogeneous field. Consequently, the nonlinear part of the electron current density can be characterized by a rank-three tensor: \mathbf{j}_{\text{a}}=\sigma_{\text{abc}}(\omega_{1},\omega_{2})\mathbf{E}_{% \text{b}}(\omega_{1})\mathbf{E}_{\text{c}}(\omega_{2}), (1) which represents the second-order nonlinear optical conductivity \sigma_{\text{abc}}. These materials exhibit a variety of intriguing physical phenomena, such as the photogalvanic and piezoelectric effects Sturman and Fridkin (1992); Belinicher and Sturman (1980); Belinicher et al. (1982); Sipe and Shkrebtii (2000). Indeed, for \omega_{1}=-\omega_{2}=\omega, the product of the fields can be decomposed into symmetrized terms, \propto\sigma_{\text{abc}}(\mathbf{E}_{\text{b}}\mathbf{E}^{*}_{\text{c}}+% \mathbf{E}^{*}_{\text{b}}\mathbf{E}_{\text{c}}), describing linear photogalvanic effects (LPGE), and antisymmetrized terms, \propto i\varsigma_{\text{ab}}[\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{E}^{*}]_{\text{b}}, describing circular photogalvanic effects (CPGE). The microscopic origin of these effects can be traced to the asymmetry of electronic scattering processes (for a review, see Ref. Sturman (1984) and references therein). For matched frequencies, \omega_{1}=\omega_{2}=\omega the \mathbf{E}^{2} term gives rise to second harmonic generation (SHG). In materials with topologically nontrivial band structures, finite Berry curvature contributes to unique photocurrents Deyo et al. (2009); Moore and Orenstein (2010); de Juan et al. (2017); König et al. (2017), the quantum nonlinear Hall effect Sodemann and Fu (2015); König and Levchenko (2021), and more generally, gyrotropic Hall effects König et al. (2019). Some of these effects have been observed, such as in semiconductor heterostructures Ganichev et al. (2001); Olbrich et al. (2009) and in Weyl semimetals like TaAs Wu et al. (2017); Patankar et al. (2018), which exhibit a giant nonlinear optical response – orders of magnitude higher than that of archetypal electro-optical materials such as GaAs Bergfeld and Daum (2003) and ZnTe Wagner et al. (1998). In this work, we focus on the specific mechanism of second harmonic generation (SHG) in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). To this end, we consider a 2D electron system described by the Rashba model of spin-orbit coupling Rashba (1959); Bychkov and Rashba (1984) and account for electron-impurity scattering, as illustrated in Fig. 1. We demonstrate that the application of an in-plane magnetic field induces an oscillatory current response, which exhibits a resonant structure at frequencies commensurate with the energy separation between the spin-orbit split bands. The direction of the induced nonlinear current is determined by a linear superposition of two vectors one of which points along the direction of external electric field while the other points along the direction given by the cross product of magnetic field and normal to the surface."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09699v1,"Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and
Application to Rare-Earth Magnets","Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective \mathbb{Z}_{2} chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoemission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.","Magnetic topological semimetals with cubic symmetries in the parent state, particularly those found in rare-earth magnets with rock-salt structures Hirschberger et al. (2016); Schrunk et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2023); Kushnirenko et al. (2022, 2023); Wu et al. (2019), have recently gained attention. The cubic space group permits several point group symmetries that can protect topological band crossings Chiu et al. (2016). These include three- and four-fold rotational symmetries which can individually stabilize crossings between pairs of Kramer’s degenerate bands, giving rise to three-dimensional Dirac semimetals (DSMs) Yang and Nagaosa (2014). Therefore, cubic crystals offer a promising platform for realizing cubic-symmetric DSMs. Over the past decade, several cubic-symmetric materials have been proposed as DSM candidates. Notably, ab initio calculations have identified several full Heusler alloys Guo et al. (2017a); Mondal et al. (2019), along with Pd and Pt oxides as potential DSMs Li et al. (2017). More recently, experiments on the cubic material PtBi2 Wu et al. (2019) have revealed existence of Fermi-arc like surface states, leading to the suggestion that it is an DSM. Moreover, cubic-symmetric DSM states have been proposed as parent phases for magnetic Weyl semimetals Duan et al. (2018); Guo et al. (2017b); Huang et al. (2020). Despite the growing body of literature supporting the existence of DSMs in cubic crystals, the extent to which Dirac semimetallic features influence the electronic behavior of cubic crystalline materials remains unclear and has yet to be systematically explored. (a) (b) Figure 1: Universal bulk-characteristics and phase diagram of symmetry-protected Dirac semimetals (DSMs). (a) The minimum number of Dirac points (red dots; DPs) in rotational-symmetry protected DSMs is 2, which lie along the rotation axis (highlighted in blue). (b) In cubic-symmetry protected DSMs the minimum number of DPs is 6 which appear along the three symmetry-equivalent, fourfold-rotation axes. In inversion and time-reversal symmetry preserving systems, there are two types of DSMs, sd and sp [sd and sf], in category (a) [(b)]. (inset) Respective phase diagrams supported by the minimal Hamiltonians describing these phases on (a) tetragonal and (b) simple cubic lattices. Here, “TI” and “OI” are acronyms for topological insulator and ordinary insulator. Understanding cubic-symmetric DSMs poses two key challenges, however. First, the multiple equivalent rotation axes and mirror planes in cubic systems can protect a variety of bulk-band crossings, complicating the interpretation of experimental data. As a result, early theoretical works on DSMs primarily focused on trigonal, tetragonal, and hexagonal systems, which feature a single principal rotation axis. Through minimal Hamiltonians, various aspects of the physics of rotational-symmetry protected DSMs have been addressed, including nature of band-topology Kargarian et al. (2016, 2018); Wieder et al. (2020); Tyner et al. (2023); Fang and Cano (2021), classification schemes Yang and Nagaosa (2014); Yang et al. (2015a); Gao et al. (2016), and experimental implications Burkov and Kim (2016); Armitage et al. (2018). Insights from such minimal modeling have led to the identification of several candidate materials Wang et al. (2012, 2013); Le et al. (2017, 2018); Kim et al. (2019); Tang et al. (2016), and interpretation of experimental investigations into tetragonal Liu et al. (2014a); Neupane et al. (2014); Borisenko et al. (2014, 2020); Zhang et al. (2019); Lv et al. (2015); Kong et al. (2021) and hexagonal Liu et al. (2014b); Xu et al. (2015a); Xiong et al. (2015); Zhang et al. (2017); Yang et al. (2023) symmetric Dirac materials. Second, theoretical investigations have revealed an absence of a robust bulk-boundary correspondence in rotational-symmetry protected DSMs Kargarian et al. (2016, 2018); Wieder et al. (2020); Tyner et al. (2023); Fang and Cano (2021), in sharp contrast to topological insulators and Weyl semimetals (67) . Since surface states have been pivotal in probing the bulk topology of topological materials Armitage et al. (2018); Lv et al. (2021), this feature of symmetry-protected DSMs complicates the diagnosis of their bulk-topology using surface-sensitive techniques such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Some of this ambiguity can yet be resolved by examining the universal features of minimal models, which offer a clearer framework for associating surface state characteristics with bulk topological properties. Here, we systematically develop a theory of non-magnetic DSMs in cubic crystals, and demonstrate the universal aspects of the relationship between various space group symmetries and observable properties of such DSMs. We find two classes of cubic-symmetric DSMs, based on the parity of the orbitals that hybridize to give rise to Dirac points (DPs). In analogy to similar classification of rotational-symmetry protected DSMs Wieder et al. (2020), we name them sd-DSM (orbitals with same parity) and sf-DSM (orbitals with opposite parity). In both cases the minimum number of DPs is six, which is three times larger than those in rotational-symmetry protected DSMs; see Fig. 1. This feature indicates that the surface states in cubic-symmetric DSMs are qualitatively distinct than those in rotational-symmetry protected DSMs. We construct minimal models to study the topology of the Bloch wavefunctions, identify the universal symmetry-protected features of the surface states, and the nature of spin-momentum locking the latter supports. More specifically, in the sd-DSM we identify an effective \mathbb{Z}_{2} chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Further, by incorporating candidate magnetic orders that may develop as instabilities of cubic-symmetric DSMs, we show that this framework could provide insights into key spectral features observed in rare-earth magnets. We further make specific predictions that can validate the role of DSM physics and also identify potential cubic materials that could be experimentally tested for similar phenomena. Overall, our study suggests that DSM physics may offer a coherent framework for understanding surface states in magnetic topological semimetals with cubic parent symmetries, connecting various materials, and clarifying their origins."

scanning tunneling microscopy: the case of fluorine on silver
surfaces","We use density functional theory calculations to characterize the early stages of fluorination of silver’s (100) and (110) surfaces. In the Ag(100) surface, the hollow site is the most favorable for F adatoms. In the Ag(110) surface, three adsorption sites, namely hollow, long bridge, and short bridge, exhibit similar energies. These locations are also more favorable than an F adatom occupying a vacancy site irrespectively of whether the vacancy was present or not in the pristine surface. The computed energy as a function of surface coverage is used to compute the equilibrium thermodynamics phase diagram. We argue that for the typical pressure and temperature of fluorination experiments, the state of the surface is not determined by thermodynamics but by kinetics. Combining these results with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) topographic simulations we propose assignments to features observed experimentally. We present a minimal model of the apparent topography of adatoms in different locations in terms of hydrogenic orbitals, explaining the observed trends. The model links the STM apparent topography to structural information and the oxidation states of the Ag atoms near the adatom.","The interaction of halogens, chalcogens, and other adatoms with metallic surfaces is of fundamental importance in several fields such as electrochemistry [1], corrosion, heterogeneous catalysis [2, 3, 4] and opens up the possibility to synthesize exotic quantum materials such as, for example, spin-1/2 silver fluorides [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Density functional theory (DFT) [17, 18, 1, 19, 20, 21, 22] is an invaluable theoretical tool to study atom adsorption on metal surfaces. DFT computations provide insights into key parameters, including the distance between the adatom and the upper metal layer, the proximity to the nearest metal atom, charge distributions among the atoms, changes in the work function induced by the adsorbate, and the energy associated with adsorption which is essential for thermodynamic considerations [23]. From the experimental point of view, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) provides unique information on how adatoms interact with metallic surfaces. STM provides an “apparent topography” (AT) of the surface. This, however, may be different from naive expectations based on the charge distribution. For example, operating in constant current mode, sometimes adatoms appear as protrusions but a depression is also possible, as well as a combination of both yielding a Mexican hat or “sombrero” shape. For example, sombrero shapes are observed in the case of sulfur [21], and oxygen [24] on silver. More recently, sombrero shapes have been observed for fluorine on silver surfaces [25]. This variety of ATs is due to the fact that the conductance depends on several factors, such as the density of states and the extension of orbitals. Therefore, modeling the STM data is mandatory to extract all the physical and chemical information from the STM results. Early theories [26, 27] of the ATs of adsorbed atoms on metallic surfaces were based on the jellium model. This provided insights into the bias dependence of the tunneling current and the apparent height of the adatom right at its center but did not give information on the apparent topography away from the center, i.e., what kind of feature the adatom produces. A more complete theory [28] in terms of a tight-binding model provided more detailed information on the ATs and predicted protrusions, depressions, and the sombrero shape depending on the adatom. DFT can compute [21] STM ATs based on the Tersoff-Hamann approximation [29, 30, 31] thus allowing the identification of the features observed in the experiment. In Ref. [25] low-temperature (LT)-STM measurements have been performed on the Ag(100) and Ag(110) surfaces of single crystals exposed to fluorine and hydrogen fluoride (HF). Here we present DFT computations to identify the energetically most favorable adatom locations and the corresponding ATs. We consider both adatoms on top of the ideal surfaces and adatoms in surface vacancy sites. We use the DFT results to estimate the range of fluorine gas chemical potential at which a given coverage is thermodynamically stable and compare it with the condition to have stable bulk phases. The energetics at small coverage allow us to propose assignments of the experimentally observed ATs to specific high-symmetry locations on the surfaces. This is complemented with computations of the ATs of the most stable adatom locations. Experimental ATs have a rich internal structure. As mentioned, the Ag(100) and some Ag(110) ATs show a sombrero shape, especially for negative voltage biases. Instead, ATs acquired with positive voltages tend to show a depression shape of the adatom. Simulated ATs in DFT generally reproduce this behavior although some discrepancies remain. As well known, DFT provides a wealth of information by including all relevant orbitals and a realistic effective potential. However, the trade-off is that it is not always straightforward to pinpoint the important factors determining the AT in terms of the chemistry and structure of the surface. To obtain a deeper understanding of the AT, we present a simplified orbital model of the STM topographies. This allows us to link the main observed features in STM data to information such as the out-of-plane distance from the Ag surface of the F adatom and the oxidation state of the nearby Ag atoms. Figure 1: Geometry of the first two layers of the (a)-(b) Ag(100) and (c)-(d) Ag(110) slabs. The square and rectangle drawn with red solid lines in (a) and (c) show the unit cell considered for each surface. The crystallographic axis on the left indicates the orientation of the bulk crystal associated to the Ag(100) surface. For the 110 surface shown in (c) the horizontal direction corresponds to [110] while the vertical direction corresponds to [001]. The highly-symmetric positions are indicated with yellow shapes for both surfaces. The light and dark gray spheres represent silver atoms from the topmost and the underlying layers, respectively. The distance between these two layers is indicated with an arrow in panels (b) and (d). The parameter \delta_{12} characterizes the interlayer distance relaxation for the two topmost layers. This work is organized as follows. The methods used are explained in Sec. II. Structural parameters and the energetics and diffusion barriers of adatoms are discussed in Sec. III.1. The thermodynamics of a silver surface exposed to fluorine gas is discussed in Sec. III.2. Results for the topographies of adatoms are discussed in Sec. III.3. Section III.4 deals with the explanation of the topographic features as the sombrero shape in terms of a simplified orbital model. The summary and conclusions of the work can be found in Sec. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09346v1,Quantum emitters in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride,"Hexagonal boron nitride has been experimentally shown to exhibit room-temperature single-photon emission. This emission is attributed to defect states in the wide band-gap of hBN, which allow new optical transitions between these dispersion-less defect levels. In this work, we study the new spectral features introduced by interacting atomic defects in consecutive layers of bilayer hBN. Density Functional theory simulations have been carried out to calculate the energy band structure, frequency-dependent complex dielectric functions, and Kohn-Sham states to demonstrate and understand the cause of the emission enhancements. We found that placing colour centres in the vicinity of each other in bilayer hBN introduces new polarization dependent spectral features, with strong dependence on the distance and relative orientation between atomic defects. Our results provide a pathway to engineering single photon emission in hBN via inter-defect interaction.","Figure 1: Emission enhancement in defected bilayer hexagonal boron nitride. a and b show the schematic diagrams for monolayer and bilayer hBN (with C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} point-defect), respectively. c and d show the optical absorbance spectra for the systems in a and b, respectively. The labelled numbers are the peak heights for the Lorentzian region (yellow) and bulk region (blue) of \alpha_{xx}. Defect engineering in hexagonal boron nitride is a promising pathway towards achieving single photon emission in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectral regions[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Theoretical studies on colour centres in hBN traditionally investigate the electronic and optical properties of atomic point-defects in monolayer hBN. The energy and brightness of these emissions is determined by the nature of the defect and its interaction with the host lattice (the monolayer hBN). In this work, we study the new spectral features introduced by placing colour centres in the vicinity of each other in bilayer hBN. In addition to this, our study also proposes a method to tune the emission energies, by altering the relative orientation and distance between the defects in the two layers. Although studies have been carried out to investigate the effect of combining individual atomic defects in monolayer hBN [4], extensive research has not been conducted yet to investigate the tuning of the quantum emission by changing the relative distance and orientation between individual defects. Combining defects in monolayer hBN has the effect of eliminating spin-splitting and introducing a single new defect state above the Fermi energy (but below the bulk conduction bands), leading to a strong optical transition between the two defect states (marked as 1 and 2 in Fig. 6b). However, when such a defect dimer is introduced in both layers of bilayer hBN, the number of total defect states is doubled, with a slight energy difference between the electronic levels (the states marked as 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Fig. 7 b). The new feature offered by defects in bilayer hBN is that by tuning the distance and orientation between the bilayer dimer defects, we can break or restore inversion symmetry of the defect state wavefunctions, which imposes certain selection rules determining the allowed optical transitions between defect states in bilayer hBN. This allows us to dictate how many optical transitions are allowed between the multiple defect states, and in some cases also allows us to create a polarized quantum emitter (see Fig. 8). In addition to this, combining defects in bilayer hBN also leads to enhancement in the single photon emission. The enhancement in spectral features is quantified by the relative heights of the peaks, corresponding to the single photon emission and bulk-band transitions, in the absorbance spectrum (see Fig. 1). The absorbance in Fig.1 is calculated from the frequency-dependent complex dielectric function using the following formula [6]: \alpha(\omega)=\frac{2\omega}{c}\sqrt{\frac{|\epsilon(\omega)|-\text{Re}[% \epsilon(\omega)]}{2}}. (1) In Fig. 1, the absorbance spectra for monolayer and bilayer hBN show that there is an enhancement of 18.4% in the relative peak heights (the peak height of the Lorentzian region divided by the peak height of the bulk region, as shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. 1d), when two C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} defects are allowed to couple with each other in bilayer hBN. The enhancement is explained by the splitting of the bands in the band structure, when a second layer of hBN (with C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} defect) is superposed on top of the first layer of hBN (also with C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} defect). The band splitting gives rise to extra defect states below and above the Fermi energy, allowing for extra optical transitions with nearly the same energies. This result suggests that the emission from the bilayer is not simply an incoherent sum of the two monolayer defect spectra but rather shows a complicated behaviour involving inter-defect interaction. In the following sections, we study this interaction in more details highlighting the tunability of the spectral features of the single photon emission in the bilayer system. We begin by studying the optical and electronic properties of pristine monolayer and bilayer hBN, and see how these properties change with the addition of C{}_{\text{B}}C{}_{\text{N}} defects in the monolayer and bilayer systems. Furthermore, we also investigate how the complex dielectric tensor changes when the distance and orientation between the defects is varied in bilayer hBN, and we explain these changes by looking at the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions for the resulting defect states."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09067v1,Critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces,"The critical states of disordered systems are intriguing subjects within the realm of condensed matter physics and complex systems. These states manifest in materials where disorder plays a significant role, and are distinguished by their multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, accurately characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we argue that critical states exhibit a certain invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both domains. More specifically, it is expected that typical physical quantities characterizing critical states, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, should exhibit invariance in both position space and momentum space. Subsequent numerical simulations validate the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.","The concept of critical states Critical in various physical systems pertains to the behaviors and characteristics exhibited during phase transitions or as they approach critical points. The examination of critical states provides profound insights into the nature of order, disorder, and collective behavior across diverse disciplines Sachdev1 . These states are fundamental for comprehending a wide range of phenomena in statistical physics Critical0 , condensed matter physics Critical1 , and complex systems Critical2 . As a defining feature of critical phenomena Critical3 , fluctuations in critical states become correlated over large distances, with the system demonstrating self-similar behavior at different scales. Critical fluctuations have been observed in various systems, including phase transitions in ferromagnets-antiferromagnets Critical4 , percolation thresholds in complex networks Critical5 , and photonic quasicrystals photonic . As research continues to advance, the exploration of critical states holds promise for unveiling new phenomena and deepening our understanding of complex systems. Recently, significant advancements have been achieved in the investigation of critical states of wave functions, specifically focusing on critical states of quantum disordered systems Liu-self-duality ; Li1 ; Li2 ; You ; g1 ; g2 ; zhou ; Biddle ; Zhang ; Chen ; q1 ; q2 ; q3 ; q4 ; q5 ; q6 ; q7 ; q8 ; Yao1 ; Yao2 ; cai ; Slager ; SSHQ ; gg3 ; gg4 ; gg5 ; gg6 ; gg7 ; gg8 ; gg0 ; gg9 . Novel concepts and phenomena such as anomalous mobility edges Liu-Anomalous , the utilization of renormalization groups for critical states RG1 ; RG2 , real eigenvalues determined through recursion of eigenstates Liu-Real1 ; Liu-Real2 , critical states induced by coupling of two chains twochain , and critical states of two-dimensional quasicrystals Duncan are continuously emerging. Nevertheless, the primary challenge in comprehending critical states lies in determining the conditions under which they arise and accurately characterizing them. Bohr’s complementarity principle MQM provides us with inspiration to bridge this gap. According to the complementarity principle, it is impossible to simultaneously observe the wave nature and particle nature of matter under different representations, such as position space and momentum space. Matter exhibits different properties in these representations. The relationship between position space and momentum space is primarily established through the Fourier transform; position space serves as a mathematical framework for describing the location of particles or objects in physical space, while momentum space is perceived as the duality of position space QM . The critical state can be considered as a third state in addition to particle and wave properties, thus it can be reasonably inferred that the critical state may exhibit some invariance in both position space and momentum space. Figure 1: (Color online) (a) and (b) demonstrate an application of Bohr’s complementarity principle, showing that a localized state in position space must be delocalized in momentum space, and vice versa for an extended state. (c) and (d) illustrate that critical states can simultaneously exhibit delocalization, multifractality, and self-similarity in both position space and momentum space. Based on this duality perception, Liu and Xia propose an explicit criterion Liu-Critical for precisely characterizing critical states. They assert that the Lyapunov exponents of critical states should simultaneously be 0 in both position space and momentum space. The criterion definitively distinguishes critical states from extended and localized states, as the Lyapunov exponents of the latter two are not equal in position space and momentum space. If one exponent is 0, then the dual exponent must be greater than 0. In physics, this also implies that extended and localized states cannot simultaneously exhibit delocalization in position space and momentum space, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a) and (b). In contrast, critical states should demonstrate delocalization, multifractality, and self-similarity in both position space and momentum space, as depicted in Fig. 1(c) and (d). These findings clearly illustrate that critical states maintain a certain kind of invariance across two dual spaces. A natural question arises: can the invariance of the critical state extend beyond the Lyapunov exponent to include other physical quantities in both position and momentum spaces? This study demonstrates that the invariance of the critical state is universal, encompassing various physical quantities such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08969v1,Theory of anomalous Hall effect from screened vortex charge in a phase disordered superconductor,"Motivated by recent experiments showing evidence for chiral superconductivity in an anomalous Hall phase of tetralayer graphene, we study the relation between the normal state anomalous Hall conductivity and that in the phase disordered state above the critical temperature of the superconductor. By a numerical calculation of superconductivity in an anomalous Hall metal, we find that a difference in vortex and antivortex charge is determined by the Fermi surface Berry phase. Combining this with the vortex dynamics in a back-ground supercurrent leads to a Hall response in the phase disordered state of the superconductor that is close to the normal state anomalous Hall response. However, using a gauge-invariant superconducting response framework, we find that while vortex charge is screened by interactions, the screening charge, after a time-delay, reappears in the longitudinal current. Thus, the dc Hall conductivity in this phase, instead of matching the screened vortex charge, matches the ac Hall conductance in the superconducting and normal phase, which are similar.","Multilayer graphene has recently shown evidence of a number of novel phases that can be tuned by gate voltage, magnetic field, temperature and displacement field. These phases include several superconducting phases in twisted systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and also in non-twisted systems [12, 13, 14] some of which are spin triplet. More interestingly, a recent experiment [15] has provided evidence of chiral superconductivity in an anomalous Hall metal phase, which is quite close to systems that have shown quantum anomalous Hall as well as fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases [16]. The occurrence of superconductivity in close proximity to correlated phases has led to many theoretical proposals for the mechanism of superconductivity, some based on strong correlation [17, 18] and others based on the proximity to correlated topological states [19, 20] . Figure 1: Schematic for the origin of anomalous Hall in a 2D superconductor above the BKT transition i.e. so-called phase disordered state. The local supercurrent applies a Magnus force [21] on the vortex-antivortex pair (red and blue discs) in opposite directions. This leads to diffusive motion of the vortices along \pm\hat{x} [22]. The motion of the vortices corresponds to an electric field along y, which is the origin of dissipative transport in the phase disordered state. The difference in vortex-anti-vortex charge \Delta Q_{v}=Q_{-}-Q_{+} that we will numerically show to be related to the normal state anomalous Hall coefficient lead to a Hall current (green arrow) orthogonal to the electric field. We find that many-body screening as well as the far-field phase winding of vortices (shown as the crescents of moving charge) conspire to match the measured dc Hall conductance from vortices to the bulk ac Hall conductance. The peculiar characteristics of the superconducting state such as the pair density wave-character [18], chiral nature [19] as well as the Berry curvature of the band are likely to lead to interesting phenomelogical aspects that are quite independent from the origin of the superconductivity. In fact, quantum geometry, which is a generalization of Berry curvature, has already been shown to have a significant modification of the superfluid stiffness [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30] even in the absence of Berry curvature. Berry curvature of a band leads to more interesting behavior in the form of anomalous Hall conductance [31, 32, 33] in the normal state. This leads to the natural question about how such an anomalous Hall conductance would manifest in a chiral superconducting phase. In fact, chiral superconductivity by itself has been suggested to support an ac Hall response [34, 35]. This chiral response has been conjectured to have a number of interesting consequences such as fractional charge and angular momentum of vortices [36]. However, a gauge invariant treatment of screening effects by the background condensate leads to an effective Chern-Simons theory where the chiral conductivity from purely chiral superconductivity at low wave-vectors is suppressed [37, 38]. The evidence for chiral superconductivity in a purely two dimensional anomalous Hall metal phase [19], where screening effects are reduced and phase disordered superconductivity is seen, motivates us to revisit the question of chiral response and vortex properties of such phases. In this work, we will study the effect of anomalous Hall conductivity in the normal state on the phase disordered state in the superconductor above the Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition [21]. As shown in Fig. 1, the difference in charge densities in the cores of vortices and anti-vortices can lead to an anomalous Hall contribution to the current. We argue that such a contribution can arise from a gauge invariant effective action of a superconductor [39] that includes a Hall response and numerically check that such a contribution indeed appears in a simple model. We then show using the gauge-invariant response that while the vortex charge is screened by many-body interactions, the dynamical screening cloud (crescents in Fig. 1) combine so that the vortex generated dc Hall conductivity is the same as the ac Hall response."

Cavity Quantum Materials","The strong coupling regime of photons and quantum materials inside optical cavities has emerged as a promising environment for manipulating states of matter with light. Here, in turn, we show that photons bear witness to cavity quantum-electrodynamical modifications of the material, leading to profoundly non-classical properties of light passing through the cavity. By generalizing quantum-optical input-output relations to correlated quantum materials, we study the second-order photon coherence g^{(2)}(t) and demonstrate that antibunching of transmitted photons serves as direct evidence of light-induced changes to the cavity-embedded material. We show that materials near a quantum critical point can realize a collective many-body photon blockade, enabling the generation of single photons or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs via leveraging strong matter fluctuations. Our findings provide new routes for interrogating and harnessing cavity-embedded quantum materials as quantum light sources, as a resource for photon-based computation and quantum sensing.","The strong light-matter coupling regime of photons and correlated quantum materials has recently garnered much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In conventional quantum-optical settings, individual localized emitters become strongly coupled to photon modes inside optical cavities, generating polariton excitations with hybrid light and matter characteristics that are a rich resource for quantum information processing [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Recent studies have started to bridge the fields of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) and correlated electrons, by demonstrating strong coupling of photons to the collective modes of many-body systems in cavities [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], and exploring whether photon fluctuations can suffice to alter ground state properties of quantum materials [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. However, monitoring the quantum electrodynamical dressing of states of matter in cavities, and distinguishing these photon-induced changes from more mundane screening or interface effects due to the cavity remains a central challenge. At the same time, observable ramifications for the state of light remain largely unexplored, raising intriguing questions regarding whether correlated electron systems can be harnessed as sources of quantum photon states, with applications to quantum computing and metrology. The starting point for this work rests on the observation that, if strong light-matter coupling indeed alters the collective phase of a quantum material, then photons must necessarily be witnesses to these changes through their entanglement with the material [41, 46]. Hence, as photons are injected into the cavity and trigger changes in the material, these modifications should become visible to measurements of the statistics of ejected photons. On generic grounds, materials near a quantum critical point (QCP) are a particularly attractive target to test these ideas, as strong quantum fluctuations should make them susceptible to light-induced changes. Light emitted from cavities hosting strongly-correlated and photon-dressed quantum materials should consequently exhibit strongly non-classical properties. Here, we confirm these expectations, showing that the quantum statistics of light transmitted through cavities are direct evidence of quantum-electrodynamical changes to the state of matter in materials. Generalizing quantum optical input-output relations to strongly-correlated cavity quantum materials, we study the second-order photon coherence g^{(2)}(t) for weakly-driven cavities hosting Mott insulators in the strong light-matter coupling regime. We find that transmitted photons exhibit pronounced (anti)bunching, which becomes drastically amplified near an Ising QCP, and establish measurements of g^{(2)} as a probe of the ensuing photon-induced changes to the state of matter. We then show that quantum materials near criticality can in turn become collective single-photon sources, harnessing strong quantum fluctuations in the material to convert a laser drive into single photons. Finally, we demonstrate that chiral Mott insulators embedded in optical cavities can become efficient sources of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs of entangled photons, as a resource for photon-based computation and sensing [47]."

The vortices and antivortices carry fractional charges of equal sign but unequal magnitude and have a honeycomb lattice structure that contrasts with the triangular lattices of superconducting electron-electron-pair vortex lattices. We predict that increasing charge density and weakening magnetic fields drive vortex delocalization transitions signaled experimentally by abrupt increases in counterflow transport resistance.,"References Ma et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08800v1,Deep Learning Accelerated Quantum Transport Simulations in Nanoelectronics: From Break Junctions to Field-Effect Transistors,"Quantum transport calculations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices, yet the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency has long limited their practical applications. We present a general framework that combines the deep learning tight-binding Hamiltonian (DeePTB) approach with the non-equilibrium Green’s Function (NEGF) method, enabling efficient quantum transport calculations while maintaining first-principles accuracy. We demonstrate the capabilities of the DeePTB-NEGF framework through two representative applications: comprehensive simulation of break junction systems, where conductance histograms show good agreement with experimental measurements in both metallic contact and single-molecule junction cases; and simulation of carbon nanotube field effect transistors through self-consistent NEGF-Poisson calculations, capturing essential physics including the electrostatic potential and transfer characteristic curves under finite bias conditions. This framework bridges the gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a powerful tool for high-throughput quantum transport simulations across different scales in nanoelectronics.","Quantum transport simulations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices. The non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) method[1, 2, 3], combined with density functional theory (DFT)[4, 5], has established itself as the standard approach for investigating quantum transport phenomena at the first-principles level[6, 7]. However, the computational burden of DFT-NEGF self-consistent field (SCF) iterations severely constrains its practical applications. This limitation becomes particularly critical in studying large-scale systems and dynamic processes, in which extensive sampling of configuration space is required. A prime example is the break junction experiments[8, 9], where quantum transport through nanoscale contacts evolves from metallic contacts to single-molecule junctions. Thousands of conductance measurements throughout this process are essential for statistical analysis, making first-principles calculations computationally prohibitive. Machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged as promising alternatives to accelerate quantum transport calculations. There are several ML attempts including direct prediction of conductance from atomic structures using local descriptors[10], and mapping combined structural and electronic features to transmission spectra near the Fermi level[11]. While these approaches demonstrate the potential of ML in transport calculations, they are often limited to specific systems or single transport property, lacking the generality required for broad applications in nanoelectronics. A systematic and comprehensive framework to accelerate DFT-NEGF simulations and capable of predicting various transport properties - from transmission spectra to potential profiles and current-voltage characteristics - remains elusive. The key to addressing this challenge lies in bypassing the time-consuming SCF iterations while maintaining first-principles accuracy. Our recently developed deep learning represented tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian method, DeePTB[12, 13], provides an efficient route to accurate electronic structure calculations. By combining deep neural networks with physics-based principles, DeePTB achieves remarkable accuracy in predicting both local environment-dependent Slater-Koster (SK) tight-binding Hamiltonians[12] and DFT Hamiltonians, overlap and density matrix in the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis[13]. Building on these capabilities, we present a general DeePTB-NEGF framework for efficient quantum transport calculations. This framework enables direct prediction of TB models or DFT Hamiltonians as well as the overlap matrices, eliminating the need for SCF iterations while maintaining first-principles accuracy. We demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of our approach through two representative applications: (1) break junction systems, where we successfully simulate the dynamic process in metallic contacts and single-molecule junctions, showing good agreement with both DFT-NEGF calculations and experimental measurements[14]; and (2) carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FETs), where we implement Poisson calculations in DeePTB-NEGF framework to study transport characteristics under finite bias, validating our results against the established NanoTCAD ViDES solver[15, 16]. These applications demonstrate that our framework can efficiently handle quantum transport across different scales and materials systems, opening new possibilities for high-throughput quantum transport calculations in nanoelectronics."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08654v1,Spin-valley-polarized Weiss oscillations in monolayer 1-MoS2,"Monolayer 1T′-\ceMoS2 exhibits spin- and valley-dependent massive tilted Dirac cones with two velocity correction terms in low-energy effective Hamiltonian. We theoretically investigate the longitudinal diffusive magnetoconductivity of monolayer 1T′-\ceMoS2 by using the linear response theory. It is shown that, when the Fermi level is close to the spin-orbit coupling gap, the Weiss oscillation splits into two branches and exhibits spin-valley polarization in the presence of both a spatial periodic electric potential modulation in the lateral direction and a nonzero perpendicular electric field. The spin-valley polarization stems from the interplay between the tilted Dirac cones, the spin-orbit coupling gap, and the external electric potential modulation, and can be treated as a signature of monolayer 1T′-\ceMoS2. When the Fermi level is far from the spin-orbit coupling gap, the spin-polarization appears in the Weiss oscillation under a magnetic field modulation in the lateral direction. This polarization behavior arises from the interplay between the tilted Dirac cones, the spin-orbit coupling, and the external magnetic field modulation, indicating that a finite spin-orbit coupling gap is not indispensable for polarization in the Weiss oscillation.","Monolayer trasition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) of the T′ structure phase, which have the general chemical fomula \ceMX2 with M (W, Mo) and X (Te, Se, S), was theoretically predicted to be a quantum spin Hall insulator [1] and has recently attracted considerable attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. As a typical material of monolayer 1T′-TMDCs, monolayer 1T′-\ceMoS2 [1] possesses anisotropic tilted bands around Dirac points with linear energy dispersions in the momentum space [13, 14, 15] similar to that in 8-Pmmn borophene [16, 17], and undergoes a topological phase transition [18, 19, 20] induced by a perpendicular electric field such as that in silicene [21]. Due to the anisotropic tilted Dirac bands, the strong spin-orbit interaction and the controllable band gap, monolayer 1T′-\ceMoS2 has already led to various intriguing findings such as anisotropic longitudinal optical conductivities [22], anisotropic plasmon excitations and static screening effects [23], and electric field modulated valley- and spin-dependent Klein tunneling [24]. The information of the electron spectrum of two-dimensional systems can be successfully obtained by the interaction of electrons with artificially created periodic modulation (electric, magnetic or both) with periods in the submicrometer range [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Under such spatial periodic modulations, it is known as Weiss oscillation [25, 26, 31], that the longitudinal diffusive conductivity oscillates with the inverse magnetic field periodically. Weiss oscillations have been investigated in pristine graphene [32, 33], bilayer graphene [34], \alpha-\mathcal{T}_{3} lattices [35], and phosphorene [36]. A beating pattern was predicted in spin-orbit-coupled two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) [37, 38] and silicene [39, 40]. The tilting-induced valley polarization was discovered in 8-Pmmn borophene [41]. However, the signature of Weiss oscillations in monolayer 1T′-\ceMoS2 has not been studied yet, where the interplay between the tilted Dirac cones and the spin-orbit coupling may bring distinct spin and/or valley polarization. In addition, whether a finite spin-orbit coupling gap is indispensable for spin-polarization in the Weiss oscillation deserves our attention. In this work, we theoretically investigate Weiss oscillations in monolayer 1T′-\ceMoS2 in low temperature regime by using the linear response theory. When the Fermi surface is close to the spin-orbit coupling gap, we find that the Weiss oscillation is spin-valley-polarized in the presence of both a spatial periodic electric potential modulation in the lateral direction and a nonzero perpendicular electric field. This spin-valley polarization in the Weiss oscillation arises from the interplay between the tilted Dirac cones, the spin-orbit coupling gap, and the external electric potential modulation, which can be a signature of monolayer 1T′-\ceMoS2. In fact, silicene is a material with the spin-orbit coupling gap but is lack of the tilted Dirac cones and 8-Pmmn borophene is a material with the tilted Dirac cones but is lack of the spin-orbit coupling gap. Neither of them can exhibit the spin-valley polarization in the Weiss oscillation [40, 41] with a single electric potential modulation. Comparing to the spin-polarized and valley-polarized Weiss oscillation in silicene [40], the tilted Dirac cones participate in the spin-valley-polarized Weiss oscillation in monolayer 1T′-\ceMoS2 instead of an additional spatial periodic electric field modulation along the z direction. On the other hand, by raising the Fermi surface high enough so that the spin-orbit coupling gap can be neglected, the Weiss oscillation is spin-polarized with a magnetic field modulation. This polarization behavior arises from the interplay between the tilted Dirac cones, the spin-orbit coupling, and the external magnetic field modulation, and is different from that in silicene [40], where the spin-orbit coupling participates in the spin-polarization in the form of a finite spin-orbit coupling gap. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of monolayer 1T′-\ceMoS2 and obtain the Landau levels and eigenfunctions. The modulation induced Weiss oscillation in the longitudinal diffusive magnetoconductivity is discussed in Sec. III. Finally, we conclude in Sec. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08597v1,Electron-Magnon Coupling Mediated Magnetotransport in Antiferromagnetic van der Waals Heterostructure,"Electron-magnon coupling reveals key insights into the interfacial properties between non-magnetic metals and magnetic insulators, influencing charge transport and spin dynamics. Here, we present temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy and magneto-transport measurements of few-layer graphene (FLG)/antiferromagnetic FePS3 heterostructures. The magnon mode in FePS3 softens below 40 K, and effective magnon stiffness decreases with cooling. Magnetotransport measurements show that FLG exhibits negative magnetoresistance (MR) in the heterostructure at low fields (\pm 0.2\,\text{T}), persisting up to 100 K; beyond this, MR transitions to positive. Notably, as layer thickness decreases, the coupling strength at the interface reduces, leading to a suppression of negative MR. Additionally, magnetodielectric measurements in the FLG/FePS3/FLG heterostructure show an upturn at temperatures significantly below (T_{\text{N}}), suggesting a role for the magnon mode in capacitance, as indicated by hybridization between magnon and phonon bands in pristine FePS3 via magnetoelastic coupling.","The interaction between conduction electrons and spin fluctuations in magnetic insulators, i.e., magnons, may cause electronic and/or magnonic spin current which may be probed either electronically, by measuring spin-mixing conductance, or thermally, by spin Seebeck effect (SSE) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Theoretically, scattering of electron and magnon (frequency \omega) results in transition from electronic state i to j with momentum transfer (\mathbf{q}), and can be expressed in terms of electron-magnon coupling (EMC) matrix element (\left\langle\Psi_{j,\mathbf{k+q},\downarrow}\left|\nabla^{\nu}_{\mathbf{q}}V% \right|\Psi_{i,\mathbf{k},\uparrow}\right\rangle\omega_{\mathbf{q}\nu}^{-1/2}), where V represents the electron-magnon self energy, analogous to the electron-phonon and electron-photon coupling [7, 8, 9]. However, this process requires a spin flip in the electronic state to satisfy the angular momentum conservation, whereas electron-phonon coupling operates independent of spin state. Depending on the EMC strength, efficient momentum transfer at the metal/antiferromagnetic insulator (AFMI) interface increases the effective local density of state (DOS), which in turn, influences the electron transport through the metallic channel. Moreover, as the lattice modulation in AFMIs is accompanied by magnetic order, magnons may couple with the electric dipoles which may be captured in magnetocapacitance (MC) measurement [10, 11, 12]. Effectiveness of magnon (frequencies GHz to THz, lifetime microseconds to nanoseconds) detection over a large distance (several micrometers) via magnetotransport/spin transport method rely on: (i) the interface between the magnetic material and the metal layers, (ii) the shape and size of the magnetic material, (iii) availability of low-temperature for the reduction of scattering with phonons, and (iv) the frequency range of the detection system [13]. Even though AFM magnons (THz range frequencies) are gaining interest due to faster dynamics, and robustness against external fields, the detection technique is challenging compared to ferromagnets because of the lack of net magnetization, which makes conventional magneto-optical techniques less effective [14]. Detection of spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in AFMIs is more challenging than FMIs as the coupling between the spin current and the complex magnonic structure of the AFM produces subtle changes in spin-mixing conductance than that of ferromagnets even at cryogenic temperature [15, 16]. In an electron-doped antiferromagnet, spiral phase of the sublattice magnetization is not energetically favorable due to the presence of homogeneous phase. Even though magnon exchange can bind two electrons, it is weaker at large distances (r) between electron, decay faster as \sim\frac{1}{r^{4}} than in holes (\sim\frac{1}{r^{2}}) [17]. Consequently, for the detection of the electron-magnon coupling, graphene as transport channel with low spin-orbit coupling, high spin diffusion length (\sim \mum at room temperature), high carrier concentration (\sim 1013 cm-2) is preferable over metallic films [18, 19]. To probe magnon-mediated fluctuation in carrier density of graphene, an uncompensated interface, where the electrons on the graphene surface couple asymmetrically to the AFM sublattice can increase the EMC [20, 21]. An effective approach for generating a magnon spin current involves using charge-spin conversion through spin-orbit coupling, along with continuous spin transfer between electrons and magnons [22, 23, 24], a process referred to here as charge-magnon conversion. This conversion efficiency is much higher for uncompensated interface and the efficiency is enhanced with the thickness of AFM in two dimensional regime as discussed by Liao et. al. [25]. Recently, Yang et.al. studied graphene/van der Waals AFM heterostructure (HS) and observed an unconventional manifestation of the quantum Hall effect which can be due to the presence of counterflowing spin-polarized edge channels originating from the spin-dependent exchange shift in graphene [26]. Moreover, in the stacked HS (graphene/vdW FM CrBr3/graphene), tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) at low temperature indicates magnon emission with a possibility of spin-injection [27]. Practically, for 2D AFMIs, thicker flakes (thickness \geq 5 nm), with higher magnetic moment and magnetic ordering temperature, may be transferred onto the graphene channel for stronger EMC [28]. In this context, few-layer graphene (FLG), compared to monolayer, provides better signal-to-noise ratio, higher sensitivity due to the increased carrier density, and greater robustness against the strain/rippling effect during micromanipulation process [29]. An alternative approach towards realization of AFM magnon-coupled electronic device could be correlating spin-charge-lattice coupling via Raman scattering with conventional magnetoresistance (MR) and magnetocapacitance (MC) measurement of FLG/vdW antiferromagnet HS in suitable geometry. Here, we bring together temperature dependent magnetotransport study (MR, and MC) and Raman spectroscopy in a FLG/bulk 2D AFMI FePS3 (out-of-plane anisotropy with T_{\text{N}} \sim 120 K) HS device. Similar to the pristine FePS3, spin-phonon coupled modes in the HS, indicative of magnetic ordering, were observed at/around 120 K, but with 3 times higher deviation (softening) from usual anharmonicity (\Delta\omega) when placed on FLG. Moreover, in the HS, contrary to the characteristics of magnetic Bragg peaks, magnon mode of FePS3 (\sim 120 cm-1) softens between 5 K and 120 K which suggests decrease of effective magnon stiffness in presence of graphene. In the HS device with micro-electrodes only on FLG, besides the typical positive MR (in isolated FLG) resulting from the distortion of the trajectory of charge carriers with increasing magnetic field, negative slope has been recorded at low magnetic field (\leq 0.2 T) persisting upto 100 K which is evocative of the EMC due magnon-to-charge conversion (see Figure 1(a)). Predictably, with lowering the thickness of AFMI, suppression of said negative MR in FLG has been observed due to the lessened magnetic moment in the few-layer limit of FePS3 which causes considerable drop in magnon-to-charge conversion and hence, reduced EMC. Further, MC of bulk FePS3, sandwiched between two FLG flakes, exhibits an upturn below magnon temperature (\sim 90 K) which suggests the role of magnon-phonon coupling in FePS3 on the interfacial electric polarization (see Figure 1(b)). The material perspective, and the device architecture reported here may have significant implications in future magnetoelectric memory and logic devices based on antiferromagnetic magnon."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08346v1,Evidence of Orbital Hall current revealed in second harmonic response of longitudinal and transverse voltage in light metal-ferromagnet bilayers,"We present experimental evidence of orbital Hall torque and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR), arising from the orbital Hall effect generated by the transverse flow of orbital angular momentum in light metals under an applied electric current. Through second-harmonic measurements, we investigate orbital Hall torque and UMR in bilayer devices composed of ferromagnetic materials (FM), such as Ni and NiFe, paired with light metals (LM), such as Ti and Nb. Our results demonstrate that LM/Ni bilayers exhibit enhanced damping-like torque and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) compared to LM/NiFe bilayers. This enhancement suggests that angular momentum is generated via the orbital Hall effect within the light metal, where it undergoes orbital-to-spin conversion within the Ni ferromagnet, ultimately transferring to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. Torque and UMR are also absent in single-layer devices, highlighting the necessity of the bilayer structure for orbital current generation.","The nonequilibrium flow of angular momentum stands as an essential element in condensed matter physics, exerting a significant influence on contemporary solid-state magnetic devices. The spin dynamics effect has been observed through phenomena such as the Spin Hall Effect (SHE)[1, 2, 3, 4], Spin Seeback Effect (SSE)[5, 6, 7], Spin Nernst Effect (SNE)[8], Spin Torque (ST)[9, 10]. The SHE, characterized by generating a spin current from a charge current through spin-orbit coupling (SOC), facilitates the transfer of angular momentum from the crystal lattice to the electronic system. This transferred spin, in turn, contributes to magnetization, giving rise to spin-orbit torque (SOT), and thereby enabling the electrical manipulation of magnetization of ferromagnetic material[11, 12]. However, this method for generating a strong spin current mostly works with specific materials like W, Pt, Topological Insulator[13] etc., because it relies on a significant SOC, which not all materials have[14]. in addition to this, the spin angular momentum is also responsible for the novel magnetoresistance, which includes SMR[15, 16] and UMR[17, 18, 19, 20] phenomena.In contrast to anisotropic and spin Hall magnetoresistance, unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) is directly proportional to the electric current amplitude and reverses sign with the inversion of either the current or magnetization[17]. Consequently, it serves as an effective means for detecting magnetization switching[20, 21]. So far, extensive investigation into orbital transport has occurred, primarily driven by the influence of the crystal field, which imposes specific symmetries on the block state. this imposition disrupts continuous rotational symmetry, consequently inhibiting the formation of orbital momentum. However recent theoretical studies have forecasted the emergence of a nonzero orbital current through the establishment of a non-equilibrium state. this state can be induced by applying an electric field to a nonmagnetic material, without necessitating the SOC inherent in the nonmagnetic material[22, 23, 24, 25].The process involves the transfer of angular momentum from the crystal lattice to the orbital, followed by subsequent angular momentum transmission through SOC from the orbital to the spin. Ultimately, the angular momentum is transferred from the spin to the magnetization. In the absence of SOC, only the angular momentum transfers to the orbital from the lattice, resulting in nonzero orbital angular momentum. This underscores the fundamental nature of angular momentum, surpassing the significance of spin angular momentum in such scenarios. In the case of spin, it originates within the nonmagnetic material and interacts with the magnetization of the ferromagnetic, rendering it independent of the specific ferromagnetic material[26, 27]. Conversely, orbital angular momentum does not directly interact with magnetization, making the experimental measurement of orbital effects particularly challenging. Numerous experimental investigations have explored the orbital Hall effect[28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34], demonstrating enhanced torque on the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials by employing bilayers of low spin-orbit coupling (SOC) metals with ferromagnetic layers. Given that orbital currents do not directly interact with magnetization, a transfer of orbital angular momentum to spin is required for magnetization interaction, a process occurring within the ferromagnetic material that is therefore sensitive to the choice of ferromagnetic material. The orbital current generated in the light metal diffuses into the ferromagnetic layer, where it is converted into a spin current via the SOC of the ferromagnet. This spin current subsequently exerts torque on the ferromagnet’s magnetization, highlighting the significance of SOC within the ferromagnetic layer. In this paper, we investigate the detection of the orbital Hall effect arising from Ti and Nb via second harmonic Hall measurements and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) techniques. Ti and Nb layers were deposited on two distinct ferromagnetic materials, NiFe and Ni, to compare the orbital Hall torque (OHT) and spin Hall torque (SHT). Our observations include the identification of the Slonczewski-like (SL) effective field, with associated torque efficiency quantified. Our findings reveal an increase in current-induced torque for Ti/Ni and Nb/Ni bilayers compared to Ti/NiFe and Nb/NiFe, despite the relatively low spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of Ti and Nb. Furthermore, we observed orbital UMR in all bilayer structures, free from the influence of heavy elements with high SOC, and found comparable UMR in Ti and Nb when paired with either Ni or NiFe, indicating an orbital origin rather than a spin-related one. Additionally, we compared the torque and UMR of each bilayer with those of single-layer devices, where these effects are absent due to the lack of orbital current in single layers."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08287v1,"Tuning the Quasi-bound States of Double-barrier Structures: Insights from Resonant
Tunneling Spectra","In this work, we study the resonant tunneling (RT) of electrons and H atoms in double-barrier (DB) systems. Our numerical calculations directly verify the correspondence between the resonant tunneling energies and the energy levels of quasi-bound states (QBS) within the double barriers. Based on this, in-depth analyses are carried out on the modulation of QBS energy levels and numbers which show step variation with the inter-barrier spacing. The mathematical criterion for the existence of QBS is derived, and the impacts of the barrier width and barrier height on QBS levels are investigated. Taking the rectangular double-barrier as an example, we have studied the manipulation of electronic structures and optical properties of the inter-barrier region (quasi-potential well) by tuning the inter-barrier spacing (width of quasi-potential well). Atom-like optical absorption features are found in the range of infrared to visible spectrum, which can be continuously tuned by the variation of quasi-potential well width. The potential application of double-barrier nanostructures in ultrahigh-precision detection of electromagnetic radiations is demonstrated.","Resonant tunneling (RT) is a unique phenomenon in quantum tunneling, specifically occurring in a double-barrier (DB) system. In this scenario, an incident particle can traverse the barriers with a probability of 100%. The exploration of RT began with the foundational theoretical and experimental work by Tsu, Esaki, Chang, and others in the 1970s [1, 2, 3], gaining considerable attention in the 1980s [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Research on RT continues today [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], largely due to its applications in microelectronic devices such as resonant tunneling diodes [20, 12, 21, 22]. Recent studies have investigated dynamic RT through quasi-bound superstates (QBSS) generated by oscillating delta-function potentials [15]. The prevalent conceptual framework for RT suggests that the energy of the incident particle aligns with one of the quasi-bound states (QBS) energy levels formed within the DBs, leading to resonance and constructive interference of the wave functions, thus maximizing tunneling probability [2, 3, 23, 7, 24, 15]. However, this picture remains largely hypothetical and has yet to be substantiated through numerical or experimental verification. In a related work, one of the authors has performed a systematic investigation of quantum tunneling through DBs of arbitrary shape [18], establishing general conditions for RT. This work demonstrates that RT can be realized for any particle with incident energy less than the barrier height by adjusting the distance between the barriers. This implies that continuous tuning of the QBS energy levels is possible through manipulation of the barrier distance, effectively modifying the width of the quasi-potential well. Based on a number of DB systems, we have meticulously examined in this paper the RT of electrons, as well as the RT of H atoms whose tunneling effects have been demonstrated experimentally [25, 26, 27]. Comprehensive numerical simulations have validated the one-to-one correspondence between the RT energies and the QBS energy levels within the double-barrier region. Utilizing this insight, we conducted a detailed analysis of how varying the distance between the barriers influences the position and abundance of QBS levels. Additionally, we elucidated the mathematical conditions necessary for the existence of these energy levels and explored the impacts of barrier width and height variations. Focusing on rectangular DB systems, we investigated the effects of inter-barrier spacing (the width of the quasi-potential well) on the electronic structures and optical properties of the region. This examination highlights the free-atom-like electronic and optical features of QBS in DB nanostructures, which enable potential applications in ultrahigh-precision detection of electromagnetic radiation, underscoring their transformative potential in the fields of nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II demonstrates numerically the correspondence between the RT energies and QBS levels. Section III elucidates how the spacing of potential barriers can modulate the energy levels of QBS and deduces the conditions that must be met with for RT to take place. Section IV examines the optical properties of the quasi-potential well region, with a particular focus on the effects of varying the inter-barrier spacing (width of quasi-potential well) and its potential applications in the ultrahigh-precision detection of electromagnetic waves within the infrared spectrum."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08202v1,Latent Haldane Models,"Latent symmetries, which materialize after performing isospectral reductions, have recently been shown to be instrumental in revealing novel topological phases in one-dimensional systems, among many other applications. In this work, we explore how to construct a family of seemingly complicated two-dimensional models that result in energy-dependent Haldane models upon performing an isospectral reduction. In these models, we find energy-dependent latent Semenoff masses without introducing a staggered on-site potential. In addition, energy-dependent latent Haldane masses also emerge in decorated lattices with nearest-neighbor complex hoppings. Using the Haldane model’s properties, we then predict the location of the topological gaps in the aforementioned family of models and construct phase diagrams to determine where the topological phases lie in parameter space. This idea yielded, for instance, useful insights in the case of a modified version of \alpha-graphyne and hexagonal plaquettes with additional decorations, where the gap-closing energies can be calculated using the ISR to predict topological phase transitions.","Topological phases of matter have become a cornerstone of modern condensed matter theory, with applications ranging from material science and photonics through mechanical and non-Hermitian systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. A well-established theoretical framework that characterizes topological phases has been developed and refined in the last three decades, based on a classification of disordered insulators and superconductors subject to anti-unitary symmetries [6, 7, 8, 9]. One of the main properties of topological insulators is the bulk-boundary correspondence, which implies the existence of robust in-gap edge modes in one dimension (1D) and gapless boundary states in two and three dimensions (2D and 3D). To understand bulk properties, one typically considers periodic crystal structures and uses the bulk-boundary correspondence [10]. However, topologically nontrivial insulating states are not restricted to periodic systems, as they have also been found in amorphous, aperiodic, fractals, and disordered systems [11, 12, 13, 14]. One of the paradigmatic models of topological insulators in 2D is the Haldane model [15]. It models tightly-bound spinless electrons on a 2D honeycomb lattice subject to time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking by including complex next-nearest-neighbor hoppings. One of the consequences of nontrivial topology in such a system is the nonexistence of a complete set of exponentially localized Wannier functions, also known as an obstruction to Wannierization [16]. Consequently, a topologically nontrivial state cannot be adiabatically connected to an atomic limit in which electrons occupy maximally localized Wannier states. This model forms the backbone for understanding the quantum spin Hall effect [17, 18], and is also the simplest model to realize the quantum anomalous Hall effect [19]. Because of its importance, it has been dubbed the “hydrogen atom” of topological insulators. Here, we will explore how it can be combined with the isospectral reduction (ISR) technique [20]. In the last few years, the ISR has been used to understand and uncover many phenomena that were previously difficult to grasp. This technique originates in the study of large networks using graph theory, where the adjacency matrices for complicated graphs are reduced on a set of chosen vertices using a projective scheme. As the name implies, the technique reduces the matrix dimension while preserving the spectrum at the cost of introducing a non-linear eigenvalue problem. Initially, the method was shown to be very useful in revealing hidden network structures [21] and obtaining better eigenvalue approximations [22]. In the context of physics, it takes the form of an effective Hamiltonian. It has found use in various applications, including the unveiling of latent symmetries [23], explaining accidental degeneracies [24], designing quantum information transfer protocols [25], or uncovering novel topological phases of Hermitian and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians [26, 27, 28]. In this work, we use ISRs in a range of 2D lattice models to understand some of their features in terms of the Haldane model. In particular, we study a set of selected systems that, upon applying an ISR, reduce to an energy-dependent Haldane model. In doing so, we uncover the mechanisms behind the formation of gaps by breaking latent symmetries. Specifically, we see that a latent Semenoff mass is generated whenever the parameters of the model destroy a latent inversion symmetry. These gaps appear at energies that can be predicted based on the latent Haldane model. Furthermore, when TR symmetry is broken by introducing complex nearest-neighbor hoppings, it is also possible to find topological phases at fillings dictated by specific energy conditions, and directly construct topological phase diagrams from the latent Haldane model. This is in contrast to the usual Haldane model, in which the topological phase is induced by next-nearest-neighbor hopping. As an example, we applied this idea to a modified version of \alpha-graphyne [29, 30] and a decorated hexagonal plaquette. We predicted the gap-closing energies and critical parameter values using the ISR. We emphasize that these features are not model-specific but hold for a family of models that can be constructed from the simple building blocks that we thoroughly study in this paper. This article is structured as follows: in Section II, for pedagogical reasons, we introduce the Haldane model and recall its most essential features, such as its topological phases and the associated edge states in a ribbon geometry. We explain how the phase diagram can be constructed using a low-energy approximation near the gap-closing point and introduce the terminology used in the rest of the manuscript. This is followed by an explanation of the ISR in Section III.1 and an application to \alpha-graphyne in Section III.2. We calculate the gap-closing energies and introduce the ingredients necessary to generate topological phases. Then, we present the first system in which a latent Semenoff mass is generated from a decorated lattice in Section III.3. It provides the realization of a gap-opening mechanism that takes the form of a Semenoff mass, without a staggered on-site potential. We also introduce complex long-range hoppings that yield topological phases and construct a topological phase diagram. In Section III.4, we consider a system that now generates a latent Haldane mass from complex nearest-neighbor hoppings. When combined with the decorated lattice generating a latent Semenoff mass, this yields a variety of topological phases, for which we determine the phase diagram for the fillings that admit them. Finally, in Section V, we summarize our findings and discuss potential future directions of study."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08102v1,Magnetic-field suppression of tomographic electron transport,"Degenerate two-dimensional electron liquids are theoretically established to possess two vastly distinct collisional electron mean free paths, where even-parity deformations of the Fermi surface are hydrodynamic with a short collisional mean free path but odd-parity deformations remain near ballistic (known as the “tomographic” transport regime). Predicted signatures of this regime rely on the scaling of observables with temperature or device dimension, both of which are difficult to establish with certainty. Here, we consider magnetotransport in a minimal model of tomographic electrons and show that even a small magnetic field suppresses tomographic transport signatures and thus acts as a sensitive and unique probe of this regime. Fundamentally, the magnetic field breaks time-reversal invariance, which is a prerequisite for the odd-even parity effect in the collisional relaxation. We analyze in detail the scaling of the transverse conductivity, which has been linked to small-channel conductance of interaction-dominated electrons, and show that a tomographic scaling regime at intermediate wavenumbers is quickly suppressed with magnetic field to a hydrodynamic or collisionless form. We confirm that the suppression occurs at relatively small magnetic fields when the cyclotron radius is comparable to the ballistic mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode. This occurs at a much smaller magnetic field than the magnetic field strength required to suppress hydrodynamic electron transport, which suggests an experimental protocol to extract the odd-parity mean free path.","Recent advances in the fabrication of ultraclean materials allow to probe interaction-dominated electron transport, for which the electron mean free path due to binary collisions is smaller than the device dimension or the phonon or impurity mean free path [1]. This leads to collective hydrodynamic electron flow with a characteristic scale set by the electron shear viscosity. Hydrodynamics transport is expected to be the generic mode of transport in clean materials, and signatures of hydrodynamic electrons have by now been reported in a wide variety of (predominately two-dimensional) materials like mono-[2, 3] and bilayer graphene [4, 5], (Al,Ga)As [6, 7, 8], WTe2 [9, 10], WP2 [11], PdCoO2 [12], MoP [13], and NbP [14]. Since by Fermi liquid theory, electron interactions are phase-space suppressed at low temperature, the hydrodynamic regime is expected to span an intermediate temperature range where temperatures are large enough that electron interactions dominate over impurity scattering yet high-temperature relaxation due to phonon scattering is not yet prevalent. In this context, it has been suggested that the Pauli principle imposes very different phase space restrictions on electron relaxation depending on the parity of the Fermi surface perturbation [15], which leads to the emergence of not one but two vastly different electronic mean free paths: First, even-parity deformations of the Fermi distribution, which are described by a momentum-parity symmetrized distribution f_{e}({\bf k})=[f({\bf k})+f(-{\bf k})]/2, relax with a short mean free path that at low temperatures increases as an inverse square of temperature \ell_{e}\sim v_{F}T_{F}/T^{2} (where v_{F} is the Fermi velocity and T_{F} the Fermi temperature) [16, 17, 18]. Second, by strong contrast, odd-parity deformations, described by the anti-symmetrized distribution f_{o}({\bf k})=[f({\bf k})-f(-{\bf k})]/2, have a much larger anomalously increased ballistic mean free path, \ell_{o}\gg\ell_{e}. Indeed, for a simple circular Fermi surface (applicable to, for example, GaAs or doped graphene), more recent studies predict an asymptotic low-temperature scaling of \ell_{o}\sim v_{F}T_{F}^{3}/(m^{4}T^{4}), which is significantly increased at low temperatures, with an additional dependence on an angular-momentum index m that labels different odd-parity modes [19, 20, 21, 22]. This odd-even effect in the quasiparticle relaxation is surprisingly robust and predicted to exist up to temperatures T\lesssim 0.1T_{F} with a finite number of {\it O}(\sqrt{T_{F}/T}) decoupled odd-parity modes [19, 20, 21, 22]. Quite generally, the odd-even effect will be present for any system with a parity-even Fermi surface, for which deformations can be classified into even-parity and odd-parity modes. Fundamentally, the symmetry that guarantees this is time-reversal invariance, which implies a parity-even electron dispersion, \varepsilon({\bf k})=\varepsilon(-{\bf k}) [23]. Electron flows exhibiting the odd-even effect have been dubbed “tomographic” to distinguish this new regime from hydrodynamic and ballistic flows. Recent predictions for phenomena exhibited by these flows include anomalous fractional scaling of a narrow channel’s conductivity with its width [24], distinct bulk collective modes [25], and an enhanced nonlinear response [26]. Indeed, two recent experiments report signatures that could be attributable to tomographic flow: First, the observed Hall field profile in a narrow channel is seen to have a slightly larger curvature compared to the strict hydrodynamic Poiseuille profile [27], an observation that appears not fully explained so far but is speculated to be due to odd-parity modes in Ref. [27]. Second, the viscosity as extracted from a hydrodynamic modeling of electron flow in a Corbino geometry shows an anomalous inverse linear-in-temperature scaling at low temperatures [28]. This result is unanticipated since the hydrodynamic shear viscosity involves a microscopic even-parity deformation with a relaxation time that (according to Fermi liquid theory) increases with the inverse square of the temperature [29, 30]. Quite generally, a challenge in detecting existing predictions for tomographic phenomena is that establishing an anomalous scaling with device dimensions requires the fabrication (and theoretical modeling) of different samples, and an anomalous temperature scaling must be distinguished from other relaxation due to phonons and impurities. It would therefore be desirable to have an in-situ method to suppress tomographic effects without changing samples or parameter values. This would discriminate tomographic effects from other non-hydrodynamic phenomena. In this paper, we include magnetic field effects on tomographic transport and demonstrate that due to the breaking of time-reversal invariance, tomographic transport signatures are rapidly suppressed with increasing magnetic fields (illustrated in Fig. 1 below). This implies that if anomalous transport observations are indeed due to tomographic flow, then a hallmark signature would be a rapid suppression of such signatures with magnetic fields to a more conventional hydrodynamic or collisionless form (with a subsequent suppression to standard Ohmic transport at even larger fields). Here, we focus in our analysis on the transverse static conductivity, which is linked to the the shear viscosity and which addresses the recent experiment [28], but the general effect of a magnetic-field induced suppression of tomographic transport should hold more broadly [15]. In general, the magnetic field competes with all possible relaxation processes. Specifically, based only on quasiclassical arguments one can argue that as soon as the cyclotron radius r_{c}=m^{*}v_{F}/eB (here m^{*} is the effective electron mass and e>0 the magnitude of the electron charge) becomes smaller than a mean free path scale of interest \ell, the corresponding relaxation-related effects must be suppressed. The characteristic magnetic field scale is thus B_{\star}\simeq m^{*}v_{F}/e\ell. Introducing the cyclotron frequency \omega_{c}=eB/m^{*}, we find that relaxation channel of interest is suppressed after the cyclotron frequency reaches a corresponding relaxation inverse time scale, i.e., the decay rate v_{F}/\ell. In clean Fermi liquids \ell_{min}\sim\ell_{e} and therefore all electronic relaxation effects should be suppressed for B_{\star}\simeq m^{*}v_{F}/e\ell_{e}, an effect that is elegantly utilized by Zeng et al. [28] to disentangle Ohmic and electron hydrodynamic transport contributions. We will argue in this paper that the characteristic magnetic field which impedes the tomographic regime is much smaller than that and is proportional to the inverse mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode at the corresponding wave number. The focus of this study is to establish and illustrate the principles behind the magnetic-field induced suppression of tomographic effects. We therefore adopt a minimal model of tomographic electrons that allows to make semi-analytical calculations. In this model, we assume rigid deviations of the Fermi surface (as opposed to a temperature or interaction-induced broadening of the Fermi edge) and parameterize deformations of the quasiparticle distribution from local equilibrium as \displaystyle\delta f({\bf r},{\bf p}) \displaystyle=e^{i{\bf k}\cdot{\bf r}}\biggl{(}-\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial% \varepsilon}\biggr{)}h(\theta), (1) where {\bf k} is the wave vector of the perturbation (we assume static perturbations in the following), and we separate a nonanalytical factor involving the derivative of the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution f_{0}. In this way, by the chain rule, h(\theta) can be thought of a rigid deformation of the chemical potential that depends on the angle \theta of the momentum vector under the Fermi surface (see, for example, Fig. 2 below for illustrations). This function can be expanded in angular harmonics, \displaystyle h(\theta) \displaystyle=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}e^{im\theta}h_{m} (2) with angular momentum index m. The even- and odd-parity components of the distribution function discussed above are then composed of even and odd m, respectively. For a circular Fermi surface, binary collisions will not change the angular momentum index, such that collisions can be treated in a generalized relaxation-time approximation with individual decay rates \gamma_{m}\sim v_{F}/\ell_{m} that are inversely proportional to the mean free path \ell_{m} of the mode. Here, the first modes m=0,\pm 1 (the “hydrodynamic” modes) describe a compression and a rigid center-of-mass shift of the Fermi surface, respectively, with infinite lifetime since they are linked to conserved quantities (binary collision do not change particle number or total momentum), i.e., \gamma_{0}=\gamma_{\pm 1}=0. Moreover, we will assume that all remaining even-parity modes follow standard Fermi-liquid scaling, \gamma_{m\,{\rm even}}=\gamma, with no pronounced m-dependence. For odd-parity modes, we will adopt here a Matthiessen rule (with \gamma^{\prime}\ll\gamma) \displaystyle\gamma_{m\,{\rm odd}}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\gamma}+\frac{1}{\gamma^{% \prime}m^{4}}} (3) that interpolates between the relaxation rate of the lowest m modes with anomalously long mean free path and m-independent scaling for large m. The form (3) is an accurate description of the lowest odd eigenvalues at low temperatures and is in good agreement with exact diagonalization studies of the Fermi liquid collision integral [21, 22]. Note that elastic impurity scattering (with scattering rate \gamma_{i}) will contribute to all angular modes except for m=0 [25]. The advantage of the parameterisation (1) is that the kinetic Fermi liquid equation takes an effective tight-binding form (omitting the Landau parameters here), \displaystyle\bigl{(}\gamma_{m}-im\omega_{c}\bigr{)}\ h_{m}+i\frac{v_{F}k}{2}(% h_{m+1}+h_{m-1}) \displaystyle\quad=\frac{v_{F}eE}{2}\bigl{(}e^{i\theta_{E}}\delta_{m,1}+e^{-i% \theta_{E}}\delta_{m,-1}\bigr{)}, (4) where we include an external electric field {\bf E} that forms an angle \theta_{E} with the wave vector {\bf k} [see App. A for a derivation of the kinetic equation in a magnetic field and App. B for a derivation of the tight-binding representation (4)]. The left-hand side of Eq. (3) is reminiscent of a one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian with lattice sites labeled by m, where the term v_{F}k/2 fixes the amplitude of nearest-neighbour hopping, the magnetic field corresponds to an effective constant electric field, and \gamma_{m} is a non-Hermitian on-site decay term. For the tight-binding representation (4), very efficient exact numerical solution algorithms exist to solve for the vector \{h_{m}\} that do not rely on a slowly convergent matrix inversion of Eq. (4) with finite cutoff [25, 31]. This paper is structured as follows: In the next Sec. II, we summarize the main results of our analysis and discuss the magnetic field dependence of the transverse conductivity. The following Sec. III presents a detailed discussion of the minimal kinetic model for odd-mode transport outlined above and describes the crossover between the hydrodynamic, tomographic, and collisionless regimes. We conclude the paper with a summary and outlook in Sec. IV. Basics of Fermi liquid theory in a magnetic field, details of the evaluation of the kinetic equation at large momenta, as well as a link between a derivative expansion and Hilbert expansions used in hydrodynamics are relegated to five appendices."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08880v1,Fractional Chern mosaic in supermoiré graphene,"We propose the realization of a fractional Chern mosaic: a state characterized by a spatially varying topological order. This state is enabled by a separation of length scales that emerges when three graphene sheets are sequentially rotated by a small twist angle. The resulting structure features not only conventional moiré lattices, but also a much larger supermoiré lattice. We demonstrate that a fractional Chern mosaic arises when electron correlations induce fractionalization locally on the moiré scale, while the pattern of fractionalization varies at the supermoiré scale.","The importance of length scales in physics is exemplified in the rise of two-dimensional moiré materials. Twist engineered moiré lattices on the nanometer scale provide an ideal platform for experimentally realizing a remarkable variety of quantum phenomena [1, 2, 3, 4], from superconductivity [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] to fractional Chern insulators [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. This rich physics is enabled by a separation of length scales between the atomic and moiré lattices. At experimentally relevant scales, the physics is governed by that of the moiré lattice, which behaves as a new artificial crystal. The interplay of length scales is at the forefront in an emerging class of moiré materials with multiple incommensurate moiré lattices. Prominent examples are various multilayer graphene-hBN heterostructures [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] and twisted trilayer graphene at small, generic, twist angles [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53]. The presence of two incommensurate moiré lattices introduces an additional large supermoiré (or “moiré-of-moiré”) length scale, which can be parametrically larger than the moiré lattices. This new supermoiré scale leads to another separation of length and energy scales, opening the door to especially intriguing correlated electronic states. One especially striking example is the Chern mosaic [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. In this state, electrons form Chern insulators at the moiré scale, but the Chern number varies across the supermoiré scale. The result is a mosaic of Chern insulators embedded in a network of topological domain walls. Here, we consider an even more exotic possibility: a “fractional Chern mosaic”, where electrons spontaneously fractionalize within local regions of fractional Chern insulators (FCI) [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], but with the pattern of fractionalization varying at the supermoiré scale. Such a fractional Chern mosaic would represent a novel class of quantum states characterized by a spatially varying topological order. We propose the realization of a fractional Chern mosaic. Specifically, we focus on helical trilayer graphene (HTG), a prototypical supermoiré material consisting of three graphene sheets sequentially rotated by a small twist angle \theta, i.e. in the configuration (\theta_{1},\theta_{2},\theta_{3})=(\theta,0,-\theta). In HTG, adjacent layer pairs produce moiré lattices with periods a_{m}\approx a_{0}/\theta, which combine to form a large supermoiré lattice with period a_{sm}\approx a_{0}/\theta^{2}, where a_{0}=0.246nm is the graphene lattice constant. This supermoiré lattice, on the scale of a few hundred nanometers, was recently imaged with a scanning single-electron transistor (SET) [67]. Lattice relaxation creates large triangular moiré-periodic domains, referred to as h-HTG and \overline{\mathrm{h}}-HTG, as illustrated in Fig. 1 [36, 37]. Due to the separation of lengthscales a_{sm}\gg a_{m}, it suffices to model the system as locally periodic within each domain. Within these periodic domains, the local moiré band structure gives rise to topological flat bands with valley-contrasting Chern number and opposing topology in adjacent domains [36, 37, 38]. Flat band ferromagnetism then leads to spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking, as observed near a magic angle \theta\approx 1.8^{\circ} [51]. The combined presence of broken time-reversal symmetry, flat Chern bands, and supermoiré periodicity sets the stage for the fractional Chern mosaic. The task is to establish whether electrons within each domain can fractionalize. To achieve this, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the correlated physics at partial filling of the flat Chern bands. We begin by characterizing an additional momentum-dependent tunneling (MDT) term in the Hamiltonian, which originates from the decay of the interlayer tunneling amplitude as a function of the in-plane distance between the atomic p_{z} orbitals [68]. We find that accounting for MDT not only explains the particle-hole asymmetry observed in transport [51] but, crucially, stabilizes an FCI at filling factor \nu=3+1/3. The predicted state, illustrated in Fig. 1a, features electron fractionalization into charge e/3 quasiparticles in a spatially varying way due to the opposing band topology in the h-HTG and \overline{\mathrm{h}}-HTG domains, and can be experimentally unveiled by local scanning probes. Figure 1: a) Helical trilayer (HTG) relaxes on the supermoiré scale a_{sm} into h-HTG and \bar{\text{h}}-HTG domains that are locally moiré-periodic, and separated by gapless domain walls (grey). Fractionalization within the domains generates a fractional Chern mosaic. b) Band structure in valley K of the h-HTG domain in the absence of momentum-dependent tunneling (MDT). The central two bands are colored according to Chern-sublattice polarization \tilde{\sigma}_{z}(\bm{k}), where red (blue) indicates polarization onto the A (B) sublattice. Right line trace plots the density of states. c) Same as b) except in the presence of MDT. Non-interacting model—Our starting point is a generalized Bistritzer-MacDonald [69] continuum model description of the local band structure within each h-HTG (or \bar{\text{h}}-HTG) domain [36]. The K valley of h-HTG is described by H_{K}=\begin{bmatrix}-iv\bm{\sigma}\cdot\nabla&T(\bm{r}-\bm{d}_{t})&0\\ T^{\dagger}(\bm{r}-\bm{d}_{t})&-iv\bm{\sigma}\cdot\nabla&T(\bm{r}-\bm{d}_{b})% \\ 0&T^{\dagger}(\bm{r}-\bm{d}_{b})&-iv\bm{\sigma}\cdot\nabla\end{bmatrix} (1) where \bm{\sigma}=(\sigma_{x},\sigma_{y}) acts on the microscopic sublattice, and v=8.8\times 10^{5}\,\text{ms}^{-1}. In the absence of MDT, the interlayer tunneling is \begin{gathered}T(\bm{r})=\begin{bmatrix}w_{AA}t_{0}(\bm{r})&w_{AB}t_{-1}(\bm{% r})\\ w_{AB}t_{1}(\bm{r})&w_{AA}t_{0}(\bm{r})\end{bmatrix}\\ t_{\alpha}(\bm{r})=\sum_{n=0}^{2}e^{\frac{2\pi i}{3}n\alpha}e^{i\bm{q}_{n}% \cdot\bm{r}}\\ q_{n,x}+iq_{n,y}=-ik_{\theta}e^{\frac{2\pi i}{3}n},\end{gathered} (2) where k_{\theta}=2K_{D}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}, with K_{D}=\frac{4\pi}{3a_{0}} the Dirac wavevector, and we fix (w_{AA},w_{AB})=(75\,\text{meV},110\,\text{meV}). Within the h-HTG domain, the relative interlayer moiré shift is \bm{d}_{t}-\bm{d}_{b}=\frac{1}{3}(\bm{a}_{2}-\bm{a}_{1}), where \bm{a}_{1,2}=\frac{4\pi}{3k_{\theta}}(\pm\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\frac{1}{2}) are the basis moiré vectors. We focus only on the physics within an h-HTG domain, as the \bar{\text{h}}-HTG domains are related by \hat{C}_{2z} symmetry. Eq. 1 and 2 obey an exact particle-hole-inversion symmetry111This is only weakly broken when introducing the small twists in the Pauli terms. (PHS) that is strongly broken in experiment [51], where correlated states appear only for electron doping. This symmetry is broken by considering the finite range of interlayer hopping, which generates MDT. This is incorporated to leading order by making the replacement t_{\alpha}(\bm{r})\rightarrow\sum_{n=0}^{2}e^{\frac{2\pi i}{3}n\alpha}e^{i\bm{% q}_{n}\cdot\bm{r}}(1+\lambda_{\mathrm{MDT}}\hat{\bm{q}}_{n,\perp}\cdot\vec{% \nabla}), (3) where \hat{\bm{q}}_{n,\perp}=\left[\cos(\frac{2\pi}{3}n),\sin(\frac{2\pi}{3}n)\right] is a unit vector perpendicular to \bm{q}_{n}. We take a realistic \lambda_{\text{MDT}}\approx-2.3\,Å, as derived in App. A. Fig. 1b,c shows the non-interacting band structure of \theta=1.8^{\circ} h-HTG within a single spin-valley sector. Regardless of MDT, we obtain a pair of narrow bands separated by large gaps \gtrsim 80\,meV to higher remote bands that are not shown. The non-trivial topology is unveiled by diagonalizing the sublattice operator \sigma_{z} projected to the central bands [70, 71, 72]. This yields the so-called Chern basis indexed by a ‘Chern-sublattice’ label \tilde{\sigma}=A,B according to the dominant sublattice polarization222\tilde{\sigma} refers to the Chern basis, while \sigma indexes the microscopic sublattice. They become equivalent in the chiral limit. We will often use the terms Chern and sublattice interchangably.. Within valley K, these bands have Chern numbers C_{K,A}=1,\quad C_{K,B}=-2, (4) and the corresponding values for valley \bar{K} and the \bar{\text{h}}-HTG domain can be obtained by time-reversal and \hat{C}_{2z}. The blue and red colors indicate the expectation value of \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle\equiv\langle P_{A}\rangle-\langle P_{B}\rangle, where P_{\tilde{\sigma}} is the projector onto the \tilde{\sigma} band. In the absence of MDT (Fig. 1b), the central bands obey PHS as reflected in the density of states. Band eigenstates with predominantly B character (\langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle\approx-1) are more dispersive than those with A character, but both have the same energy when averaged over the mBZ. To make this concrete, we can rotate to the Chern basis and switch off the off-diagonal hybridization to define the dispersions E_{\tilde{\sigma}_{z}}(\bm{k}) (see App. B). At \theta=1.8^{\circ}, we find that E_{A}(\bm{k}) and E_{B}(\bm{k}) have zero average, but bandwidths 7.2\,meV and 30.4\,meV respectively. In contrast, introduction of MDT (Fig. 1c) lowers the energy of the B basis relative to the A basis. At \theta=1.8^{\circ}, E_{A}(\bm{k}) has a mean energy of 1.0\,meV and is bounded by -2.9\,meV and 4.2\,meV, while E_{B}(\bm{k}) has a mean energy of -6.4\,meV and is bounded by -22.4\,meV and 9.4\,meV. This strongly breaks the PHS, as evidenced by the substantial asymmetry of the density of states. These details will become important soon when considering correlated states. Interactions—We consider gate-screened Coulomb interactions V(q)=\frac{e^{2}}{2\epsilon_{0}\epsilon_{r}q}\tanh qd_{\text{sc}}, where the gate distance is d_{\text{sc}}=25\,\text{nm} and the relative permittivity \epsilon_{r}\simeq 8-15 is left as a tuning parameter. The large single-particle remote gaps permit projection onto the two central bands per spin and valley H_{\text{int}}=\frac{1}{2A}\sum_{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}V({{\boldsymbol{q}}})% \delta\hat{\rho}_{{\boldsymbol{q}}}\delta\hat{\rho}_{-{{\boldsymbol{q}}}} (5) where A is the system area, and \delta\hat{\rho}_{{\boldsymbol{q}}}=\hat{\rho}_{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}-4\overline% {\rho}_{{\boldsymbol{q}}} is the projected density operator measured relative to the mean density \overline{\rho}_{{\boldsymbol{q}}} of the central bands (this is the so-called ‘average’ interaction scheme) [52]. H_{\text{int}} satisfies a U(2)_{K}\times U(2)_{\bar{K}} flavor symmetry, which includes charge-U(1)_{c} and valley-U(1)_{v} conservation, and valley-dependent SU(2)_{s} spin-rotations. Figure 2: a) HF phase diagram as a function of twist angle \theta and relative permittivity \epsilon_{r} at \nu=+3 (top) and \nu=-3 (bottom). White shaded regions indicate gapless states. \Lambda, defined in the main text, is a measure of how far the HF solution is from an idealized strong-coupling state. TSB indicates various states that break moiré translation symmetry. System size is 12\times 12, and we allow for spontaneous doubling or tripling of the moiré unit cell along both directions. b) HF band structure of the \nu=+3 Chern insulator. The bands are colored according to their Chern-sublattice polarization. Dots (crosses) denote spin up (down). System size is 24\times 24. c) Schematic of Chern-sublattice transitions induced by the sublattice asymmetry in the effective dispersion. d) HF calculations of Chern-sublattice polarization \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle for fillings 3\leq\nu\leq 4. \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle is defined as the difference of the occupation numbers of the A and B Chern-sublattice bands per moiré unit cell. We enforce moiré translation symmetry and valley U_{v}(1) symmetry. Calculations are performed with MDT unless otherwise indicated. System size is 18\times 18. Hartree-Fock phase diagram— We first consider the physics at integer fillings within Hartree-Fock (HF) theory. In the absence of MDT, Ref. [52] identified a hierarchy of so-called “strong-coupling” insulators at integer fillings \nu. These phases can be understood by fully polarizing into \nu+4 of the eight total Chern bands indexed by spin s\in\{\uparrow,\downarrow\}, valley \tau\in\{K,K^{\prime}\}, and Chern-sublattice \tilde{\sigma}_{z}\in\{A,B\}, with the associated Chern number following from Eq. 4. The phase diagram in Ref. [52] was identical under \nu\leftrightarrow-\nu due to PHS. In contrast, MDT leads to qualitatively different behaviors at negative and positive integer fillings in our HF calculations (Fig. 2a). We diagnose the strong-coupling nature by the deviation from full (\tau,s,\tilde{\sigma})-polarization \Lambda\equiv\text{max}_{\tau,s,\tilde{\sigma}}\Big{[}\text{min}\big{(}\langle n% _{\tau,s,\tilde{\sigma}}\rangle,1-\langle n_{\tau,s,\tilde{\sigma}}\rangle\big% {)}\Big{]}, (6) where \langle n_{\tau,s,\tilde{\sigma}}\rangle is the mBZ-averaged occupation number for the Chern band \tilde{\sigma} in valley \tau and spin s. \Lambda vanishes for an idealized strong-coupling insulator, while it can take values as large as 0.5 for generic states. For \nu=+3, we find a strong-coupling |C|=1 insulator for a range of \theta, including for very weak interactions \epsilon_{r}\gtrsim 25. On the other hand for \nu=-3, the strong-coupling phase only exists for for relatively strong interactions \epsilon_{r}\lesssim 9. Lowering the interaction strength leads to gapless states, or various gapped phases with intervalley coherence and translation symmetry-breaking [52, 73]. Analogous results hold for other integer fillings (Fig. S4), demonstrating that MDT can explain the pronounced particle-hole asymmetry observed in transport [51]. Fig. 2b shows the HF band structure of the |C|=1 insulator at \nu=+3. The state is fully spin-valley polarized within the flat-band manifold, and the strong-coupling nature is evidenced by the near total \tilde{\sigma}_{z} polarization of the conduction band. In the partially-filled flavor, the system occupies the B band (blue) with lower mean kinetic energy, leaving a narrow unfilled A band (red) with |C|=1. Sublattice transitions—At \nu=3, the unfilled conduction band is a narrow |C|=1 band of predominantly \tilde{\sigma}=A character, with favorable quantum geometry (Fig. S5) for hosting FCIs when fractionally occupied. For this to occur, it is crucial that the notion of an isolated conduction A band remains valid at higher fractional fillings like \nu=3+\frac{1}{3}. To this end, we discover a cascade of sublattice transitions (Fig. 2c,d), whose mechanism relies on two key ingredients: (i) sublattice ferromagnetism induced by the dominant Coulomb interactions, and (ii) the lower average but higher peak kinetic energy of the B band compared to the A band. In the following, we discuss the cascade for the filling range 3\leq\nu\leq 4 assuming full flavor polarization (i.e. flat bands in three of four spin-valley flavors are fully filled). Exactly at \nu=3, occupying either Chern band of the remaining flavor yields a valid exchange-driven strong-coupling insulator, but the system chooses to form the |C|=1 insulator and fill the B band due to its lower average kinetic energy, yielding a \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle\approx-1 state. As electrons are doped into the system, they naturally populate the empty A band (Fig. 2c, top), which gradually degrades the initial negative sublattice polarization -1<\langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle<0. Eventually we reach a critical filling \nu_{c} where the system energetically prefers to instead fully occupy the A band and partially occupy the B band so that \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle>0 (Fig. 2c, bottom). The reason is that doing so allows the system to empty the parts of the B band that are kinetically costly, while respecting the tendency towards sublattice polarization. \nu_{c} is determined by the interplay between the relative energy gain from fully polarizing the B band over the A band, and the kinetic cost of occupying the high energy parts of the B band. The outcome is an abrupt sign change of the sublattice polarization at \nu_{c}. Fig. 2d tracks the self-consistent HF sublattice polarization. For all parameters, \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle starts off near -1 and increases linearly with a gradient close to 1 as the empty A band is progressively occupied. With MDT, we find a strongly first-order sublattice jump at which \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle changes sign. Crucially, the transition filling \nu_{c}\approx 3.5 is greater than 3+\frac{1}{3} for realistic parameters. The enhanced dispersion of the B band means that the Fermi surfaces for \nu>\nu_{c} are often flavor-degenerate, but the phase for \nu<\nu_{c} is always fully flavor polarized. These findings are consistent with the experimental observation of AHE persisting to \nu\approx 3.5 [51]. \nu_{c} is lowered when increasing \epsilon_{r}. If MDT is neglected (dotted lines), the sublattice transition occurs almost immediately upon electron doping \nu=+3. The reason is that without MDT, the average kinetic energies of the A and B bands are identical (Fig. 2a), and only the sublattice exchange anisotropy of \lesssim 0.5\,meV favors occupying the B band at \nu=+3 [52]. This tiny splitting is easily swamped at small \nu_{c} by the kinetically-driven mechanism explained above, underscoring the importance of MDT in faithfully capturing the sublattice physics. Similar sublattice transitions occur between every non-negative integer filling, but none occur for \nu<0, where there is significantly less symmetry-breaking (Fig. S7). Figure 3: a) 1-band ED calculation on the 5\times 6 cluster at \nu=3+1/3. Bottom row shows the momentum-resolved many-body spectrum for \epsilon_{r}=8 and 15. Top row shows the corresponding evolutions of the three quasi-degenerate ground states under flux threading \Phi. b) 2-band ED calculation of the Chern-sublattice polarization as a function of filling. Different symbols (see legend) refer to various lattice geometries with corresponding system sizes N=12,15,16. N_{\tilde{\sigma}} is the expectation value of the particle occupation in the Chern-sublattice basis. Red (blue) corresponds to the A (B) basis. The vertical line indicates \nu=3+1/3. All calculations are performed at \theta=1.8^{\circ} and with MDT. Exact diagonalization—We use exact diagonalization (ED) to investigate whether FCIs can be stabilized at fractional fillings. Since full calculations in the eight central bands are expensive, it is necessary to truncate the ‘active’ part of the many-body Hilbert space. In Fig. 3a, we first present 1-band ED results at \nu=3+\frac{1}{3}, where the active subspace is restricted to the |C|=1 conduction band of the \nu=+3 HF insulator. In other words, we constrain the other seven HF bands to be fully occupied333We therefore include the Hartree and Fock potentials from these non-active bands., and work at 1/3 filling of the remaining Chern band which is spin-valley polarized and of predominantly \tilde{\sigma}=A character (see Fig. 2b). We obtain an FCI for \epsilon_{r}=8,15 on a system with N=30 unit cells, as evident from the three-fold quasi-degenerate ground states with correct momenta that remain gapped under flux threading. In App. D, we show N=27 results that rule out charge density waves. Next, we perform ED calculations where we only constrain that three flavors are fully occupied, leading to the restriction 2\leq\nu\leq 4. We emphasize that this effective 2-band calculation is exact within the maximally spin-valley-polarized symmetry sector of the eight central bands. From the HF results, we anticipate that the ground state indeed lies in this flavor sector from \nu=+3 up to at least the sublattice transition at \nu_{c} (see App. C.4). Importantly, this 2-band calculation faithfully captures the interplay between the \tilde{\sigma}=A,B bands. Fig. 3b plots the Chern-sublattice densities \langle n_{A}\rangle and \langle n_{B}\rangle in the 2-band calculation as a function of \nu. Owing to the increased computational difficulty, we collate results for several system sizes. Consistent with the HF analysis, the \nu=+3 ground state is strongly polarized into the B band and is essentially a gapped single Slater determinant (see App. D). Upon electron-doping for \epsilon_{r}=8, the B band maintains a large occupancy >90\% such that the additional carriers primarily populate the A band. Crucially, this picture still holds at \nu=3+\frac{1}{3} across multiple lattice geometries, lending credence to the 1-band ED. The theory of sublattice transitions is corroborated by the abrupt jump at \nu_{c}\approx 3.5. For \epsilon_{r}=15, the B band depopulates more appreciably for certain system sizes when adding electrons to the \nu=+3 insulator, though we still find kinks in the sublattice occupations around \nu_{c}\approx 3.5. We note that direct signatures of FCIs in our multi-band calculations are present but not fully robust (see App. D.4), likely due to finite-size effects since the largest size444The Hilbert space dimension per momentum at N=18,21 is approximately 7\times 10^{7} and 3\times 10^{9} respectively. for which we have 2-band data at \nu=3+\frac{1}{3} is smaller than the threshold N beyond which 1-band ED robustly yields FCIs. Fractional Chern mosaics — Having found evidence for FCIs within the h-HTG domains, we now zoom out and re-examine the structure of HTG at \nu=3+1/3 as a whole. In the h-HTG domain, electrons within the A band of a particular spin-valley (\tau,s) flavor fractionalizes. The resulting state has a local Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy}=-\frac{2}{3}\tau_{z}\frac{e^{2}}{h} where \tau_{z}=1 (for K) or -1 (for K^{\prime}). The fractional Hall conductivity can be decomposed as -\frac{2}{3}=-1+\frac{1}{3}, where -1 arises from the Chern insulator at \nu=3, and 1/3 from the FCI. Since the local physics in the \bar{\text{h}}-HTG domain is related by \hat{C}_{2z}, the corresponding FCI there will arise from a partially filled B band with local \sigma_{xy}=\frac{2}{3}\tau_{z}\frac{e^{2}}{h}. Since the spin-valley polarization is determined spontaneously, there are multiple qualitatively distinct fractional Chern mosaics that may occur. Which of these scenarios is favored will likely depend on fine details of the domain wall energetics [58, 52]. Consider the case where the valley polarizations in the h-HTG and \bar{\text{h}}-HTG domains are identical. In this case, a mosaic of local \sigma_{xy}=\pm\frac{2}{3}\frac{e^{2}}{h} domains is formed. The domain walls necessarily host fractionally charged topological chiral edge modes. In both types of domains, electrons fractionalize into charge e/3 quasiparticles as is known for the 1/3 Laughlin state. However, the anyonic exchange phase e^{\pm i\frac{\pi}{3}} will be opposite for quasiparticles in the two types of domains. The result is a novel state in which fractionally charged quasiparticles exhibit spatially varying anyonic statistics. Another possibility is that the valley polarizations will be opposite in the two domains. This configuration will be favored by a small external magnetic field. For concreteness, suppose that the FCI arises in the K valley for h-HTG, and in the K^{\prime} valley for \bar{\text{h}}-HTG. In this case, while both domains have local \sigma_{xy}=-\frac{2}{3}\frac{e^{2}}{h}, we consider this state a fractional Chern mosaic since the fractionally charged e/3 quasiparticles carry opposite valley quantum numbers in the two domains. Discussion—Our results have important implications for recent and future experiments. The transport study of Ref. [51] observed correlated features only for positive fillings in multiple magic-angle (\theta\approx 1.7^{\circ}-1.8^{\circ}) HTG devices, consistent with our HF calculations in the presence of MDT. The anomalous Hall effect and density-tuned hysteresis observed near 3\lesssim\nu\lesssim 3.5 are consistent with the sublattice transition identified here via the kinetic mechanism at \nu_{c}\approx 3.5. Combined with the recent observation of supermoiré domains in (non magic-angle) HTG by Ref. [67], our analysis implies that a fractional Chern mosaic can be realized at \nu=3+1/3, but is not likely visible in transport [51] due to the network of conducting domain walls and sample inhomogeneity. Local probes are ideal for resolving the real-space mosaic and detecting the local topological state. Scanning single-electron transistors (SET) [74, 75, 76, 67] can identify the state as an incompressible feature that disperses with perpendicular magnetic field B according to the Streda formula. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) [77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84] would further be able to directly image the cascade of sublattice transitions predicted in this work. We also note that the global \hat{C}_{2z} symmetry of pristine HTG implies that identical physics would be present in the h-HTG and \bar{\text{h}}-HTG domains, but alignment to the hBN substrate could introduce a sublattice splitting that favors fractionalization in only one type of domain. Finally, while we have mainly focused on \nu=3+\frac{1}{3}, FCIs may exist at other fillings, especially those which are compatible with the picture above. The simplest candidates are Jain states at \nu=3+\frac{k}{2k+1} for which \nu<\nu_{c}. The periodic resets in flavor and sublattice physics suggest that fractionalization could also occur around other integer fillings, a possibility which we leave for future theoretical studies. In summary, we have predicted the realization of a fractional Chern mosaic enabled by a combination of local topological flat bands and supermoiré periodicity. Our results present an opportunity to engineer and explore novel intricate quantum states with spatially varying topological order. Acknowledgements.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08457v1,Wave Topology of Stellar Inertial Oscillations,"Inertial waves in convective regions of stars exhibit topological properties linked to a Chern number of 1. The first of these is a unique, unidirectional, prograde oscillation mode within the cavity, which propagates at arbitrarily low frequencies for moderate azimuthal wavenumbers. The second one are phase singularities around which the phase winds in Fourier space, with winding numbers \nu=\pm 1 depending on the hemisphere. Phase winding is a collective effect over waves propagating in all directions that is strongly robust to noise. This suggests a topology-based method for wave detection in noisy observational data.","Helioseismology has shed unparalleled light on the Sun’s interior, and with it stellar interiors in general. While many acoustic modes with mHz frequencies have been identified and used to constrain the rotation and sound speed profiles [1], other waves are expected to bring complementary information to the surface. Solar internal gravity waves with 10^{2}\muHz frequencies would bring constraints on the solar core, but confirmation of their observation is still missing [2]. In recent years, a third kind of waves has attracted a great deal of attention. Inertial waves propagate owing to solar rotation with 10^{2}nHz frequencies, and are sensitive to the entropy gradient in the convective zone, a quantity to which acoustic modes are essentially insensitive [3]. These waves control the differential rotation of the convective zone and cause it to depart from the Taylor-Proudman columnar structure [4]. Rossby waves [5, 6, 7] and inertial waves of higher frequencies [8, 9] have unequivocally been observed at the solar surface. Inertial modes of convective cores of \gamma Doradus stars have also been observed [10], as well as Rossby waves [11, 12, 13]. Inertial waves are thus an important channel of modern stellar seismology, which motivates further characterization of their oscillation modes. In parallel, recent studies showed a connection between topology and geophysical and astrophysical waves, providing new insight on the properties of global modes [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. In this study, we show that stellar inertial waves possess topological properties, characterized by Chern numbers of \pm 1. This result gives a topological origin to a unidirectional inertial wave propagating eastward at arbitrarily low frequencies. It also explains the existence of a phase singularity of the polarization relations of the waves in Fourier space, to which is associated a winding of the phase of \pm 1. This property provides a novel way of identifying waves. We give a procedure to use this singularity as a signature of the wave and help future identification of seismic signals. Figure 1: Physical space and parameter space of solar inertial waves. Left: coordinates of the convective zone (yellow). Right: The Berry curvature of the upper inertial waveband is singular at the origin of the parameter space {k_{x}=k_{y}=f_{\mathrm{t}}=0}. Brightness indicates the norm of F_{+}."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08289v1,Breakdown of continuum elasticity due to electronic effects in gold nanotubes,"A recent experiment reports a creation of goldene, which is two-dimensional gold with hexagonal structure. By rolling up the goldene, gold nanotubes (GNT) should exist, but their structural and electronic properties are not understood well. Based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate a breakdown of inverse square law, wherein the curvature energy stored in a GNT decreases with the inverse square of the GNT radius. This is due to the enhanced curvature energy in specific GNTs having nearly flat bands around the Fermi level. We show that the electron states on the flat band of GNT reflect those on the Fermi surface of goldene by using the Bloch and geometric boundary conditions, and that in-plane character of the latter states enhances the curvature energy.","References (1) H.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08288v1,Microscopic Theory of Polariton Group Velocity Renormalization,"Cavity exciton-polaritons exhibit ballistic transport and can achieve a distance of 100 \mum in one picosecond. This ballistic transport significantly enhances mobility compared to that of bare excitons, which often move diffusively and become the bottleneck for energy conversion and transfer devices. Despite being robustly reproduced in experiments and simulations, there is no comprehensive microscopic theory addressing the group velocity of polariton transport, and its renormalization due to phonon scattering while still preserving this ballistic behavior. In this work, we develop such a microscopic theory to describe the group velocity renormalization using a finite-temperature Green’s function approach. Utilizing the generalized Holstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, we analytically derive an expression for the group velocity renormalization and find that it is caused by phonon-mediated transitions from the lower polariton states to the dark states. The theory predicts that the magnitude of group velocity renormalization scales linearly with the phonon bath reorganization energy under weak coupling conditions and also linearly depends on temperature in the high-temperature regime. These predictions are numerically verified using quantum dynamics simulations via the mean-field Ehrenfest method, demonstrating quantitative agreement. Our findings provide theoretical insights and a predictive analytical framework that advance the understanding and design of cavity-modified semiconductors and molecular ensembles, opening new avenues for engineered polaritonic devices.","Results and Discussions Model System. We use the Generalized Holstein-Tavis-Cummings (GHTC) Hamiltonian [22, 23, 24, 25] to describe N excitons interacting with \mathcal{M} cavity modes, and N\gg{\mathcal{M}} for typical experimental setups. Typically, one estimate N/\mathcal{M}\sim 10^{6}-10^{9} for system used in experiments [26]. The total Hamiltonian can be written in the form of system-bath model and is expressed as \hat{H}=\hat{H}_{\text{S}}+\hat{h}_{\text{B}}+\hat{H}_{\text{SB}}. The system Hamiltonian \hat{H}_{\mathrm{S}} consists of the excitonic degrees of freedom (DOF) and the photonic DOF of the cavity. Each exciton is modeled as an effective two-level system that consists of the ground state |g_{n}\rangle and excited state |e_{n}\rangle (for the n_{\mathrm{th}} exciton). Without making the long-wavelength approximation [25], \hat{H}_{\text{S}} is expressed as follows, \displaystyle\hat{H}_{\text{S}}= \displaystyle\hbar\omega_{0}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\hat{\sigma}_{n}^{\dagger}\hat{% \sigma}_{n}+\sum_{k}^{\mathcal{M}}\hbar\omega_{k}\hat{a}^{\dagger}_{k}\hat{a}_% {k} (1) \displaystyle+\sum_{k}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\hbar g_{k}\left[\hat{a}^{\dagger}_{k}\hat% {\sigma}_{n}e^{-i{k}_{\parallel}\cdot{x}_{n}}+\hat{\sigma}_{n}^{\dagger}\hat{a% }_{k}e^{i{k}_{\parallel}\cdot{x}_{n}}\right], where \hat{\sigma}_{n}^{\dagger}=|e_{n}\rangle\langle g_{n}| and \hat{\sigma}_{n}=|g_{n}\rangle\langle e_{n}| are the creation and annihilation operators of the n_{\mathrm{th}} molecule’s exciton, and \omega_{0} is the excitation energy between the molecule’s ground and excited state. Further, \hat{a}_{k} and \hat{a}_{k}^{\dagger} are the photonic field annihilation and creation operators for mode k whose frequency is \omega_{k}. For Fabry-Pérot (FP) cavities, the dispersion is \displaystyle\omega_{k}(k_{\parallel})=c\sqrt{k^{2}_{\perp}+k^{2}_{\parallel}}, (2) where c is the speed of light in vacuum. When k_{\parallel}=0, the photon frequency is \omega_{\mathrm{c}}\equiv\omega_{k}(k_{\parallel}=0)=ck_{\perp}. The second line of Eq. 1 represents light-matter interaction, where g_{k}=g_{\text{c}}\sqrt{(\omega_{k}/\omega_{\text{c}})}\cos\theta is the k-dependent light-matter coupling strength [4], and \tan\theta=k_{\parallel}/k_{\perp} is the incident angle. Further, x_{n} is the position of the n_{\mathrm{th}} exciton. We consider the cavity modes inside the same simulation box as the excitons, with total size NL along the k_{\parallel} direction (L=x_{n}-x_{n-1}). As such, k_{\parallel} has discrete (but quasi-continuous) values of k_{\parallel}=\frac{2\pi}{NL}k, where the mode index is k\in[-\frac{\mathcal{M}-1}{2},...0,...\frac{\mathcal{M}-1}{2}]. Diagonalizing \hat{H}_{\text{S}} in the singly excited subspace leads to 2\mathcal{M} polariton states |\pm_{k}\rangle, with eigen-energies \displaystyle\epsilon_{\pm k}=\hbar\omega_{\pm k}=\frac{\hbar}{2}(\omega_{k}+% \omega_{0})\pm\frac{\hbar}{2}\sqrt{(\omega_{k}-\omega_{0})^{2}+4Ng^{2}_{k}}, (3) where + and - denotes the upper polariton (UP) and lower polariton (LP) branches, respectively. In addition, there are N-\mathcal{M} dark states |{\mathcal{D}}_{k}\rangle with energies \hbar\omega_{{\mathcal{D}}k}=\hbar\omega_{0}, which do not mix with photonic states and they form the dark polariton branch. Figure 1: Schematics of the GHTC model and band structure. Left: schematics of the model setup. Inside an optical cavity, the separated molecules collectively interact with many cavity modes. Right: polariton band structure, where the matter fraction is also shown. The dashed lines are the bare photon (red) and matter (silver) dispersions, respectively. Under the polariton representation, the system Hamiltonian in Eq. 1 is expressed as \hat{H}_{\text{S}}=\sum_{\mu,k}\hbar\omega_{\mu k}\hat{P}^{\dagger}_{\mu,k}% \hat{P}_{\mu,k}, where \hat{P}^{\dagger}_{\mu,k}, \hat{P}_{\mu,k} are the polariton creation and annihilation operators for polariton state k on polariton band \mu, respectively, and the band label \mu\in\{+,-,\mathcal{D}\}. Specifically, \displaystyle\hat{P}^{\dagger}_{+,k}=\cos\Theta_{{k}}\hat{B}^{\dagger}_{k}+% \sin\Theta_{{k}}\hat{a}^{\dagger}_{k} (4a) \displaystyle\hat{P}^{\dagger}_{-,k}=-\sin\Theta_{{k}}\hat{B}^{\dagger}_{k}+% \cos\Theta_{{k}}\hat{a}^{\dagger}_{k}, (4b) where \hat{B}^{\dagger}_{k}=(1/\sqrt{N})\sum_{n=1}^{N}e^{-ik_{\parallel}\cdot x_{n}}% \hat{\sigma}^{\dagger}_{n} creates the collective bright excitons, and \Theta_{{k}}=\frac{1}{2}\arctan\left(\frac{2\sqrt{N}g_{k}}{\omega_{k}-\omega_{% 0}}\right)\in[0,\frac{\pi}{2}) (5) is the mixing angle. Details on the derivation in the polariton representation as well as the expressions of the polariton operators are provided in Supplementary Note 1. We present a schematic illustration of the model system above, as well as the polariton band structure, in Fig. 1. Without coupling to phonons, the polariton exhibits band-like transport characterized by the group velocity \displaystyle v_{g,\pm}(k_{\parallel})=d\omega_{\pm k}/dk_{\parallel}, (6) where the k_{\parallel}-dependence of \omega_{\pm k} is carried by \omega_{k} via Eq. 2. The bath Hamiltonian \hat{h}_{\mathrm{B}} describes the nuclear DOF, which we assume is a phonon environment that consists of a set of non-interacting harmonic oscillators, \hat{h}_{\text{B}}=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\sum_{\alpha}\hbar\omega_{\alpha}\hat{b}^{% \dagger}_{\alpha,{n}}\hat{b}_{\alpha,{n}}, where \hat{b}_{\alpha,n}, \hat{b}^{\dagger}_{\alpha,n} are the \alpha_{\mathrm{th}} bosonic bath phonon annihilation and creation operators in the n_{\mathrm{th}} molecule with phonon frequency \omega_{\alpha}. Furthermore, \hat{H}_{\mathrm{SB}} describes the exciton-phonon interaction \hat{H}_{\text{SB}}=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\hat{\sigma}_{n}^{\dagger}\hat{\sigma}_{n}% \otimes\sum_{\alpha}c_{\alpha}(\hat{b}_{\alpha,{n}}+\hat{b}^{\dagger}_{\alpha,% {n}}), where c_{\alpha} is the exciton-phonon coupling strength. We assume the coupling strength is identical for all excitons and c_{\alpha} is therefore independent of the label n. Based on the Caldeira-Leggett model [27, 28], the baths as well as their interactions with the system are described by the spectral density J(\omega)=\frac{\pi}{\hbar}\sum_{\alpha}c^{2}_{\alpha}\delta(\omega-\omega_{% \alpha}), (7) and \lambda=(1/\pi)\int_{0}^{+\infty}d\omega~{}J(\omega)/\omega=\sum_{\alpha}c^{2}% _{\alpha}/\omega_{\alpha} is the reorganization energy. We further introduce the Fourier transform of the bath phonon operators \hat{b}_{\alpha,{k}}=(1/\sqrt{N})\sum_{n=1}^{N}e^{ik_{\parallel}\cdot x_{n}}% \hat{b}_{\alpha,{n}}. Using these transforms, the bath Hamiltonian is expressed as \hat{h}_{\text{B}}=\sum_{k}\sum_{\alpha}\hbar\omega_{\alpha}\hat{b}^{\dagger}_% {\alpha,{k}}\hat{b}_{\alpha,{k}}, and the polariton-phonon interaction Hamiltonian is given by \hat{H}_{\text{SB}}=\sum_{\mu,k,\nu,k^{\prime}}\zeta_{\mu k}\cdot\zeta_{\nu k^% {\prime}}\hat{P}^{\dagger}_{\mu,k}\hat{P}_{\nu,k^{\prime}}\sum_{\alpha}\frac{c% _{\alpha}}{\sqrt{N}}(\hat{b}_{\alpha,{k-k^{\prime}}}+\hat{b}^{\dagger}_{\alpha% ,{k^{\prime}-k}}), (8) where the band labels \mu,\nu\in\{+,-,\mathcal{D}\}, and \zeta_{\mu k} is a state-dependent coefficient that characterizes the matter fraction of the polariton state, with \zeta_{+k}=\cos\Theta_{{k}} and \zeta_{-k}=\sin\Theta_{{k}}. The \zeta_{+k} and \zeta_{-k} are commonly referred to as the Hopfield coefficients [29, 30, 23], and we note that \zeta_{\mathcal{D}k}=1. These polariton-phonon interaction will modify the polariton band structure, and will in turn affect the polariton transport properties such as the group velocity in Eq. 6. Theory. We derive the expression for v_{g}-renormalization using the equilibrium Green’s functions at finite temperature. We restrict our discussions on polariton transport in the weak exciton-phonon coupling regime and the band-like transport regime, which are typical regimes for polariton transport experiments [4, 6]. The single-particle Green’s function of the polaritons at finite temperature is expressed as follows [31], \displaystyle G_{\mu,k}(t)\equiv-i\theta(t)\langle\hat{P}_{\mu,k}(t)\hat{P}^{% \dagger}_{\mu,k}(0)\rangle, (9) where \theta(t) is the Heaviside step function, the time-dependence of the operators read as \hat{P}_{\mu,k}(t)=e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}t}\hat{P}_{\mu,k}(0)e^{-\frac{i}{% \hbar}\hat{H}t}, and \langle\hat{A}\rangle\equiv\text{Tr}[\hat{A}e^{-\beta\hat{H}}]/\text{Tr}[e^{-% \beta\hat{H}}] denotes the thermal average under finite temperature \beta\equiv 1/(k_{\text{B}}T), where k_{\text{B}} is the Boltzmann constant. Similarly, one defines the Green’s function of the phonons as D_{q}(t)\equiv-i\sum_{\alpha}(c^{2}_{\alpha}/N)\cdot\langle\theta(t)\hat{b}_{% \alpha,q}(t)\hat{b}^{\dagger}_{\alpha,q}(0)+\theta(-t)\hat{b}^{\dagger}_{% \alpha,-q}(t)\hat{b}_{\alpha,-q}(0)\rangle. The Green’s function in Eq. 9 can be determined by the self-consistent Dyson equation in the time domain as [31] \displaystyle\Big{(}i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}-\epsilon_{\mu k}\Big{)}G% _{\mu,k}(t)-\int_{0}^{t}d\tau~{}\Sigma_{\mu,k}(t-\tau)G_{\mu,k}(\tau)=\delta(t), (10) where \Sigma_{\mu,k}(t) is the self-energy, and \epsilon_{\mu k}=\hbar\omega_{\mu k} is the bare polariton energy. Eq. 10 is recast in the frequency domain as \displaystyle\mathcal{G}^{-1}_{\mu,k}(\omega)=\hbar(\omega-\omega_{\mu k}+i% \eta)-\Sigma_{\mu,k}(\omega), (11) where \mathcal{G}_{\mu,k}(\omega) is the Fourier transform of G_{\mu,k}(t), and we take \eta\to 0_{+}. To obtain the polariton band renormalization, we further define the renormalized polariton energies \tilde{E}_{\mu k}=E_{\mu k}+i\Gamma_{\mu k} and plug it into Eq. 11, arriving at the expression [32] \displaystyle E_{\mu k} \displaystyle=\hbar\omega_{\mu k}+\text{Re}[\Sigma_{\mu,k}(\tilde{E}_{\mu k}/% \hbar)], (12a) \displaystyle\Gamma_{\mu k} \displaystyle=\text{Im}[\Sigma_{\mu k}(\tilde{E}_{\mu k}/\hbar)], (12b) which has to be solved self-consistently for E_{\mu k} and \Gamma_{\mu k}. Consequently, E_{\mu k} is the renormalized polariton band, and the renormalized polariton group velocity is obtained via \tilde{v}_{g,\pm}(k_{\parallel})=(1/\hbar)dE_{\pm k}/dk_{\parallel}, which leads to \displaystyle\tilde{v}_{g,\pm}(k_{\parallel})=v_{g,\pm}(k_{\parallel})+\frac{1% }{\hbar}\frac{d}{dk_{\parallel}}\text{Re}[\Sigma_{\pm,k}(\tilde{E}_{\pm k}/% \hbar)]. (13) The second term in the right-hand side of Eq. 13 characterizes the modification of the polariton group velocity due to polariton-phonon interaction. We hypothesize that this term is the main cause of the renormalization of v_{g} [4, 20]. In most cases, Eq. 12 cannot be solved exactly and approximations are needed to obtain the self-energy in a closed form. Here, we derive the leading contribution to polariton band renormalization using the standard tools of diagrammatic perturbation theory. The first-order self-energy is expressed as [31, 33, 34] \displaystyle\Sigma^{(1)}_{\mu,k}(t)=i\zeta^{2}_{\mu k}\sum_{\nu,k^{\prime}}% \zeta^{2}_{\nu k^{\prime}}\cdot D^{(0)}_{k-k^{\prime}}(t)G^{(0)}_{\nu,k^{% \prime}}(t), (14) where G^{(0)}_{\pm,k}(t)=-i\theta(t)e^{-i\omega_{\pm k}t} and G^{(0)}_{\mathcal{D},k}(t)=-i\theta(t)e^{-i\omega_{0}t} are the non-interacting Green functions of the polaritons, and the low-temperature limit is taken because \epsilon_{\mu k}\gg k_{\text{B}}T. Further, D^{(0)}_{k-k^{\prime}}(t) is the free phonon propagator under finite-temperature, and is expressed as D^{(0)}_{q}(t)=-i\sum_{\alpha}\frac{2c^{2}_{\alpha}}{N}[(1+n_{\alpha})e^{-i% \omega_{\alpha}|t|}+n_{\alpha}e^{i\omega_{\alpha}|t|}], (15) where D^{(0)}_{q}(t) is independent of q (see right-hand side of Eq. 14), n_{\alpha}=1/(e^{\beta\hbar\omega_{\alpha}}-1) is the Bose-Einstein distribution function, and the factor of 2 results from the degeneracy of the bath modes such that \omega_{\alpha,q}=\omega_{\alpha,-q}=\omega_{\alpha}. Eq. 14 is the Fan-Migdal self-energy [32], and when substituted in Eq. 13 leads to the following expression for the modified polariton bands E^{(2)}_{\mu k}=\hbar\omega_{\mu k}+\zeta^{2}_{\mu k}\cdot\sum_{\nu,k^{\prime}% }\sum_{\alpha}\zeta^{2}_{\nu k^{\prime}}\cdot\frac{2c^{2}_{\alpha}}{N}\cdot\Xi% _{\mu k,\nu k^{\prime}}(\omega_{\alpha}), (16) where \Xi_{\mu k,\nu k^{\prime}}(\omega_{\alpha}) is the real part of the polarizability and is given by \displaystyle\Xi_{\mu k,\nu k^{\prime}}(\omega_{\alpha}) (17) \displaystyle=\text{Re}\Big{[}\frac{1+n_{\alpha}}{\omega_{\mu k}-\omega_{\nu k% ^{\prime}}-\omega_{\alpha}+i\eta}+\frac{n_{\alpha}}{\omega_{\mu k}-\omega_{\nu k% ^{\prime}}+\omega_{\alpha}+i\eta}\Big{]}. A detailed derivation of Eq. 17 is provided in Supplementary Note 2. For continuous spectral density functions, the summation over the phonon modes \alpha in Eq. 16 can be written as an integral in terms of J(\omega) (see Supplementary Note 3). We note that the band modification can also be obtained directly from the total Hamiltonian using Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory, but this derivation of the band modification does not have any temperature-dependence [32]. In this work, we focus on the LP’s v_{g} renormalization, which is dominated by scattering to the dark exciton states (a total of N-{\mathcal{M}} of them), as opposed to scattering to the \mathcal{M} LP and \mathcal{M} UP states, because N-{\mathcal{M}}\gg 2{\mathcal{M}}. Thus, one can explicitly perform the summation over k^{\prime} that only includes the dark exciton contributions, with \sum_{k^{\prime}}f(\omega_{\nu k^{\prime}})\approx(N-\mathcal{M})f(\omega_{0}), and the N-\mathcal{M} factor will cancel with 1/N in Eq. 17. With the above considerations, the renormalized LP group velocity becomes \tilde{v}_{g,-}=v_{g,-}+\frac{d}{dk_{\parallel}}\left[|C_{k}|^{2}\sum_{\alpha}% 2c^{2}_{\alpha}\cdot\Xi_{-k,0}(\omega_{\alpha})\right], (18) where the Hopfield coefficient |C_{k}|^{2} is expressed as |C_{k}|^{2}=\sin^{2}\Theta_{k}=\frac{1}{2}\Big{[}1+\frac{\omega_{k}-\omega_{0}% }{\sqrt{(\omega_{k}-\omega_{0})^{2}+4Ng^{2}_{k}}}\Big{]}, (19) which characterizes the matter fraction of the LP. \Xi_{-k,0}(\omega_{\alpha}) only considers the dark exciton contribution, and is expressed as \displaystyle\Xi_{-k,0}(\omega_{\alpha})=\frac{n_{\alpha}\cdot(\omega_{\alpha}% -\Delta\omega_{-k})}{(\omega_{\alpha}-\Delta\omega_{-k})^{2}+\eta^{2}}-\frac{1% +n_{\alpha}}{\omega_{\alpha}+\Delta\omega_{-k}}, (20) where \Delta\omega_{-k}=\omega_{0}-\omega_{-k}>0 is the energy gap between the dark exciton states and the LP band at k_{\parallel}=\frac{2\pi}{NL}k. Eq. 18 provides an analytic expression of the LP group velocity based on the current theory. It predicts that the magnitude of the v_{g} renormalization will depend linearly on \lambda [through c^{2}_{\alpha}], and also predicts that v_{g} is sensitive to C_{k} and temperature [through n_{\alpha}]. Further taking the \eta\to 0 limit of Eq. 20, one can then analytically express Eq. 18 as \displaystyle\Delta v_{g,-} \displaystyle\equiv\tilde{v}_{g,-}-v_{g,-} (21) \displaystyle=-\frac{d}{dk_{\parallel}}\Big{[}|C_{k}|^{2}\sum_{\alpha}2c_{% \alpha}^{2}\omega_{\alpha}\frac{\Delta\omega_{-k}\cdot(2n_{\alpha}+1)-\omega_{% \alpha}}{\Delta\omega^{2}_{-k}-\omega^{2}_{\alpha}}\Big{]}. In most experiments, the LP initial excitation is in a region \Delta\omega_{-k}\gg\omega_{\alpha}, thus \Xi_{-k,0}(\omega_{\alpha}) is negative. For a broad range of phonon frequencies, the high-frequency phonon makes a positive contribution to \Xi_{-k,0}(\omega_{\alpha}), but the overall results should still be dominated by the low-frequency phonons, making \Xi_{-k,0}(\omega_{\alpha}) negative. Note that Eq. 18 is only valid when dark excitons dominate the sum in Eq. 16. Nevertheless, one is able to derive simpler analytic answers from Eq. 16 or Eq. 18 under different regimes of spectral densities J(\omega) or temperatures. Numerical Results. To quantitatively examine the accuracy of the above theory (Eq. 16, or the corresponding \tilde{v}_{g,-}), we perform quantum dynamics simulations for the GHTC model Hamiltonian using the Ehrenfest method [20], and verify various scaling relations and predictions made by the theory. For the system Hamiltonian, we chose the exciton energy \hbar\omega_{0}=1.96 eV, the cavity frequency \hbar\omega_{\text{c}}=1.90 eV, and the collective light-matter coupling strength \sqrt{N}g_{\text{c}}=120 meV. Details of the models and computations are provided in Supplementary Note 4, with a brief summary provided in the Methods section. Figure 2: Polariton band structure modification and group velocity renormalization due to polariton-phonon interaction. (a) Modified polariton band structure under different \lambda. (b) Group velocity of the LP branch \tilde{v}_{g,-} under different \lambda. (c) Scaling relation of the magnitude of LP group velocity change |\Delta v_{g,-}| with \lambda. (d) Temperature-dependence of the LP group velocity \tilde{v}_{g,-} at LP energy \epsilon_{-k}= 1.86 eV and \lambda= 6 meV. Theoretical results using Eq. 16 (solid lines) are compared to Ehrenfest dynamics simulations (open circles). Fig. 2a presents the modified polariton band structure with different \lambda. One observes that the modification of v_{g} increases as \lambda and the matter fraction increases. For the LP branch, the second term in Eq. 16 is negative, which effectively provides an attractive interaction between polaritons (mediated by phonons) and decreases the LP energy. Similarly, the energy increases for the UP branch. Since \zeta^{2}_{\mu k} is the matter fraction of the polariton branch, it is straightforward to see that as k_{\parallel} increases, \zeta^{2}_{-k} increases with larger matter fraction, thus providing more modifications to the LP band. The modified polariton band structure consequently leads to polariton group velocity renormalization. Fig. 2b presents the LP group velocity at different energies (see Fig. 2a) and for different \lambda, where the theoretical results using Eq. 16 are compared to quantum dynamics simulations (open circles). One sees that as \lambda increases, the magnitude of the group velocity renormalization increases (from the blue curve to the green curve), further deviating from the derivative of the LP band, v_{g} (black solid curve). Further, as the LP energy increases, the matter character of the LP state |C_{k}^{2}| also increases, which further reduces the group velocity. For all cases, the theory agrees very well with the numerical simulations for small \lambda (< 12 meV). However, for larger \lambda, the polariton-phonon interaction enters the non-perturbative regime, and the first-order self-energy level theory in Eq. 16 becomes inadequate. As a result, the theory gradually deviates from numerical simulations, as expected. Nevertheless, the overall semi-quantitative trend is always captured by the theory. Fig. 2c presents the scaling relation of the LP group velocity change |\Delta v_{g,-}|=|\tilde{v}_{g,-}-v_{g,-}| (c.f. Eq. 18) as a function of \lambda, which characterizes the modification to the LP group velocity by the polariton-phonon interaction. Importantly, the theory in Eq. 18 predicts that this renormalization magnitude is proportional to c^{2}_{\alpha} and thus |\Delta v_{g,-}|\propto\lambda. Fig. 2c presents \Delta v_{g,-} versus \lambda at different LP energies. We observe that |\Delta v_{g,-}| scales linearly with \lambda, and the slope increases as the matter fraction increases. It is clear from Eq. 16 that the polariton band structure (or group velocity) modification is proportional to \lambda due to its quadratic dependence on c_{\alpha}. The results obtained from quantum dynamics simulations agree quite well with the theory, especially for cases with small \lambda and matter fraction. As \lambda and matter fraction increase, the Ehrenfest results gradually deviate from the theory and show a nonlinear dependence on \lambda, due to non-perturbative effects; see the \epsilon_{-k}= 1.86 eV (shallow green) curve for example. Nevertheless, the semi-quantitative trend is always captured by the theory, and we stress that there are no free parameters in the current theory. Furthermore, our quantum dynamics simulation is based on the Ehrenfest MQC approximation which may lead to inaccurate results when \lambda is large. Future efforts are needed to evaluate v_{g} in the large \lambda regime using more accurate quantum dynamics approaches. Finally, we consider the temperature dependence of the polariton group velocity renormalization. Fig. 2d presents \tilde{v}_{g,-} versus T at LP energy \epsilon_{-,k}= 1.86 eV and \lambda= 6 meV. One observes that the results obtained from Ehrenfest dynamics simulations agree quantitatively well with theory in the high-temperature regime, while deviations from theory begin to show at very low temperatures. From a theoretical standpoint, the temperature dependence is mainly carried by the Bose-Einstein distribution function in Eq. 16 which is nonlinear in T. In particular, under the high-temperature limit (\hbar\omega_{\alpha}\ll k_{\text{B}}T for all \omega_{\alpha}), the Bose-Einstein distribution function can be approximated as n_{\alpha}\approx k_{\text{B}}T/(\hbar\omega_{\alpha})\propto T. As a result, the modification of the polariton band structure (or group velocity) is proportional to T. At temperatures near 300 K, the parameters we used satisfy the high-temperature limit, thus \Delta v_{g,-} scales linearly with T. In the Ehrenfest dynamics simulations, the nuclear quantum effect comes from the Wigner distribution of the nuclear thermal density only, which does not give accurate results in the very low-temperature regime. Considering this, we place greater confidence in the analytic theory, which should be accurate under the low \lambda and T\to 0 limits because of the perturbative treatment. Nevertheless, both the current theory (solid green line) and the numerical simulation agree reasonably well across all temperature regimes. Overall, the theory and simulations predict that v_{g,-} decreases as T increases. This is because when T increases, the phonon fluctuations cause transitions from the LP band to the dark exciton states, thus reducing the group velocity. Note that a phenomenological expression has previously been proposed based on the thermal activated scattering theory (TAST) [6], due to scattering from |-_{k}\rangle to the dark states, resulting in the following expression for the group velocity renormalization \tilde{v}_{g,-}=\frac{v_{g,-}}{1+G\cdot e^{-\beta\hbar\Delta\omega_{-k}}}, (22) where G is a free parameter. See Supplementary Note 5, as well as Supplementary Information S3 in Ref. 6 for further details. The TAST is based on the idea that transport depends on the proportion of time the system spends in the LP band relative to the dark states, resulting in a temperature-dependent modification of v_{g} that is sensitive to the energy gap \Delta\omega_{-k}. Although the TAST makes intuitive sense (and aligns with findings from our microscopic theory), we found that Eq. 22 does not give the correct temperature dependence when G is treated as a temperature-independent parameter. In Fig. 2, the result from TAST is plotted as the red dashed curve, with a fitting parameter G=3.0 to reproduce the correct value of \tilde{v}_{g,-} at T=300 K. One sees that it does not give the correct T-dependence across a broad range of temperatures unless one further chooses a T-dependent G parameter. The reason TAST fails to reproduce an accurate T-dependence is because the expression from TAST scales as 1/(1+e^{-\beta\hbar\Delta\omega_{-k}}), whereas the microscopic theory in Eq. 18 posits that the temperature dependence is n_{\alpha}\approx e^{-\beta\hbar\omega_{\alpha}} under the low-temperature limit when \hbar\omega_{\alpha}\gg k_{\mathrm{B}}T, and n_{\alpha}\approx k_{\text{B}}T/(\hbar\omega_{\alpha}) under the high-temperature limit when \hbar\omega_{\alpha}\ll k_{\mathrm{B}}T. Additionally, TAST assumes that the transition between the LP band and dark exciton states follows Boltzmann statistics, whereas in our current theory, the phonons obey the Bose-Einstein statistics, which mediate the transitions between the LP band and the dark states. Our microscopic theory also predicts that \Delta v_{g,-} should depend on \Delta\omega_{-k}, but this dependence (in Eq. 18) is not in the Boltzmann factor."

We leverage recent insights into the creation and detection of non-Abelian anyons in electrically insulating spin systems to propose topological qubit architectures based on quantum spin liquids. We present two types of prototype designs that enable the requisite control in a potentially scalable framework: one invokes spin liquids integrated into magnetic tunnel junction arrays, the other uses semiconductor-spin liquid hybrids. We further identify various protocols for interrogating spin-liquid-based topological qubits, both to validate the underlying principles of topological quantum computation and to establish gates required for universal quantum computation. These results provide long-term direction for experimental investigation of Kitaev materials and potentially other solid-state spin liquid hosts.","Topological phases of matter hosting non-Abelian anyons (or closely related non-Abelian defects) can emerge in experimental platforms including topological superconductors [1, 2], fractional quantum Hall systems [3], and quantum spin liquids [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Interest in these settings is fueled in large part by their potential utility for intrinsically fault-tolerant topological quantum information processing [11, 12]. Three deeply related non-Abelian-anyon characteristics [13] underlie this technological promise: First, a collection of non-Abelian anyons nucleated in a host platform encodes a degeneracy consisting of locally indistinguishable states. Qubits encoded in that manifold correspondingly enjoy built-in resilience against dephasing errors from local environmental noise. Second, adiabatically braiding non-Abelian anyons nontrivially rotates the system’s wavefunction within the degenerate subspace—enacting a set of ‘rigid’ quantum gates on the protected qubits. Third, non-Abelian anyons can ‘fuse’ into multiple quasiparticle types, with a history-dependent outcome. Measuring their fusion products thus provides a mechanism of quantum-state readout. Building a functional prototype topological qubit requires definitive formation of a non-Abelian topological phase, on-demand creation and controlled manipulation of non-Abelian anyons, and detection of individual anyons and their possible fusion products. Topological qubit blueprints integrating these requirements were first proposed for quantum Hall systems [14, 15, 16] and later adapted to topological superconductors [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] (leading eventually to scalable designs [24]). Despite the rather different nature of the two platforms, both constitute electrically active systems amenable to gating and charge transport—key experimental tools for manipulation and detection. In the quantum Hall setting, for example, electrostatic gating can nucleate fractionally charged non-Abelian anyons that can be electrically detected via anyon interferometry [25, 14, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Similarly, gating can manipulate non-Abelian domain-wall defects in topological superconductors [33], while electrical transport in conjunction with Coulomb charging effects enables interferometric readout [34, 35, 36, 37, 24]. How does one build and interrogate a topological qubit based on a non-Abelian quantum spin liquid? This question is nontrivial because spin liquids appear in electrically inactive spin systems. Consequently, one can not naively import the topological qubit designs and control techniques noted above to this setting. The question is also relevant given intense experimental investigations of a family of magnetic insulators dubbed Kitaev materials [5, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]—believed to exhibit Hamiltonians ‘close’ to the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model [4]. The Kitaev model in particular harbors a magnetic-field-induced non-Abelian spin liquid phase, for which experimental evidence has been reported in \alpha-\mathrm{RuCl}_{3} [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49] (see, however, Refs. 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56). Numerous recent papers have devised schemes for creating and detecting non-Abelian anyons in spin liquids [57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72] (see also the references in Sec. II). We build on these results to propose spin-liquid-based topological qubit blueprints as well as protocols designed to validate the essential underpinnings of topological quantum computation in this setting. We develop two types of architectures that incorporate potentially scalable ingredients: (i) spin liquids integrated into magnetic tunnel junction arrays that allow local, real-time manipulation of the host platform, and (ii) semiconductor-spin liquid hybrids for which electrons bind non-Abelian anyons, enabling charged-based control of the latter. In both cases readout proceeds via anyon interferometry. Following a philosophy similar to Ref. 73, we primarily focus on relatively simple geometries that allow for a series of proof-of-concept topological qubit experiments. We specifically present device designs and protocols for qubit initialization, verification of non-Abelian anyon fusion rules, demonstration of non-Abelian braiding, and extraction of topological qubit lifetimes. The required ingredients in turn allow one to realize both protected and unprotected quantum gates required for a universal gate set, which we also discuss in some detail drawing inspiration from earlier work in other settings [74, 11, 75, 14, 15, 76, 16, 77, 12, 78, 79, 80, 81, 33, 22, 82, 24]. Our designs moreover extend to scalable multi-qubit architectures. While many advances would be required to bring our proposals to life, we hope that the strategies developed here provide useful long-term guidance for quantum spin liquid experiments. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II sets the stage by reviewing the phenomenology of non-Abelian Kitaev spin liquids and surveying previously introduced anyon creation and detection strategies. Next, Sec. III proposes anyon manipulation methods that use either magnetic tunnel junction arrays or electrical setups. Section IV synthesizes these results to propose minimalist spin-liquid-based topological qubit designs and highlight protocols for validating non-Abelian fusion rules, non-Abelian braiding, and qubit lifetime extraction. Section V adapts protocols for gates needed to achieve universal quantum computation in this setting. Finally, we conclude in Sec. VI by highlighting various future challenges and opportunities."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08091v1,Non-Fermi liquids from subsystem symmetry breaking in van der Waals multilayers,"We investigate the spontaneous breaking of subsystem symmetry in a stack of two-dimensional Fermi liquid metals, each maintaining a subsystem number conservation symmetry, driven by interlayer exciton condensation. The resulting Goldstone modes in this broken symmetry phase couple to the quasiparticle current perpendicular to the layers. This coupling, which remains non-zero for small momentum transfers, leads to the emergence of a three-dimensional anisotropic marginal Fermi liquid state when the number of layers is sufficiently large. We propose a possible experimental realization of this phenomenon in two-dimensional multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Using self-consistent mean-field calculations, we characterize the subsystem symmetry-broken metallic state and examine the effects of fluctuations on its physical properties within the random phase approximation. We find that these fluctuations produce additional logarithmic enhancements to the specific heat at low temperature, specifically C\sim T(\log(1/T))^{2}.","Non-Fermi liquids (NFL) are a class of metallic phases of matter that deviate from the paradigmatic Landau Fermi liquid theory. A significant amount of theoretical and experimental effort continues to be devoted to studying these complex, strongly-coupled phases and their experimental realizations [1, 2]. They are typically believed to emerge in strongly correlated materials such as cuprates and pnictides when a bosonic order parameter becomes quantum critical [3, 4, 5]. A recent addition to the catalog of strongly correlated materials are two-dimensional van der Waals materials, which are heterostructures formed by stacking single material layers on top of each other [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. These heterostructures, created by stacking individual material layers, offer remarkable flexibility through gate-voltage tunability and diverse layer combinations, each yielding distinct physical properties. This versatility raises the intriguing possibility of these materials facilitating novel pathways to the realization of NFLs. Figure 1: (a) Stack of two-dimensional Fermi liquid metals with subsystem symmetry and long-lived quasiparticles. (b) Inter-layer coherent, or subsystem symmetry broken, three-dimensional non-Fermi liquid metal with short-lived single-particle excitations. In metallic states that spontaneously break continuous symmetries, the coupling of electrons to Goldstone modes can, in certain cases, result in NFL behavior [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. In scenarios where the broken symmetry generators affect only internal flavor degrees of freedom—such as in an XY ferromagnetic metal—Goldstone modes decouple from the electrons at low energies, thus maintaining the stability of the Fermi liquid [20]. Consider a bilayer metal with separately conserved electron numbers n_{1} and n_{2} in each layer, which can be decomposed into relative (n_{1}-n_{2}) and total (n_{1}+n_{2}) number conservation. The relative number conservation symmetry can be spontaneously broken through interlayer exciton condensation, while the total electron number conservation remains intact. In this context, the layers can be interpreted as flavor degrees of freedom, resulting in an exciton-condensed metallic state analogous to an XY magnetically ordered metal, which is a Fermi liquid state. Now, let us consider a stack of such monolayers, each possessing a subsystem number (n_{i} for the i-th layer) conservation symmetry and discrete translational symmetry perpendicular to the layers. Similar to the bilayer case, we can examine the spontaneous breaking of the relative number conservation symmetries (n_{i}-n_{i+1}) across all pairs of layers, while preserving the total number conservation. In a three-dimensional system with many layers, the relative number conservation symmetry generator cannot merely be viewed as acting on internal flavor degrees of freedom, as it couples electrons that are spatially separated. In this work, we demonstrate that such a subsystem symmetry-broken metallic state strongly couples to Goldstone modes at low energies, resulting in an NFL state. It is important to note that subsystem symmetry breaking at zero temperature necessitates that the spatial dimension of the subsystem where the symmetry generators act non-trivially is at least two. In lower-dimensional subsystems, strong quantum fluctuations will restore the system to a symmetric state [26]. Field theories with subsystem symmetries and their spontaneous breaking have also been considered recently in the context of fractonic systems (for a sample of papers, see Refs. [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]). Subsystem number conservation symmetry can be realized in 2D materials when monolayers are separated by an insulating barrier, such as boron nitride [33, 34], or when the layers are arranged with a large-angle twist [35], significantly suppressing interlayer electron tunneling. In this work, we begin by analyzing a microscopic model of such a multi-layer system. Using self-consistent mean-field calculations, we examine the phase where subsystem symmetry is spontaneously broken. We then derive a low-energy model of a 3D Fermi liquid coupled to Goldstone mode fluctuations, demonstrating that this interaction leads to a marginal Fermi liquid state, whose properties we subsequently analyze."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07999v1,Estimation of spin-orbit torques in the presence of current-induced magnon creation and annihilation,"We present a comprehensive set of harmonic resistance measurements of the dampinglike (DL) and fieldlike (FL) torques in Pt/CoFeB, Pt/Co, W/CoFeB, W/Co, and YIG/Pt bilayers complemented by measurements of the DL torque using the magneto-optical Kerr effect and calibrated by nitrogen vacancy magnetometry on the same devices. The magnon creation-annihilation magnetoresistances depend strongly on temperature and on the magnetic and transport properties of each bilayer, affecting the estimate of both the DL and FL torque. The DL torque, the most important parameter for applications, is overestimated by a factor of 2 in W/CoFeB and by one order of magnitude in YIG/Pt when not accounting for the magnonic contribution to the planar Hall resistance. We further show that the magnonic contribution can be quantified by combining measurements of the nonlinear longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistances, thus providing a reliable method to measure the spin-orbit torques in different material systems.","I The harmonic Hall resistance analysis of SOTs I.1 Standard analysis The change of the magnetization direction due to the SOT in NM/FM bilayers gives rise to a change of the magnetoresistance. As this change is proportional to the current, a second harmonic transverse or longitudinal magnetoresistance can be detected when using an alternating current. It is thus possible to evaluate the SOTs from the transverse magnetoresistance measurement in a Hall bar device pi10 ; garello13 ; kim13 ; avci14 ; hayashi14 . Thanks to its simplicity, the harmonic Hall resistance analysis has been extensively used to study and evaluate the SOTs in NM/FM bilayers manchon19 ; nguyen21 both in in-plane magnetized avci14 ; wen17 ; lau17 ; neumann18 ; masuda20 ; chi20 ; du20 ; hibino20 ; du21 ; lee21 ; binda21 ; binda23 and out-of-plane magnetized samples garello13 ; hayashi14 ; pai15 ; nguyen16 ; ghosh17 ; avci17 ; zhu18 ; zhu19a ; wang19 ; ghosh22 ; shirokura21 ; krishnia21 ; wang23 . More recently it was further used to estimate the SOTs in NM/antiferromagnet bilayers cogulu22 as well as the SOTs associated to the orbital Hall effect in light metal/FM bilayers sala22 ; ding22 . The technique further allows for disentangling the current-induced SOT and thermoelectric contributions, as described by Avci et al. avci14 ; avci15 ; ghosh17 . When the magnetization is rotated in-plane by an angle \varphi relative to the current direction, the first and second harmonic transverse magnetoresistance R_{xy}^{1\omega} and R_{xy}^{2\omega} are given by: R_{xy}^{1\omega}=R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{1\omega}\sin\varphi\cos\varphi, (1) \begin{split}R_{xy}^{2\omega}=(-R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega}+R_{\mathrm{\nabla T% },xy}^{2\omega}-\frac{1}{2}R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega})\cos\varphi\\ +(2R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega})\cos^{3}\varphi,\end{split} (2) where R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{1\omega} is the planar Hall resistance, R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega} is the change of transverse resistance due to the DL torque, R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2\omega} is the transverse magnetothermal contribution due to the out-of-plane thermal gradient associated with the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) and spin Seebeck effect (SSE), R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega} is the change of transverse resistance induced by the Oersted field and the FL torque. For simplicity, we will not separate the FL torque due to the spin accumulation and the Oersted field contributions. The latter can be estimated by Ampere’s law or directly measured by NV microscopy, as shown in Sect. III.2. Similarly, the second harmonic longitudinal contribution R_{xx}^{2\omega} includes contributions from torques and magnetothermal effects, as well as the unidirectional spin Hall magnetoresistance (USMR) avci15 ; langenfeld16 ; yasuda16 ; li17 ; wang18 ; borisenko18 ; avci18 ; sterk19 ; liu21 . For the in-plane angular dependence, the first and second harmonic longitudinal magnetoresistance contributions R_{xx}^{1\omega} and R_{xx}^{2\omega} are given by: R_{xx}^{1\omega}=R_{\mathrm{AMR}}^{1\omega}\cos^{2}\varphi-R_{\mathrm{SMR}}^{1% \omega}\sin^{2}\varphi, (3) \begin{split}R_{xx}^{2\omega}=(R_{\mathrm{USMR}}^{2\omega}+R_{\mathrm{\nabla T% },xx}^{2\omega}+2R_{\mathrm{FL},xx}^{2\omega})\sin\varphi\\ -2R_{\mathrm{FL},xx}^{2\omega}\sin^{3}\varphi,\end{split} (4) where R_{\mathrm{AMR}}^{1\omega} is the anisotropic magnetoresistance, R_{\mathrm{SMR}}^{1\omega} is the spin Hall magnetoresistance, R_{\mathrm{USMR}}^{2\omega} is the USMR contribution, R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xx}^{2\omega} is the longitudinal magnetothermal contribution and R_{\mathrm{FL},xx}^{2\omega} is the change of the longitudinal resistance due to the FL torque with R_{\mathrm{FL},xx}^{2\omega}=-g\cdot R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega} and R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xx}^{2\omega}=-g\cdot R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2\omega}, with g the length-to-width ratio of the Hall bar. To disentangle this multitude of effects, one has to rely on their different response to additional external stimuli. In the standard analysis, Eq. (2) is rewritten as R_{xy}^{2\omega}=R_{\cos}^{2\omega}\cos\varphi+R_{\cos^{3}}^{2\omega}\cos^{3}\varphi, (5) where R_{\cos}^{2\omega}=-R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega}+R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2% \omega}-\frac{1}{2}R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega} and R_{\cos^{3}}^{2\omega}=2R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega}. Assuming that the magnetization aligns with the external field H, and by rotating the sample in a constant field, the values of R_{xy}^{2\omega} measured as a function of \varphi are fitted using Eq. (5) to extract the coefficients R_{\cos}^{2\omega} and R_{\cos^{3}}^{2\omega}. Using linear combinations of these coefficients, the torque can be estimated from the variations of R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega} and R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega} with the applied magnetic field H avci14 . The FL torque is obtained by: R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{1\omega}}{\mu_% {0}H}B_{\mathrm{FL}}, (6) with \mu_{0} the vacuum permeability and B_{\mathrm{FL}} the magnetic flux density associated to the FL torque. The DL torque is obtained by: R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega}+R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2\omega}=\frac{R_{% \mathrm{AHE}}^{1\omega}}{\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{eff}}}B_{\mathrm{DL}}+R_{\mathrm{% \nabla T},xy}^{2\omega}, (7) where the magnetothermal contribution R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2\omega} does not depend on the effective field H_{\mathrm{eff}} acting on the magnetization, R_{\mathrm{AHE}}^{1\omega} is the anomalous Hall resistance and B_{\mathrm{DL}} the magnetic flux associated to the DL torque. The effective field is given by H_{\mathrm{eff}}=H+H_{\mathrm{dem}}+H_{\mathrm{PMA}} with H_{\mathrm{dem}} the demagnetizing field and H_{\mathrm{PMA}} the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy field. In the following, we refer interchangeably to B_{\mathrm{FL}} as the FL torque and B_{\mathrm{DL}} as the DL torque. I.2 Magnonic contribution Figure 1: Summary of the angular dependence of the second harmonic signals in the longitudinal and transverse measurement configurations due to the SOTs, m\!{}^{\dagger}​mMRs, USMR, and magnetothermal effects. The analysis of the Hall resistance reported in the previous section is valid when the magnetization M of the FM layer has a constant magnitude, independent of current. However, as discussed in Ref. jointpaper, , the injection of a spin current from the NM into the FM layer induces the creation or annihilation of magnons, depending on the polarization of the current. This effect is maximum when the polarization of the spin current is parallel or antiparallel to the magnetization. To first order in the current, the change of magnon population induces a change of magnetization \Delta M(I), resulting in a current- and angle-dependent modulation of M(I)=M_{s}+\Delta M(I)\sin\varphi, where M_{s} is the saturation magnetization at the temperature of the measurements. Joule-heating effects \propto I^{2} can be included in M_{s} to provide higher-order corrections to this expression. In order to account for the magnonic contributions Eq. (2) and (4) have to be modified. The transverse second harmonic resistance R_{xy}^{2\omega} and longitudinal second harmonic resistance R_{xx}^{2\omega} are then given by R_{xy}^{2\omega}=(R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{2\omega}-R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega}+R_{% \mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2\omega}-\frac{1}{2}R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega})\cos% \varphi+(2R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega}-R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{2\omega})\cos^{3}\varphi, (8) R_{xx}^{2\omega}=(R_{\mathrm{USMR}}^{2\omega}+R_{\mathrm{MMR}}^{2\omega}+R_{% \mathrm{\nabla T},xx}^{2\omega}+2R_{\mathrm{FL},xx}^{2\omega}+R_{\mathrm{AMR}}% ^{2\omega})\sin\varphi+(R_{\mathrm{SMR}}^{2\omega}-R_{\mathrm{AMR}}^{2\omega}-% 2R_{\mathrm{FL},xx}^{2\omega})\sin^{3}\varphi, (9) where R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{2\omega}, R_{\mathrm{MMR}}^{2\omega}, R_{\mathrm{AMR}}^{2\omega} and R_{\mathrm{SMR}}^{2\omega} are respectively the m\!{}^{\dagger}​mPHE, m\!{}^{\dagger}​mMMR, m\!{}^{\dagger}​mAMR and m\!{}^{\dagger}​mSMR coefficients defined in Ref. jointpaper, . From Eq. (8) we notice that R_{\mathrm{PHE}}^{2\omega} cannot be separated from the R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega}, R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega} and R_{\mathrm{\nabla T},xy}^{2\omega} purely based on the angular dependence, since the equation system is underdetermined. Therefore, not accounting for the m\!{}^{\dagger}​mPHE using the harmonic Hall resistance method will affect the proper estimation of R_{\mathrm{DL},xy}^{2\omega}, R_{\mathrm{FL},xy}^{2\omega} and of the associated torques, but will not affect the quality of the fit of R_{xy}^{2\omega}. Similar to the transverse resistance, the longitudinal contributions due to the m\!{}^{\dagger}​mMRs also cannot be distinguished based on their angular dependence [see Eq. (9)]. We would like to point out that R_{\mathrm{USMR}}^{2\omega}, the USMR contribution, corresponds here to the spin-dependent USMR avci15 and the magnonic contribution associated with the spin flip USMR is entirely contained in the expression of R_{\mathrm{MMR}}^{2\omega}. In Fig. 1 we graphically summarized all the possible contributions to the second harmonic signal due to the torques avci14 , m\!{}^{\dagger}​mMRs jointpaper , USMR avci15 and magnetothermal effects avci14 ; miyasato07 ; uchida08 , in the transverse and longitudinal resistance."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07991v1,Nonlinear longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistances due to current-induced magnon creation-annihilation processes,"Charge-spin conversion phenomena such as the spin Hall effect allow for the excitation of magnons in a magnetic layer by passing an electric current in an adjacent nonmagnetic conductor. We demonstrate that this current-induced modification of the magnon density generates an additional nonlinear longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance for every magnetoresistance that depends on the magnetization. Using harmonic measurements, we evidence that these magnon creation-annihilation magnetoresistances dominate the second harmonic longitudinal and transverse resistance of thin Y3Fe5O12/Pt bilayers. Our results apply to both insulating and metallic magnetic layers, elucidating the dependence of the magnetoresistance on applied current and magnetic field for a broad variety of systems excited by spin currents.","References [1] T.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07926v1,Near-field refractometry of van der Waals crystals,"Common techniques for measuring refractive indices, such as ellipsometry and goniometry, are ineffective for van der Waals crystal flakes because of their high anisotropy and small, micron-scale, lateral size. To address this, we employ near-field optical microscopy to analyze the guided optical modes within these crystals. By probing these modes in MoS2 flakes with subwavelength spatial resolution at a wavelength of 1570\,\mathrm{nm}, we determine both the in-plane and out-of-plane permittivity components of MoS2 as 16.11 and 6.25, respectively, with a relative uncertainty below 1\%, while overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.","Introduction The discovery of the exceptional properties of graphene, enabled by a straightforward exfoliation technique to isolate monocrystalline graphitic films in the early 2000s Novoselov et al. (2004), ignited a search for other materials with layered structures held together by weak van der Waals (vdW) forces. These materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), have become a focal point in optoelectronics and quantum nanophotonics owing to their unique optical and electrical properties Song et al. (2024); Gonçalves et al. (2020); Reserbat-Plantey et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2021). Due to the layered structure of vdW materials, most of them are expected to exhibit giant anisotropy and even hyperbolic dispersion Gjerding et al. (2017), which cannot be found among previously known naturally occurring materials. TMDCs, for instance, display remarkable optical behavior; their monolayers, readily exfoliated from bulk crystals Novoselov et al. (2005); Velický et al. (2017); Frisenda et al. (2020), often exhibit optoelectronic properties distinctly different from those of their bulk counterparts Liu et al. (2016); Rasmussen and Thygesen (2015). Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), the TMDC considered in the present work, exemplifies this: it transitions from an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a 1.29 eV bandgap in bulk Böker et al. (2001) to a direct bandgap semiconductor with a 1.8–1.9 eV bandgap as a monolayer Mak et al. (2010); Li et al. (2014). Theoretical and computational advancements Cappelluti et al. (2013); Kormányos et al. (2015); Fang et al. (2015); Rasmussen and Thygesen (2015); Thygesen (2017) and experimental explorations Novoselov et al. (2005); Tang et al. (2014); Shen et al. (2013); Li et al. (2014); Yim et al. (2014) have propelled the understanding of vdW materials, yet the experimental characterization of their basic optical properties remains challenging. Exfoliated flakes are generally too small and non-uniform in thickness for traditional refractive index measurements, which limits precision in determining key optical parameters like the complex permittivity tensor. Understanding these optical properties is crucial for the design and optimization of devices based on vdW materials, such as metasurfaces Munkhbat et al. (2020), and could enable new applications previously limited by a lack of suitable materials with such unique properties. Some refractive index measurement methods rely on Snell’s law and goniometer setups to precisely measure refraction angles; however, they are ineffective for slab-like samples, where refraction results only in slight beam displacement. Techniques such as measuring critical angles for total internal reflection or using Brewster’s angle provide rough estimations but lack accuracy due to weak angular dependence. The most advanced method, ellipsometry, measures the change in polarization upon reflection, which is fitted by different models to extract the thickness and refractive index of the unknown layer. However, the precision of conventional spectroscopic ellipsometry relies on using a well-collimated beam with a spot size of >300\,\mathrm{\upmu m}, which is too large to make it reliable for the investigation of exfoliated flakes, because defects and non-uniformities are also illuminated Ermolaev et al. (2020); Munkhbat et al. (2022). This limitation is overcome in an imaging ellipsometry setup, which uses angled wide-field illumination and microscopy detection with an objective, claimed to have a lateral resolution below 10\,\mathrm{\upmu m} Ermolaev et al. (2021); Funke et al. (2016); Zotev et al. (2023). However, its primary purpose is imaging of material contrast, which might compromise the accuracy of refractive index measurements, especially for challenging samples as anisotropic TMDC flakes. Finally, the large refractive index of most TMDC materials results in low sensitivity of the above far-field methods to the out-of-plane component of the refractive index, because the incident illumination from the air even at large angles will be refracted to nearly normal direction inside the flake. FIG. 1: a) Artistic representation of the experiment where guided modes in an MoS2 flake are probed using a transmission s-SNOM setup. b) Differential interference contrast image of a t=185 nm thick MoS2 flake. The scale bar is 20 \mathrm{\upmu m}. c-d) Amplitude \left|E_{\mathrm{nf}}\right| and real part \mathrm{Re}\left\{E_{\mathrm{nf}}\right\} of the complex near-field map of the marked 40\,\mathrm{\upmu m} by 20\,\mathrm{\upmu m} region in panel b) (green dashed rectangle). The scale bar is 10 \mathrm{\upmu m}. e) Momentum-space representation of the complex near-field map, highlighting Fourier components associated with TE0 and TM0 modes. In contrast to far-field methods, scanning near-field microscopy (SNOM) bypasses the issue of lateral resolution. Here we implemented a method we termed ”near-field refractometry”, which works by probing guided modes within the material, whose properties are directly linked to the material optical properties Boroviks et al. (2022); Lebsir et al. (2022); Casses et al. (2022, 2024); Jang et al. (2024). Moreover, our approach demonstrated sensitivity to both in-plane and out-of-plane refractive index components, making it uniquely suited for measurements of highly anisotropic vdW materials. We demonstrate the precision and accuracy of our method by investigating a highly anisotropic vdW material, namely MoS2 Ermolaev et al. (2021), using a phase-resolved SNOM (Figure 1a). We map the near field of guided modes within MoS2 flakes of finite thickness (Figure 1c and d) at photon energies below the bandgap (\lambda_{0}=1570 nm), with a scan size as small as 40\,\mathrm{\upmu m} by 20\,\mathrm{\upmu m} (Figure 1b). First, the guided transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes are found by Fourier transforming the recorded near-field map (Figure 1e). After filtering in the Fourier domain, these modes are fitted in the direct space to extract their propagation constant. Finally, after collection of the thickness-dependent dispersion characteristics of these modes, we extract the anisotropic dielectric function of MoS2 and estimate its uncertainty."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07844v1,Moiré amplification of highly tunable shift current response in twisted trilayer graphene,"In this work we analyze the shift current conductivity in helical twisted trilayer graphene. Without loss of generality, we show that the density of states and the twist angle set an upper bound for this response, which is inversely proportional to the square of the twist angle. For the case of ABA stacking and at the magic angle, the shift photoconductivity can reach values of order 10^{4}~{}\mathrm{\mu A\cdot nm\cdot V}^{-2} for frequencies below 50 meV, which can be attributed to the interband transitions between the two flattened middle bands close to the Fermi level. By tuning the twist angle, we demonstrate that the photoconductivity is shifted in the frequency range and it is further influenced by two additional factors: The magnitude of the shift vector and the energy separation between the bands. Furthermore, we propose a scenario in the AAA stacked configuration, where the photoconductivity can be of order 10^{5}~{}\mathrm{\mu A\cdot nm\cdot V}^{-2} in the THz regime, revealing a potential influence of the stacking in the optimization of the shift current conductivity. Therefore, a large density of states, a small twist angle and the layer stacking are ingredients that hold promising functionality for photovoltaic applications in moiré heterostructures.","Nowadays, solar-cell technology is a suitable alternative for high efficient and eco-friendly energy applications. In this context, an alternative mechanism to the standard PN photovoltaics for the photo-current generation is the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE). In BPVE the photo-current generation is driven by the shift current (SC), where light illumination induces a photoconductivity in materials lacking inversion symmetry [1, 2, 3]. Its origin has been attributed to the shift of the center of charges in the presence of light. In contrast to the conventional PN photovoltaic effect, the BPVE can generate a photovoltage above the band gap, enabling to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit and in principle surpassing the conversion efficiency of conventional solar cells. However, even with all these good premises, BPVE is still not competitive with standard PN Photovoltaics, suggesting further exploration on materials with different band structure properties [4]. Concerning nonmagnetic materials, natural prospects for large shift conductivities are ferroelectrics, such as BaTiO3 or PbTiO3 [5], but its dependence with the direction and strength of the ferroelectric polarization is not fully understood. On the other hand, there is a growing interest on the study of BPVE in metallic systems, where the SC could be enhanced by real and virtual transitions between the bands, for example, in the topological semi-metal TaAs [6, 7]. In fact, when the frequency of the incoming light lies within the mid-infrared region of the spectrum, it can exceed by orders of magnitude the photo-conductivity of conventional ferroelectrics [5, 8] and chiral materials [9]. Nevertheless, it is still smaller than the gigantic shift conductivity computed in BiTeI, which can reach about 750 \mathrm{\mu A\cdot V^{-2}} [10] and it can be tuned throughout a topological transition in the presence of pressure [11]. Very recently, a wide variety of investigations have identified that twisted multilayer systems made of transition metal dichalcogenides or graphene monolayers, just to name a few, are able to display colossal nonlinear d.c. responses [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] and second order photocurrents [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. Regarding the nonlinear Hall effect, the magnitude of the conductivity in twisted bilayer WTe2 [12] relies on the numerous band crossings and band inversions around the Fermi level, leading to an enhancement of the Berry curvature. Correlation effects have also been proposed as an explanation to the large nonlinear Hall effect in WSe2 [15]. On the other hand, graphene structure usually exhibit very low rotational symmetries, typically \textrm{C}_{3} or \textrm{C}_{6}, forbidding the second order Hall effect driven by the Berry curvature dipole [28, 29] and the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect [30].In this situation, it is more likely that the d.c. current could be associated with more complex extrinsic contributions such as side jump or skew scattering [31]. Although the rotational symmetry can be broken in several ways, e.g., by applying strain [32, 33] or modifying the structural phase of the material [34], the nonlinear photocurrents can be considered as a signal that is more flexible to the crystal symmetry constraints, and a versatile route to take advantange of the electronic properties of moiré patterns. Several features of twisted materials can strongly impact the overall magnitude of the shift conductivity: For twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and in the THz regime, it can reach 10^{3}~{}\mathrm{\mu\cdot nm\cdot V^{-2}} depending on the value of the applied strain [22]. This value is sensitive to the presence of particle hole symmetry, encapsulation with hBN and perturbative effects from a substrate [35]. When the number of layers N\geq 5, the shift conductivity can increase up to 10^{4}~{}\mathrm{\mu\cdot nm\cdot V^{-2}}, whose origin relies on the virtual transitions between the multiple flat bands involved [36]. Motivated by the facts mentioned above, and the rebirth of the interest in semi-direct materials to observe maximal SC, we study the origin, intensity and the potential tunability of this signal in helical twisted trilayer graphene (hTTG). Our paper is organized as follows: In section II we show that an upper bound of the SC response is given by the product of the density of states involving two bands, whose distance corresponds to the energy of the incident photon. This upper bound is a complement to a previous upper limit reported for the shift conductivity in extended systems [37]. In this section we also present the model for hTTG, which we later use in section III to provide the numerical results and a discussion about the outcomes of the work. Finally, in section IV we state the main conclusions of the article."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07823v1,"Interlayer charge transfer induced by electronic instabilities in the 
natural van der Waals hetrostructure 4H-TaS","The natural van der Waals heterostructure 4Hb-TaS2 composed of alternating 1T- and 1H-TaS2 layers serves as a platform for investigating the electronic correlations and layer-dependent properties of novel quantum materials. The temperature evolution of the conductivity spectra \sigma(\omega) obtained through infrared spectroscopy elucidates the influence of band modifications associated with the charge-density-wave (CDW) superlattice on the 1T layer, resulting in a room-temperature energy gap, \Delta_{\rm CDW}\approx 0.35 eV. Supported by density functional theory calculations, we attribute the behavior of interband transitions to the convergence of the layers, which amplifies the charge transfer from the 1T to the 1H layers, progressing as the temperature decreases. This phenomenon leads to an enhanced carrier density. The presence of an energy gap and the temperature-tunable charge transfer within the bulk of 4Hb-TaS2 – driven by layer-dependent CDW states – contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of other complex compounds of transition-metal dichalcogenides.","References Ribak et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07746v1,Lorentz Skew Scattering Mechanism in Nonreciprocal Magneto-Transport,"We unveil a new mechanism of nonreciprocal magneto-transport from cooperative action of Lorentz force and skew scattering. The significance of this Lorentz skew scattering mechanism lies in that it dominates both longitudinal and transverse responses in highly conductive systems, and it exhibits a scaling behavior distinct from all known mechanisms. At low temperature, it shows a cubic scaling in linear conductivity, whereas the scaling becomes quartic at elevated temperature when phonon scattering kicks in. We develop its microscopic formulation and reveal its close connection with Berry curvature on Fermi surface. Applying our theory to surface transport in topological crystalline insulator SnTe and bulk transport in Weyl semimetals leads to significant results, suggesting a new route to achieve giant transport nonreciprocity in high-mobility materials with topological band features.","References Rikken et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07633v1,Stretched-exponential stress dynamics in chain of springs and masses model of crystals: analytical results and MD simulations.,"The model of chain of springs and masses, originating from works of Schrödinger (1914) and Pater (1974), is found suitable as an analytical description of dynamics of layers in oriented FCC crystals. An analytical extension of that model has been provided for the case of linear-in-time ramp pressure applied to sample surface. Examples are provided of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirming the usefulness of the model in description of dynamic effects in steal 310S under pressure. For large sizes of samples and for long times, an improved version of proposed earlier interlayer potential has been provided for the use in lammps, resulting in a perfect harmonic inter-layer interaction, compensating the inclusion of higher-order terms in potential energy, proportional to x^{4}. The results of MD simulations suggest that the dynamics of the model of chain of springs and masses of perfectly ordered matter is describable by stretched-exponential time functions and it is characterized by simple scaling properties in time.","1 Samples and data processing. For creation of samples of steel 310S (FCC structure) we used either lammps [1] or Atomsk [2], as well custom-written Perl scripts. After testing available interatomic potentials ([3], [4, 5, 6, 7]) we choose the EAM potential of Bonny et al. [3] as the one that reproduces correctly basic physical properties of the material and as the most efficient one computationally. Moreover, that potential has been developed to model defects in steel of similar composition and therefore is suitable for our planned future modelling Some results were computed by using Artur potential [4] as well. For the simulations of applied pressure it is important to set force for the lower region in X direction to 0. That causes that the region will reflect the incoming pressure wave. The upper region is defined as rigid. We use a typical [8] simulation setup applied in similar modelling, as shown in figure 1. The shear surface stress P^{\rm 0}_{\rm{xy}} is created by applying a force to atoms in the upper region while on the bottom surface of the lower region conditions are imposed of zero forces and velocities of atoms. The force F applied to atoms must be oriented in X-direction and have a value such that when summed for all atoms in the upper region and divided by the surface area in X-Z direction it will result in desired value of pressure P^{\rm 0}_{\rm{xy}}. We find by testing that the width of upper and lower regions in figure 1 may be made as small as the distance between atomic layers in Y-direction, i.e. that these regions contain one only layer of atoms. Statistical averaging of physical quantities along X direction was done by using Perl scripts. That step, i.e. the proper averaging of data within well defined layers of atoms, is one of the most important ones in the entire data analysis. Additional analysis of data was often accompanied by creating movies with process automation utilizing bash, Perl, Gnuplot scripts, and ffmpeg. Figure 1: Sample crossection in X-Y directions for modelling dynamics of dislocations (not to scale). For a proper capture of dislocation dynamics we need a long size in X-direction, which is direction of dislocation movement (and Burgers vector orientation). X-Y plane is the gliding plane while dislocation line is perpendicular to it, i.e. it is in Z-direction and it is denoted by large red circle in the center. Position of dislocation is M unit cells from cell bottom and N unit cells from sample top. Open circles symbolize atoms arranged in X-Z layers: there are two layers in this case in upper and two in lower regions. Two blocks of atoms: The bottom block has N=120 columns of atoms, and is elongated by half a unit cell along X, i.e. 0.5/120=0.00417 The top block has N=121 columns of atoms, and is shortened by half a unit cell along X, i.e. 0.5/121=0.00413 After that, both blocks are merged together. A proper organization of data post-processing, as shown in a simplified manner in Fig. 2 as an illustration of our own process, requires large attention and a good planning. We deal with thousands of files, and terabytes of data sets for analysing. Figure 2: Simplified schematic diagram of data post processing"
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07522v1,Protected chaos in a topological lattice,"The erratic nature of chaotic behavior is thought to erode the stability of periodic behavior, including topological oscillations. However, we discover that in the presence of chaos, non-trivial topology not only endures but also provides robust protection to chaotic dynamics within a topological lattice hosting non-linear oscillators. Despite the difficulty in defining topological invariants in non-linear settings, non-trivial topological robustness still persists in the parametric state of chaotic boundary oscillations. We demonstrate this interplay between chaos and topology by incorporating chaotic Chua’s circuits into a topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit. By extrapolating from the linear limit to deep into the non-linear regime, we find that distinctive correlations in the bulk and edge scroll dynamics effectively capture the topological origin of the protected chaos. Our findings suggest that topologically protected chaos can be robustly achieved across a broad spectrum of periodically-driven systems, thereby offering new avenues for the design of resilient and adaptable non-linear networks.","Chaotic dynamics, despite being notoriously unpredictable and sensitive to initial conditions [1], govern the behavior of many complex systems [2, 3] such as networks of coupled oscillators and dynamical non-linear lattices [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In such coupled dynamical networks, even small perturbations are amplified rapidly, leading to complex global behaviors [4, 9, 10]. While synchronization can appear at times, chaos, with its inherent unpredictability, disrupts this order and makes the system decidedly irregular in the long run. However, we discover that this well-established pattern of behavior may no longer hold when a network of coupled chaotic oscillators is arranged in a topological manner. Despite the lack of well-defined band topological invariants in non-linear systems, we find that topological robustness potently persists, even as chaotic behavior introduces randomness that would erode the bulk periodicity and threaten any semblance of topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Surprisingly, not only can topological robustness be well-preserved in certain chaotic systems, it even protects chaotic oscillations from strong perturbations, demonstrating a parametric robustness inherited from band topology. This protection stems from the stability of non-trivial edge oscillations, whose absence would lead to the rapid decay of bulk chaotic attractors, as observed in the case of trivial edge oscillations. In this work, we choose chaotic Chua circuits among various potential candidates to implement the Lorenz system, as they offer an experimentally accessible and easily tunable platform for investigating chaotic dynamics [11, 12, 13]. Identical Chua circuits are coupled such that they form a one-dimensional topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit array with onsite chaotic Chua oscillators [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. In our setup, the degree of non-linearity can be adjusted by tuning the current-voltage characteristics of the Chua diodes, with high non-linearity typically expected to substantially distort linear eigenstates. In non-linear systems, a key challenge in attributing robustness to band topology is the difficulty in defining bulk topological invariants [23], which are inherently properties of linear band structures. To overcome this, we continuously deform the Chua circuit array from its linear SSH limit by tuning its non-linear Chua diodes. Notably, the topological edge oscillations are preserved remarkably well even deep into the non-linear regime. This allows for the identification of non-linear topological boundaries, which can be made further precise with the aid of machine learning techniques. Importantly, we emphasize that although we shall demonstrate topologically protected chaos only with Chua circuits, this novel form of robustness is not specific to the Lorenz equations, and extends generally to chaotic attractors with well-defined bounded oscillations. Furthermore, the physical implementation is applicable to any medium which can host the requisite non-linear dynamics, not just electronic circuit metamaterials. As such, our discovery of topologically protected chaos also opens up new possibilities in fields as diverse as neural networks [24, 25], chaotic quantum dynamics [26] and mechanical metamaterials [27]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07456v1,Nonlinear Hall Effect in Insulators,"The nonlinear Hall effect refers to the nonlinear voltage response that is transverse to the applied electric field. Recent studies have shown that the quantum geometric quantities on Fermi surfaces serve as fundamental contributors to the nonlinear Hall effect, suggesting that the nonlinear Hall effect occurs mainly in metals. However, in this work, we demonstrate that insulators can also exhibit the nonlinear Hall effect. We find that for an insulator driven at a finite frequency, a series of frequency dependent quantum geometric quantities from the occupied bands can give rise to a nonvanishing nonlinear Hall conductivity. The nonlinear Hall conductivity is frequency dependent: at resonance, it represents the inter-band transition enabled nonlinear Hall current; near resonance, it represents the nonlinear order polarization transverse to the electric field. We further connect the nonlinear Hall conductivity to the Kleinman conjecture in nonlinear optics and point out that the nonlinear Hall effect is generally allowed in insulators given the driving frequency near resonance. For the candidate materials, we consider the biased Bernal bilayer graphene under uniaxial strain and propose polarization resolved second harmonic microscopy to detect the nonlinear Hall effect there.","References (1) E.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07369v1,Topological Hall-like behavior of multidomain ferromagnets,"We investigate the emergence of topological Hall-like (THE-like) signals in disordered multidomain ferromagnets. Non-monotonic behavior in Hall resistivity, commonly attributed to topological spin textures such as skyrmions, is produced in a random resistor network model without any chirality. It arises from simple mechanisms of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in combination with the domain wall scattering. By varying domain configurations and domain wall resistances, we explore the conditions under which the non-monotonic resistivity can be enhanced. Our results emphasize the need for careful analysis in distinguishing between true topological Hall effects and artifacts caused by domain disorders.","The topological Hall effect (THE) has emerged as an essential tool for detecting and studying topological spin textures like magnetic skyrmions in chiral magnets. The THE manifests as a contribution to the Hall resistivity that is neither due to the ordinary Hall effect nor the anomalous Hall effect, and often appears as a characteristic hump or dip in the Hall signal as a function of magnetic field [1, 2]. This distinctive nonmonotonic Hall response has been widely interpreted as a hallmark of skyrmion spin textures, which can impart Berry phase effects on conduction electrons [3]. The THE arises from the interaction of conduction electrons with the non-coplanar spin texture of skyrmions. As an electron moves through a skyrmion, its spin adiabatically follows the local magnetization direction, accumulating a Berry phase. This Berry phase can be described as an emergent magnetic field experienced by the electron, which deflects its motion and gives rise to the THE [4, 5]. The magnitude of the THE is related to the topological charge density of the skyrmion texture. (a) (b) Figure 1: The blue and red circles in panel (a) depict the opposite spin polarization in different domains of the ferromagnetic material.(a) Ferromagnetic Domains. (b) Resistor Network where blue boxes would indicate a resistor with spin down in the system and the red boxes indicating a spin up resistor, The black boxes depict the giant magneto-resistance effect (domain wall resistance). Early observations of THE in bulk B20 compounds like MnSi, MnGe, and FeGe showed a clear hump feature in the Hall resistivity corresponding to the skyrmion lattice phase [1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], which provided strong evidence linking THE to skyrmion formation. Other materials, such as the frustrated triangular-lattice magnet Gd2PdSi3, showed a large THE associated with a field-induced skyrmion phase [11]. However, the situation is more complex in thin film and multilayer systems that have recently attracted interest for their potential to host room-temperature skyrmions[12]. In multilayer films composed of ferromagnetic and heavy metal layers, such as [Ir/Fe/Co/Pt] stacks [13, 14], oxide heterostructures like SrRuO3/SrIrO3 [15] where electric field control of THE has been demonstrated [16], or in (Ca,Ce)MnO3 where a very large THE has been demonstrated [17], the THE features in these systems are often more subtle than in bulk materials. Careful analysis is required to extract the topological contribution from the measured Hall signal by accounting for the ordinary and anomalous Hall effects. Recent works have revealed several important considerations for interpreting THE in multilayer systems. The magnitude of THE does not always scale simply with skyrmion density, and factors like multi-band transport, interfacial effects, and non-adiabatic processes can complicate this relationship [18, 19]. These findings highlight the importance of considering complex spin configurations and magnetic phases beyond isolated skyrmions. Furthermore, The effective Hall coefficient relevant to THE may differ from the ordinary Hall coefficient due to multi-band effects, leading to quantitative discrepancies between observed and predicted THE magnitudes and dimensional crossover effects as the film thickness is varied can dramatically influence skyrmion stability and THE [20]. For example, in Mn-doped Bi2Te3 films, THE was observed only at a critical thickness corresponding to the onset of surface state hybridization [21] as well as the transitions between isolated skyrmions, skyrmion clusters, and labyrinthine stripe domains, plays a crucial role in determining THE behavior . In these interfacial systems, like the work of work by Raju et al.[14] on Ir/Fe/Co/Pt multilayers, THE measurements were complemented by direct magnetic imaging techniques like magnetic force microscopy (MFM), which revealed the presence of skyrmions evolving from labyrinth domains, another work by Wang et al. have used in addition to Hall measurement, the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect microscope, and they have observed in multilayer system of Ta/CoFeB/MgO the transformation of an initial labyrinthine domain patter into dense array of skyrmions [22], with the same behavior observed in Co/Pt nanostructured films [23]. However, not all studies use imaging techniques to confirm the presence of skyrmions, some of them rely only on the hump in the Hall resistivity measurement as a signature of topological spin textures, like in the Heusler alloy Mn2CoAl where the nucleation and annihilation of skyrmions have been interpreted through THE [24]. Kumar et al. used the same THE signals as a signature for the presence of antiskyrmions in another Heusler alloys Mn1.4Pt1-xPdxSn and Mn1.4Pt1-xRhxSn [25]. Another example is found in the thin films of the Heisenberg ferromagnet EuO where they interpreted the peaks in Hall resistivity is suggestive of a 2D topologically nontrivial spin structure even in absence of supporting imaging of this spin textures [26]. The interfacial effects in multilayers, such as the coupling between skyrmions across layers and the formation of hybrid chiral domain walls [27], as well as the interface modification of Berry curvature may lead to the Hall effect peaks and can influence THE in ways not captured by simple models [28]. While THE remains a powerful probe of skyrmion physics, recent studies have raised important caveats about its interpretation. Gerber pointed out that nonmonotonic Hall signals resembling the THE can arise in heterogeneous ferromagnets with competing ordinary and anomalous Hall effects, necessitating careful analysis in interpreting nonmonotonic Hall signals as definitive evidence for topological spin textures [29] and Fijalkowski et al. demonstrated that coexisting magnetic phases in topological insulator heterostructures could produce an AHE-associated response that resembles THE but is not of topological origin [30], and they showed that overlapping AHE signals with opposite signs from surface and bulk magnetic phases could mimic THE-like features. These multiples overlapping AHE signals that mimic THE-like signals could also arise in thin films from thickness variation, defect and interface modification [31], and SrRuO3 thin films are used as a model system to illustrate these issues. Many studies claiming to observe skyrmions in SrRuO3 can be alternatively explained by AHE inhomogeneities[20]. Similarly, Tai et al. developed methods to distinguish genuine THE from artifact ”THE” signals from two-component AHE [32], where they proposed using minor loop measurements, temperature dependence, and gate dependence to differentiate between actual topological signals and AHE artifacts. To address these concerns, Li et al. reported THE in a simplified topological insulator-magnetic insulator bilayer structure of Bi2Se3/BaFe12O19 that excludes the possibility of competing AHE signals [39]. They observed pure THE at low temperatures (2-3 K) and the coexistence of THE and AHE at intermediate temperatures, with opposite temperature dependencies. Their results demonstrate genuine THE in a topological insulator system [34, 35] and highlight the role of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in stabilizing skyrmions. These recent developments underscore the need for careful analysis when interpreting THE signals. Direct imaging of spin textures, systematic exclusion of competing effects, and examination of temperature and field dependences are crucial for establishing the topological origin of observed Hall signatures. The purpose of this work is to prove theoretically that the THE-like signal can be simply induced by anomalous Hall effect of multidomain ferromagnets. The multidomain structure is modeled by a resistor network. We show that the typipcal THE-like nonmonotonic behavior in the hall resistivity can also arise from domain wall scattering in the absence of any topological textures."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07329v2,Magnetic Vortex Dynamics on a Spherical Cap,"By tailoring geometrical properties of magnetic nanocap structures, new possibilities appear to control its magnetic properties, such as the dynamics of magnetic vortices. Here, we develop an approach to describe dynamics of magnetic vortices on a spherical cap. Analytic results for the gyrofrequency of the vortex state are in a good agreement with micromagnetic simulations.","Curvilinear magnetism is a framework to analyze geometry-governed effects and predict modifications of magnetic responses in geometrically curved nanostructures [1]. The theory introduces emergent interactions, which are are responsible for different families of curvature-induced effects including topological patterning and magnetochiral effects [2]. For instance, the appearance of a skyrmion state in core-shell particles with easy-normal anisotropy [3] is a fingerprint of the topological patterning. Other examples include nonorientable Möbius rings, which support magnetic vortex states and different topologically protected domain walls [4], and spherical shells with easy-surface anisotropy favouring a 3D onion state in thin spherical shells [5] and whirligig state in thick shells [6]. Among different curvilinear magnetic systems, there is one group of the so-called spherical cap structures, which can be prepared by deposition of a magnetic thin film on non-magnetic spheres [7, 1]. Depending on the magnetic anisotropy of the thin film, either radially magnetized magnetic structures or magnetic vortices can be realized in magnetic nanocaps. Magnetic vortices were actively studied in planar films and planar nanodots [8]. A vortex state is characterized by the in-plane magnetization circulation following the edge of a nanodot and possessing an out-of-plane magnetization component (polarity) at the location of the vortex core. In the case of curved geometries, magnetic vortices acquire new properties in comparison with their planar counterparts. This includes polarity-circulation coupling of the vortex on a spherical cap and shell [5, 9], controllable switching of the vortex magnetochirality on a hemispherical cap [10], chirality symmetry breaking upon switching of the vortex core [11], and nonlocal chiral symmetry breaking effect in cap structures [12, 13]. Spherical geometries are well studied with respect to static magnetic distributions [14, 15, 5, 16, 6, 17]. The study of magnetization dynamics of topological textures is one of the important and challenging problems of the curvilinear magnetism. At the moment, dynamics of topological soliton is well described mainly for the tubular geometry [18]. General aspects of the dynamics of solitons in curved geometries are studied for skyrmions [19, 9]. In particular, the skyrmion gyromotion was studied analytically using a Thiele-like collective variable approach [19]. Investigations of magnetic dynamics of vortices in curved geometries include the description of resonance excitations [20], polarity and circulation switching [14, 11, 10, 7]. The use of the Thiele-like approach for the vortex dynamics becomes more complex due to their nonlocalized nature. Here, we develop a theoretical approach to describe the motion of magnetic vortices in nanoshells of spherical geometry. The method is based on the image vortex technique [21, 22], which we extend to curved geometries. Using mapping from a sphere to a complex plane, we derive equations of motion of magnetization on a spherical cap. We calculate the gyrofrequency of the vortex core and validate our analytic theory with micromagnetic simulations."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07316v1,"Tilted Light, Giant Currents: Engineering Floquet Moiré Patterns for Scalable Photocurrents","While intense laser irradiation and moiré engineering have independently proven powerful for tuning material properties on demand in condensed matter physics, their combination remains unexplored. Here we exploit tilted laser illumination to create spatially modulated light-matter interactions, leading to two striking phenomena in graphene. First, using two lasers tilted along the same axis, we create a quasi-1D supercell hosting a network of Floquet topological states that generate controllable and scalable photocurrents spanning the entire irradiated region. Second, by tilting lasers along orthogonal axes, we establish a 2D polarization moiré pattern giving rise to closed orbital propagation of Floquet states, reminiscent of bulk Landau states. These features, imprinted in the bulk of the irradiated region and controlled through laser wavelength and tilt angles, establish a new way for engineering quantum states through spatially modulated light-matter coupling.","The quest to manipulate material properties on demand drives much of modern research in materials science and condensed matter physics [1, 2]. Two particularly promising approaches have emerged: dynamic control through light-matter interactions [3] and structural control through spatial modulation [4]. While each approach has shown remarkable success independently, the combination of these approaches, though largely unexplored, offers unprecedented control over material properties. Such combination can be achieved in two ways: by illuminating twisted structures [5, 6], or, as we do here, by generating space-dependent modulation through carefully tuned lasers. Strong coupling with light has proven particularly powerful, with theoretical [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and experimental [12, 13] studies demonstrating gap opening with hybrid Floquet-Bloch states. Recent breakthroughs, including direct observation of these states in graphene [14, 15, 16] and beyond Dirac materials [17], and the modulation of nonlinear optical response in 2D materials [18, 19], have validated theoretical predictions and opened new frontiers in light-based material control [3]. Perhaps most striking is the ability to induce Floquet topological phases in otherwise trivial materials [9, 20, 21], characterized by non-trivial Chern numbers and robust edge states [22, 23, 24, 25]. The recent observation of light-induced anomalous Hall effect [26] exemplifies their far-reaching consequences, while various electron-photon interaction mechanisms enable spin-polarized photocurrents in both 3D [27] and 2D topological insulators [28], and control of quantum Hall states [29, 30]. Figure 1: Irradiation scheme: Two tilted lasers create an interference pattern on a 2D material. This pattern defines a new commensurate length, outlining a supercell. The electron-photon interaction varies locally based on the position in the supercell. Here we demonstrate that combining these approaches through tilted laser illumination creates spatially modulated light-matter interactions with unprecedented control capabilities. Using graphene as a model system and experimental setups similar to those in 2D optoelectronics [26, 16], we reveal two novel scenarios: 1. Irradiation with two lasers tilted along the same axis produces a quasi-1D supercell, resulting in a network of Floquet topological states that span the entire irradiated region. Unlike the edge-confined states observed in previous studies [26], these bulk topological states generate controllable and scalable photocurrents whose magnitude can be tuned by adjusting the lasers’ tilt. 2. Tilting lasers along orthogonal axes generates a 2D polarization moiré pattern, creating alternating regions of laser polarization. This configuration gives rise to closed orbital propagation of Floquet states, reminiscent of bulk states in quantum Hall systems. These findings establish a new way of engineering quantum states through spatially modulated light-matter coupling. In the following, after introducing the theoretical framework, we build our understanding progressively: from the known case of perpendicular illumination to the emergence of bulk topological states under tilted illumination, culminating in the creation of 2D moiré patterns and their implications for controlling quantum states in materials."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07256v1,Surface Exciton Polariton,"In this Letter, we have developed a theory describing surface exciton polariton (SEPs) that accounts for the spatial dispersion of the dielectric constant connected with exciton momentum. Due to strong coupling between light and bulk excitons in the frequency separation, \hbar\omega_{LT}, between the longitudinal and transverse exciton, the SEP is formed and behaves at partially light and partially matter. The dispersion of the SEP was found through a combined solution of Maxwell’s and Thomas-Hopfield’s equations. The analytical theory describes SEPs at any bulk exciton/vacuum interface and provides its complete dispersion if one knows \hbar\omega_{LT}, the exciton effective mass, M, and the high frequency dielectric constant, \kappa_{\infty}. The presented theory is in excellent agreement with the only numerical modeling of this problem, which was conducted for SEPs at a ZnO/vacuum interface. Calculations show the spatial dispersion of the dielectric constant leads to rather small broadening of the photon-like quasi-particle and suggests using SEPs for long-range coherence transfer.","References 1 Maier, S.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07931v1,Time-dependent radiative heat flux due to started thermal radiation,"We develop a theoretical formalism for time-dependent radiative heat flux from one object to another in the case where the former starts to radiate at a certain time. The time dependence is demonstrated for the heat flux between two isolated nanoparticles. After one particle starts to radiate, the emitted energy first reaches the other one with a delay according to electromagnetic retardation, and afterwards the flux shows oscillatory exponential relaxation to its stationary value. For the room or higher temperature radiation, the oscillation period and relaxation time are determined by the resonance frequency and damping rate of the particle polarizability, respectively, being equal to dozens of femtoseconds and one picosecond for silicon carbide particles. At cryogenic temperatures, the relaxation time depends on the thermal wavelength.","Radiative heat transfer at micro- and nanoscale has been studied intensively in the current century, with promising ideas for a variety of applications [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, most of the studies consider stationary conditions, where the heat transfer does not depend on time. Note that one can still study temporal correlations of the stationary transfer via computing the corresponding second order correlation functions [12], describing the heat transfer fluctuations, which are the cornerstone for the Green-Kubo relations [13, 14]. These functions were computed also for electromagnetic energy density [15]. One important and by now well understood nonstationary problem concerns system thermalization, i.e., relaxation towards global thermal equilibrium of the system of objects with different initial temperatures. This process has been studied for various systems using the heat balance equation, where the heat fluxes between the objects depend on time via the time-dependent temperatures [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. A more recently studied nonstationary scenarios involve time modulation of the objects’ dielectric functions [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] or temperatures [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. It was shown that this modulation can fundamentally affect heat radiation and transfer: For example, the heat emission of an object can be coherent between different frequencies [23, 24], and a colder object in the proximity of a hotter one can experience an active cooling [25]. In this work, we consider another nonstationary condition: Thermal radiation does not exist forever but only starting from a certain time. Such a condition leads to a transient regime for the radiated electromagnetic (EM) field until a steady state is reached. Specifically, in Sec. III, we derive a formula for heat flux from one object (object 1) to another (object 2) in the case where the former starts its radiation at time t=0. The two objects can be of arbitrary shape, size, and material, and they can be surrounded by other arbitrary objects. Our derivation employs fluctuational electrodynamics in time domain, under the assumption of local equilibrium inside each object. The derived flux contains the permittivity and Green’s tensors in time domain, thus rigorously accounting for the time dependence, including EM retardation. In Sec. IV, we give the flux in the limit where objects 1 and 2 reduce to small spherical particles, a practically important scenario being feasible for numerical computations. We demonstrate the developed formalism in Sec. V for two small particles in isolation, finding the time dependence of the flux for different temperatures and interparticle distances."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07694v1,Collective multimode strong coupling in plasmonic nanocavities,"Plasmonic nanocavities enable access to the quantum properties of matter, but are often simplified to single mode models despite their complex multimode structure. Here, we show that off-resonant plasmonic modes in fact play a crucial role in strong coupling, and determine the onset of a novel collective interaction. Our analysis reveals that n strongly coupled plasmonic modes, introduce up to n(n+1)/2 oscillation frequencies that depend on their coupling strengths and detunings from the quantum emitter. Furthermore, we identify three distinct regions as the coupling strength increases: (1) single mode, (2) multimode, and (3) collective multimode strong coupling. Our findings enhance the understanding of quantum dynamics in realistic plasmonic environments and demonstrate their potential to achieve ultra-fast energy transfer in light-driven quantum technologies.","Strong coupling between light and matter is essential across various fields, as it connects nanophotonics, materials science, chemistry, and quantum technologies [1, 2, 3]. Strong light-matter coupling enables quantum emitters (QE) to coherently exchange energy with light, creating new polaritonic states that play a critical role in quantum information systems [4]. To reach the strong coupling regime, quantum emitters (such as molecular dyes, cold atoms and quantum dots) must be placed within regions of intense light, where light-matter interaction rates outpace losses. Therefore, plasmonic nanocavities (such as metallic nanostructures, dimers, and nanoparticle on mirror cavities) are ideal for realising strong coupling [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] as localised surface plasmons allow for exceptional subwavelength light confinement and extreme coupling strengths [11, 12]. In addition, they are straightforward to synthesize, chemically stable, and facilitate the precise positioning and alignment of molecules for reliable and highly reproducible experiments [13, 14, 15]. Theoretical descriptions reveal how these new polariton states emerge, and continue to guide experiments towards the generation of new quantum states. Although significant advancements have been made in describing QEs within plasominc nanocavities - accounting for more complex vibrational structures and larger numbers of molecules [16, 17, 18] - usually the underlying assumption is that they interact with just a single cavity mode. The single mode approximation originates from the analysis of Fabry-Pérot and photonic crystal cavities [19, 20, 21, 22], where modes are spectrally separated relative to their coupling strengths. However, multimode coupling has been shown to play an important role experimentally in some optical cavities [23, 24, 25, 26]. Plasmonic nanocavities in particular support a dense collection of modes that overlap in frequency, and often all exhibit significant field enhancements [27, 28, 29]. Although coupling to multiple plasmonic modes has been previously considered [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35] in general, the underlying origin and impact of the complex quantum dynamics that emerge in these multimode systems is still not known. In this work, we demonstrate that multiple, off-resonant plasmonic modes can significantly dominate the quantum dynamics of QEs in plasmonic nanocavities. In particular, we show that n strongly coupled modes introduce up to n(n+1)/2 distinct oscillation frequencies in the QEs excited state population. These frequency components depend on the number of strongly coupled modes, and their respective coupling strengths and detunings from the QE. In fact, we identify three distinct regions defined by the dipole moment: (1) single mode strong coupling, (2) multimode strong coupling, and (3) collective multimode strong coupling. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the quantum dynamics in multi-mode environments, and demonstrate how realistic plasmonic nanocavities can be used to achieve ultra-fast energy transfer, for use in light-driven quantum technologies."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07614v1,Two-dimensional room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors,"To realize ferromagnetic semiconductors with high Curie temperature T\rm_{C} is still a challenge in spintronics. Recent experiments have obtained two-dimensional (2D) room temperature ferromagnetic metals, such as monolayers MnSe2 and Cr3Te6. In this paper, by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we proposed a way to obtain 2D high T\rm_{C} ferromagnetic semiconductors through element replacement in these ferromagnetic metals. High T\rm_{C} ferromagnetic semiconductors are predicted in the monolayers (Mn, D)Se2 and (Cr, D)3Te6, where element D is taken as vacancy, 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal elements. For the concentrations of D from 1/9 to 1/3, there are about 10 ferromagnetic semiconductors with T\rm_{C} above 200 K, including (Cr5/6, W1/6)3Te6 and (Cr4/6, Mo2/6)3Te6 with T\rm_{C} above 300 K. In addition, Mn(Se6/8, Sb2/8)2 is also predicted to be a 2D ferromagnetic semiconductor with T\rm_{C} above 300 K. Considering the fast developments on fabrication and manipulation of 2D materials, our theoretical results propose a way to explore the high temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors from experimentally obtained 2D high temperature ferromagnetic metals through element replacement approach.","References Dietl [2010] T.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07545v1,Terahertz control of surface topology probed with subatomic resolution,"Light-induced phase transitions offer a method to dynamically modulate topological states in bulk complex materials[1, 2, 3, 4]. Yet, next-generation devices demand nanoscale architectures with contact resistances near the quantum limit[5] and precise control over local electronic properties[6]. The layered material \ceWTe2 has gained attention as a likely Weyl semimetal[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], with topologically protected linear electronic band crossings hosting massless chiral fermions. Here, we demonstrate a topological phase transition facilitated by light-induced shear motion of a single atomic layer at the surface of bulk \ceWTe2, thereby opening the door to nanoscale device concepts. Ultrafast terahertz fields enhanced at the apex of an atomically sharp tip[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30] resonantly couple to the key interlayer shear mode of \ceWTe2 via a ferroelectric dipole at the interface[31, 32, 33, 34], inducing a structural phase transition at the surface to a metastable state. Subatomically resolved differential imaging, combined with hybrid-level density functional theory, reveals a shift of 7 \pm 3 picometres in the top atomic plane. Tunnelling spectroscopy links electronic changes across the phase transition with the electron and hole pockets in the band structure, suggesting a reversible, light-induced annihilation of the topologically-protected Fermi arc surface states in the top atomic layer.","With technology reaching the limits of conventional design and fabrication, next-generation device concepts based on nanoscale architectures, terahertz clock rates, and complex material systems are becoming increasingly important. For example, light-induced phase transitions in complex materials promise a route to ultrafast switching of versatile electronic and photonic devices[1, 2, 3, 4]. Materials with switchable, topologically non-trivial phases are especially intriguing due to their symmetry-protected states, which offer unique electronic properties. Theoretical calculations[7, 8, 12, 9, 13, 15, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 20, 22, 35, 23, 11] and experimental studies with scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM)[16, 17, 18], angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)[10, 13, 19, 9, 8, 12, 11], and transport measurements[15] suggest that the non-centrosymmetric Td phase of bulk \ceWTe2 is a type-II Weyl semimetal at low temperature. This classification refers to the presence of three-dimensional (3D) linear electronic band crossings at the touching points of electron and hole pockets. The absence of inversion symmetry leads to pairs of Weyl points with opposite chirality, which are non-degenerate in momentum space and connected by topologically protected Fermi arc surface states[7]. It has been shown that strong terahertz fields can resonantly excite an interlayer shear mode[21], while mid-infrared and near-infrared pulses can non-resonantly drive the bulk lattice structure into a metastable state via the shear mode[36, 22, 37, 23, 24, 38, 21, 39]. The light-induced structural phase transition can restore inversion symmetry, which leads to an annihilation of the Weyl points and, hence, a topological electronic phase transition from a Weyl semimetal to a trivial semimetal. In contrast to its bulk form, monolayer \ceWTe2 is a quantum spin Hall insulator in its low-temperature ground state[40]. Moreover, the stacking of few-layer \ceWTe2 leads to a spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization[31, 32, 33, 34]. The orientation of this ferroelectric dipole can be switched through a sliding motion of the top atomic layer, which can be induced by a vertical field on the scale of 0.1–0.2 V/nm (refs. [31, 34]). A similar shift of the top atomic layer of bulk \ceWTe2 has also been activated by static doping with adsorbed potassium atoms[41]. In the present work, we show that terahertz fields enhanced at an atomically sharp tip apex and polarized normal to a bulk \ceWTe2 surface couple to its ferroelectric dipole. When these terahertz near-fields exceed \qty1V/nm, they induce a localized structural phase transition of the topmost atomic layer, driving it from the low-temperature Td phase to a metastable state characterized by both a shear translation and an intralayer distortion. As a result, the electronic structure at the vacuum interface undergoes a phase transition, where the top layer can no longer host Fermi arc surface states. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations using hybrid exchange-correlation functionals are integral to this analysis, providing a comprehensive understanding of the ground and metastable states observed in experiments along with insight into the stability of the Weyl points."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07465v1,Hybrid skin-topological effect in non-Hermitian checkerboard lattices with large Chern numbers,"Non-Hermitian topology provides a research frontier for exploring topological phenomena, revealing novel topological effects and driving the development of emergent materials and platforms. Here, we explore the non-Hermitian Chern insulator phases and the hybrid skin-topological effects in checkerboard lattices with synthetic gauge fluxes. Such lattices can be realized in integrated silicon photonic nanocircuits and microresonators as well as in arrays of evanescently coupled helical optical waveguides. With a simple and tunable design, the system is found to support non-Hermitian hybrid skin topological effects, exhibiting corner skin effects when the lattice symmetry either C_{4} or C_{2}. An unconventional physical mechanism is revealed as the origin of such a transition which is connected to the corner-induced scattering between the multiple chiral edge channels. These properties are enabled by the large Chern number and the rich non-Hermitian topological edge states in our system, revealing the diverse non-Hermitian topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Our design offers excellent controllability and experimental feasibility, making it appealing for studying non-Hermitian topological phenomena.","Non-Hermitian physics provides an efficient framework for investigating non-equilibrium and open quantum systems as well as their classical counterparts, wherein dissipation, energy gain, and nonreciprocal couplings give rise to physical effects that are unattainable in conventional Hermitian systems. Non-Hermitian effects were found to result in versatile non-Hermitian phenomena such as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the exceptional points, lines and surfaces [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], the non-Hermitian topological band theory [15, 16, 17, 18], non- Bloch band theory [19, 20, 21, 22], unidirectional invisibility [23], and non-Hermitian states permutation [24]. The NHSE can be characterized by the spectral topology in the complex plane for finite non-Hermitian systems[25, 26]. Non-Hermitian skin modes coexist with topological edge modes and thus extends the bulk-edge correspondence to a more general picture[27]. A particularly promising frontier lies at the interface between topological physics and non-Hermitian physics. The interplay between NHSE and topological edge modes can bring interesting physics, such as hybrid topological-skin effects [28, 29, 30, 31], where corner localization is due to the coaction of topological localization and NHSE. Floquet non-Hermitian systems, with time-periodic modulation, provide a rich territory for exploring dynamic and topological phenomena [32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. Floquet systems can enable “synthetic dimensions” and create a platform to engineer desired effective Hamiltonian with unconventional properties [37]. Furthermore, Floquet systems can generate interesting spectral and dynamic properties, allowing for the emergence of various topological phases [38, 39, 40, 41]. The periodic modulation in Floquet systems introduces unique artificial gauge fields, enabling the manipulation of topological phases and the emergence of hybrid modes within a single setup. The hybrid topological-skin effects can be regarded as a second-order NHSE, where the topological edge states exhibit NHSE towards certain corner boundaries. However, the existing studies on hybrid topological-skin effects focus on the relatively simple regime where the spatial symmetry dictates the phenomena and there is only one branch of edge states. The hybrid topological-skin effects remain unknown in the regime with multiple branches of edge states where richer emergent phenomena are expected. In this work, we study the interplay between the NHSE and the topological physics in Floquet non-Hermitian checkerboard lattices. At the heart of our theory is the non-Hermitian topological phases induced only by gain and loss as well as their interplay with the artificial gauge fields. For concreteness, we design a coupled photonic waveguide lattice to realize the theoretical model, where the synthetic gauge flux is generated through the Floquet modulation. Nevertheless, the underlying physics is more general and is not restricted to photonic systems. For instance, the same physics can be realized also in cold atom systems where the synthetic gauge flux can be realized via other mechanisms. We find that our checkerboard lattices can efficiently generate non-Hermitian bands with large Chern numbers. The induced multiple chiral edge states have rich non-Hermitian skin effects due to that each branch of the chiral edge states have its own non-Hermitian properties. The total hybrid topological-skin effect comes from the NHSEs of the multiple chiral edge states as well as their interaction. We find that the scattering between these multiple non-Hermitian topological edge channels at the corner boundaries can induce an unconventional mechanism for the corner skin effect, which is distinct from the previous mechanisms solely associated with the nonreciprocal properties of the non-Hermitian edge states. With a simple and tunable design, the system is found to support non-Hermitian hybrid skin topological effects, exhibiting rich corner skin effects when the lattice symmetry is either C_{4} or C_{2}. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we introduce the non-Hermitian effective model of photonic checkerboard lattices and the topological phases, which provide the groundwork for realizing the NHSE. In Sec. III.1, we investigate the mixed skin-topological effects in the non-Hermitian effective model with C_{4} symmetry. We analyze the origin of corner skin modes from a dynamical perspective. The locations of different corner skin modes are influenced by various non-equilibrium interactions of topological edge states. In Sec. III.2, we explore the non-Hermitian effective model with C_{2} symmetry. Corner skin modes still exist, and we present the dynamic analysis process, finding that the locations of corner skin modes depend not only on the signs of group velocity and the gain/loss of topological edge states, but also on the contributions from the topological edge states. Finally, we conclude in Section IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07068v1,Majorana modes in quantum dots coupled via a floating superconducting island,"Majorana modes can be engineered in arrays where quantum dots (QDs) are coupled via grounded superconductors, effectively realizing an artificial Kitaev chain. Minimal Kitaev chains, composed by two QDs, can host fully-localized Majorana modes at discrete points in parameter space, known as Majorana sweet spots. Here, we extend previous works by theoretically investigating a setup with two QDs coupled via a floating superconducting island. We study the effects of the charging energy of the island and the properties of the resulting minimal Kitaev chain. We initially employ a minimal perturbative model, valid in the weak QD-island coupling regime, to derive analytic expressions for the Majorana sweet spots and the splitting of the ground state degeneracy as a function of tunable physical parameters. The conclusions from this perturbative approximation are then benchmarked using a microscopic model that explicitly describes the internal degrees of freedom of the island. Our work shows the existence of Majorana sweet spots, even when the island is not tuned at a charge-degeneracy point. In contrast to the Kitaev chains in grounded superconductors, these sweet spots involve a degeneracy between states with a well-defined number of particles.","Electrostatic interactions constitute a key aspect in the engineering of a large variety of quantum devices, including quantum dots (QDs), single-electron transistors and Cooper-pair boxes. The effects of charging energy have played a crucial role also in the design of many hybrid semiconductor-superconductor systems (see, for instance, the recent reviews [1, 2, 3]) and provide important tools for the study of subgap states in nanodevices fabricated with the goal of realizing topological superconductors [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Among the hybrid systems, artificial Kitaev chains, composed by QDs coupled via superconductors, have emerged as a promising platform to realize Majorana modes [19, 20, 21, 22], eventually reaching the topological regime from a bottom-up approach [23, 24]. In their minimal form, these chains are composed by two QDs coupled via a short grounded superconducting segment that mediates crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) and elastic cotunneling (COT) [19, 20]. These minimal Kitaev chains feature the so-called poor man’s Majorana modes (PMMs) at isolated sweet spots in parameter space where CAR and COT amplitudes are equal. Experiments in QDs coupled via grounded superconductors have demonstrated the onset of zero-energy states with transport and spectral properties compatible with the PMM interpretation in two [25, 26, 27] and three QD Kitaev chains [28, 29]. The main strategy to realize PMMs in these experiments relies on Andreev subgap states in the central superconductor, that dominate the coupling between the QDs. By controlling the energy of these states, it is possible to tune the relative amplitude of CAR and COT, which, in turn, allows for reaching the Majorana sweet spot [22, 30, 31, 32]. The high level of tunability reached makes artificial Kitaev chains a promising alternative to demonstrate the properties of Majorana modes, like Majorana fusion and braiding [33, 34, 35], and their applications, including qubits based on fermion parity [34, 36, 37]. In this work, we analyze the low-energy properties of two QDs coupled via a floating superconductor. We examine the role of the charging energy of this superconducting island and show that the system features sweet spots with Majorana modes well localized in the QDs, both at and away from the charge-degeneracy point. We first present a perturbative model based on the effective CAR and COT coupling between spin-polarized QDs, Sec. II. Within this minimal model, the effect of the island charging energy is similar to that of an inter-QD charging energy considered in Refs. [38, 39]. The predictions of the perturbative model are benchmarked in Sec. III by using a microscopic model that includes spin and Coulomb interactions of the QDs and explicitly describes the central island, based on the recently developed surrogate model [40, 41]. In the appendices we derive analytic expressions for the energy renormalization of the QDs and amplitudes of CAR and COT processes, and we further analyse the effects of charging energy and multiple subgap states in the floating superconductor. Our analysis is complementary to the recent investigations of electrostatic interactions in the QDs, which have shown their beneficial effect to improve the quality of PMMs [30, 38, 39] and their role to determine triple degeneracies in the energy spectra of these systems [42]. The effects of the charging energy have also been analyzed in superconducting nanowires aimed at more traditional realizations of Majorana modes. The interplay of electrostatic interactions with superconductivity in these systems has been at the core of many theoretical proposals concerning Majorana-mediated teleportation [43], topological qubits [44, 45], the initialization of topological systems [46, 47], Majorana fusion [48, 49], and braiding [50, 51, 52]. This work points to the emergence of PMMs in interacting systems that display the potential of reproducing these devices and phenomena in tunable hybrid QD–superconductor platforms. Such setups will open the door for the realization of qubits based on PMMs and the observation of unique Majorana properties, including Majorana teleportation and the topological Kondo effect [53].

Both the QD energy levels (\varepsilon_{\nu}) and the charge offset n_{g} on the superconductor can be controlled with gate electrodes (gold)."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06929v1,3D Magnetic Textures with Mixed Topology: Unlocking the Tunable Hopf Index,"Knots and links play a crucial role in understanding topology and discreteness in nature. In magnetic systems, twisted, knotted and braided vortex tubes manifest as Skyrmions, Hopfions, or screw dislocations. These complex textures are characterized by topologically non-trivial quantities, such as a Skyrmion number, a Hopf index H, a Burgers vector (quantified by an integer \nu), and linking numbers. In this work, we introduce a discrete geometric definition of H for periodic magnetic textures, which can be separated into contributions from the self-linking and inter-linking of flux tubes. We show that fractional Hopfions or textures with non-integer values of H naturally arise and can be interpreted as states of “mixed topology” that are continuously transformable to one of the multiple possible topological sectors. Our findings demonstrate a solid physical foundation for the Hopf index to take integer, non-integer, or specific fractional values, depending on the underlying topology of the system.","Figure 1: The Hopf index, H, can take fractional values when the background maps to an S^{1} line within the target space S^{2} of the magnetisation vector \mathbf{m} (upper panel). The magnetisation of the background, m_{z}^{\mathrm{b}} (depicted in the lower panel), determines the latitude of this line, effectively partitioning the S^{2} sphere into two topologically distinct subspaces. Knots, links, and braids are important across a wide range of scientific disciplines and are realisable in diverse physical platforms [1] such as water [2, 3], quantum gases [4], electromagnetic waves [5], DNA [6] superfluids [7], liquid crystals [8, 9, 10, 11], laser light [12, 13], high energy physics [14], frustrated magnets [15, 16] and chiral magnets [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. These phenomena are significant across length scales, from the smallest lengths in the early cosmology of the universe [23] to magnetic braids in the solar corona that store vast amounts of energy, making them several times hotter than the surface of the sun [24]. In magnetic materials, a multitude of topologically non-trivial textures has been realised [25], such as Skyrmions in 2D systems that can be readily manipulated with external fields and have potential in device applications [26, 27, 28, 29]. In 3D systems, the addition of a third spatial dimension enriches the applications of topology by enabling knots, links and braids, to form textures [30, 31] such as Hopfions [15, 32] or the recently predicted [21] and observed [22] screw dislocations. Also, 3D textures exhibit complex dynamics under applied drives [33, 34, 35, 36] making them interesting for applications. Notably, the family of topological defects has been expanded to include textures where non-integer Hopf indices have been calculated [37, 31]. Magnetic textures have typically been characterised based on the homotopy groups of spheres or mapping of the magnetisation \mathbf{m} from a base space to the target space S^{2}. The standard homotopy groups resulting in integer values of the Skyrmion number N_{\mathrm{sk}} and Hopf index H are \pi_{2}(S^{2})=\mathbb{Z} and \pi_{3}(S^{2})=\mathbb{Z} for 2D and 3D textures, respectively. Topological stability is then derived from the fact that knotted textures in a continuous field cannot be unwound without introducing singularities, violating the continuity of the field or modifying the base space. In this work, we show that a classification of 3D magnetic textures by homotopy groups is not sufficient to explain all classes of 3D topological magnetic defects such as Hopfions with non-integer Hopf indices. Instead, it is required to introduce the concept of flux tubes of the emergent magnetic field corresponding to the magnetic textures and analyse their linking numbers [38, 39, 40, 41, 42] as topological invariants as well. Using this concept, we demonstrate that arbitrary non-integer values of the Hopf index naturally arise for magnetic structures whose far-field or background magnetisation is non-collinear and maps to a S^{1} line on the S^{2} magnetisation sphere (see Fig. 1), despite a discrete representation of the Hopf index by a finite number of flux tubes. Examples of this are magnetic textures in a conical spiral [43, 44, 20, 45] or screw dislocation [21] background. Here we focus on magnetisation textures which are periodic along a certain axis labelled as z such that the background magnetisation m_{z}^{\mathrm{b}} (indicated by the black line in Fig. 1) generally divides the S^{2} target space into two subspaces [11, 46, 47, 48]. In this case, the base space changes from S^{3} to S^{2}\times S^{1}[49, 50, 22, 51, 52, 53]. Linking numbers must be introduced for the top and bottom target subspaces individually (self-linking), as well as additional inter-linking numbers involving both subspaces. Here the linking numbers and the Hopf index are calculated per period [54]. Furthermore, H is maintained as a measure of the Hopf index relative to the unlinked state that has the same configuration at the boundary of the volume [54, 55]. Magnetic textures with non-integer Hopf indices may be interpreted as states of “mixed topology”. Upon continuously tuning the background magnetisation m_{z}^{\mathrm{b}} up or down the magnetisation texture can continuously evolve and the Hopf index is continuously modified without changing the linking numbers. Once the background magnetisation m_{z}^{\mathrm{b}} reduces to a single point on S^{2} the Hopf index becomes integer. We illustrate this finding with a plethora of examples of smooth topological magnetic structures. This work provides a unique framework to characterise, explain and classify the wealth of 3D topological textures in magnetism. I.1 Hopf index in terms of flux tubes The Hopf index, or the helicity integral H, characterizes the topological properties of the field lines in a vector field \mathbf{F}, such as their linking number [56, 57, 58, 59, 54]. Field lines of \mathbf{F} are oriented curves that are tangent at every point to the direction of \mathbf{F}. The Hopf index can be written in a discrete geometric form for flux tubes 111Please note that every solenoidal vector field can be decomposed into flux tubes. This decomposition is not necessarily unique, but all decompositions lead to the same result in Eq. (1). For a definition of flux tubes we refer to Ref. [55]., i.e. bundles of field lines as [57, 61, 62, 42], H=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\Phi}}L_{ii}\Phi_{i}^{2}+2\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}i=1\\ j\neq i\end{subarray}}^{N_{\Phi}}L_{ij}\Phi_{i}\Phi_{j}. (1) Here, the vector field \mathbf{F} has been decomposed into N_{\Phi} flux tubes. \Phi_{i} is the (positive definite) flux of the flux tube labelled by the index i, i.e. \Phi_{i}=|\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{F}|, where the integration is over a cross-sectional area of the flux tube. The linking numbers L_{ii} and L_{ij} are respectively the oriented self-linking of the flux tube i and the oriented inter-linking of flux tubes i and j. L_{ij} is computed using the Gauss linkage formula L_{ij}=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{C_{i}}\oint_{C_{j}}\frac{\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r% }_{j}}{|(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j})|^{3}}\cdot(d\mathbf{r}_{i}\times d% \mathbf{r}_{j}) (2) using the contour C_{i} (C_{j}) following an arbitrarily chosen field line belonging to flux tube i (j) 222Equation (2) contains integrals over closed curves. For field lines that run vertically along the z-direction, the periodic boundary conditions imply that the field lines close trivially at infinity. An alternative is to define “winding numbers” of open field lines as in Ref. [55]. L_{ii} is calculated analogously using two field lines within the same tube i. The sign of the linking numbers L_{ii} and L_{ij} are determined by the direction of the field lines as depicted in Fig. 2 333Note that, in general, linking numbers can be written as the sum of twist and writhe components [39, 40, 41, 42]., with further examples in Sec. A of the Supplementary Material. Eq. (1) decomposes H into two contributions that, while geometrically distinct, are topologically equivalent. It also indicates that when the fluxes are non-integer, H can assume non-integer values. A significant advantage of Eq. (1) is its intuitiveness and ease of analytical calculation in comparison with the mathematically equivalent well-known Whitehead integral formula [65, 57] H=-\int\mathrm{d}^{3}r\,\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{A} with \mathbf{F}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{A}. The latter can typically only be calculated numerically and its evaluation requires a carefully chosen gauge [66]. Figure 2: Here, we illustrate examples of two linked field lines. The green surfaces indicate periodic boundary conditions along the vertical axis. In panel (a), the field lines form closed, linked loops. Panel (b) shows a loop threaded by a vertical line. Panels (c) and (d) display vertically braided lines. The linking number of the field lines is -1 in scenarios (a-c), and +1 in (d) according to Eq. (2). I.2 Hopf index in magnetism In magnetism, the vector field \mathbf{F} for which the Hopf index H is typically calculated is the emergent magnetic field defined by [67, 68] F^{k}=\frac{1}{8\pi}\epsilon^{ijk}\mathbf{m}\cdot(\partial_{i}\mathbf{m}\times% \partial_{j}\mathbf{m}). (3) where \epsilon^{ijk} is the Levi-Civita symbol, i,j,k\in\{x,y,z\} and the normalised vector field \mathbf{m} represents the magnetic texture. To calculate the Hopf index for the emergent magnetic field, Eq. (1) can generally be applied after the division of field lines of \mathbf{F} into flux tubes. Each flux tube contributes a flux \Phi=|N_{\mathrm{sk}}|, where N_{\mathrm{sk}}=\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{F} is the Skyrmion number calculated for the cross-sectional area of the flux tube of the emergent magnetic field. Importantly, a flux tube can be arbitrarily decomposed into its constituent parts without affecting the validity of Eq. (1), as we exemplify explicitly for a Skyrmion and a Hopfion in Sec. B of the Supplementary Material. In magnetism, it is common to consider the preimages of magnetisation \mathbf{m}, which are lines with constant \mathbf{m}, to obtain information about the Hopf index. The preimages of \mathbf{m} coincide at a local level with the field lines of \mathbf{F} only if \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{F}=0 [69], i.e. in particular in the absence of Bloch points. In contrast to preimages, however, only the field lines of \mathbf{F} possess a distinct direction, which is indispensable for determining unambiguously the sign of the linking number and hence the proper calculation of the Hopf index H, as emphasised by the sketches shown in Fig. 2. Figure 3: Illustrative examples applying Eq. (1) to spin textures with a ferromagnetic background (m_{z}^{\mathrm{b}}=1): All panels show spin textures composed of \Phi=1 flux tubes enclosed by the transparent blue isosurface where m_{z}=1. For each flux tube two field lines of \mathbf{F} are highlighted, which correspond to the preimages of \mathbf{m}=(0,0,-1) and \mathbf{m}=(0,-0.87,0.50), respectively accompanied by thin arrows showing the direction of the field line. The green planes represent the periodic boundary conditions along the vertical axis. The middle row shows cross-sections of the 3D structures depicted in a) - e) with the thick arrows indicating the spin direction. Yellow stars indicate the point of intersection of the field lines and the central horizontal plane. The colour code corresponds to the S^{2} sphere shown in Fig. 1. (a) A vertical Skyrmion string without self-linking, (b,c) vertical Skyrmion strings with self-linking \pm 1, (d) a Hopfion, (e) a Hopfion with self-linking -2, (f) a Hopfion encircling a vertical Skyrmion tube, (g,h) interlinked Hopfions, (i,j) braided Skyrmion tubes."

As an illustrative example, we uncover a two-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator with point-gapless corner states. Furthermore, we identify a three-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator that features hinge states with isolated exceptional points, representing second-order topological phases intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06840v1,Edge reconstruction of compressible Quantum Hall fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3,"Edge reconstruction of gate-tunable compressible quantum Hall fluids in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3 is studied by measuring transmitted conductance of two individually excited fractional e^{2}/3h edge modes of bulk 2/3 fractional quantum Hall fluid. Our findings reveal that the measured transmitted conductance deviates from the fully equilibrated value for the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3 of the gate-tunable compressible quantum Hall fluids at higher magnetic fields. This observation suggests that at the boundary of the compressible fluid a reconstructed e^{2}/3h fractional edge mode is present and the mode does not completely equilibrate with the inner dissipative bulk region. Consequently, this outer reconstructed edge mode supports adiabatic charge transport, allowing non-equilibrated current transport through the compressible region. These studies open new avenues for achieving robust fractional edge modes even in compressible quantum Hall fluids under strong magnetic fields, enhancing our understanding of edge state dynamics in these complex systems.","Quantum Hall (QH) effect is characterized by quantized Hall conductance as \nu e^{2}/h [1, 2], where \nu is the Landau level filling fraction. At the well defined QH states, the bulk is insulating and topologically protected edge states of total conductance \nu e^{2}/h at the boundary carry the current [3, 4, 5, 6]. From the bulk to the physical edge of the sample, the carrier density reduces to zero because of the surface barrier potential. At the smooth boundary of the two dimensional electron system (2DES), formation of dominant incompressible strips results in integer and fractional edge modes [7, 8, 9, 10]. Depending upon the smoothness of the surface potential and the strength of Coulomb interaction, multiple upstream and downstream fractional charge modes as well as charge neutral modes appear [11, 12, 13]. The studies of edge reconstruction and the robust reconstructed edge modes are very crucial for quantum interferometric applications of the edge modes. The impact of equilibration of reconstructed edge modes in the quantum interferometric applications is studied [14, 15]. The study of equilibration of the edge modes can reveal many useful information, like the interaction between edge modes hosting different quasi-particles [16, 17], the energy gap corresponding to the incompressible strips separating edge modes [17, 18, 19], the estimation of edge tunneling exponent in quantum point contact [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] etc. Figure 1: (color online) (a) Schematic filling fraction profile at the smooth boundary under electrostatic edge reconstruction for bulk filling fraction 1/3<\nu<2/3. The dominant incompressible stripe (shaded 1/3 FQH state) separates the outer 1/3 mode from the bulk compressible fluid. (b) Schematic filling fraction profile in absence of electrostatic edge-reconstruction at the boundary. No edge mode is expected in this case. There have been many theoretical [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33] and experimental [34, 35, 36, 37, 38] studies on edge reconstruction at different incompressible filling fractions \nu. Reconstructed fractional edge modes are observed at integer filling unity [34, 14, 39]. Edge reconstruction for 2/3 fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state is well studied. One of the theoretical models for 2/3 FQH state assumes one downstrean e^{2}/h integer mode and one upstream e^{2}/3h fractional mode [11] which upon equilibration produce only one downstream 2e^{2}/3h charge mode along with a neutral upstream mode [40, 41]. Other model assumes multiple upstream and downstream edge modes which after inter channel interactions give rise to two co-propagating downstream e^{2}/3h modes along with two upstream neutral modes [27, 31]. Subsequent experiment confirms validity of the second model of edge reconstruction for 2/3 FQH state in case of smooth confining potential at the boundary of the 2DES [37], where equilibration of the fractional charge modes is found to be about 2 \mum. In other experiment at higher magnetic fields, more robust co-propagating fractional edge modes of conductance e^{2}/3h are observed with equilibration length of the order 100\ {\mu m} for \nu=2/3 in the smooth boundary [39]. Such a robust 1/3 fractional edge mode at bulk filling fraction 2/5 is used for QH interferometry and studying braiding statistics of fractional charges recently [42]. So far edge reconstruction is studied in the incompressible QH states extensively. However, edge reconstruction in the compressible region in between two FQH states is least studied experimentally. Theoretically edge reconstruction is predicted for incompressible QH fluids as well as compressible QH fluids [26, 10] in presence of strong Coulomb interaction. In this article, we focus on the edge structure of compressible fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3. One possible edge reconstruction model is schematically shown in Figure 1(a) for compressible fluids in the filling fraction range of 1/3 to 2/3, considering the dominant incompressible stripe corresponding to 1/3 FQH state and a robust e^{2}/3h fractional charge mode might emerge [7, 8]. In case of weaker incompressibility of 1/3 FQH state or the sharp boundary, edge reconstruction should not be observed for the compressible fluid. Figure 1(b) schematically represents such a case where edge reconstruction is not favorable and only the dissipative bulk conducts. In this article, we present experimental study on edge reconstruction of the gate defined compressible QH fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3<\nu<2/3 to verify the applicability of the above two models. In this study we have utilized the knowledge and experimental technique to measure edge equilibration that is used in our previous work [39]. Following our previous work, we have selectively excited the two partially equilibrated e^{2}/3h modes of 2/3 FQH state and use them to probe the edge reconstruction of a gate defined compressible fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3<\nu<2/3. Transmittance of the excited e^{2}/3h fractional modes through the top gate defined compressible fluid is measured. We find that the measured transmitted conductance deviates from the full equilibration value at higher magnetic field. Our observation is explained by considering a reconstructed e^{2}/3h fractional edge mode that does not fully equilibrate with the inner dissipative bulk region of the compressible fluid. Therefore, the outer reconstructed e^{2}/3h fractional edge mode at the boundary of the compressible fluid supports adiabatic charge transport that validates edge reconstruction of compressible fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3 as shown in Figure 1(a). Figure 2: (color online) (a) Topologically equivalent device structure with measurement scheme for edge equilibration experiments. S1, S2, D1 and D2 are the Ohmic contacts for current injection and detection; G1 and G2 are the top metal gates (approximate dimensions 25 \mum x 25 \mum) used for tuning filling fractions \nu_{1} and \nu_{2} beneath the gates respectively, while bulk is kept at filling \nu_{b}. Sources S1 and S2 are excited simultaneously with different frequencies; currents at virtually grounded D1 and D2 contacts are measured by standard lock-in technique. (b) Plot of two terminal magneto-resistance (2TMR) measured between S1 and D2, when all other contacts are floating and gates are grounded. Quantized plateaus at bulk filling \nu_{b}=2/3,4/5 and 1 are labeled. (c) Representative plot of G1 gate characteristics vs V_{G1} at \nu_{b} = 2/3 (B= 13.7 T) when G2 gate is fully pinched-off.

Blue curve is the reflectance (G^{r}_{S1\rightarrow D2}) of G1 measured between contacts S1 and D2. Magenta curve represents total conductance (G^{total}) i.e. sum of transmittance and reflectance. (d) Plot of G2 gate characteristics at 13.7 T magnetic field, when G1 gate is fully pinched-off. Transmittance G^{t}_{S1\rightarrow D1}(red curve) is measured between S1 and D1, reflectance G^{r}_{S1\rightarrow D2} (blue curve) is measured between S1 and D2. Gate characteristics data represented in (c) and (d) are taken in a separate cooldown for comparison and checking sample uniformity."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06801v2,Time-Varying Strong Coupling and It Induced Time Diffraction of Magnon Modes,"Time-varying media break the temporal translation symmetry of wave propagation in materials, enabling advanced wave manipulations. However, this novel phenomenon has been rarely explored in magnonic systems due to the significant challenge of achieving a sudden and prominent change in magnon dispersion within materials. Here, we drive a ferrimagnet with periodic pump pulses to construct time-varying strong coupling between two magnon modes. We observe a change in the beats of Rabi-like oscillations near the pulse edges, indicating the time-varying strong magnon coupling and the formation of time interfaces. Using a frequency comb spectroscopy technique developed in this work, we characterize the frequency conversion of magnon modes induced by the time-varying strong coupling effect. Moreover, we construct time slits with adjacent time interfaces and demonstrate, for the first time, the double-slit time diffraction of magnon modes. The frequency spacing of the multiplied magnon modes inversely correlates with the separation between two time slits, analogous to the well-known Yang’s double-slit experiment. These findings rely solely on the time-varying strong magnon coupling, independent of device reconfiguration. Our results open avenues for applications such as all-magnetic mixers or on-chip GHz sources.",Data availability The data that support the findings of this study are available from corresponding authors upon reasonable request.
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06724v1,Non-Abelian charge conversion in bilayer binary honeycomb lattice systems,"In two-dimensional systems with space-time inversion symmetry, Dirac nodes (DNs) carry non-Abelian topological charges which induce intriguing momentum space braiding phenomenon. Although the original idea was proposed in condensed matter setup, the experimental verification of non-Abelian charge conversion has been limited to artificial metamaterials because of the difficulty in identifying suitable materials in which controlled tuning of DN positions is possible. In this work, we propose bilayer binary honeycomb lattices (BBHL) as a new material platform to study the non-Abelian charge conversion phenomenon in which DN positions in momentum space can be manipulated. More explicitly, we demonstrate that layer sliding and vertical pressure serve as tunable braiding parameters controlling the non-Abelian charge conversion process which is crucial to understand the stacking-dependent electronic properties of BBHL systems. We show that the BBHL systems are a promising candidate for the experimental realization of non-Abelian phenomena of DNs in condensed matter.","References Ahn et al. (2019a) J. Ahn, S.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06622v1,Electronic states in a bilayer graphene quantum ripple,"In this paper, we investigate the influence of the geometry in the electronic states of a quantum ripple surface. We have considered an electron governed by the spinless stationary Schrödinger equation constrained to move on the ripple surface due to a confining potential from which the Da Costa potential emerges. We investigate the role played by the geometry and orbital angular momentum on the electronic states of the system.","As reported in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) meyer2007structure ; meyer2007roughness and scanning tunneling microscopy experiments (STM) ishigami2007atomic ; stolyarova2007high , suspended graphene samples tend to exhibit seemingly random spontaneous curvatures which can be visualized as ripples ranging from a few angstroms in height to several nanometers in length. Curvature effects in graphene can arise due to disorder, i.e., imperfections or irregularities in the material’s structure caused by lattice defects, impurities, or topographical variations on its surface. Disorder can significantly affect the electronic properties of a low-dimensional material, and this has been extensively investigated for graphene ludwig1994integer ; Nersesyan:1994zz ; Nersesyan:1995cdf ; stauber2005disorder ; Peres:2006zz . Inspired by the physics of nanotubes and fullerenes, many studies on the electronic properties of curved graphene address curvature induced by topological defects tamura1994disclinations ; charlier2001electronic ; Gonzalez:2000ovj ; cortijo2007electronic ; Cortijo:2006xs , where it has been found that characteristic charge anisotropies can arise due to conical defects on an average flat surface, which could be observed in STM or TEM experiments. Such anisotropies were later observed in experiments with scanning single-electron transistors martin2008observation and electrostatic force microscopy lu2006electrostatic . Indeed, the geometry of graphene plays a central role in the material’s electronic structure. The presence of curvature on the surface is associated with fascinating effects, such as the formation of quantized energy levels, the emergence of geometric phases, and curvature-induced forces that influence the dynamics and trajectory of particles costa ; costa1 , chiral properties dandoloff2004quantum ; atanasov2009geometry ; atanasov2015helicoidal , the existence of pseudo-magnetic fields guinea2010generating and charge inhomogeneity de2007charge , which can arise in corrugated atanasov2010tuning and rippled de2007charge layers. A continuum limit approach, which allows for the formulation of the Hamiltonian of an electron on curved surfaces, is feasible through the thin-layer squeezing method jensen1971quantum . Starting from a three-dimensional Schrödinger Hamiltonian, this method yields an attractive geometric potential that depends on both the mean curvature and the Gaussian curvature, known as the da Costa potential costa ; costa1 ; matsutani1992berry ; daSilva:2016wxz . This approach can also be extended to include external fields and spin, as noted in references ferrari2008schrodinger ; wang2014pauli ; burgess1993fermions . Among the studied surfaces, we highlight the torus, as carbon nanotori are present in nanoelectronics, biosensors, and quantum computing Goldsmith ; Goldsmith2 . In Ref. encinosa , for instance, bound states and their respective curvature-induced eigenvalues were calculated for an electron governed by the Schrödinger equation. A similar analysis was conducted in Ref. GomesSilva:2020fxo with the inclusion of external fields in the system. Additionally, governed by the Pauli equation, a spin-1/2 charged particle confined to the surface of a torus was investigated in Ref. AGM , and analytical solutions for the Dirac equation in (2+1) dimensions were found in Ref. Yesiltas:2018zoy for cases where the Fermi velocity is constant and position-dependent. An extension of this latter work to include external fields was carried out in Ref. Yesiltas:2021crm . More recently, a potential qubit encoding in the energy levels of a graphene nanotoroid was investigated in Ref. Furtado:2022uvk . Given that the electronic properties of two-dimensional carbon materials, such as graphene katsnelson ; geim ; castro and phosphorene phosphorene , have been shown to be highly dependent on sample geometry CostaFilho:2020sbw ; Aguiar:2020dgi , these configurations can be used as highly relevant analog models for high-energy physics Capozziello:2020ncr ; Cvetic:2012vg ; Pourhassan:2018wjg ; Acquaviva:2022yiq ; Iorio:2013ifa ; Iorio:2010pv ; Iorio:2014pwa . Here, we highlight the catenoid geometry, which is configured as a minimal surface equivalent to that of a wormhole dandoloff . For example, in Refs. gonzalez and pincak , the authors proposed a nanotube bridge connecting a graphene bilayer. The electronic properties of such structures were described in Ref. novaes2010electronic , where it was reported that for metallic nanotubes, conductance is approximately independent of their length but highly dependent on the nanotube-bilayer junction. The exact opposite occurs for semiconductor nanotubes, where conductance becomes dependent on the nanotube length but independent of the junction. In Refs. dandoloff and dandoloff2 , to achieve a smooth connection between the bridge and the asymptotically flat surfaces, a single catenoid surface was proposed. The effects of geometry and external electric and magnetic fields on the electronic properties of a graphene catenoid structure were investigated in Ref. euclides . Additionally, electronic states of a graphene bilayer connected by a generalized Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole-type bridge were investigated in Ref. deSouza:2022ioq . In addition to the geometric potential discussed above (third paragraph), it is expected that curvature may also produce position-dependent mass (PDM) effects, as the homogeneity of the lattice is broken. Although PDM effects have been extensively studied on flat surfaces pdm1 ; pdm2 ; pdm3 ; pdm4 , only recently has an extension of the da Costa’s method for treatment on curved surfaces been proposed, see Ref. moraes . PDM considerations for an electron confined to a catenoid were addressed in Refs. Yesiltas:2021dpm and silva2021position . In this paper, we investigate the influence of geometry on the electronic states of a quantum ripple surface. We consider an electron governed by the spinless stationary Schrödinger equation, constrained to move on a Gaussian-type ripple due to a confining potential from which the da Costa potential emerges. We examine the roles played by both geometry and orbital angular momentum on the electronic states of the system. This paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we present the geometry and dynamics of an electron governed by the Schrödinger equation with the da Costa potential, resulting from the thin-layer squeezing method. The main characteristics of this potential are then discussed. Using the method of separation of variables, we derive a one-dimensional equation describing a position-dependent mass system in the presence of an effective potential that depends on the orbital quantum number \ell. A qualitative analysis of this potential is also performed. In Section III, we investigate how the geometric parameters characterizing the Gaussian-type ripple surface affect the bound states of the system. Finally, in Section IV, we present our conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06515v1,Friedel oscillations in two-dimensional materials with inverted bands and Mexican-hat dispersion,"We study Friedel oscillations (FOs) in two-dimensional topological materials with Mexican hat band dispersion, which attract great interest due to the complex of its inherent non-trivial features, including the Van Hove singularity, doubly connected Fermi surface, non-trivial quantum-geometric properties, and the presence of states with negative effective mass. These factors are found to lead to a three-mode structure of the FOs. One of the modes, arising from electron transitions between the Fermi contours, has an unexpectedly large amplitude. The evolution of the amplitudes of all modes with Fermi energy is largely determined by the interplay of three main factors: intra-contour and inter-contour electron transitions, the quantum metric of the basis states, and the electron-electron interaction. We traced the role of each factor in the formation of the FO pattern and identified the corresponding features of the FO evolution.","Friedel oscillations (FOs) are a fundamental feature of the density-density response specific to a fermionic system. The FOs are caused by the interference of quantum states scattered by a local potential perturbation created by an external charge, defect, interface, etc. [1]. Being an essential component of the density-density response function, the FOs reflect many properties of the system of fermionic quasiparticles [2, 3], including their quantum geometry, valley and orbital structure, which are currently of great interest. This allows one to consider FO as a promising tool for studying non-trivial properties of electronic states using probe microscopy. This perspective stimulated numerous theoretical studies of specific features and properties of the FOs for electron systems in graphene-based materials [4, 5], topological insulators [6, 7], transition-metal dichalcogenides [8, 9], Weyl semimetals [10, 11], two-dimensional (2D) electron systems with spin-orbit interaction [12, 13]. It was found that in electron systems with parabolic dispersion, the Coulomb interaction between electrons affects the shape of the FOs at relatively short distances, but asymptotically, the FOs are described by double the Fermi wave vector [2]. Anisotropy of the effective mass leads to a corresponding anisotropy of the FOs [14]. Spin-orbit interaction radically changes the wave vector of the FOs [12], and in the presence of two types of spin-orbit interactions, beatings of the FOs arise [13]. Multimode FOs and the beatings of electron density appear in the presence of valleys in the band spectrum [15]. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the question of what role quantum geometric properties of eigenstates play in the density-density response and related phenomena such as plasma excitations [16, 17] and FOs [18, 19, 20]. The significance of this problem is largely determined by the discovery of striking manifestations of quantum geometry in the structure of the FOs, which opens up promising prospects for the experimental study of geometric properties. One way to implement this idea is to measure the Berry phase by observing the wavefront dislocations in the FOs created by a charge embedded in the host crystal [21, 18, 19, 22]. Another possibility is to study the characteristic features of the FOs that arise due to the quantum geometry of band states. In this case, the question first of all arises about the features of the spatial shape of the FO and their behavior when changing the parameters of the system, in particular, the Fermi energy. The research presented here is aimed precisely in this direction. The key moment determining the geometric properties and topology of the quantum states is the multi-orbital structure of the Bloch states [23], i.e. the presence in their composition of several orbitals with different properties. The multi-orbital structure of the wave functions manifests itself in significant and even dramatic changes of both charge screening and plasma excitations, as shown by studies for some topological materials [24], graphene [16], and \alpha-\mathcal{T}_{3} lattice structure [16, 25]. In this paper, we study the FOs for a 2D material with Mexican hat-shaped band dispersion formed by the inversion of electron and hole bands. This system is interesting for the following reasons. First, the basis quantum states are topological with a sufficiently large Berry curvature. Second, in the energy range between the bottom and the top of the Mexican hat dispersion (MHD), there are two Fermi contours. Third, the MHD has two important nontrivial features. The main one, which usually attracts attention, is the Van Hove singularity of the density of states at the MHD bottom. Because of this, the role of electron–electron (e-e) interaction increases significantly and, as a consequence, the conditions for the formation of the ferromagnetic phase [26, 27] and superconducting pairing [28, 29] are facilitated. Another feature is related to the effective mass of quasiparticles. On the MHD branch with a low wave vector, the effective mass changes sign with increasing energy from positive near the MHD bottom to negative near the top. This obviously affects the distribution of electron density around the external charge and, consequently, the screened potential, since quasiparticles with negative mass are attracted to the negatively charged center. In particular, due to this feature, quasi-bound states with energy above the MHD top are formed [30, 31]. Thus, one can expect dramatic changes in the spatial distribution of electron density around an external charge. Since MHD occurs in many 2D electron systems, this problem is of rather general interest. We found that three Kohn anomalies are formed due to the presence of two Fermi contours. In addition to the two anomalies caused by intra-contour transitions, there is another anomaly caused by inter-contour transitions. At low Fermi energies, it significantly exceeds the other two. The quantum metric significantly affects the amplitude of the singularities, and the inter-contour singularity disappears altogether at high Fermi energies. As a result, a three-mode FO structure is formed, the evolution of which with the Fermi energy is determined by the interaction of three main factors: intra-contour and inter-contour transitions, the quantum metric, and the e-e interaction, which plays an important role due to the singularity of the density of states. The calculations are performed in the random phase approximation (RPA) for a 2D electron system described by the BHZ model. In Sec. II, we study the Lindhard polarization function. The screened potential of a point charge and the electron density oscillations around it are studied in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we discuss the main results and draw conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06509v1,Nonlinear Hall effects with an exceptional ring,"In non-Hermitian band structures, exceptional points generically form gapless lines or loops that give rise to extensively many defective eigenstates. In this work, we investigate how they non-trivially contribute to higher-order nonlinear responses by introducing unique singularities in the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) or Berry connection polarizability (BCP). Using a tilted 2D dissipative Dirac model ansatz that harbors an exceptional ring, broken inversion symmetry is shown to give rise to extrinsic (BCD) and intrinsic (BCP) nonlinear Hall behaviors unique to systems with extensive exceptional singularities. In particular, when the non-Hermiticity is increased while keeping the ring radius fixed, the BCD response exhibits a power-law increase, while the BCP response correspondingly decreases. Our work sheds light on how non-Hermiticity can qualitatively control the extent and nature of higher harmonic generation in solids.","Beyond the well-known Kubo formula paradigm that connects band topology to linear response properties Kubo (1957); Kubo et al.

The infusion of non-Hermitian topology has greatly enriched the phenomenology of quantum response and transport. Previous studies on non-Hermitian linear response Bouganne et al. (2020); Pan et al. (2020) have unveiled anomalous coherent oscillations in wave packet dynamics Xu et al. (2017); Qin et al. (2024a); Lee et al. (2020b); Jiong-Hao et al. (2022); Lee and Longhi (2020); Singhal et al. (2023); Price and Cooper (2012); Roy et al. (2015); Oliver et al. (2023) induced by the non-Hermitian anomalous Berry connection. In particular, in non-Hermitian systems containing exceptional point singularities, the Berry curvature exhibits singularities near the band crossings, leading to much heightened sensitivity around these singularities and qualitatively affecting both linear and high-order nonlinear responses. As such, in this work, we investigate a tilted two-dimensional massive dissipative Dirac model that represents an ansatz exceptional ring model. Our findings reveal that both the BCD and Berry connection polarizability (BCP) become markedly sensitive to non-Hermiticity near the singularities of an exceptional ring. Particularly, the distinct scaling laws of BCD and BCP in proximity to this exceptional ring lead to significantly different extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall responses. The paper is organized as follows: In section II, we present the general formalism for both extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall effects. In section III, we introduce the Hamiltonian for an exceptional ring and provide a detailed analysis of its energy band structure. In section IV, we investigate the quantum geometry tensor, Berry curvature, quantum metric, and the extrinsic nonlinear Hall response described by the BCD. Moreover, we study the nonzero component intrinsic nonlinear Hall response described by the BCP."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06480v1,Multifunctional 2d infrared photodetectors enabled by asymmetric singular metasurfaces,"Two-dimensional materials offering ultrafast photoresponse suffer from low intrinsic absorbance, especially in the mid-infrared wavelength range. Challenges in 2d material doping further complicate the creation of light-sensitive p-n junctions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a graphene-based infrared detector with simultaneously enhanced absorption and strong structural asymmetry enabling zero-bias photocurrent. A key element for those properties is an asymmetric singular metasurface (ASMS) atop graphene with keen metal wedges providing singular enhancement of local absorbance. The ASMS geometry predefines extra device functionalities. The structures with connected metallic wedges demonstrate polarization ratios up to 200 in a broad range of carrier densities at a wavelength of 8.6 \mum. The structures with isolated wedges display gate-controlled switching between polarization-discerning and polarization-stable photoresponse, a highly desirable yet scarce property for polarized imaging.","Methods Responsivity estimates. The power in the device plane was measured with a Thorlabs S302C thermal power head connected to a PM100D powermeter. We replaced the devices holder with the thermal head to preserve the optical path. The measured average laser power (50 % duty cycle) varies in the range P_{0}^{\rm avr}=1.52\dots 8.90~{}{\rm mW}, depending on the laser current, while the power amplitude is P_{0}=3.04\dots 17.8~{}{\rm mW}. The power per device area with dimensions L and W, illuminated by a Gaussian focused beam p(x)\propto e^{-(x^{2}+y^{2})/2\sigma^{2}} is P_{\rm dev}=\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{L}{2\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right)% \operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{W}{2\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right)P_{0}. (1) Our laser spot has \sigma = 20 \mum, thus the w-, t- and s-devices with L=W=30 \mum receive 30 % of total laser power. The amplitude of photovoltage under steady illumination V_{\rm ph} is calculated from lock-in readings V_{\rm LI} under meander-modulated illumination using V_{\rm ph}=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\,V_{\rm LI}, (2) The responsivities per total power (r_{\rm V}) and per power reaching the device (r_{\rm V,\,dev}) are r_{\rm V}=\frac{V_{\rm ph}}{P_{0}}\qquad{\rm and}\qquad r_{\rm V,\,dev}=\frac{% V_{\rm ph}}{P_{\rm dev}}. (3) Modeling. Electromagnetic modeling was implemented in Microwave Studio package with single-frequency finite element solver. The dielectric functions of contact metals and surrounding dielectrics were taken from refractiveindex.info database. Modeling of thermal transport is based on heat conduction equation for electron temperature T({\bf r}): -(\nabla,\chi_{e}({\bf r})\nabla T({\bf r}))=-\frac{C_{e}}{\tau_{\varepsilon}}% [T({\bf r})-T_{0}]+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{\rm opt}|{\bf E}|^{2}, (4) here \chi_{e} and C_{e} are the electronic thermal conductivity and heat capacity, respectively, \tau_{\varepsilon} is the energy relaxation time due to substrate phonons, T_{0} is equilibrium temperature. The last term in Eq. (4) is the Joule heating by electromagnetic field. Modeling of photo-thermoelectric response is based on continuity relation supplemented with microscopic expression for electron current. The latter includes thermal diffusion and drift components. The resulting equation on light-induced electric potential V({\bf r}) is (see Supplementary Information, Section II for derivation): (\nabla,\alpha_{e}({\bf r})\nabla T({\bf r})-\sigma_{e}({\bf r})\nabla V({\bf r% }))=0, (5) here \alpha_{e}({\bf r}) is the thermal diffusivity and \sigma_{e}({\bf r}) is the electron conductivity. The three functions \alpha_{e}, \chi_{e} and \sigma_{e} are bound by the Wiedemann-Frantz and Mott relations. Only one of them retains free, which we choose to be \sigma_{e}=\mu e(n+p). Equation (5) can be solved semi-analytically for the photocurrent I_{\rm ph} under assumption of uniform conductivity \sigma_{e}({\bf r})={\rm const}. The result reads as I_{\rm ph}=\frac{1}{V_{0}}\int{d{\bf r}({\bf E}_{0}({\bf r}),\alpha_{e}({\bf r% })\nabla T({\bf r}))}, (6) where {\bf E}_{0} is dc the electric field in the channel upon application of potential V_{0} to the drain (not to be confused with local radiation field {\bf E}({\bf r})). Eq. (6) shows that photocurrent sampling is most efficient from the points with strong local dc electric field, i.e. near the edges."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06446v1,Entropic magnetic interlayer coupling,"Nanomagnetism concerns the engineering of magnetic interactions in heterostructures that consist of layers of magnetic and non-magnetic materials. Mostly, these interactions are dominated by the minimization of energy. Here, we propose an effective magnetic interlayer coupling that is dominated by the maximization of entropy. As an example, we consider the system that mediates the effective interactions to be square spin ice, in which case we find purely entropic interactions that are long-ranged. We argue that in the thermodynamic limit the entropic interlayer coupling gives rise to entropic torques on the magnetization direction. For small systems, the physical properties are well characterized by the mutual information between the two magnets that are coupled. Because entropic interactions become stronger for higher temperatures, our findings may benefit the development of nanomagnetic devices that require thermal stability.","References Shinjo [2009] T.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06016v1,Probing g-tensor reproducibility and spin-orbit effects in planar silicon hole quantum dots,"In this work, we probe the sensitivity of hole-spin properties to hole occupation number in a planar silicon double-quantum dot device fabricated on a 300 mm integrated platform. Using DC transport measurements, we investigate the g-tensor and spin-relaxation induced leakage current within the Pauli spin-blockade regime as a function of magnetic-field orientation at three different hole occupation numbers. We find the g-tensor and spin-leakage current to be highly anisotropic due to light-hole/heavy-hole mixing and spin-orbit mixing, but discover the anisotropies to be relatively insensitive to the dot hole number. Furthermore, we extract the dominant inter-dot spin-orbit coupling mechanism as surface Dresselhaus, with an in-plane orientation parallel to transport and magnitude \boldsymbol{t_{SO}} \approx 300 neV. Finally, we observe a strong correlation between the g-factor difference (\delta\boldsymbol{g}) between each dot and the spin-leakage current anisotropy, as a result of \delta\boldsymbol{g} providing an additional spin-relaxation pathway. Our findings indicate that hole-spin devices are not as sensitive to precise operating conditions as anticipated. This has important implications optimizing spin control and readout based on magnetic-field direction, together with tuning large arrays of QDs as spin-qubits.","0.1 Experimental Methods The Si-MOS device consists of a three-layer gate structure with a sub-50 nm width and 5 nm isolation layer enables a tighter QD confinement potential. The measurements were performed in a BlueFors LD250 dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 8 mK and an approximate electron temperature of 120 mK. Magnetic-field rotations to study the anisotropy in spin-leakage current and g-factor were achieved via a 6T-1T-1T vector magnet. The sample was mounted on a PCB with a LPF on the DC lines (f_{c}= 130 kHz), and bias-tees on the RF lines (R=1.2 k\Omega, C = 1 nF) in order to apply microwave tones. Voltages for the DC were sourced through a Quantum Machines QDAC and an R\&S SGS100A to generate microwaves for EDSR. The spin-leakage was current converted into a voltage via a low-noise high-stability Basel instruments I-V converter with f_{c}= 300 Hz, and measured by a Keithley K2000 multi-meter. {acknowledgement} This work was funded by the Australian Research Council under projects LP200100019, DP200100147 and IL230100072."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05988v1,Band structure and optical response of Kekulé-modulated \alpha-\mathcal{T}_{3} model,"We study the electronic band structure and optical response of a hybrid model, a \alpha-\mathcal{T}_{3} model featuring a \sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3} Kekulé pattern modulation. Such a hybrid system may result from the depositing of adatoms in a hexagonal lattice, where the two sublattices are displaced in the perpendicular direction, like in germanene and silicene. We derive analytical expressions for the energy dispersion and the eigenfunctions using a tight-binding approximation of nearest-neighbor hopping electrons. The energy spectrum consists of a double-cone structure with Dirac points at zero momentum caused by Brillouin zone folding and a doubly degenerate flat band resulting from destructive quantum interference effects. Furthermore, we study the spectrum of intraband and interband transitions through the joint density of states, the optical conductivity, and the Drude spectral weight. We find new conductivity terms resulting from the opening of intervalley channels that are absent in the \alpha-\mathcal{T}_{3} model and manifest themselves as van Hove singularities in the optical response. In particular, we identify an absorption window related to intervalley transport, which serves as a viable signature for detecting Kekulé periodicity in two-dimensional materials.","In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibiting flat bands have garnered significant attention due to their unique electronic and transport properties, making them ideal platforms for exploring novel physical phenomena [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The observation of correlated insulator states and signatures of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene [2] has further fueled the interest in systems hosting flat bands close to the Fermi level [12, 13]. Line graphs [14, 15, 4, 16], such as the kagome and pyrochlore lattices, along with bipartite lattices like the Lieb and dice lattices [17, 4], naturally host flat bands in their energy spectrum thanks to destructive interference between electron wavefunctions. The \alpha-\mathcal{T}_{3} model [18, 19, 20, 21] is a simple example of flat-band system which continuously evolves between the graphene and dice lattice by modulation of a hopping parameter. Its crystal structure consists of a honeycomb lattice (rim atom), with an additional site at the center of each hexagon (a hub atom) that couples to neighboring atoms with only one of the sublattices, hosting a flat band and Dirac cones close to the Fermi level. Numerous studies are dedicated to unraveling the mechanisms behind the emergence of flat bands in Dirac systems [10, 22, 23] and how they give rise to a variety of quantum phases [24, 25]. The optical response of flat bands has also been studied [26, 27, 28, 29], but since the group velocity in these bands vanishes, identifying clear optical signatures in the low-frequency range seems challenging. On the other hand, spatial bond modulation can induce exotic effects in the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials [30, 31, 32, 8, 33]. One of the most interesting examples of spatial modulation is the Kekulé distortion in the graphene honeycomb lattice [34, 35, 36, 37], where the lattice acquires a bond density wave with superlattice unit cell \sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3} larger than the original unit cell. As a result, Brillouin zone folding brings the K,K^{\prime} points to the center of the Brillouin zone (\Gamma point). Experiments suggest two types of Kekulé modulations in graphene with distinct low-energy spectrum [37, 38]: the so-called Kek-Y phase with two Dirac cones with different velocities, and the Kek-O phase with a doubly degenerate massive Dirac band. Several mechanisms have been proposed to generate phases with different Kekulé distortions [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53], indicating its ubiquitousness in hexagonal lattices [39]. Electrical and optical signatures offer a promising avenue for studying and understanding the mechanism behind the Kekulé phase [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]. From a topological perspective, Kekulé-distorted graphene was first proposed as a novel platform hosting fractionally charged topological excitations [31]. Mechanical strain applied to graphene-based heterostructures with Kekulé patterning also gives rise to intriguing topological effects [62]. Moreover, Kekulé distortion is one of the suggested mechanisms behind the superconducting and correlated insulating states behavior in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene [63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68], further increasing the interest in the study of Kekulé-patterned superlattices. Figure 1: (a) Lattice structure of Kekulé-modulated \alpha-\mathcal{T}_{3} model. Atoms on sublattices A and B are depicted as gray and blue circles, respectively. The hub atoms in red appear with Kekulé periodicity and only connect with the B sublattice. (b) The basis vectors of the honeycomb lattice are \mathbf{a}_{1} and \mathbf{a}_{2}. The vectors \boldsymbol{\delta}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\delta}_{2}, and \boldsymbol{\delta}_{3} connect each A or B atom to its nearest neighbors. The gray parallelogram represents the unit cell of the superlattice. (c) Reciprocal space with vectors \mathbf{K}_{\pm}. The original (honeycomb lattice) Brillouin zone is represented as a black dashed hexagon. The K_{D}^{\pm} valleys (at the red Dirac points) are coupled by the wave vector \mathbf{G}=\mathbf{K}_{+}-\mathbf{K}_{-} and folded onto the center of the superlattice Brillouin zone (blue point). In this work, we propose a hybrid model based on a honeycomb lattice with an atom located at the center of each hexagon, appearing only with Kekulé periodicity. We name this system as “Kekulé-modulated \alpha-\mathcal{T}_{3} model” (Kek-\alpha), which provides a robust platform for studying valley and flat-band physics. The feasibility of constructing such a model has been discussed in the literature [34, 3, 39, 69, 70, 71]. For instance, a hexagonal lattice where its sublattices are displaced along the z-plane, similar to silicene or related systems [72], with atoms deposited with Kekulé periodicity, could be well described by our model. Given the increasing interest in space-modulated and flat-band materials, we aim to anticipate potential future developments in these systems. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present the tight-binding model and in Sec. III we derive a Dirac-like Hamiltonian and its energy dispersion. In Sec. IV we study the optical transitions. We first study the joint density of states to identify critical frequencies, which will determine the prominent spectral features of the optical response (Sec. IV.1). The optical conductivity, due to intra and interband transitions, is calculated within the Kubo formalism in Sec. IV.2. Finally, we present our conclusions and remarks in Sec. V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07216v1,"Multifunctional spintronic transistors: Sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local GMR, and NDR in spin gapless semiconductor and/or spin gapped metal FETs","Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are emerging as a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, offering unique opportunities to realize novel functionalities beyond conventional electronics. In this work, we propose a novel concept of multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) by employing SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as the source and drain electrodes. These devices function similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (SGM) electrode and the intrinsic semiconducting channel. However, unlike metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, the proposed devices leverage the distinctive spin-dependent transport properties of SGS and/or SGM electrodes to enable sub-60 mV/dec switching, a significant improvement over the sub-threshold swing bottleneck of 60 mV/dec in conventional MOSFETs, facilitating low-voltage operation. Additionally, the incorporation of SGMs introduces the negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio, further enhancing the device functionality. The proposed spintronic FETs exhibit a remarkable combination of features, including sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect, and NDR effect, making them highly attractive for next-generation applications such as logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These functionalities open avenues for exploring novel computing architectures beyond the constraints of the classic von-Neumann architecture, enabling more efficient and powerful information processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials emerge as a promising platform for realizing these multifunctional FETs. In this work, we perform a comprehensive screening of the computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials for the proposed devices. For device simulations, we select VS2 as the SGS material. As a proof-of-concept, we employ a non-equilibrium Green’s function method combined with density functional theory to simulate the transfer (I_{\mathrm{D}}-V_{\mathrm{G}}) and output (I_{\mathrm{D}}-V_{\mathrm{D}}) characteristics of a vertical VS2/Ga2O2 heterojunction FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS2. Our calculations predict a remarkably low sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 108, and a significant non-local GMR effect demonstrate these devices’ potential for low-power and high-performance applications.","Modern charge-based electronics rely heavily on metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) as fundamental building blocks. Their remarkable scaling over the decades has revolutionized computing and communication technologies, enabling the development of increasingly powerful and compact devices. However, despite their widespread use and advancements, conventional MOSFETs face inherent limitations that challenge further progress in electronics scaling and energy efficiency. One such limitation is the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing (SS) imposed by thermionic emission, which has remained a persistent bottleneck [1, 2]. This limitation significantly hinders low-voltage operation, a critical factor for achieving energy-efficient devices in modern electronics. Lowering the operating voltage not only reduces static power consumption but also minimizes leakage currents, addressing a fundamental concern for battery-powered electronics and portable devices where energy efficiency is paramount. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore alternative transistor designs and materials that can overcome these limitations and pave the way for the next generation of energy-efficient electronic devices [3, 4, 5]. To overcome the 60 mV/dec SS limit, researchers have explored alternative transistor designs categorized as steep slope transistors. These devices aim to achieve a sharper transition between the on-state and off-state, leading to a lower SS value. Examples of such devices include tunnel FETs (TFETs), Dirac source FETs, and the recently proposed cold-metal source FETs [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. While these alternative designs offer lower SS compared to conventional MOSFETs, they often come with trade-offs. Tunnel FETs, for instance, rely on a tunneling mechanism for current flow, leading to significantly lower on-currents compared to MOSFETs. This drawback limits their applicability in many logic circuits where high on-currents are crucial for driving subsequent stages. In contrast, Dirac source and cold-metal source FETs generally exhibit much higher on-state current densities, making them more attractive alternatives for practical applications. Steep-slope FETs with Dirac source and cold-metal source electrodes are an area of active research and are being explored as a potential solution to overcome the limitations of traditional MOSFETs, especially for low-power and high-speed applications. However, a key limitation of these emerging transistor proposals is their reliance solely on the charge degree of freedom. They do not exploit the potential benefits offered by the electron’s spin, a valuable resource for future spintronic devices. Spin gapless semiconductors (SGSs) have shown promising potential in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), enabling functionalities beyond conventional MTJs based on Fe, Co, and CoFeB. While these traditional MTJs offer high tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) for memory applications, they lack current rectification, hindering their functionality as diodes for logic applications [13, 14, 15]. A recent proposal addressed this by introducing type-II SGSs and half-metallic magnets in MTJs, achieving both TMR and a re-programmable diode effect [16, 17], which is experimentally demonstrated in MTJs based on Heusler compounds [18]. Inspired by this progress, we propose a novel class of spintronic FETs utilizing SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes with an intrinsic semiconductor channel. This configuration overcomes the limitations of both conventional MOSFETs (restricted by the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing) and alternative steep-slope transistor designs. The key lies in exploiting the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS and SGM electrodes. The SGSs enable sub-60 mV/dec switching and introduce the non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect, absent in conventional charge-based FETs. Additionally, SGMs offer negative differential resistance (NDR) with a high peak-to-valley current ratio. This combination opens doors for next-generation applications like logic-in-memory computing, where data processing and storage occur on the same chip [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. In this paper, we present a comprehensive conceptual framework for novel multifunctional spintronic FETs. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials emerge as a promising platform for realizing these multifunctional FETs. These materials offer a promising pathway to overcome scaling challenges inherent to conventional FETs. Their atomically thin structure enables exceptional gate control and mitigates short-channel effects, essential for low-power, high-performance devices. Focusing on spintronic applications, we identify transition metal dichalcogenides and dihalides, such as VS2 and ScI2, as potential 2D candidates. Through a comprehensive screening of a computational 2D materials database, we select suitable SGS and SGM materials for our proposed devices. To demonstrate proof-of-concept, we employ ab initio quantum transport calculations to simulate a vertical VS2/Ga2O2 heterojunction FET based on 2D type-II SGSs VS2. Utilizing a non-equilibrium Green function method combined with density functional theory, our simulations predict remarkable device performance, including a subthreshold swing (SS) of only 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 108, and a substantial non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect. These findings underscore the potential of 2D SGSs for realizing our proposed multifunctional spintronic FETs, paving the way for a new generation of low-power, high-performance spintronic devices. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we introduce the concepts of SGSs and SGMs. Section III presents the design and operation principles of our proposed multifunctional spintronic FETs. The computational methodology employed in this study is detailed in Section IV. In Sections V.A and V.B, we present the results of our screening process for suitable 2D materials and the simulation results for a vertical VS2/Ga2O2 heterojunction FET, respectively. Finally, Section VI summarizes our key findings and discusses their implications.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07095v1,Multicomponent Kardar-Parisi-Zhang Universality in Degenerate Coupled Condensates,"We show that the multicomponent Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation describes the low-energy theory for phase fluctuations in a \mathbb{Z}_{2} degenerate non-equilibrium driven-dissipative condensate with global U(1)\times U(1) symmetry. Using dynamical renormalisation group in spatial dimension d=1, we demonstrate that coupled stochastic complex Ginsburg-Landau equations exhibit an emergent stationary distribution, enforcing KPZ dynamical exponent z=3/2 and static roughness exponent \chi=1/2 for both components. By tuning intercomponent interactions, the system can access other regimes, including a fragmented condensate regime from a dynamical instability in the phase fluctuations, as well as a spacetime vortex regime driven by the non-linear terms in the coupled KPZ equations. In stable regimes, we show that in specific submanifolds relevant to polaritons, the RG fixed point offers a transformation to decoupled KPZ equations. Our findings have broad implications for understanding multicomponent KPZ systems in the long-wavelength limit.","Degenerate Coupled Condensates - Typically, mesoscopic dynamics of driven-dissipative condensates in d=1 are modelled by coupled SCGLE for the lower polariton branch fields \psi_{i}\in\mathbb{C} [51] \displaystyle i\partial_{t}\psi_{i} \displaystyle=\Big{[}-(k_{c}-ik_{d})\partial_{x}^{2}+(\mu_{c}+i\mu_{d})+ (1) \displaystyle(u_{c}-iu_{d})|\psi_{i}|^{2}+(v_{c}-iv_{d})|\psi_{\overline{i}}|^% {2}\Big{]}\psi_{i}+\zeta_{i}, with a density coupling to the other component \psi_{\overline{i}}. This model can be derived from Keldysh field theory in the semiclassical approximation assuming a Markovian coupling to the decay and pumping bath modes. All parameters are real and \mu_{d},\,u_{d},\,u_{c}>0 for a stable condensed solution, and \zeta_{i} is a Gaussian complex white noise with diagonal correlations \langle\zeta^{*}_{i}(x,t)\zeta_{j}(x^{\prime},t)\rangle=(\gamma_{p}+\gamma_{l}% )\delta_{ij}\delta(x-x^{\prime})\delta(t-t^{\prime}). The kinetic coefficient is k_{c}=1/2m_{LP} where m_{LP} is the effective polariton mass and k_{d} is a diffusion constant which acts to suppress higher momentum modes. The system is driven-dissipative requiring incoherent external pumping from a laser, and is in contact with an excitonic decay bath. This gives rise to an effective gain \mu_{d}=(\gamma_{p}-\gamma_{l})/2 from the incoherent pump minus the single particle losses which is positive in the U(1) spontaneously symmetry broken (SSB) condensate phase. The two particle losses u_{d},\,v_{d}>0 act as gain saturation terms. This model assumes local interactions which is valid provided we ignore the spatial extent of the excitons. For polaritons, the intercomponent, v_{c}, and intracomponent, u_{c}, interactions are attractive and repulsive respectively. Typically, experimental cross-spin scattering rates are 5-10\% of the intraparticle scattering rate implying v_{c}\approx-0.1u_{c} [52, 53]. Equilibrium two-component condensates support a miscible-immiscible transition when the real intercomponent interactions exceed the intracomponent interactions v_{c}^{2}>u_{c}^{2} [54, 55, 56, 57] where modulation instabilities cause condensate fragmentation. Non-equilibrium condensates support a similar phase separation [14, 43] but differ from their equilibrium counterparts in that the linearised SCGLE (1) no longer has four gapless sound modes in its Bogoliubov spectrum but instead has two gapped density modes and two gapless diffusive phase modes. There are two conditions of different physical origin which can drive a miscible transition shown in FIG. 1(i-ii): (a) the dissipative intercomponent interaction exceeds the intracomponent interactions v_{d}>u_{d}, resulting in the gapped modes becoming dynamically unstable, and (b) when the rescaled intercomponent interaction \tilde{v}_{c}=v_{c}/u_{c} does not satisfy -1-\mathcal{R}(k)\mathcal{R}(u)(1+\tilde{v}_{d})<\tilde{v}_{c}<1+\mathcal{R}(k% )\mathcal{R}(u)(1-\tilde{v}_{d}) (2) with \mathcal{R}(k)=k_{d}/k_{c}, resulting in the gapless modes becoming dynamically unstable. Within the \tilde{v}_{d}=v_{d}/u_{d}<1 region, there exist two sub-cases for the miscible transition depending on whether the intercomponent interaction v_{c} is attractive or repulsive. For repulsive intercomponent interactions v_{c}>0, tuning (\tilde{v}_{c},\tilde{v}_{d}) outside of the immiscible boundary Eq. (2), gives rise to spatially localised single component regions. For these parameters which map to Quadrants II and III in FIG. 1(i-iii), the low-energy sector is described by single component KPZ if density fluctuations are sufficiently irrelevant [51]. If the interaction is attractive \tilde{v}_{c}<0, as shown for the density plot for the simulation in Quadrant III in FIG. 1(ii), there is no obvious fragmentation. However, the density fluctuations are still large and cannot be adiabatically eliminated, making the KPZ mapping inappropriate. The theory is invariant under U(1)\times U(1) symmetry with independent \psi_{i}\mapsto e^{i\theta_{i}}\psi_{i}. When \mu_{d}>0, each U(1) undergoes SSB. The ground state topology dictates that the effective theory is parameterised using the density-phase representation where \theta_{i} parameterise the gapless fluctuations. In the adiabatic approximation around the mean field |\psi_{0,i}|^{2}=\rho_{i}={\mu_{d}}/{(u_{d}+v_{d})}=-{\mu_{c}}/{(u_{c}+v_{c})}, gapped fluctuations can be integrated out [58] giving multicomponent KPZ equations for \mathbb{R}^{2}-fields (\theta^{\alpha}(x,t))_{\alpha=1}^{2} \displaystyle\partial_{t}\theta^{\alpha}=D_{\alpha\beta}\partial_{x}^{2}\theta% ^{\beta}+\dfrac{1}{2}\Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma}(\partial_{x}\theta^{\beta})% (\partial_{x}\theta^{\gamma})+\zeta^{\alpha} (3) driven by a real Gaussian additive white noise (\zeta^{\alpha})_{\alpha=1}^{2} with symmetric covariance \langle\zeta^{\alpha}(x,t)\zeta^{\beta}(x^{\prime},t^{\prime})\rangle=2\Delta^% {\alpha\beta}\delta(x-x^{\prime})\delta(t-t^{\prime}). Strictly, the phase itself is a compact variable, supporting non-trivial topological excitations such as spacetime vortices (STV) which modify the scaling. For the single-component case in the low-noise regime, compactness does not affect KPZ scaling for significant time windows [59]. The parameters from the SCGLE mapping are D_{11}=k_{c}\mathcal{C}_{1}(u_{d}u_{c}-v_{c}v_{d})+k_{d},\,D_{12}=k_{c}% \mathcal{C}_{1}(v_{c}u_{d}-u_{c}v_{d}),\,\Gamma^{1}_{11}=-2k_{c}+2k_{d}% \mathcal{C}_{1}\left(u_{c}u_{d}-v_{c}v_{d}\right),\,\Gamma^{1}_{22}=2k_{d}% \mathcal{C}_{1}(v_{c}u_{d}-u_{c}v_{d}),\,\Gamma^{1}_{12}=0, where \mathcal{C}_{1}=(u_{d}^{2}-v_{d}^{2})^{-1}. The remaining parameters can be inferred from \mathbb{Z}_{2} symmetry. Coupling in the real density channel between the condensates v_{c} produces non-trivial couplings in the off-diagonals of the diffusion and noise matrices. The non-linearity vanishes at the equilibrium condition when k_{d}/k_{c}=v_{d}/v_{c}=u_{d}/u_{c} define collinear rays in the complex plane [60]. A point to stress is that off-diagonal interaction vertices \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma} are only generated if k_{d}\neq 0. The \Delta^{\alpha\beta} have non-trivial cross-components resulting in correlated white noise driving the two phase modes and are presented in the supplemental materials Ref. [61]. Imposing that the diffusion matrix D is positive definite is equivalent to the dynamical stability condition in Eq. (2). In the spirit of Landau, the effective theory in the multicomponent regimes should be described by Eq. (3) with \mathbb{Z}_{2} symmetry \theta^{1}\leftrightarrow\theta^{2} resulting in the degenerate structure of the \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma} tensors \Gamma^{1}=\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}\Gamma^{1}_{11}&\Gamma^{1}_{12}\\ \Gamma^{1}_{12}&\Gamma^{1}_{22}\end{array}\right),\hskip 5.69054pt\Gamma^{2}=% \left(\begin{array}[]{cc}\Gamma^{1}_{22}&\Gamma^{1}_{12}\\ \Gamma^{1}_{12}&\Gamma^{1}_{11}\end{array}\right) (4) and D=D^{T}=D^{\tau}, \Delta=\Delta^{T}=\Delta^{\tau} where \tau denotes the off-diagonal transpose. It is insightful to transform Eq. (3) to its normal modes where the rotated fields, denoted by tildes, transform as \tilde{\theta}^{1}={(\theta^{1}+\theta^{2})}/{\sqrt{2}}, \tilde{\theta}^{2}={(\theta^{1}-\theta^{2})}/{\sqrt{2}}. These coordinates capture the joint phase and phase difference between the condensates. The linear equations decouple with diffusion matrices \tilde{D}_{11}=D_{11}+D_{12} and \tilde{D}_{22}=D_{11}-D_{12}. The noise covariance inherits the diagonal structure \langle\tilde{\zeta}^{\alpha}(x,t)\tilde{\zeta}^{\beta}(x^{\prime},t^{\prime})% \rangle=\delta^{\alpha\beta}(\Delta_{11}\pm\Delta_{12})\delta(x-x^{\prime})% \delta(t-t^{\prime}) where +,\,- are for (1,1) and (2,2) components respectively. Interaction vertices are rank-(1,2) tensors, transforming non-trivially \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}=(\Gamma^{1}_{11}+2\Gamma^{1}_{12}+\Gamma^{1}_{22})/% \sqrt{2}, \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}=(\Gamma^{1}_{11}-2\Gamma^{1}_{12}+\Gamma^{1}_{22})/% \sqrt{2}, \tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12}=(\Gamma^{1}_{11}-\Gamma^{1}_{22})/\sqrt{2} while all other non-linear terms vanish. In these coordinates, the \mathbb{Z}_{2}-theory maps onto \displaystyle\partial_{t}\tilde{\theta}^{1} \displaystyle=\tilde{D}_{11}\partial_{x}^{2}\tilde{\theta}^{1}+\dfrac{1}{2}% \left(\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}(\partial_{x}\tilde{\theta}^{1})^{2}+\tilde{% \Gamma}^{1}_{22}(\partial_{x}\tilde{\theta}^{2})^{2}\right)+\tilde{\zeta}_{1} (5) \displaystyle\partial_{t}\tilde{\theta}^{2} \displaystyle=\tilde{D}_{22}\partial_{x}^{2}\tilde{\theta}^{2}+\tilde{\Gamma}^% {2}_{12}(\partial_{x}\tilde{\theta}^{1})(\partial_{x}\tilde{\theta}^{2})+% \tilde{\zeta_{2}} previously studied by Ertaş and Kardar in dynamic roughening of directed lines [16]. For decoupled \mathbb{Z}_{2} symmetric KPZ equations with v_{c}=v_{d}=0, the bare parameters transform to \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}=\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}=\tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12} which corresponds to the point (1,1) in FIG. 1(iii). Tuning the intercomponent interactions allows you to move away from the decoupled point into other quadrants, each representing distinct physical behaviours. At large times, the dynamics is dominated by the non-linearity and stability analysis shows that if \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22} and \tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12} do not have the same sign, there is an instability. This instability arises from the non-hyperbolicity of the linearised equations and non-linear dominated dynamics in Quadrants II and IV in FIG. 1. Tuning (\tilde{v}_{c},\tilde{v}_{d}), we can access this instability in Quadrant IV from the SCGLE by choosing bare parameters which satisfy Eq. (2) but violate conditions \displaystyle-1+\dfrac{\mathcal{R}(u)}{\mathcal{R}(k)}(1+\tilde{v}_{d}) \displaystyle<\tilde{v}_{c}<1-\dfrac{\mathcal{R}(u)}{\mathcal{R}(k)}(1-\tilde{% v}_{d}) (6a) \displaystyle 1-\dfrac{\mathcal{R}(u)}{\mathcal{R}(k)}(1-\tilde{v}_{d}) \displaystyle<\tilde{v}_{c}<-1+\dfrac{\mathcal{R}(u)}{\mathcal{R}(k)}(1+\tilde% {v}_{d}) (6b) for \mathcal{R}(u)<\mathcal{R}(k) and for \mathcal{R}(u)>\mathcal{R}(k) respectively. For clarity, we draw attention to the significance of this quadrant in the context of the original \mathbb{Z}_{2} parameters. In FIG. 1(iii), Quadrant IV is achieved when both X = \tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12}/\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}<0 and Y=(\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}\tilde{\Delta}_{22}\tilde{D}_{11})/(\tilde{\Gamma}^{% 1}_{11}\tilde{\Delta}_{11}\tilde{D}_{22})>0. In the specific case of the SCGLE mapping, \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}=\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11} and \tilde{\Delta}_{11},\tilde{\Delta}_{22}>0 are always satisfied, leading to the equivalence of conditions Y>0 and Eq. (2), both of which ensure the positive definiteness of the diffusion constants \tilde{D}_{11},\,\tilde{D}_{22}>0. Therefore, Quadrant IV emerges by tuning the effective KPZ interactions, \tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12}\sim(\Gamma^{1}_{11}-\Gamma^{1}_{22}) and \tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}\sim(\Gamma^{1}_{11}+\Gamma^{1}_{22}), to have different signs. Consequently, in the \mathbb{Z}_{2} coordinates, this occurs when the KPZ intercomponent interaction between the phase modes is larger than the KPZ intracomponent interaction |\Gamma^{1}_{22}|>|\Gamma^{1}_{11}|. In this quadrant, the non-hyperbolicity gives rise to large phase differences between nearest-neighbour sites. At the physical level, this triggers the proliferation of STVs, non-trivial windings in the phase due to compactness. The vortex turbulent regime dramatically modifies the scaling, resulting in growth exponent \beta=1/2 and dynamical exponent z=1 as shown in FIG. 2. An STV phase has been observed in the single component case in the large noise regime [59], however this phase transition originates from tuning the intercomponent interaction \tilde{v}_{c}. More detail on the analysis of the STV phase can be found in the supplemental material Ref. [61]. Figure 2: SCGLE simulations with parameters v_{d}=0, k_{d}=u_{d}=\mu_{d}=1 and k_{c}=3,\;u_{c}=1.5 and tuning \tilde{v}_{c} from 0 to -1.2. (i-ii) The autocorrelation \Delta(t_{1}-t_{2}) of the unwound phase for \tilde{\theta}_{1} and \tilde{\theta}_{2} respectively showing a crossover to the STV regime when tuning \tilde{v}_{c} between 0 to -1.2 plotted from bottom to top. (iii) Probability of a vortex in the spacetime lattice for unrotated \theta_{1}, \theta_{2} as a function of attractive \tilde{v}_{c}. Inset shows the line traced out in the (X,Y) plane in FIG. 1(iii) from the decoupled point (1,1) in Quadrant I (KPZ) in blue to Quadrant IV (STV) in red. (iv) Vortex charge distribution with +1 (red) and -1 (blue) on a section of the spacetime lattice for \tilde{v}_{c}=-1.2 in the STV dominated Quadrant IV. The RG flows are best interpreted in the normal mode basis in adimensionalised coordinates from Eq. (5), closing under the \mathbb{R}^{4}-parameter space: T=\tilde{D}_{22}/\tilde{D}_{11}, X=\tilde{\Gamma}^{2}_{12}/\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{11}, Y=(\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22}\tilde{\Delta}_{22}\tilde{D}_{11})/(\tilde{\Gamma}^{% 1}_{11}\tilde{\Delta}_{11}\tilde{D}_{22}), Z=(\tilde{\Delta}_{11}(\tilde{\Gamma}^{1}_{22})^{2})/(4\Lambda\tilde{D}_{11}^{% 3}) where \Lambda is the UV cutoff regularising the effective theory. The cutoff has a natural origin in exciton-polariton systems since excitons typically have a Bohr radius up to 100\text{\AA} giving k_{max}=h/100\text{\AA}. The noise ratio W=\tilde{\Delta}_{22}/\tilde{\Delta}_{11} is required to be positive definite to retain its connection to probability. The RG flow equations are autonomous ODEs describing how the parameters change as we iteratively integrate out high momentum modes. The boundary condition for the flows is specified at \ell=0 where the parameters assume their initial bare values. The projected flows of X and Y are shown in FIG. 1(iii). The parameters X,\,Y do not change sign under RG, implying that the flows do not cross between quadrants. To understand the phase dynamics, we can concentrate on Quadrants I and IV since the other quadrants present a physical instability from Eq. (2). The RG suggests that the scaling should be Edwards-Wilkinson z=2 for the \tilde{\theta}_{2} mode and KPZ z=3/2 for \tilde{\theta}_{1} in Quadrant IV, however we must discount it based on the instability from conditions (6a) and (6b). Physically, this quadrant as previously discussed corresponds to a disordered STV phase with z=1 for both modes. At this point, we focus on the analysis of the coupled SCGLE in Quadrant I."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06820v1,Re-entrant topological order in strongly correlated nanowire due to Rashba spin-orbit coupling,"The effect of the Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC) on the topological properties of the one-dimensional (1D) extended s-wave superconducting Hamiltonian, in the presence of strong electron-electron correlation, is investigated. It is found that a non-zero RSOC increases the periodicity of the effective Hamiltonian, which results in the folding of the Brillouin zone (BZ), and consequently in the emergence of an energy gap at the boundary of the BZ. If the chemical potential is inside the energy gap and it does not perceive the two-band structure of the resulting energy spectrum the topological phase is removed from the phase diagram.In contrast, if we move the chemical potential upwards towards the highest occupied band the opposite happens and the non-trivial topology is restored. This is the origin of re-entrant nature of the existent topological properties. This property of the system allows us to drive the system in and out of the topological phase only by the proper tuning of the chemical potential. A heterostructure involving van der Waals materials and a 1D Moire pattern for an investigation of the predicted effect has also been proposed and discussed in our work.","(a) (b) Figure 1: (a) The schematics of the energy dispersion of the non-interacting electrons in a 1D chain with (right) and without (left) a three fold periodicity of the lattice. The three fold periodicity results in the folding of the energy dispersion three times and, consequently, in the emergence of the energy gap at the BZ boundaries. If the chemical potential lies within this gap and no other band is involved no topological phase is present. On the right hand side diagram, the tuning of the chemical potential from the lower to the higher band will result in the re-entrant topological order. However, this is absent on the left hand side diagram, as there is no energy gap. (b) Schematics of the proposed heterostructure involving (quasi-)1D Moire lattice for detection of the re-entrant topological phase in strongly correlated system (discussed in Sec. VII). The prediction of spatially separated Majorana fermions (MF) in a 1D topological superconductor (TSC) [1] has marked the paradigm shift in the research for the realization of quantum computers [2]. Several experimental platforms have been proposed to realize MF [3, 4]; among them heterostructures of a semiconducting nanowire (NW) on top of a s-wave SC have got a special attention, mainly due to the ease of synthesis and widespread availability of the constituent materials [5]. Three ingredients are necessary for such NW/SC heterostructures: (i) the RSOC (\alpha), (ii) an external magnetic field (B_{z}), (iii) the proximity induced s-wave superconducting (SC) order parameter (\Delta). The RSOC shifts the momentum parabola sideways locking the electron spin with momentum (k), B_{z} opens a gap at k=0, and \Delta opens a gap at opposite Fermi points. Experimental efforts involving NW/SC have been partially fruitful and are still ongoing [6, 4, 7]. Some of the major concerns regarding NW/SC heterostructures are as follows. The critical field (H_{c2}) and the critical temperature (T_{c}) of the usual s-wave SC are small. Low H_{c2} requires a large Lande g factor in a nanowire so that a large enough gap can be opened at k=0 under such lower magnetic field B_{z}<H_{c2}. A large \alpha in NW is desirable as it allows for stronger spin and momentum locking. From the design point of view, the presence of a magnetic field in electronic circuits is far from ideal, as stray fields hamper the miniaturization of the circuit. The interface between the NW and the SC should be both of high quality (allowing for a higher proximity induced SC gap) and smooth (to suppress disorder induced scattering which is detrimental for p-wave SC). Although, the latter concerns are of a more applied nature, however, the former (i.e., the large \alpha, g) is more of fundamental. Hence, the question arises, whether the requirements for having both RSOC and magnetic field can be completely avoided? A number of alternative platforms have been proposed which don’t require neither RSOC nor magnetic field. Some of them are associated with atop of a magnetic atomic chain on a SC [8], topological insulator/magnetic insulator/SC heterostructure [9], monolayers of WTe2 [10], van der Waals (vdW) materials [11, 12, 13]. Another interesting proposal is to use strong electron-electron (e-e) correlation, in place of a magnetic field, to access the topological SC phase [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Using DMRG it was found that strong e-e correlation favors the formation of the MF even without magnetic field [14, 15]. This favorable scenario can be easily understood in the context of a 1D chain with a single valence electron at every atomic site. Under a magnetic field the spin of every electron is frozen along the direction of the applied field. This results in every atomic site containing at most a single electron, the so called ""no double occupancy"" (NDO) condition. The NDO scenario can also appear due to strong e-e correlation, as the energy penalty for placing one more electron at an already occupied atomic site will be too high for that to take place; of course there is a caveat: the spin is not automatically frozen along a single direction in this case. One way to solve this problem is to invoke the so-so called ""spin-charge separation"" method [19]. Due to the strong e-e interaction the electron-hole excitations delocalize the electron until it becomes totally incoherent. As a result, at low energy, for this strong coupling regime, only separate non interacting collective spin (spinon) and charge (holon) excitations remains. Although e-e correlation is an intrinsic property of the material, but several recent proposals have been put forward to control it extrinsically [20, 21, 22]. With these considerations, in this article we investigate the Hamiltonian of a (quasi-)1D topological SC system in the presence of strong e-e correlation. The SC order parameter is of extended s-wave; proximity induced due to iron based SC. The reason for choosing iron-based SC is because they have higher T_{c}, H_{c2} and superconducting gap [23]. In the Hamiltonian we also included RSOC and magnetic field to understand their affect on the topological properties; although, the overall goal is to get rid of them. To solve the Hamiltonian we use spin-charge separation and su(2|1) path integral method [[][;seeforreviewofthemehod], 24]. This method has been applied to several other systems [25, 26, 27, 28, 18, 29]. The main results of this work is as follows. (i) For non-zero RSOC the system can enter into the topological phase multiple times when the parameters are appropriately tuned (see Fig. 2). This happens due to the folding of the Brillouin zone (BZ), which takes place because of the quasi-periodicity induced by the non-zero RSOC as shown schematically in Fig. 1a. The same property was also observed in Ref. [13] due to Moire potential. (ii) The effective Hamiltonian, Eq. (11), contains the dynamical parameter \theta, which is a function of spinon degree of freedom — they are related through Eq. (9) and Eq. (6). For system to be in topological phase the two conditions should be satisfied, firstly the value of \theta should be 0<\theta<\pi, secondly the \mathbb{Z}_{2} invariant should be Q=-1. From free energy calculation (Fig. 6) we find that both these conditions can be satisfied in some defined range of chemical potential. Therefore only the chemical potential can be used as the tuning parameter to drive the system into and out of the topological phase. It is useful for the design of the devices where chemical potential can be controlled efficiently through gate voltage. (iii) We propose heterostructure involving vdW materials for experimental realization of the effect; a schematic diagram of the same is shown in Fig. 1b. We discuss about this heterostructure thoroughly in Sec. VII."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06794v1,Emergence of steady quantum transport in a superconducting processor,"Non-equilibrium quantum transport is crucial to technological advances ranging from nanoelectronics to thermal management. In essence, it deals with the coherent transfer of energy and (quasi-)particles through quantum channels between thermodynamic baths. A complete understanding of quantum transport thus requires the ability to simulate and probe macroscopic and microscopic physics on equal footing. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate the emergence of non-equilibrium steady quantum transport by emulating the baths with qubit ladders and realising steady particle currents between the baths. We experimentally show that the currents are independent of the microscopic details of bath initialisation, and their temporal fluctuations decrease rapidly with the size of the baths, emulating those predicted by thermodynamic baths. The above characteristics are experimental evidence of pure-state statistical mechanics and prethermalisation in non-equilibrium many-body quantum systems. Furthermore, by utilising precise controls and measurements with single-site resolution, we demonstrate the capability to tune steady currents by manipulating the macroscopic properties of the baths, including filling and spectral properties. Our investigation paves the way for a new generation of experimental exploration of non-equilibrium quantum transport in strongly correlated quantum matter.","I Main Recent advances in quantum thermodynamics and nano-scale devices have shown the increasing importance of quantum transport. However, despite its widespread interest and technological significance, a complete knowledge of the microscopic mechanisms that lead to the emergence of steady quantum transport remains elusive. The main obstacle resides in the presence of diverse scales: the microscopic motion of the individual particles being transported, and the statistical behaviour of particles in the thermodynamic baths. Although new insights into the quantum origin of thermodynamic equilibrium have been given by the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis [1, 2, 3] and typicality [4, 5], these approaches are challenged in the investigation of steady quantum transport due to the presence of transport channels. This motivates the development of new theoretical, numerical, and experimental frameworks that can capture multiscale non-equilibrium physics. Figure 1: Schematics of setup and measurement of site-resolved dynamics. a, Schematic of the device where qubits are depicted as circles with connecting lines representing nearest-neighbour tunable couplings. 31 functional qubits used in the experiment are coloured in cyan. b, Mapping to the particle-transport model which comprises two non-integrable baths connected by a weak link between sites 18 and 20. c, Measured dynamics of the site-resolved particle occupations. Shown are the simultaneously measured excited-state probabilities of individual qubits in both baths (see colorbars on the far right) at a few selected time spots during the dynamics. A promising direction is to use quantum simulators such as ultracold atoms [6, 7, 8], trapped ions [9], and superconducting qubits [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Quantum simulators have the potential to surpass classical computers in investigating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can naturally handle the exponential complexity inherent in these systems [15, 16, 17, 18]. However, the study of non-equilibrium transport requires additional efforts on these experimental platforms due to the presence of baths. Firstly, the description of the bath state often relies on fictitious statistical ensembles, instead of experimentally realistic pure states. These ensembles are represented with complex mixed states that are impossible to generate strictly through unitary evolution of a pure state [19]. Secondly, engineering a configurable and scalable bath to have desired macroscopic properties and spectral profiles is still challenging with either analogue or digital quantum simulators [20, 21, 19]. Resolving these issues would significantly enhance our capabilities in simulating and understanding complex non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. In this article, we demonstrate the emergence of steady quantum transport from a single pure initial state in a superconducting processor. By preparing a population difference between the baths, we observe a generation of inter-bath particle current, the main signature of non-equilibrium transport. Specifically, we show that the currents obtained are typical, as they do not depend on the microscopic dynamics of the baths, but only on their conserved quantities. Moreover, these currents are steady, manifested by a significant decrease in their temporal fluctuations as the system size increases. We emphasise that 31 qubits are sufficient to capture the above observations, implying a fast transition to the regime where statistical mechanics apply. This relies on the recent understanding of quantum chaos [22, 23], pure-state quantum statistical mechanics [4, 24, 25, 26, 27, 5, 28, 29], and prethermalisation dynamics [30, 31, 32, 33, 34] which leads to an extendable intermediate time scale to probe steady current properties [35, 36, 37]. Additionally, we show that our setup serves as a flexible platform to study quantum transport by demonstrating a high degree of current tunability."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06758v1,Edge supercurrent in Josephson junctions based on topological materials,"The interplay between novel topological states and superconductivity has garnered substantial interest due to its potential for topological quantum computing. The Josephson effect serves as a useful probe for edge superconductivity in these hybrid topological materials. In Josephson junctions based on topological materials, supercurrents exhibit unique quantum interference patterns, including the conventional Fraunhofer oscillations, the \Phi_{0}-periodic oscillation, and the 2\Phi_{0}-periodic oscillation in response to the external magnetic field (\Phi_{0}=h/2e is the flux quantum, h the Planck constant, and e the electron charge). These interference patterns stem from varied Andreev reflection mechanisms and the associated current density profiles. This review seeks to comprehensively examine the theoretical and experimental advancements in understanding the quantum interference patterns of edge supercurrents in Josephson junctions based on quantum spin Hall, quantum Hall, and quantum anomalous Hall systems.","Figure 1: (a) When the central region is filled with bulk carriers, LARs uniformly occur at the interfaces between the SC and the central region. Consequently, the Josephson critical current I_{c} oscillates with the external magnetic field, resulting in a Fraunhofer pattern. (b) In the QSH-based JJs, LARs occur at the single helical edge states. The resulting edge-dominated supercurrents exhibit a \Phi_{0}-periodic oscillation. (c) In the QH-based and QAH-based JJs, edge supercurrents arise from CARs instead of LARs. This leads to a 2\Phi_{0}-periodic oscillation. The schematic diagrams illustrate (d) LARs in the conventional JJs, (e) LARs at the helical edge states in the QSH-based JJs, and (f) CARs at the chiral edge states in the QH-based and QAH-based JJs. The orange (green) lines represent the electrons (holes), respectively. The research on topological materials is at the forefront of condensed matter physics, contributing both to fundamental science and potential technological breakthroughs. The quantum Hall effect (QHE), first discovered by Klitzing ref1 ; ref2 ; ref3 in 1980, exemplifies the manifestation of topological phenomena in condensed matter physics. The QHE is distinguished by chiral edge states, where electrons propagate unidirectionally along the sample’s edges while the bulk remains insulating. This effect occurs in a two-dimensional electron gas under a strong magnetic field at low temperatures, leading to quantized Hall resistance plateaus at h/ne^{2} (n is an integer), where h is Planck’s constant and e is the elementary charge ref1 ; ref4 . The quantized Hall resistance can be understood through topological invariants known as Chern or Thouless–Kohmoto–Nightingale–Nijs (TKNN) numbers ref4 ; CN2 . The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) represents a variant of the QHE that does not require an external magnetic field, yet still supports chiral edge states ref5 ; ref6 . The QAHE was theoretically predicted by Haldane ref7 in 1988 for a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice without a magnetic field and experimentally observed in Cr-doped (\mathrm{Bi},\mathrm{Sb})_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{3} thin films in 2013 ref8 . Since then, QAHE has been observed in various materials, including Cr-doped \rm{(Bi,Sb)_{2}Te_{3}} films QAH11 ; QAH12 ; QAH13 ; QAH14 ; QAH15 ; QAH16 ; QAH17 ; QAH18 ; QAH19 , V-doped \rm{(Bi,Sb)_{2}Te_{3}} films QAH4 ; QAH12 ; QAH21 ; QAH22 ; QAH23 ; QAH24 , \rm{MnBi_{2}Te_{4}} QAH5 ; QAH31 ; QAH32 , and recently moiré superlattice systems QAH6 ; QAH7 ; QAH8 . Both QHE and QAHE break time-reversal symmetry, whereas the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) preserves it. The QSHE is characterized by metallic helical edge states protected by a bulk gap QSH1 ; QSH2 ; QSH11 ; QSH22 ; QSH3 ; QSH4 . The helical edge states mean that electrons with opposite spins counter-propagate along the edges of the material. This can be regarded as two copies of QAHE with opposite Chern numbers. Experimentally, QSHE has been observed in HgTe/CdTe quantum wells QSH5 , InAs/GaSb double quantum wells QSH6 , and monolayer \rm{WTe}_{2} QSH7 ; QSH8 . Remarkably, the interplay between superconductivity and QSHE/QHE/QAHE has attracted considerable attention for its potential to realize topological superconductors (TSCs) capable of hosting Majorana fermions MF1 ; QSH22 ; FJE1 . Majorana fermions, which are exotic quasiparticles that are their own antiparticles, exhibit non-Abelian statistics and are promising candidates for topological quantum computing TQC1 ; TQC2 ; TQC3 ; TQC4 ; TQC5 ; TQC6 ; TQC7 ; TQC8 ; TQC9 . Their nonlocal nature confers resistance to local perturbations, providing a robust platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Consequently, the study of TSCs is not only of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics but also essential for the advancement of next-generation quantum technologies. Establishing the presence of edge superconductivity is a critical step toward demonstrating topological superconductivity in these systems, and the Josephson effect serves as a key tool for probing this edge superconductivity. The Josephson effect, discovered by Josephson in 1962 JJ1 , arises when two superconductors (SC) are separated by a central region that can be an insulator, normal metal, semiconductor, or a narrow superconductor. This configuration, known as a Josephson junction (JJ), permits the tunneling of Cooper pairs across the central region. The hallmark of the Josephson effect is the Josephson current, a supercurrent flowing through the junction driven by the superconducting phase difference without any applied voltage, known as the DC Josephson effect. The generation of this supercurrent is facilitated by Andreev reflections, where an electron converts into a hole at the interfaces between the SC and central region, concurrently creating a Cooper pair in the superconducting region AR . In the conventional SC-normal metal-SC (SNS) JJs, local Andreev reflections (LARs) occur uniformly within the central region (see Fig. 1(d)), which means an electron is retroreflected into a hole, leading to bulk supercurrent oscillations in response to an external magnetic field. As shown in Fig. 1(a), these oscillations produce a quantum interference pattern known as the Fraunhofer pattern. The Fraunhofer pattern is characterized by a central lobe with a width of 2\Phi_{0} and decaying side lobes. Here, \Phi_{0}=h/2e is the flux quantum, h the Planck constant, and e the electron charge. Recently, the combination of the JJs and topological materials has garnered significant attention due to the novel quantum phenomena and potential applications in quantum computing. When the central region exhibits QSHE, the junction is referred to as a QSH-based JJ. Unlike traditional JJs, bulk supercurrent is prohibited due to the presence of a bulk gap. Instead, edge supercurrent, carried by helical edge states, can also sustain even when the chemical potential resides within the bulk gap. In this regime, LARs can occur at a single helical edge (see Fig. 1(e)). Thus, the edge supercurrent oscillates with the magnetic field resulting in a “SQUID-like” quantum interference pattern characterized by a \Phi_{0} periodicity depicted in Fig. 1(b) . Figure 2: (a) Differential resistance ({\rm d}V/{\rm d}I) is measured with the top voltage gate V_{tg}=1.05 V, exhibiting the Fraunhofer pattern. (b) The nearly flat distribution of the supercurrent density indicates the bulk-dominated regime. (c) Differential resistance {\rm d}V/{\rm d}I is measured with the top voltage gate V_{tg}=-0.425 V, showing a “SQUID-like” sinusoidal pattern. (d) The sharp peaks of the supercurrent density indicate the edge-dominated regime. Reprinted from Ref. 67. On the other hand, when the chemical potential lies within the bulk gap, an incident electron from one chiral edge is transformed into an outgoing hole along the opposite edge after encountering the interface between the SC and central region through the crossed or nonlocal Andreev reflections (CARs) in both QH-based and QAH-based JJs CAR1 ; CAR2 ; f2 ; f4 ; f8 . Similarly, the hole is then reflected as an electron along the other interface. The entire process forms a loop, as depicted in Fig. 1(f), which is analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations AB1 . In AB oscillations, electrons traveling along different paths enclose a magnetic flux \Phi, causing resistance to oscillate with the magnetic flux exhibiting a periodicity of 2\Phi_{0} AB2 . Consequently, the critical Josephson current I_{c} in response to the external magnetic flux \Phi has two distinct features f1 ; f2 ; f3 ; f31 ; f4 ; f5 ; f6 ; f7 ; f8 ; f9 : (a) The periodicity of the quantum interference pattern is 2\Phi_{0}. (b) The minima of the oscillation is non-zero. In this review, we focus on the quantum interference patterns in response to the external magnetic field in QSH-based, QH-based, and QAH-based JJs related to the different Andreev reflections. We begin by outlining the experimental and theoretical progress in QSH-based JJs in Sec. II.1 and Sec. II.2, respectively. Then, we discuss the experimental and theoretical research in QH-based JJs in Sec. III.1 and Sec. III.2, respectively. Following this, we introduce the theoretical developments in QAH-based JJs in Sec. IV. Finally, we conclude the review with a discussion on the possible future directions in Sec. V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06682v1,Multifield tunable valley splitting and anomalous valley Hall effect in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic MnBr,"Compared to the ferromagnetic materials that realize the anomalous valley Hall effect by breaking time-reversal symmetry and spin-orbit coupling, the antiferromagnetic materials with the joint spatial inversion and time-reversal (PT) symmetry are rarely reported that achieve the anomalous valley Hall effect. Here, we predict that the antiferromagnetic monolayer MnBr possesses spontaneous valley polarization. The valley splitting of valence band maximum is 21.55 meV at K and K’ points, which is originated from Mn-d{}_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital by analyzing the effective Hamiltonian. Importantly, monolayer MnBr has zero Berry curvature in the entire momentum space but non-zero spin-layer locked Berry curvature, which offers the condition for the anomalous valley Hall effect. In addition, the magnitude of valley splitting can be signally tuned by the onsite correlation, strain, magnetization rotation, electric field, and built-in electric field. The electric field and built-in electric field induce spin splitting due to breaking the P symmetry. Therefore, the spin-layer locked anomalous valley Hall effect can be observed in MnBr. More remarkably, the ferroelectric substrate Sc2CO2 can tune monolayer MnBr to realize the transition from metal to valley polarization semiconductor. Our findings not only extend the implementation of the anomalous valley Hall effect, but also provides a platform for designing low-power and non-volatile valleytronics devices.","Valley degrees of freedom is the third degree of freedom for electrons outside of charge and spin, which has recently attracted extensive attention since it provides remarkable opportunities for realizing the next-generation of ultra-fast speed, ultra-high capacity, low power consumption, and non-volatile devices 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 ; 5 ; 6 ; 7 ; 8 . The valley refers to a local energy maximum or minimum point in the valence or conduction band, which the energy extremum is robust against impurity scattering and phonon due to the large separation in the momentum space 9 . The current focus of valley investigation is understanding how to stably manipulate the valley degrees of freedom, thereby generating robust valley polarization 10 ; 11 ; 12 ; 13 ; 14 ; 15 ; 16 ; 17 ; 18 ; 19 . Physically, there are two strategies to realize valley polarization. One is optical excitation with circularly polarized light 20 ; 21 , the other is the symmetry breaking 22 ; 23 . The former is a dynamic process, while the latter is especially concerned, particularly the intrinsic valley polarization. There are also two kinds of ways to achieve the intrinsic valley polarization. One is to break the symmetry of spatial inversion (P) via ferroelectric polarization 16 ; 24 ; 25 , and the other broke the time-reversal symmetry (T) through magnetism 10 ; 11 ; 12 ; 13 ; 14 ; 15 ; 16 ; 17 ; 18 ; 19 . This kind of material is named ferrovalley material 10 . Until now, the ferrovalley via breaking T symmetry is mainly focused on ferromagnetic (FM) materials. Compared with the FM materials, the antiferromagnetic (AFM) material is robust against external magnetic perturbation, has high storage density, and possesses ultrafast writing speed (about three orders of magnitude higher than the FM material) due to the zero magnetic moment 26 ; 27 . It is well-known that the two sublattices have opposite spin vectors for the AFM hexagonal lattice. Both the P and T symmetries are broken, but the joint symmetry PT is retained. Therefore, the AFM ferrovalley provides inviting potential for the spintronic and valleytronic applications. Unfortunately, the spontaneous valley polarization in AFM materials is exceedingly rare, which makes the circumstances worse. Simultaneously, the anomalous valley Hall effect is undesirably suppressed for the AFM materials. In this work, based on the density functional theory (DFT) and Hamiltonian model, we propose that the AFM monolayer MnBr is a highly fascinating candidate for the abundant valley contrasting physics. Our results show that monolayer MnBr is a semiconductor with the spin up and spin down bands degeneracy without considering spin-orbit coupling (SOC). When the SOC is included, the valence band maximum (VBM) has 21.55 meV valley splitting at K and K’ points, which originated from Mn-d{}_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital by analyzing the effective Hamiltonian. Importantly, the value of valley splitting can be tuned not only by the onsite correlation, strain, magnetization rotation, electric field, and built-in electric field. But also the phase transition of valley polarized semiconductor to metal can be controlled by ferroelectric substrate Sc2CO2. Our findings open an avenue for the investigation of valley physical quantity in the AFM material, realizing the energy conservation, fast operating spintronic and valleytronic devices."

In this work, we analyzed published data on QPTs in three one-dimensional arrays and two two-dimensional arrays using a recently developed phenomenological model of QPTs. The model is based on the insight that the scaled experimental data depend in a universal way on two characteristic length scales of the system: the microscopic length scale L_{0} from which the renormalization group flow starts, and the dephasing length, L_{\varphi}(T) as given by the distance travelled by system-specific elementary excitations over the Planckian time. Our analysis reveals that the data for all five arrays (both 1D and 2D) can be quantitatively and self-consistently explained within the framework of interacting superconducting plasmons. In this picture, L_{\varphi}=v_{p}\hbar/k_{B}T, and L_{0}\approx\Lambda, where v_{p} is the speed of the plasmons and \Lambda is the Coulomb screening length of the Cooper pairs. We also observe that, in 1D arrays, the transition is significantly shifted towards the insulating side compared to the predictions of the sine-Gordon model. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences with recent microwave studies of extremely long JJ chains, as well as with the pair-breaking QPT observed in superconducting nanowires and films.","References [1] M.T.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06038v1,Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect,"Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below 100 mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than 10^{-3}\rm cm^{2}) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width \Delta B as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency f_{s}(T) is less than 1 GHz at temperatures of 100 mK or lower and for system sizes of 10^{-3}\rm cm^{2} or smaller. Additionally, the frequency f_{s}(T) decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency f_{s}(T)\simeq 2.4GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of 6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^{2} for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately 2.4 GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency f_{s}=m_{a}/2\pi of \simeq 2.4 GHz implies an axion mass of \simeq 10^{-5}eV. We also propose additional experiments that support the existence of axions. The appearance of the axion effect in the quantum Hall effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.","I introduction Axions are currently considered one of the most promising candidates for dark matter in the Universe, and their discovery could provide key insights into new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Although several axion models, including axion-like particles (ALPs), exist with masses spanning tens of orders of magnitude, this paper focuses specifically on the QCD axion. The QCD axion model not only addresses the strong CP problem in QCD, but it also remains the most realistic among the various axion models under consideration. As a pseudo-Goldstone boson arising from the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, the QCD axion naturally resolves the strong CP problem axion1 ; axion2 ; axion3 . The mass of the QCD axion is constrained within the range m_{a}=10^{-6}\mbox{eV}\sim 10^{-3}eV Wil ; Wil1 ; Wil2 , corresponding to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave band with frequencies from 1\rm GHz\sim 10^{3}GHz, produced through axion-photon conversion. Despite numerous experimental effortsadmx ; carrack ; haystac ; abracadabra ; organ ; madmax ; brass ; cast ; sumico ; iwazaki01 , many approaches either lack the sensitivity required for axion detection or are restricted to a narrow mass range, even when high sensitivity is achieved. Most experiments rely on a strong magnetic field to stimulate electromagnetic radiationsikivie from axions. Notably, strong magnetic fields are also employed in quantum Hall effect (QHE) experimentsvon ; girvin . In previous researchiwa ; iwa2 , we proposed detecting axions through the integer quantum Hall effect. In QHE, two-dimensional electrons absorb microwaves emitted by axions. This absorption causes electrons in localized states to transition to extended states, thereby enhancing the Hall conductivity. As a result, the axion’s presence can be inferred from an increase in Hall conductivity. By closely examining plateau-to-plateau transitions observed in past experiments, we can identify possible axion signatures in these transitions. In fact, our analysis suggests that existing experimental results may already indicate the presence of axion dark matter. The quantum Hall effect (QHE) von ; girvin is observed in two-dimensional electron systems at low temperatures and under a strong magnetic field B perpendicular to the two-dimensional surface. These systems are typically realized in semiconductor quantum wells, with the semiconductor sample known as a Hall bar. In general, Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy} varies with the magnetic field B. However, when \sigma_{xy} is measured in a system at low temperatures (\sim 1K) and under a strong magnetic field (\sim 10T), the Hall conductivity is quantized as \sigma_{xy}=(e^{2}/2\pi)\times n, where n is a positive integer. This quantization results in plateaus: regions of the magnetic field where \sigma_{xy} remains constant despite changes in B. The formation of these plateaus relates to the Fermi energy. While varying B typically changes the electric current by altering the number of electrons contributing to it, the current remains constant on these quantized plateaus. When B is further decreased (or increased) beyond a critical value, \sigma_{xy} begins to increase (or decrease), leading to a transition to the next plateau, \sigma_{xy}=(e^{2}/2\pi)\times(n+1) (\sigma_{xy}=(e^{2}/2\pi)\times(n-1)). This transition, called a plateau-to-plateau transition, occurs over a specific range of \Delta B, known as the transition width \Delta B. In this paper, we aim to analyze these plateau transitions in detail, incorporating the potential effects of axions. Additionally, we use Hall resistance \rho_{xy}, which is equal to 1/\sigma_{xy} on the plateaus. On these plateaus, the diagonal resistances vanish (\rho_{xx}=\rho_{yy}=0), while they do not vanish in the transition regions, where both \rho_{xx} and \rho_{yy} are nonzero. The presence of the plateau can be understood by noting that, in general, two-dimensional electrons become localized due to a disorder potential V, which represents the effects of impurities, defects, and similar factors (hereafter referred to as disorder potential). However, under a strong magnetic field, some electrons remain delocalized. In the absence of the disorder potential, electrons in a strong magnetic field form Landau levels with energies given by E_{n}=\omega_{c}(n+1/2), where \omega_{c}=eB/m_{e}^{0} represents the cyclotron energy and m_{e}^{0} denotes the effective electron mass in the semiconductor. Each Landau level is highly degenerate, with the number of degenerate states per unit area equal to eB/2\pi. However, when a potential V is introduced, this degeneracy is lifted. Most electrons become localized, while some remain delocalized with energies close to E_{n}. Specifically, there exists an energy region around E_{n} in which states are not localized; we refer to this region as the mobility gap. Understanding the presence of the mobility gap is crucial for analyzing the plateau-to-plateau transitions. In this paper, we discuss the mechanisms underlying plateau-to-plateau transitions and present compelling evidence for the presence of the axion by analyzing these transitions in previous experiments. As the magnetic field is varied, the Hall conductivity remains constant as long as the Fermi energy lies within localized states, which do not contribute to electric current. This constancy in conductivity produces a plateau. A transition occurs only when the Fermi energy enters the extended states within the mobility gap, as these extended states can carry current. The transition ends once the Fermi energy exits the mobility gap. The size of the mobility gap depends on factors such as temperature, the frequency of any external microwaves, and the dimensions of the Hall bar. The width \Delta B of the plateau transition is directly determined by the mobility gap. Therefore, to observe the axion effect in \Delta B, it is essential to examine how these factors influence the mobility gap. We examine in detail several experiments that demonstrate how the width behaves under different conditions: it decreases as the temperature (or the frequency of externally applied microwaves) decreases, or as the size of the Hall bar increases. Thus, \Delta B depends on temperature, microwave frequency, and Hall bar size. We discuss these behaviors of \Delta B by analyzing how the mobility gap varies with these factors. Theoretically, the width \Delta B is expected to vanish for an infinitely large Hall bar at zero temperature with no external radiation. However, in actual experiments using finite-sized samples, a non-vanishing width saturates at low temperatures or low frequencies, indicating a threshold below which \Delta B does not decrease further even as temperature or frequency decreases. Most of this saturation is due to finite-size effects, while a portion may result from the axion effect. The key point in our discussion is that, even with an infinitely large Hall bar, the width \Delta B remains non-zero at zero temperature due to the presence of axion-generated microwaves, albeit weak. Therefore, by carefully examining the behavior of \Delta B at low temperatures while varying the frequency of external microwaves and the size of the Hall bar, we can potentially detect a signature indicating the presence of the axion. (It is well known sikivie ; iwazaki01 that under a magnetic field \vec{B}, axion dark matter generates an oscillating electric field \vec{E}_{a}\propto\cos(m_{a}t)\vec{B}. This field induces oscillating electric currents in nearby metals, producing axion microwaves. In quantum Hall effect experiments, metals exposed to the magnetic field \vec{B} are always present around the Hall bar and are not necessarily oriented perpendicular to \vec{B}. In this paper, we assume the presence of such axion-generated microwaves in quantum Hall effect experiments.) In previous experiments engel ; exp5 ; hohls ; hohls2 ; balaban ; exp6 , the observed saturation frequency f_{s} is generally below 1GHz at temperatures under 100mK, largely because the Hall bar sizes were not sufficient to observe the axion effect. However, in other experiments exp8 ; exp9 , a saturation frequency of approximately 2.4GHz was observed at a low temperature of 35mK with a Hall bar large enough to potentially detect axion effects. This result is unexpected, as saturation frequency typically decreases with lower temperatures and larger Hall bar sizes. We would thus anticipate a much lower saturation frequency, below 1GHz, yet the observed frequency remains high at around 2.4GHz. We suggest that this anomalously high saturation frequency f_{s}=2.4GHz is due to the axion, with f_{s} being theoretically given by f_{s}=m_{a}/2\pi. The axion effect is thus expected to manifest as a high saturation frequency f_{s}\simeq 2.4GHz at low temperature such as 35mK when the Hall bar size is large. Further evidence supporting the presence of the axion is provided by the experiments exp8 ; exp9 , which demonstrate that f_{s}\sim 2.4GHz is independent of the Hall bar size and that an almost identical frequency is observed in a different plateau transition. This transition differs from the one associated with the plateau transition width \Delta B that also saturates at f_{s}=2.4GHz, as noted above. Additionally, an experiment exp4 shows that the saturation temperature T_{s} does not decrease as the size of the Hall bar increases. Generally, saturation temperature decreases with increasing Hall bar size due to finite-size effects. We propose that this size-independent saturation temperature suggests an axion effect, rather than a finite-size effect. Specifically, the saturation temperature is determined by the axion mass, T_{s}\sim m_{a} making it independent of the Hall bar size or specific sample properties. Interestingly, another experiment exp44 shows a similar axion effect, with the observed saturation temperature nearly identical to that in the previous experiment, despite using a different sample. It is important to emphasize that the absorbed power of axion microwaves in the quantum Hall state is significantly enhanced. We have demonstrated iwa ; iwa2 that this power scales with the square of the number of electrons in the state, where the electron number density is typically on the order of 10^{11}\rm cm^{-2}. This is in contrast to resonant cavity experiments sikivie , where the absorbed power is only proportional to the number of electrons on the cavity surface. This enhancement effect in the quantum Hall state makes the axion signal potentially observable at temperatures below 100mK when the Hall bar size exceeds 10^{-3}\rm cm^{2}. The experiments that show signs of the axion effect meet these conditions. To confirm the presence of the axion effect (i.e., axion-induced microwaves), we suggest shielding the Hall bar from axion microwaves and observing whether the high saturation frequency (approximately 2.4GHz) disappears or decreases. In this paper, we propose an improved shielding method, which is more practical than the approach in our previous work. We also outline additional confirmation methods. After detecting a saturation frequency of approximately 2.4GHz at low temperatures, we can examine whether this frequency changes with temperature or Hall bar size. Furthermore, it would be informative to test whether the same saturation frequency f_{s}\sim 2.4GHz appears across different Hall bar samples. In this paper, we use physical units, c=1, k_{B}=1 and \hbar=1. Our idea is also applicable to dark photon with frequencies of microwaves discussed below."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05908v1,Charge transfer spin-polarons and ferromagnetism in weakly doped AB-stacked TMD heterobilayers,"We study the formation of ferromagnetic and magnetic polaron states in weakly doped heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides in the “heavy fermion” limit in which one layer hosts a dense set of local moments and the other hosts a low density of itinerant holes. We show that interactions among the carriers in the itinerant layer induces a ferromagnetic exchange. We characterize the ground state finding a competition, controlled by the carrier concentration and interlayer exchange, between a layer decoupled phase of itinerant carriers in a background of local moments, a fully polarized ferromagnet and a canted antiferromagnet. In the canted antiferromagnet phase the combination of the in-plane 120∘ Néel order and Ising spin orbit couplings induces winding in the electronic wavefunction giving rise to a topologically non-trivial spin texture and an observable anomalous Hall effect. At larger carrier density the ferromagnetically ordered phase transitions into a paramagnetic heavy Fermi liquid state. This theory enables a comprehensive understanding of the existing experimental observations while also making predictions including experimental signatures enabling direct imaging of spin polaron bound states with scanning tunneling microscopy. Our work shows that the prevailing paradigm of the (Doniach) phase diagram of heavy fermion metals is fundamentally modified in the low doping regime of heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.","References Andrei et al.
