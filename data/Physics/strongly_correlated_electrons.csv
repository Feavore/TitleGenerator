https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10447v1,Ultrafast optical control of charge orders in kagome metals,"We show that ultrafast optical pump pulses provide effective control over charge orders in the kagome metals AV3Sb5 with A= K, Rb, and Cs. Starting from the real charge density waves (rCDWs) at the p-type Van Hove singularity, we conduct a thorough analysis of the post-pump dynamics by time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory. Our analysis uncovers distinct dynamical phenomena under linearly and circularly polarized pumps. Linearly polarized pumps induce directional preferences in the rCDWs, accompanied by an enhancement in the flat band. Unexpectedly, charge nematicity also emerges and receives maximal enhancement at a resonant pump frequency, which we understand with a Rabi-oscillation-like model. On the other hand, circularly polarized pumps suppress the rCDWs uniformly and triggers imaginary CDWs (iCDWs) with charge loop currents. Our results can be directly compared to the pump-probe experiments on the kagome metals AV3Sb5.","References Yin et al. [2022] J.-X. Yin, B. Lian, and M. Z.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10430v1,"Simulating the two-dimensional t-J model at finite doping
with neural quantum states","Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states—specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS)—to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the t-J model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as 6\times 10 sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.","References D.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10078v1,Ferromagnetic fragmented ground state in the pyrochlore HoRuO,"The consecutive magnetic ordering of the Ho and Ru ions in the pyrochlore Ho2Ru2O7 and their interplay are investigated by neutron scattering, magnetic and specific heat measurements. The Ru magnetic moments order at 95 K into an easy-plane antiferromagnetic state, while the Ho moments order at 1.55 K into an unsaturated ferromagnetic state that retains an extensive ground state entropy and present complex spin dynamics throughout the low temperature phase. These unexpected features are analyzed in terms of a fragmented ferromagnetic state equivalent to the pyrochlore kagome ice. Selection of this unusual state relies on a subtle compromise between long-range ferromagnetic interactions between holmium moments and a repulsive cubic field, both mediated by the ruthenium lattice.","References Gardner et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10065v1,Impact of triplon damping on thermal Hall conductivity in Shastry-Sutherland model,"We investigate the thermal Hall effect in the Shastry-Sutherland model, incorporating interactions between quasiparticle excitations. In this model, with strong nearest-neighbor interactions, the ground state is well described by the direct product of spin-singlet states, and the elementary excitations to spin-triplet states are known as triplons. In candidate materials for this model, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions are inevitably present, resulting in topologically non-trivial band structures for triplon excitations. In this study, we examine quasiparticle damping due to triplon-triplon interactions as a potential factor contributing to the suppression of the thermal Hall effect. We apply nonlinear flavor-wave theory to the Shastry-Sutherland model and treat triplons as bosonic excitations. We calculate the triplon damping rate using the imaginary Dyson equation approach and evaluate the thermal Hall conductivity. Our findings demonstrate that triplons with nonzero Berry curvature are scattered by thermally excited triplons. This scattering effect suppresses the thermal Hall conductivity, particularly at finite temperatures, highlighting the significant role of triplon damping in the thermal Hall effect.","Topological quantum states of matter have attracted considerable attention in condensed matter physics. In particular, topologically nontrivial electronic band structures have been extensively studied in various systems, such as quantum Hall systems [1, 2, 3] and topological insulators [4, 5, 6]. In these systems, topological properties manifest as quantum transport phenomena, such as the quantum Hall and spin Hall effects. On the other hand, the topological properties of elementary excitations from symmetry-broken states have also been explored [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Since these excitations are often described as charge-neutral bosonic quasiparticles, it is difficult to observe their topological properties electrically. However, the thermal Hall effect, a thermal analog of the quantum Hall effect, has been proposed as a promising phenomenon to reflect the topological properties of bosonic quasiparticles [7, 8, 9, 12, 10, 11, 22, 23]. For example, thermal Hall effects originating from magnons and phonons have been observed in insulating magnets [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. In these bosonic systems, the Berry curvature of the quasiparticle bands plays a crucial role in this effect [31]. In addition to magnons and phonons, which are collective modes arising from symmetry-broken phases, triplon excitations have been studied as another type of quasiparticle. Triplons are spin-triplet excitations from a spin-singlet ground state in quantum magnets, often described as bosons [32]. A typical example exhibiting triplon excitations is the spin-dimer phase of the Shastry-Sutherland model [33], a two-dimensional quantum magnet with strong nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions. As candidate materials for this system, SrCu2(BO3)2 has been proposed [34, 35], and its magnetic properties and excitation spectra have been actively studied [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. In this compound, the magnetic properties cannot be fully explained by the pure Shastry-Sutherland model; additional interactions, such as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, are necessary to account for experimental results [42, 43, 44]. Due to the DM interaction, the triplon bands exhibit a topologically nontrivial band structure with nonzero Berry curvature, which induces the thermal Hall effect [45]. However, recent experiments have shown no evidence of the thermal Hall effect in SrCu2(BO3)2 [46]. As possible causes of this discrepancy, the effects of triplon-triplon interactions and coupling with phonons have been proposed, which were not considered in previous theoretical studies. Recently, it has been suggested that interactions between bosonic quasiparticles play a crucial role in the stability of topological chiral edge modes [47, 48] and in the thermal Hall effect in magnon systems [49], which may also apply to triplon systems. In this paper, we focus on the finite-lifetime effect of triplons resulting from triplon-triplon interactions as a possible cause for the suppression of the thermal Hall effect. We investigate the effect of triplon damping on the thermal Hall conductivity in the Shastry-Sutherland model incorporating DM interactions. We introduce triplons as bosonic quasiparticles by applying the flavor-wave theory to this model. We address contributions beyond the linear flavor-wave approximation by using the imaginary Dyson equation (iDE) approach. To calculate the damping rate of triplons, we consider the collision and decay processes in the triplon self-energy. Our findings reveal that at zero temperature, the higher-energy triplon bands are significantly broadened due to the damping effect, which originates from the decay process where a triplon splits into two quasiparticles. At finite temperatures, the collision process involving thermally excited triplons also contributes to the damping effect. Through this process, triplon bands with nonzero Berry curvature become smeared out. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity is suppressed by triplon damping at finite temperatures, which originates from the scattering of triplons with nonzero Berry curvature by thermally excited triplons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these damping effects result from contributions beyond the lowest-order Born approximation, which can be addressed using the iDE approach. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we describe the model and method employed in this study. We introduce the Shastry-Sutherland model in Sec. 2.1 and triplon excitations as its bosonic quasiparticles from the ground state based on the generalized Holstein-Primakoff transformation, which is referred to as the flavor-wave theory. The linear approximation of the flavor-wave theory is explained in Sec. 2.2. Contributions beyond the linear flavor-wave approximation are explored in Sec. 2.3. Nonlinear effects are addressed using the iDE approach and are incorporated by the triplon damping rate. In Sec. 2.4, we present the method for calculating the thermal Hall conductivity with and without triplon damping. Section 3 discusses the results of this study. In Sec. 3.1, we show the triplon band structure and Berry curvature in the Shastry-Sutherland model within the linear flavor-wave approximation. The results regarding the triplon damping effect on the spectral function are given in Sec. 3.2. The origin of the damping effect is examined through the scattering processes of triplons. In Sec. 3.3, we present the thermal Hall conductivity calculated with triplon damping and discuss the impact of triplon damping at finite temperatures. Finally, Sec. 4 is devoted to the summary."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09907v1,Density-wave like behavior in a new Kagome material CeRuSi,"Kagome materials with inherent geometric frustration can produce many interesting physical properties, such as flat bands, quantum spin liquid, chiral magnetism, superconductivity and density-wave orders. Sometimes, the localized 4f electrons from Ce atoms coupled with other conduction electrons would also give rise to the flat bands near the Fermi level, and results in the formation of heavy fermion. Thus, it is highly probable that kagome material incorporating Ce element will display nontrivial physical properties. In this study, we present a new Kagome material belonging to the trinary Laves phase, Ce2Ru3Si, in which kagome plane is formed by Ru atoms. Electrical transport and specific heat measurements reveal a density-wave like transition. A Curie-Weiss behavior is observed in low-temperature region. Meanwhile we also find a relatively large specific coefficient \gamma_{n}(0). The calculated Wilson ratio R_{\mathrm{W}}\propto{\chi(0)/\gamma_{n}} is approximately 3.1, indicating a moderate electron correlation effect. Chemical doping of Ir at the Ru site rapidly suppresses this density-wave like transition, while Mo doping leads to a gradual decrease in transition temperature. Theoretical calculation indicates both the Ce-4f and Ru-4d electronic bands cross the Fermi level, forming a Mexican-hat-shape Fermi surface close to the Fermi energy, potentially accounting for the observed density-wave like transition. Our findings provide an useful platform for investigating how hybridization between 4f and 4d electrons influences the electronic transport, and the relationship between the density-wave transition and kagome structure.","The kagome lattice consists of interwoven triangles and hexagons, which inherently leads to geometric frustration[1, 2]. The band structure of the ideal kagome lattice exhibits the Dirac point, van Hove singularity (vHS), and flat band[3, 4, 5], with the latter two having a high density of states and large effective mass which may lead to strong electron correlations. With strong interaction between charged particles, an instability of Fermi surface may be induced, leading to various quantum phenomenon, such as superconductivity, charge density wave (CDW), pair density wave (PDW), and complex magnetism[6]. In contrast, the Dirac point with linear dispersion may results in various topological states[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Thus, the system with a kagome structure provides fertile ground for studying the interplay between magnetism, electron correlation, superconductivity and topology. In recent years, a new prototype structure based on kagome lattice was discovered, namely AV3Sb5 (A = K, Cs, Rb)[12], leading to extensive research on interplay and competition between various phases such as superconductivity, CDW, PDW, nematic and stripe order[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. With replacing V by Cr in this structure, a new kagome material CsCr3Sb5 was found to exhibit strong electron correlation, noteworthy that a flat band exists near the Fermi level; under high pressure, the density-wave transition in this sample was suppressed and unconventional superconductivity was observed[21]. Additionally, the CDW also has been discovered in antiferromagnetic ordered kagome phase FeGe[22], etc.. Compared to 3d elements like V, Cr, Fe, the element Ru possesses 4d electrons, and exhibits relatively weaker electron correlation but quite often shows magnetic feature, which may lead to other novel phenomena. With Ru atoms forming a kagome net, LaRu3Si2 possesses the highest superconducting transition temperature (T_{\mathrm{c}}) of 7.8 K among other compounds with the same structure, RT_{3}Si2 and RT_{3}B2 (R = rare earth metal, T = transition metal), highlighting the significant role of Ru’s 4d electrons in forming the superconductivity[23]. Very recently, charge order above room temperature in La(Ru1-xFex)3Si2 was also discovered[24]. Additionally, superconductor CeRu2 with C15 Laves phase, in which superconductivity may strongly intertwined with magnetism, features a Ru-kagome plane oriented perpendicular to the [111] direction[25, 26]. Despite incorporating rare-earth element Ce into the lattice, contrary to predictions, its 4f electrons are not localized; instead, they hybridize with conduction electrons leading to an intermediate valence state for Ce ions[27]. This hybridization involving 4f electrons can give rise to various correlated electronic phenomena such as heavy fermion, mixed-valence system, and unconventional superconductivity[28, 29]. The Laves phase is characterized by three predominant structural types, the hexagonal C14 type (MgZn2-type), the cubic C15 type (MgCu2-type), and the hexagonal C36 type (MgNi2-type)[30, 31]. Traditional Lave phase includes binary compounds with common formula of AB_{2}, however if substituting non-kagome-transition-metal element with non-metallic element Si will generate trinary Lave phase, such as Sc2Ir4-xSix, Mg2Ni3Si, and superconductor Mg2Ir3Si[32, 33]. In this study, we present a new Ru-based kagome material with the hexagonal structure: Ce2Ru3Si. Transport measurements reveal a shoulder-like behavior in the temperature dependent resistivity curve, indicative of a potential density-wave like transition; this finding is corroborated by specific heat measurements. Meanwhile, the magnetization curve basically obeys the Curie-Weiss law, and no obvious anomaly is observed. This discrepancy may be attributed to an enhanced delocalization degree of the 4f-electrons due to their hybridization with conduction electrons. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both the 4f-electron bands from Ce ions and the 4d-electron bands from Ru ions cross the Fermi level; notably, the 4d band from Ru forms a Mexican-hat-shaped band near the Fermi level, which gives rise to a vHS."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09883v1,Spin excitations arising from anisotropic Dirac spinons in YCu(OD)Br[Br(OD)],"A Dirac quantum spin liquid hosts Dirac spinons, which are low-energy fractionalized neutral quasiparticles with spin 1/2 that obey the Dirac equation. Recent studies have revealed cone spin continuum in YCu3(OD)6Br2[Brx(OD)1-x], consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. In this work, we further studied spin excitations using the inelastic neutron scattering technique. The width of low-energy spin excitations shows a linear temperature dependence, which can be explained by spinon-spinon interactions with a Dirac dispersion. Polarized neutron scattering measurements reveal that in-plane magnetic fluctuations are about 1.5 times stronger than the out-of-plane ones, suggesting the presence of out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Moreover, the high-energy spin excitations around 14 meV agree with the one-pair spinon-antispinon excitations in Raman studies. The real part of the dynamical susceptibility derived from the Kramers-Kronig relationship also accords with the Knight shift measured by nuclear magnetic resonance. These results provide further insights for the possible Dirac quantum spin liquid in this system.","References Savary and Balents [2017] L. Savary and L. Balents, Quantum spin liquids: A review, Rep.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09761v1,"An EFT for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets: gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones, and phase transitions","We build and discuss a low energy effective field theory for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets in presence of an external magnetic field. Such an effective theory is simple yet rich, and features a number of phenomena such as the appearance of gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones and a “spin flop” phase transition, all within the regime of validity of the theory. We also discuss in detail, the quantization procedure of the free theory in the presence of a magnetic field, which is made non-trivial by the presence of a single-time derivative term. This class of materials make a precious test field for exotic phenomena in quantum field theory. Moreover, we explicitly perform the matching of the effective theory to the short distance theory of a specific anti-ferromagnet, namely, nickel oxide. The latter is particularly relevant in light of recent proposals of employing this material towards the hunt for light dark matter. As a byproduct of our study, we also re-evaluate the role played by discrete symmetries in magnetic materials, presenting it in a way that is completely consistent with the proper low energy EFT ideology.","Anti-ferromagnets are magnetic materials which, below a certain critical temperature, exhibit long range order but no net magnetization. Contrary to ferromagnets, they were initially thought to have limited practical applications Néel (1971). Recent years, however, have witnessed the development of a plethora of such applications, ranging from electron transport controlled by the spin degrees of freedom (e.g., Baibich et al., 1988; Binasch et al., 1989), the so-called spintronics, the development of quantum sensors (e.g., Lachance-Quirion et al., 2019, 2017), and, recently, light dark matter detection Esposito and Pavaskar (2023); Marsh et al. (2019). Moreover, magnetic materials, both ferromagnets and anti-ferromagnets, are typically regarded as the textbook example for the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the emergence of Goldstone bosons (e.g., Burgess, 2000). These are indeed nothing but the spin collective excitations of these systems, the so-called magnons. Yet, in reality, the spectrum of most anti-ferromagnets feature tiny but non-zero gaps. This can be attributed to magneto-crystalline anisotropies, which provide small effects of explicit symmetry breaking. This is due to the presence of certain energetically favorable directions for the spins of the material, which are dictated by the underlying crystal structure of the anti-ferromagnet. These anisotropies, along with the exchange interaction, in turn determine the ground state of the system as well its behavior under the application of an external magnetic field. In this work we extend the well known effective field theory (EFT) for magnons in anti-ferromagnet (e.g., Burgess, 2000; Chandra et al., 1990; Pavaskar et al., 2022) to include these anisotropic effects. In particular, we will consider the case where the system features two distinct anisotropies, the so-called “easy plane” anti-ferromagnets Rezende et al. (2019). The other class of anisotropic anti-ferromagnets, so-called “easy axis”, feature only one anisotropy, but their spectrum can be obtained from that the previous class, simply setting one the parameters to zero. We will show that this extended EFT, while being eventually rather simple, features a number of interesting phenomena, such as the presence of the so-called gapped Goldstones (e.g., Nicolis and Piazza, 2013; Nicolis et al., 2013; Watanabe et al., 2013; Cuomo et al., 2021), their lifting to pseudo-Goldstones, as well as the presence of the so-called “spin flop” phase transition triggered by a varying external magnetic field, where the spin alignment in the ground state suddenly changes its direction (e.g., Rezende et al., 2019). All this, is computable within the regime of validity of the EFT. Moreover, in the presence of a magnetic field, as we will see, the theory cannot be diagonalized by a local redefinition. Hence it requires a careful quantization procedure, which we address in this work. Finally, we match our EFT to the short distance theory for a particular anti-ferromagnet, namely nickel oxide (NiO). The latter, thanks to its simple structure and spin-interactions, is often considered as the prototypical room-temperature anti-ferromagnet. Indeed, this material has been used to study a number of different processes, such as inelastic light scattering (e.g., Grimsditch et al., 1998; Milano et al., 2004) and magnetic response to terahertz frequencies Sievers III and Tinkham (1963); Satoh et al. (2010). Moreover, as mentioned, it has recently been realized that such a system offers an optimal target to look for the scattering of dark matter with spin-dependent interactions and masses as low as the keV Esposito and Pavaskar (2023), as well as to look for axion-like dark matter with masses in the meV range Catinari et al. (2024). The goal of this work is also to present everything in a framework which can bridge the linguistic gap that is often present between the standard condensed matter and high energy physics literature. This is particularly important in light of the role that anti-ferromagnets might play in future searches for light dark matter, a genuinely high energy physics question which, however, requires condensed matter tools to be tackled. Conventions: We adopt natural units, \hbar=c=1, and an index notation such that i,j,k=1,2,3 label spatial coordinates. We also employ Einstein’s notation for summing over repeated indices."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09814v1,Quantum Criticality in Black Hole Scattering,"The Teukolsky equation describing scattering from Kerr black holes captures a few important effects in the process of binary mergers, such as tidal deformations and the decay of ringdown modes, thereby raising interest in the structure of its solutions. In this letter we identify critical phenomena emerging in the corresponding phase space. One special point exists in this phase space, where the black hole is extremal and the scattered wave lies exactly at the superradiant bound, at which the physics simplifies considerably. We provide an indirect realization of a conformal symmetry emerging at this configuration, which leads to its interpretation as a critical point. Away from the critical point conformal symmetry is broken, but it is shown that critical fluctuations continue to be dominant in a wide range of parameters and at finite black hole temperatures. As in quantum many-body systems, the physics in this regime is described exclusively by the temperature and a set of critical exponents, therefore leading to robust predictions that are unique to the Kerr metric.","Over the past decade, a number of remarkable discoveries in black hole physics have been made. Since the first direct detection of gravitational waves emitted from a compact binary merger in 2015 Abbott et al. (2016), the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has cataloged about a hundred events. On a different front, in 2019 the EHT telescope captured the first-ever image of a black hole in the center of the M87 galaxy Akiyama et al. (2019), and a next-generation experiment is already underway Ayzenberg et al. (2023). The immense technological and experimental progress has led to a strong theoretical effort aiming to produce robust and qualitative predictions for black holes, a goal which remains a challenging problem despite a rich scientific history. Identifying symmetry breaking patterns has proven to be a very useful paradigm in addressing similar challenges in almost all areas of physics. Spontaneous symmetry breaking in particle physics and critical phenomena in condensed matter physics are some of the most well-known manifestations of this paradigm. In black hole physics, patterns of symmetry breaking have been studied with respect to ”regional” spacetime symmetries such as the near-horizon symmetries of (near-)extreme Kerr Bardeen and Horowitz (1999); Guica et al. (2009) and the near-ring symmetries associated with the black hole’s photon ring Hadar et al. (2022); Kapec et al. (2023), as well as hidden symmetries arising in different energy limits Maldacena and Strominger (1997); Castro et al. (2010); Charalambous et al. (2021, 2022); Hui et al. (2022a, b). In this letter we would like to report on a different type of symmetry breaking pattern that occurs in the space of configurations. Of particular interest in this context is the Teukolsky equation, which describes linear perturbations over the Kerr metric with mass M and angular momentum parameter a Teukolsky (1973). The Teukolsky equation captures a variety of effects involved in the dynamics of rotating black holes. Some examples include tidal effects during the inspiral phase of a binary merger and quasi-normal mode decay in its ringdown phase. In the eikonal limit, the Teukolsky equation also captures the physics of the photon ring. Figure 1: The phase diagram of perturbations around Kerr black holes. In the two-dimensional space of configurations spanned by the Hawking temperature and the parameter \displaystyle g\equiv a\omega, (1) there is a special point where the black hole is extremal and g is equal to \displaystyle g_{c}\equiv\frac{m}{2}, (2) corresponding to the superradiant bound. Here \omega and m are the energy and azimuthal number of the perturbation. At this point the radial part of the Teukolsky equation simplifies considerably as it reduces to the confluent hypergeometric equation Starobinsky (1973); Starobinskii and Churilov (1973); Teukolsky (1973); Press and Teukolsky (1973); Teukolsky and Press (1974); Bredberg et al. (2010); Hartman et al. (2010). We provide an indirect realization of a conformal SO(1,2) symmetry arising in this configuration. The emergence of conformal symmetry at zero temperature is reminiscent of the Quantum Critical Point (QCP) in quantum many-body systems Sachdev (2011); Hartnoll et al. (2018). At non-zero temperatures conformal symmetry is broken. However, the scaling behavior implied by the critical point gives rise to a wide range at finite temperatures in which the physics is dominated by critical fluctuations. This region is known in condensed matter physics as the Quantum Critical Regime (QCR). We depict the phase diagram describing these phenomena in figure 1."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09744v1,Measuring Hall voltage and Hall resistance in an atom-based quantum simulator,"The Hall effect [1, 2, 3, 4] has a paramount role in a wide range of disciplines, from applied sciences [5, 6] to the fundamental exploration of novel topological phases of matter [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In the solid state, this effect describes the emergence of a voltage drop perpendicular to the current flow in the presence of a magnetic field, leading to a transverse Hall resistance. Despite its fundamental nature, a full understanding and control of the Hall effect in interacting quantum systems is still lacking. This has led to the development of quantum simulators based on neutral atoms [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], where strongly correlated and universal manifestations of the Hall effect were recently unveiled [21, 22]. However, a direct measurement of the Hall voltage and of the Hall resistance in those systems was not achieved so far. Here, we demonstrate a technique for the measurement of the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator. From that we provide the first direct measurement of the Hall resistance in a non-electron-based system and study its dependence on the carrier density, along with theoretical analyses. Our work closes a major gap between analog quantum simulations and measurements performed in real solid-state systems, providing a key tool for the exploration of the Hall effect in highly tunable and strongly correlated systems.","References Ashcroft and Mermin [1976] N.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09699v1,"Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and
Application to Rare-Earth Magnets","Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective \mathbb{Z}_{2} chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoemission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.","Magnetic topological semimetals with cubic symmetries in the parent state, particularly those found in rare-earth magnets with rock-salt structures Hirschberger et al. (2016); Schrunk et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2023); Kushnirenko et al. (2022, 2023); Wu et al. (2019), have recently gained attention. The cubic space group permits several point group symmetries that can protect topological band crossings Chiu et al. (2016). These include three- and four-fold rotational symmetries which can individually stabilize crossings between pairs of Kramer’s degenerate bands, giving rise to three-dimensional Dirac semimetals (DSMs) Yang and Nagaosa (2014). Therefore, cubic crystals offer a promising platform for realizing cubic-symmetric DSMs. Over the past decade, several cubic-symmetric materials have been proposed as DSM candidates. Notably, ab initio calculations have identified several full Heusler alloys Guo et al. (2017a); Mondal et al. (2019), along with Pd and Pt oxides as potential DSMs Li et al. (2017). More recently, experiments on the cubic material PtBi2 Wu et al. (2019) have revealed existence of Fermi-arc like surface states, leading to the suggestion that it is an DSM. Moreover, cubic-symmetric DSM states have been proposed as parent phases for magnetic Weyl semimetals Duan et al. (2018); Guo et al. (2017b); Huang et al. (2020). Despite the growing body of literature supporting the existence of DSMs in cubic crystals, the extent to which Dirac semimetallic features influence the electronic behavior of cubic crystalline materials remains unclear and has yet to be systematically explored. (a) (b) Figure 1: Universal bulk-characteristics and phase diagram of symmetry-protected Dirac semimetals (DSMs). (a) The minimum number of Dirac points (red dots; DPs) in rotational-symmetry protected DSMs is 2, which lie along the rotation axis (highlighted in blue). (b) In cubic-symmetry protected DSMs the minimum number of DPs is 6 which appear along the three symmetry-equivalent, fourfold-rotation axes. In inversion and time-reversal symmetry preserving systems, there are two types of DSMs, sd and sp [sd and sf], in category (a) [(b)]. (inset) Respective phase diagrams supported by the minimal Hamiltonians describing these phases on (a) tetragonal and (b) simple cubic lattices. Here, “TI” and “OI” are acronyms for topological insulator and ordinary insulator. Understanding cubic-symmetric DSMs poses two key challenges, however. First, the multiple equivalent rotation axes and mirror planes in cubic systems can protect a variety of bulk-band crossings, complicating the interpretation of experimental data. As a result, early theoretical works on DSMs primarily focused on trigonal, tetragonal, and hexagonal systems, which feature a single principal rotation axis. Through minimal Hamiltonians, various aspects of the physics of rotational-symmetry protected DSMs have been addressed, including nature of band-topology Kargarian et al. (2016, 2018); Wieder et al. (2020); Tyner et al. (2023); Fang and Cano (2021), classification schemes Yang and Nagaosa (2014); Yang et al. (2015a); Gao et al. (2016), and experimental implications Burkov and Kim (2016); Armitage et al. (2018). Insights from such minimal modeling have led to the identification of several candidate materials Wang et al. (2012, 2013); Le et al. (2017, 2018); Kim et al. (2019); Tang et al. (2016), and interpretation of experimental investigations into tetragonal Liu et al. (2014a); Neupane et al. (2014); Borisenko et al. (2014, 2020); Zhang et al. (2019); Lv et al. (2015); Kong et al. (2021) and hexagonal Liu et al. (2014b); Xu et al. (2015a); Xiong et al. (2015); Zhang et al. (2017); Yang et al. (2023) symmetric Dirac materials. Second, theoretical investigations have revealed an absence of a robust bulk-boundary correspondence in rotational-symmetry protected DSMs Kargarian et al. (2016, 2018); Wieder et al. (2020); Tyner et al. (2023); Fang and Cano (2021), in sharp contrast to topological insulators and Weyl semimetals (67) . Since surface states have been pivotal in probing the bulk topology of topological materials Armitage et al. (2018); Lv et al. (2021), this feature of symmetry-protected DSMs complicates the diagnosis of their bulk-topology using surface-sensitive techniques such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Some of this ambiguity can yet be resolved by examining the universal features of minimal models, which offer a clearer framework for associating surface state characteristics with bulk topological properties. Here, we systematically develop a theory of non-magnetic DSMs in cubic crystals, and demonstrate the universal aspects of the relationship between various space group symmetries and observable properties of such DSMs. We find two classes of cubic-symmetric DSMs, based on the parity of the orbitals that hybridize to give rise to Dirac points (DPs). In analogy to similar classification of rotational-symmetry protected DSMs Wieder et al. (2020), we name them sd-DSM (orbitals with same parity) and sf-DSM (orbitals with opposite parity). In both cases the minimum number of DPs is six, which is three times larger than those in rotational-symmetry protected DSMs; see Fig. 1. This feature indicates that the surface states in cubic-symmetric DSMs are qualitatively distinct than those in rotational-symmetry protected DSMs. We construct minimal models to study the topology of the Bloch wavefunctions, identify the universal symmetry-protected features of the surface states, and the nature of spin-momentum locking the latter supports. More specifically, in the sd-DSM we identify an effective \mathbb{Z}_{2} chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Further, by incorporating candidate magnetic orders that may develop as instabilities of cubic-symmetric DSMs, we show that this framework could provide insights into key spectral features observed in rare-earth magnets. We further make specific predictions that can validate the role of DSM physics and also identify potential cubic materials that could be experimentally tested for similar phenomena. Overall, our study suggests that DSM physics may offer a coherent framework for understanding surface states in magnetic topological semimetals with cubic parent symmetries, connecting various materials, and clarifying their origins."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09669v1,"Layered Multiple Scattering Approach to Hard X-ray Photoelectron Diffraction: 
Theory and Application","Photoelectron diffraction (PED) is a powerful and essential experimental technique for resolving the structure of surfaces with sub-angstrom resolution. In the high energy regime, researchers in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) observe modulating patterns attributed to X-ray-PED (XPD) effects. This is accompanied by other challenges such as low cross-sections, significant photon momentum transfer, and non-negligible phonon scattering. Overall, XPD is not only an advantageous approach but also exhibits unexpected effects. To disentangle these diffraction influences, we present a PED implementation for the SPRKKR package that utilizes multiple scattering theory and a one-step model in the photoemission process. Unlike real-space implementations of the multiple scattering XPD formalism, we propose a k-space implementation based on the layer KKR method. The main advantage of this method is its ability to address a very broad kinetic energy range (20-8000 eV) without convergence problems related to angular momentum and cluster size. Furthermore, the so-called alloy analogy model can be used to simulate XPD at finite temperatures as well as XPD effects observed in soft and hard X-ray ARPES. For practical applications, we have calculated the circular dichroism in angular distributions (CDAD) associated with core-level photoemission of 2p from Si(100) and 3p from Ge(100). Photoelectrons are excited by hard X-rays (6000 eV) with right and left circularly polarized radiation (RCP and LCP, respectively).","As an influential technique for probing the atomic structure in the vicinity of a given emitter, photoelectron diffraction (PED) is widely used for various investigation purposes: crystal structures, bonding geometries of atoms, and the local environment of impurity or dopant atoms inside surfaces [1, 2, 3, 4]. It is regarded as being analogous to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) at the fundamental level, specifically regarding the angular distribution of photoelectrons emitted from a crystal surface. Nonetheless, the underlying physics and the investigative objectives of the two approaches are disparate. The angular distribution of emitted electrons represents the momentum of initial states in ARPES while in PED, it reveals the interference of photoelectron waves from final states. The observed alteration in PED intensities depends on the constructive or destructive interference of all the coherently emitted electrons. This means that details related to atomic arrangements, bonding orientations and distances, and electronic and chemical features are analyzed. Depending on the utilized photon energies with respect to photoelectron kinetic energies, this tool can be termed either ultraviolet-PED (UPD) or X-ray-PED (XPD). In summary, photoemission can provide information about core-level electrons or delocalized valence band electrons. Accordingly, there are core-level PED (CL-PED) and valence-band PED (VB-PED). The main difference is that the angular distribution in VB-PED is induced by two interference phenomena: from primary waves emitted at various atomic sites and from the scattering of corresponding secondary waves at neighboring sites [5]. At high photon energies, XPD effects [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] make ARPES data vague, alongside other complications such as poor cross-sections, considerable momentum transfer from photons causing a pronounced modulation of ARPES patterns, and substantial phonon scattering. Given the significant contributions of PED (especially in the circular dichroism in the angular distribution (CDAD) interpretation and disentangling of XPD effects), the development of a suitable theoretical model of scattering is of paramount importance. Powerful computational approaches that address single and multiple scattering in real space and reciprocal space have been developed earlier and will be summarized and reviewed in subsection 2.1. However, these packages share some limitations. First, most of them perform calculations in real space [13, 14, 15], which might not be convenient for high kinetic energies where the effective cluster sizes need to be very large. Second, some models have to borrow the atomic potential from other sources. For instance, in the MSCD code [16], it is taken from the muffin-tin potential in the database of Moruzzi et al. [17], which neglects relativistic effects. For low kinetic energy, MsSpec [18] utilizes the potential file from Munich SPRKKR [19, 20]. In the case of the dynamical high-energy electron diffraction approach to XPD [21, 22], the real and imaginary parts of the crystal potential (assumed to have 3D bulk periodicity) are computed based on the Fourier coefficients of atomic potentials available in various parameterizations [23]. Third, some approaches are designed to cope with a specific regime of kinetic energy, not flexibly covering the whole range from UV to hard X-ray. For instance, EDAC [24] is designed to cope with diffraction at lower kinetic energies compared to the method proposed by Winkelmann et al. [21, 22]. Fourth, although hard X-ray calculations (e.g. a chromium Kα source) [25, 26] attempt to simulate XPD patterns, not all of them are available for CDAD patterns for core levels in this regime, to the best of our knowledge. Indeed, the TMSP code [15] developed by Matsushita and colleagues can work with circularly polarized light [27] and interpret the CDAD in terms of the rotational shift of forward focusing peaks around the incident-light axis [28, 29]. However, no simulated CDAD for hard X-ray core levels has been published. Fifth, Kikuchi diffraction [30] is well-documented in scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) with energy sources up to 100 keV, where it manifests as electron backscatter diffraction patterns [31]. Nevertheless, it is challenging to observe this phenomenon in spectroscopy and few simulations are able to reconstruct it [32, 33, 34]. Lastly, to accurately represent scattering by cluster approaches, there is a high need for large values for the maximum angular momentum l_{max} (the number of scattering phase shifts). In the case of 10 keV electrons scattering from an atomic potential with a radius of 1 Å radius, this parameter must be raised to 100 [22]. In our earlier effort [33], major fine features of W 3d5/2 at h\nu=6 keV were relatively well reproduced by calculations. Building upon this groundwork and prior research [35], which highlighted a greater than 50% contrast in the spin-orbit doublets and the discriminant diffractogram of sub-levels in the case of W(110), this study describes our method utilized in the above-mentioned works in details and resolves these combined obstacles for Si(100) and Ge(100) at h\nu=6 keV. Our focus will be on studying fine Kikuchi and CDAD for core-level emission XPD (CL-XPD), which is more widely utilized compared to its counterpart, valence-band XPD (VB-XPD) [36, 37, 38, 39]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09662v1,On the Ferrimagnetic State of CrCl(pyz),"Van der Waals layered ferromagnetic compounds with high two-dimensional electronic conductivity holds strong potential for quantum computing, future unconventional superconductors, catalysts, batteries, and fuel cells. We suggest a minimal theoretical model to understand the magnetic properties of the metal-organic framework CrCl2(pyz)2 (pyz=pyrazine). Using a Hubbard model we show that the groundstate is dominated by a specific configuration of delocalized electrons on the pyz sites with a ferrimagnetic coupling to the localized spins on the Cr sites. This model suggests a magnetic moment of 2\mu_{B} which is remarkably close to the experimental value of 1.8\mu_{B} [K. S. Pedersen et al., Nat. Chem. 10, 1056-1061 (2018)]. From Weiss mean-field theory we predict a weak ferromagnetic Cr-Cr coupling of \approx 0.9 meV. This is consolidated by second order perturbation theory of the RKKY interaction yielding a Cr-Cr coupling of \approx 5 meV. Understanding the interactions in these types of compounds can facilitate designs of metal-organic compounds with tailored magnetic properties.","Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been predicted to serve as a platform for the next generation of quantum technology [1, 2]. The diversity of organic ligands compared to metal ligands allow for enhanced tunability of electronic and magnetic properties. These compounds may be key to harvest renewed insights into and exploitation of quantum phenomena such as the Quantum Hall Effect [3, 4, 5], topological insulators [6] and superconductivity [7]. The putatively first organic-inorganic hybrid 2D MOF, CrCl2(pyz)2 (pyz = pyrazine), was successfully synthesized in 2018 [8]. CrCl2(pyz)2 exhibits both long-range magnetic order and high 2D electronic conductivity. The compound has a Curie temperature of 55 K, and its magnetization at low temperatures saturates to 1.8 \mu_{B} in strong external fields. This indicates an intralayer ferrimagnetic coupling in agreement with predictions by density functional theory (DFT) [9, 10]. First principle calculations indicate that CrCl2(pyz)2, like other hybrid materials [11, 12, 13], can be exfoliated making it relevant for 2D applications [9]. The majority of 2D materials are non-magnetic in their pristine form [14]. A magnetic 2D material, like CrCl2(pyz)2, could have applications within spintronics [15], multiferroics [16, 17, 18] and magnetoelectronics [19]. This material could possibly even have applications within dark matter detection [20, 21, 22]. The sibling coordination solids VCl2(pyz)2 and TiCl2(pyz)2 display contrasting physical properties. In the former, divalent V ions facilitate an antiferromagnetically ordered ground state, while in the latter trivalent Ti ions favor paramagnetism and a correlated Fermi liquid state [23]. In principle, this opens the possibility for tuning through exotic phase transitions via doping. This may be compared to the magnetic phase transitions proposed for Mn2-xCr2Sb [24, 25] and Mn2Sb1-xBix [26]. Finally, the perovskite S2FeMoO6 may be highlighted as another material in which the coexistence of itinerant and localized electrons cause an ordered, in this case putatively ferromagnetic, ground state [27, 28]. A crucial step towards synthesizing materials with desired magnetic properties is to understand the mechanism yielding these properties. Here we provide a simple explanation of the ferrimagnetic coupling and explain why the magnetic moment of CrCl2(pyz)2 is approximately 2\mu_{B}. As such, we propose a minimal model for monolayer CrCl2(pyz)2 that captures the essential features of chromium couplings mediated by intermediate and itinerant pyrazine electrons. First, we compute a tight-binding model using a Slater–Koster procedure to obtain hopping parameters. From this we propose an effective model relevant for the valence electrons. The ground state configuration of the model is investigated before a magnetic field is introduced and the magnetic moment is computed. Using mean-field theory an estimate of the Cr-Cr coupling is found. Finally, the exchange interaction between electrons on neighboring chromium and pyrazine sites is calculated and an expression of the indirect exchange interaction coupling between neighboring chromium sites is obtained using second order perturbation of the RKKY interaction. From this we predict an estimate of the coupling between the localized Cr spins and the itinerant pyz electrons."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09569v1,Origin of the suppression of magnetic order in MnSi under hydrostatic pressure,"We experimentally study the evolution of the magnetic moment m and exchange interaction J as a function of hydrostatic pressure in the zero-field helimagnetic phase of the strongly correlated electron system MnSi. The suppression of magnetic order at \approx 1.5 GPa is shown to arise from the J collapse and not from a quantum fluctuations induced reduction of m. Our work provides benchmarks for first principles theories that are challenged by the presence of strong correlations and the possible role of Hund’s coupling. In addition, our experimental data are consistent with a reorientation of the magnetic propagation wavevector recently evidenced above \approx 1.2 GPa. This result calls for a thorough investigation of the crystal structure in this pressure range.","References Fulde [2012] P.

In this work, we investigate chiral spin liquids (CSL) on the kagome lattice arising from the competition between the third-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg interaction across hexagons (J_{d}) and a staggered scalar spin chirality term (J_{\chi}). Using variational Monte Carlo methods, we map out the phase diagram and identify various gapped and gapless CSL phases, each characterized by a distinct flux pattern. Notably, the interplay between J_{d} and J_{\chi} induces a tricritical point, which we analyze using Landau-Ginzburg theory. Additionally, we identify potential signatures of these CSLs—including distinctive spin-spin correlations, anomalies in the static spin structure factor, longitudinal thermal conductivity, and magnetoelectric effects—which offer practical guidance for their future experimental detection.","Acknowledgement We thank Yasir Iqbal for the valuable discussions.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09541v1,"Magnetization process of a quasi-two-dimensional quantum magnet:
Two-step symmetry restoration and dimensional reduction","We report on a comprehensive thermodynamic study of a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) quantum magnet Cu2(OH)3Br which in the 2D layer can be viewed as strongly coupled alternating antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic chains. In an applied magnetic field transverse to the ordered spins below T_{N}=9.3 K, a field-induced phase transition from the 3D ordered to a disordered phase occurs at B_{c}=16.3 T for the lowest temperature, which is featured by an onset of a one-half plateau-like magnetization. By performing quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the relevant 2D model, we find that the plateau-like magnetization corresponds to a partial symmetry restoration and the full polarization in the ferromagnetic chains. Our numerical simulations also show that the magnetization saturation occurs with full symmetry restoration at a much higher field of B_{s}\simeq 95 T, corresponding to a 1D quantum phase transition in the antiferromagnetic chains. We argue that the experimentally observed field-induced phase transition at B_{c} follows from the partial symmetry restoration and the concomitant dimensional reduction.","References Sachdev [2011] S.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09423v1,Phase diagram of the disordered Kitaev chain with long range pairing connected to external baths,"We study the inteplay between topology and disorder in the disodered Kitaev model with long range pairing, connected to two metallic leads exchanging particles with external Lindblad baths. We study how the phase diagram of the system is affected by the disorder by monitoring the subgap modes at increasing disorder, by computing the current flowing across the superconductor at a finite voltage bias between the baths, and by looking at the normal, single particle lead correlations across the Kitaev long range chain. In particular, we evidence the reentrant behavior of the massive, topological phase at limited values of the disorder strength, that has no analog in the disordered, short range pairing Kitaev model, thus rising the question of whether it is possible to recover a disorder triggered direct transition between the massive and the short range topological phase of the long range pairing Kitaev model.","In the last years, gapped topological many-particle systems have gained constantly increasing importance, both for what concerns fundamental physics, and regarding their practical applications. The main feature of a topologically non trivial (“topological”) phase is the emergence of boundary excitations in the system, which can only be removed by undergoing a (topological) phase transition and by closing, at the same time, the bulk gap [1, 2]. Due to their peculiar properties, edge states in one dimensional (1D) systems are among the most promising candidates to realize fault tolerant quantum computation protocols. In fact, by date several platforms have been proposed, to realize 1D topological system, such as quantum Hall states at filling 5/2 [3], helical states in electron liquids [4], or in photonic metamaterials [5], and so on [6]. An effective mean to evidence the onset of a topological phase is to compute a topological invariant, such as the Chern number, obtained by integrating the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone of the system with periodic boundary conditions [7]. Typically, the Chern number is quantized and, due to the “bulk-boundary correspondence” [8, 9], its value, computed in the translationally invariant system (with periodic boundary conditions) corresponds to the number of edge modes emerging at the boundaries of the system with open boundary conditions. While in 1D systems described by Hamiltonians with short range interactions and/or electron hopping the topological invariant is typically equal to 0 (in topologically trivial phases) or to \pm 1 (in the presence of edge modes in a topological phase), long range interactions and/or electron hopping allows for the onset of additional phases, with novel and intriguing properties, both for normal and for superconducting systems such as, for instance absolute values of the topological invariant higher than 1, or “unconventional” topological phases, in which an attempt to compute the topological invariant would yield fractional values [10, 11, 12, 13]. Indeed, a long-range hopping at fixed distance can, for example, stabilize a phase hosting multiple, independent, exponentially localized topological zero energy modes at the boundary of the system. Remarkably, this behavior, theoretically predicted for both the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger [14, 15, 16, 17], and the Kitaev model [18, 19, 20, 21], has also experimentally observed in optical lattices [22, 23]. Power law decaying interactions can, on the other hand, lift the degeneracy of the zero energy modes, giving rise to massive subgap topological states characterized by a finite energy, a power law spatial decay inside the bulk and a non integer value of the topological invariant. An example is given by the Kitaev chain with long-range tunneling and/or pairing hopping (LRK) [24, 25, 26] and by the helical Shiba chain [27, 28]. Understanding the peculiar properties of topological systems with long range interactions is not only fundamental from a theoretical point of view. Indeed, many experimental systems able to host topological phases of matter, such as Rydberg synthetic lattices [29, 30, 31], optical waveguides [32, 33], and trapped ions [34], exhibit power-law decaying interactions that cannot be neglected. For this reason, in the recent year, long range topological systems, and in particular the LRK, have been gained constantly increasing interest, from both the theoretical and the experimental point of view. These studies involve both static and dynamical properties in the presence of quenches [35, 36, 37, 38], or periodic drivings [39, 40], as well as the investigation of the entanglement entropy growth [41, 42]. In attempting to model realistic systems, it is important to account for unavoidable effects of disorder related to, for instance, the presence of impurities in the system, and/or lattice defects, and so on. In topological systems, the combined effects of disorder and topology further enriches the phase diagram by, for instance, making topological phases more stable, opening new phases as an effect of disorder, or triggering the disappearance of phases of the clean system at a strong enough disorder strength. [43, 44, 45]. Specifically, in non superconducting, 1D normal systems, any amount of disorder is known to fully localize the electronic wavefunctions, thus leading to a suppression of charge current transport for large enough systems [46, 47, 48]. In the specific context of topological systems, a limited amount of localization is known to stabilize the topological state, thus leading to reentrant topological phases (corresponding to an enforced protection of the edge states of the chain) [45, 49, 50, 51, 52], till disorder itself becomes strong enough to induce a phase transition to trivial phases. A reentrant topological phase is, by now, a well-estabilished feature of 1D disordered, topological superconductors, as well [43, 44, 45]. In the specific context of the LRK model, previous studies of the effects of disorder have been considered for the closed system with a discommensurate one-particle potential term [53] or a correlated commensurate one [54], and for the nonequilibrium dynamics following a parametric quench of the model Hamiltonian [55]. In this paper we study the phase diagram of an open LRK with Anderson disorder [24, 25, 56]. Specifically, we consider the LRK connected to 1D metallic leads, allowed to exchange particles with a Lindblad bath at a given chemical potential [57, 58]. Our approach, aside for providing a realistic description of the system (LRK + leads) when coupled to an external bath, allows for triggering the time evolution of the system toward a non equilibrium steady state (NESS); from the (measurable) physical properties of the system in the NESS we therefore map out the phase diagram of the disordered LRK. In this respect, introducing a direct coupling to the Lindblad bath has already proven to provide an effective tool to study the phase diagram of topological 1D systems [51, 52], as well as the onset of topological dynamical phase transitions in two dimensional superconducting systems [59, 60] and to detect the presence of non-trivial physical behaviors like the Mpemba effect [61, 62], the dynamical parity stabilization [63, 64] or the dissipative cooling [65]. Along our derivation, we provide a comprehensive discussion of how disorder affects all the phases of the LRK. In particular, we show how to fully characterize the phase diagram by first taking the system into the NESS, by coupling it to the Lindblad bath, and by then probing suitable quantities, in principle measurable in a real experiment. Doing so, while, for the phase corresponding to the topological phase in the short range pairing model [24], we recover full consistency with known results [43, 44], we also evidence the robustness of the nontrivial phase with a finite energy subgap mode (a typical feature of the LRK [66, 67, 68]) against Anderson disorder. This is possibly among the most important results of our work, given the peculiarities of such phase, in which it has been argued that the LRK may effectively work as an efficient “particle entangler”, by means of a mechanism dual to the crossed Andreev reflection across the Kitaev chain [56]. Specifically, we identify the various phases, in the presence of disorder, by looking at the lowest and at the next-to-lowest energy modes of the isolated chain and by monitoring the current {\cal I} across the LRK, as well as the single-particle lead correlations across the LRK, C_{LR}, when the baths are taken at a finite voltage bias, as a function of both the potential bias between the baths and the disorder strength. Our approach is mainly grounded on the different structure of the subgap modes in the various phases of the LRK in the absence of disorder. Indeed, as we review in the following, the model shows a trivial phase, with no energy modes below the bulk gap, a topological phase, equivalent to the one of the Kitaev model [69], with two degenerate, real fermionic modes pinned at zero energy (for a long enough chain), and a “topological massive phase”, with a finite-energy subgap mode, which can be regarded as being determined by an overlap between the real fermionic modes that keeps finite in the infinite chain limit [24, 25, 56]. Consistently with the above discussed scenario, our direct monitoring of the lowest and at the next-to-lowest energy modes of the LRK at increasing disorder strength evidences how the modes and, therefore, the corresponding phases evidenced by their structure, survive the disorder itself. Next, we characterize the NESS by using the interface current {\cal I}. This method is an extension to the open, disordered system, of the approach introduced in Ref.[56], where it was proposed to look at the DC current and at the current-current correlations, computed within Landauer-Büttiker approach. A charge current at a voltage bias below the bulk gap is strongly related to the presence/absence of subgap modes. It does ultimately depend on the bulk phase of the LRK itself. Along this line of thought, we show that a similar behavior takes place in the NESS and extends to the disordered case, as well, thus evidencing the effectiveness of the current to recovering the phase diagram of the system. Finally, we note that, in the absence of disorder, as a function of the voltage bias in the NESS, C_{LR} shows an activated behavior that signals the presence of subgap modes in the LRK, either at zero, or at a finite energy. After identifying the main features in C_{LR} typical of the various phases, we add disorder and monitor up to which value of the disorder strength a given feature survives (which is a signal that the corresponding phase is still surviving the disorder), setting the corresponding phase boundary at the point where the feature itself disappears. In this way, we are able to use our results for C_{LR} in the presence of disorder to map out the phase diagram of our system. Eventually, we verify the consistency of the results independently obtained with each other. Our paper is organized as follows: • In Section II we present the model Hamiltonian for LRK in the absence of disorder, together with a brief review of its phase diagram. Therefore, we add Anderson disorder on top of the LRK Hamiltonian. By looking at low-energy portion of the disordered LRK energy spectrum, we argue how, and to what extent, the disorder is expected to modify the phase diagram, with respect to the clean limit. • In Section III introduce the Lindblad master equation approach to the LRK coupled to two external leads exchanging particles with Lindblad baths at different potentials and recover the formulas for computing {\cal I} and C_{L,R} in the NESS. • In Section IV we study how the current in the NESS provides informations on the various phases, both in the clean limit, as well as in the presence of disorder. Moreover, we analyze the behavior of the (modulus of the) endpoint correlations between the metallic leads in the NESS in the various phases of the LRK, to pertinently complement the conclusions obtained from the charge current. • In Section V we summarize our main conclusions and present possible further developments of our work. • In the Appendix we provide mathematical details of the formalism of Lindblad Master Equation that we employ throughout our derivation."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09368v2,Entropy dynamics of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg chain,"In this article, we study the quench dynamics of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg spin chain. First, we develop a new algorithm, the ancilla TEBD method, which combines the purification technique and the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm to study the entanglement dynamics of binary bonded disordered spin chains. With the support of exact diagonalization (ED), we calculate the multifaractal dimension of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg spin model and study its dependence on the strength of the disorder potential; we find that the multifaractal dimension shows no critical behavior which rules out the existence of the many body localization transition. Then, we reproduce the long time scaling of the von Neumann entropy at the time scale that is beyond the reach of typical TEBD and time dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) algorithms. Based on the numerical analysis, we propose that such a long time scaling is due to the competition of the spin interaction and the disorder which can be seen as a new mechanism for the generating of long time scale entropy dynamics. At last, we numerically proved the existence of the transient Mpemba effect in the bond disordered Heisenberg chain.","The external disorder potential, especially for the onsite disorder, can localize, at least partially, the eigenstates of a closed quantum many body system. For the non-interacting many particle systems, all the eigenstates of low dimensional models (with space dimension d\leq 2) can be Anderson localized within a finite onsite disorder potential; while, for d>2, mobility edges splitting the localized and delocalized states in the spectrum emerge. Even with the existence of many body interactions, eigenstates of a many body system at the edge of the energy spectrum can still be putatively localized by a strong enough disorder potential; the localized states are called many body localized (MBL) states. A many body localized quantum state obeys entanglement area law and bears extensive numbers of local integral of motion (LIOM). Usually, the ground state of a quantum many body system with a finite gap to its first excitation state yields the entanglement area law; however, in a fully many body localised system, every eigenstate obeys the area law which gives rise to the long-time logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy and the subdiffusive relaxation of the particle number distribution or imbalance[1]. For a partially many body localised system, as in the Anderson localized model when d=3, there also exists mobility edges in the energy spectrum. The dynamical properties of such partially MBL systems rely on the characteristics of both of the localized and delocalized eigenstates; and the situation becomes more complex when non-abelian symmetry is imposed on the disordered system. It may be generally accepted that the continuous non-abelian symmetry is not compatible with the many body localization[2, 3, 4, 5]. Non-abelian symmetry, e.g. SU(2), usually results in extensive degeneracy in the energy level spectrum even at the present of a strong random-bond disorder; eigenstates with similar energy density can produce strong resonances that can drive the whole system to thermalization eventually. Even though the many body localized state can not survive in a non-abelian symmetric model, some of the excited eigenstates in such a system can be still subthermal, e.g. a quantum critical glass state (QCG)[6, 4]; the excited states feature the faster entanglement scaling law: S(L)\sim c\log(L)[4], comparing to the area law. Also, one can not rule out the existence of some kind of non-thermal and meanwhile non-MBL states; non-trivial entanglement dynamics may as well be introduced by such novel ergodicity breaking states and need to be confirmed by numerical calculations. The prototype disordered model with non-abelian symmetry is the bond disordered Heisenberg chain. Previously, the dynamical properties of the bond disordered XXZ spin model has been studied by utilizing many methods such as the generalized real space renormalization group for dynamical systems (RSRG-X)[4, 7], quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)[8], where the non-abelian symmetry is absent; all of these works predicate a logarithmic like entanglement entropy growth S(t)\sim\ln^{\alpha}(t), where \alpha is non-universal. It is challenging to explicitly fix the value of \alpha as well as its tight relations with the model’s space dimension and disorder strength. Then, for the SU(2) symmetric bond disordered Heisenberg chain, the dynamical properties has to be obtained numerically since the strong resonances between degenerated eigenstates render the RSRG predictions unavailable. The time dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) algorithm shows that S(t)\sim\ln(t) when t<10^{2}; however, ED results present another logarithmic scaling behavior[9] at a much longer time scale 10^{2}<t<10^{3} which is beyond the validity of tDMRG method due to the proliferation of Trotter error; and this special long time scaling has not been well explained yet. Also, this unusual long time scaling behaviors indicate that the relation between the real time dynamics and the non-ergodic eigenstates of the SU(2) disordered Heisenberg model need to be further explored as well. In this article, by combining the TEBD algorithm and purification scheme, we developed an efficient time evolving method in order to do the summation with respect to a large number of disorder samples for the real time dynamical properties of binary bond disordered Heisenberg model. Numerically, we generalize the light cone renormalization group (LCRG) algorithm and the purification method[10] which is initially designed to simulate the potential disorder; We combine the same purification method with the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm to study the bond disordered spin chain so that we can consider all the binary bond disorder samples in only one cycle of time evolution process. We will use this new method, which is dubbed as the ancilla TEBD, to study the quench dynamics of the von Neumann entropy S(t) of the bond disordered Heisenberg spin chain; and we find that this new algorithm works efficiently up to time scale t\sim 10^{2}. However, to use the ancilla TEBD method, we have to double the chain length which inevitably increases the computing cost. In order to have a check of the long time scaling of S(t) for a longer chain length L and speed up the calculation, we can focus on the dynamical properties in the subspace with non zero total spin moment S_{z}^{tot}=-L/2+2 where the interacting effects are encoded in the up-spin pair. Combining with the ED method, we give a through study of the entropy dynamics of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg model. We reproduced the long time scaling behavior of the von Neumann entropy S(t) and ascertain that the special scaling is associated to the distribution of the weak and strong disordered bonds in the potential; it is not related to the localization of eigenstates. Our conclusions are in line with previous tDMRG and ED results. Additionally, using the ancilla TEBD algorithm, we also calculate the entanglement asymmetry, \Delta S_{A}(t)[11] in the bond disordered Heisenberg model. It has been proposed that there exists strong memory effect[12] in the states of spin glass systems which is in tight relation with disordered spin models; and such memory effect can induce the famous Mpemba effect which tells one initial state that is farther from the equilibrate state will relax more faster than other states that is relatively nearer to the equilibrium. Interestingly, in the short time domain, we find that the relaxing rate of \Delta S_{A}(t) of the two initially asymmetric state is not monotonic and intersects during the time evolution which mimics the quantum Mpemba effect. To give a deep insight of the entropy dynamics of the bond disordered Heisenberg chain, we also investigate the mutifractality of its spectrum. Since the eigenstates of the bond disordered Heisenberg model are neither MBL nor purely ergodic, they might be classified as the nonergodic extended (NEE) states[13] whose q moments of the wavefunction amplitudes scales with the chain length L as \sum_{j=1}^{L}|\phi(j)|^{2q}\sim L^{-D_{q}(q-1)}[14], D_{q} is called the multifractal dimension; D_{q}=1 (=0) means the state is fully extended (localized). A multifractal eigenstate usually occupies a fractal part of the whole Hilbert space; therefore, it is non-ergodic but still extended. The existence of such multifractal states can moderately affected the system’s physical properties[15, 16, 14, 13], such as the ballistic spreading of the initially localized wave packet and the subdiffusive transportation[17]. For the bond disordered Heisenberg model, its multifractal dimension can be extracted from the scaling behavior of the paricipation entropy S_{q} (logarithm of the inverse participation ratio (IPR)) with the size of the Hilbert space: S_{q}\sim D_{q}\ln D_{H}[18]. We will show that D_{q} of the bond disordered Heisenberg model is very near to 1 and independent to the disorder strength; in contrast, D_{q} exhibit a step jump with respect to the disorder strength for the potential disordered model. Further, to get a dynamical view of the time evolved initial product wave function |\Phi(t=0)\rangle, we also compute the time dependent fidelity F(t)=|\langle\Phi(0)|\Phi(t)\rangle|^{2} and the instant IPR I_{IPR}(t) of |\Phi(t)\rangle. We find that F(t) exhibit robust oscillations in the time domain where the entanglement entropy shows logarithmic scaling; we may infer that the onset of logarithmic scaling is also related to the action of LIMOs. As for I_{IPR}(t) in the spin configuration space, it always converges to a non-universal finite number which indicates the extent of localization of the long time final state; Based on the ED results, we argue that the final state of the SU(2) symmetric disordered Heisenberg model at the long time limit is neither localized nor fully extended no matter how strong the disorder strength is. Our results proves that the long time scaling behavior of S(t) can also be achieved in a non-MBL spin chain. This article is organized as follows: In Sec.II, we define the model and introduce the ancilla TEBD algorithm. Then, we compare the ancilla TEBD and ED results to prove the correctness of our new algorithm. In Sec.III, we will calculate the multifractal dimension D_{q} of the bond disordered Heisenberg model and show the dependence of D_{q} on the disorder strength. Next, we study the unusual long time scaling of S(t) using ED and the ancilla TEBD method and try to address its physical origin numerically. In Sec.V, we report the decaying behavior of the entanglement asymmetry. Finally, in Sec.VI, we conclude the paper."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09337v1,Phase transitions in the presence of fluctuating charge-density wave in two-dimensional film of kagome metals,"We determine the nature of a phase transition in a model describing an interaction of multiple charge density waves in a two dimensional film. The model was introduced by two of the authors in Phys. Rev. B 108, 045119 (2023) to describe fluctuations in charge density wave order in the kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs) in two dimensions. The situation is nontrivial since the transition occurs in the region of phase diagram where the unbound vortices compete with the interaction between charge density waves. Here, we study the nature of the phase transition via Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations. The 3-component order parameter, the susceptibility, the energy per site, and the specific heat are measured for a range of temperatures for different lattice sizes L=8,16,24,32. The finite size scaling analysis indicates the presence of a second-order transition.","Two-dimensional (2D) correlated metals derived from transition metal ions represent a significant area of study within many-body physics Kennes et al. (2021); Dzero et al. (2016). These materials exhibit a rich range of intriguing electronic phenomena, including unconventional superconductivity Ortiz et al. (2019a, 2020, 2021a), charge and spin ordering Jiang et al. (2021); Li et al. (2021), nematicity Uykur et al. (2022); Ortiz et al. (2021b), and strange metallic behavior Tan et al. (2021); Denner et al. (2021a); Feng et al. (2021). While the majority of theoretical and experimental investigations have focused on structures with square lattices, such as cuprates Ortiz et al. (2020); Yu et al. and iron-based superconductors Ortiz et al. (2019a); Yang et al. (2020); Yu et al. (2021), there is comparatively less research on correlated metals with hexagonal and triangular symmetries. Recently, a new class of kagome metals has emerged, offering exciting opportunities for further exploration. The tight-binding electronic structure of the kagome metals Yin et al. (2022) feature a flat band, Dirac points and van-Hove singularities which naturally leads to the existence of various types of order which precise nature depends on the filling fractions of electrons in the band and the nature of electronic interactions. Excellent examples of such systems are recently discovered quasi-two dimensional kagome lattice metals AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs) Ortiz et al. (2019b). The electron filling in these metals is such that the chemical potential is very close to the van-Hove singularities. The different types of order are likely to originate from the electron-electron interactions at the nested Fermi surface.The observed phases include charge-density wave (CDW) order Jiang et al. (2021), superconductivity Ortiz et al. (2019c) and pair-density wave Chen et al. (2021); Li et al. (2023) among others. These experimental observations have inspired a search for something more exotic. As we have demonstrated in our previous work Tsvelik and Sarkar (2023), a competition between order parameter fluctuations and topological excitations in 2D films can lead to different composite orders. In this work we concentrate our attention on the charge density wave state. CDW order in kagome materials AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs) is quite complex since it has three CDWs interacting with each other (see Fig. 1) and it breaks time reversal Denner et al. (2021b); Mielke III et al. (2022) and six-fold rotational symmetries Li et al. (2022). Figure 1: (a) A schematic phase diagram of the model described by the free energy functional Eqn. (5), [adopted from Tsvelik and Sarkar (2023)]. For J=1, there is a crossover into a regime with composite order around T_{\rm composite}, where the sum of the charge-density wave (CDW) phases are frozen, i.e. (\phi_{1}+\phi_{2}+\phi_{3})=0. Then at a further low temperature T_{\rm CDW}, there is a phase transition into the state where individual CDWs order. For g_{3}>0, the low-temperature phase breaks time-reversal symmetry. (b) The hexagonal Brillouin zone (BZ) of the kagome lattice, with reciprocal lattice vectors \vec{b}_{1}=4\pi(0,1/\sqrt{3}) and \vec{b}_{2}=2\pi(1,-1/\sqrt{3}). The BZ also portrays the center ({\bf\Gamma}) at (0,0) and the high symmetry K points located at the vertices of the BZ and the points \bf{M}_{a} with a=1,2,3 at positions {\bf M}_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\vec{b_{2}}, {\bf M}_{2}=-\frac{1}{2}(\vec{b_{1}}+\vec{b_{2}}) and {\bf M}_{3}=\frac{1}{2}\vec{b_{1}} located at the hexagonal Brillouin zone face centers. Compounds such as AV3Sb5 with A = K, Rb, Cs exhibit saddle points at the \vec{M_{a}}, a=1,2,3, shown by green circles. The M_{a} points are connected by the three nesting vectors {\bf Q}_{a}, a=1,2,3 that also serve as the ordering wave-vectors of the CDW. (c) Depicted are all possible interactions g_{1}, g_{2}, g_{3} and g_{4} in the patch model (see Hamiltonian (3)). The cones represent the saddle-point dispersion at each {\bf M}_{a} while the arrows depict the scattering processes described by the interactions. In three dimensional materials, where the coupling between the layers is sufficiently strong Barman et al. (2024), the phase transition to the CDW state when all three wave components order is of the second order. In 2D films Kim et al. (2023); Song et al. (2021); Wang et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2022); Zheng et al. (2023) there are strong phase fluctuations Wang and Chubukov (2014); Sarkar et al. (2019) and there are also topologically nontrivial configurations, i.e. vortices which influence the ordering Sachdev (2018). In our previous work, Ref. Tsvelik and Sarkar (2023), we demonstrated that the competition among CDW order parameters, fluctuations, and topological vortices leads to the condensation of a global phase prior to the emergence of individual CDW orders. In that study, we derived a Ginzburg-Landau functional, showing that the nature of the phase transition is governed by the interplay of two primary operators: one arising from Umklapp scattering and the other from vortex configurations.This competition makes the problem especially interesting giving rise to a non-trivial situation, even in the case of a phase transition of these fluctuating CDW orders. In this work, we address the open question of the character of the phase transition by employing Monte Carlo simulations utilizing the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy functional derived in Ref. Tsvelik and Sarkar (2023). This functional describes the thermodynamic properties of the CDW state in 2D films of the kagome materials AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs), incorporating vortex contributions. We note that a similar model applies to interacting superconducting order parameters in three-band s-wave superconductors (see, for instance, Refs.Böker et al. (2017); Timoshuk and Babaev ). Figure 2: (a) Energy per site E as a function of temperature T for the model described in Eq. (III), with system parameters set to (G,g_{3})=(6.0,1.0) and (J,\Delta)=(1.0,1.0). The plots correspond to system sizes of L_{x}=L_{y}\equiv L=8,16,24,32. As the system undergoes a second-order phase transition at temperature T_{c}, the energy changes continuously, exhibiting no discontinuities. (b) The mean magnetization m^{1} versus temperature T illustrates the behavior of the order parameter as the system approaches the critical temperature T_{c}. The continuous nature of the order parameter indicates a second-order phase transition. Notably, the value of m^{1} above T_{c} is influenced by the lattice size L, with the continuum limit \lim_{T\to\infty}m^{i}\rightarrow 0 approached more closely as L increases. (c) The second order parameter m^{2} exhibits analogous behavior to m^{1}, while the third order parameter m^{3} (not shown) follows a similar trend. Together, these three order parameters underscore the continuous transition characteristics inherent in second-order phase transitions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09325v1,"Gapped Spin Excitation in Magnetic Ordered State 
on Yb-Based Zigzag Chain Compound YbAgSe","We report the 77Se-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results of trivalent Yb zigzag chain compound YbAgSe2, which is a sister compound of YbCuS2. The 77Se-NMR spectrum was reproduced by considering two different Se sites with negative Knight shifts and three-axis anisotropy. Above the Néel temperature T_{\rm N}, the Knight shift is proportional to the bulk magnetic susceptibility. Below T_{\rm N}, the extremely broad signal with weak intensity and the relatively sharp signal coexist, suggesting that one is strongly influenced by internal magnetic fields and the other remains relatively unaffected by these fields in the magnetic ordered state. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_{1} remains almost constant above T_{\rm{N}} and abruptly decreases below T_{\rm{N}}. In contrast to YbCuS2, a T-linear behavior of 1/T_{1} at low temperatures was not observed at least down to 1.0 K in YbAgSe2. Our results indicate that the gapless excitation is unique to YbCuS2, or is immediately suppressed in the magnetic fields.","In recent years, there has been significant attention and interest in novel charge-neutral quasiparticles observed in strongly correlated insulators. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] The gapless excitations of such quasipartices, which are seemingly inconsistent with the bulk charge-band gap observed in transport measurements, have been reported in some rare-earth based compounds; Yb-based frustrated insulating magnets YbMgGaO4 [1, 2, 3] and NaYbSe2 [4, 5], Kondo insulators YbB12 [6, 7, 8] and YbIr3Si7 [9, 10]. YbCuS2 is one of such rare-earth-based compounds, where the Yb3+ ions with magnetic moments form zigzag chains along the a axis [13]. Due to the competing interactions between nearest and next-nearest neighbors in the zigzag chains, magnetic frustration is expected in YbCuS2 [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. At zero magnetic field, the specific heat exhibits a sharp peak at T_{\rm{N}}\sim 0.95 K [21, 22]. In the previous study [12], we performed 63/65Cu-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements and revealed the first-order magnetic transition at T_{\rm{N}} and an incommensurate magnetic structure with much smaller Yb magnetic moments than the anticipated one from the crystalline electric field ground state. In addition, we found the gapless excitations in YbCuS2, suggesting the presence of the charge-neutral quasiparticles. Although the magnetic frustration arising from the Yb zigzag chains seems to play a crucial role in leading to this ordered state and the gapless excitations [12, 11], the origin and the characteristics of these phenomena still remain unclear. Recently, it has been theoretically proposed that the anisotropic exchange interactions originating from the Yb zigzag chains may lead to gapless excitations [18, 19, 20]. Therefore, the investigation on other Yb-based zigzag-chain compounds is highly desired. Yb-based compound YbAgSe2 has an orthorhombic structure with the space group P2_{1}2_{1}2_{1} (No. 19, D^{4}_{2}) and the Yb zigzag chains are formed as shown in Fig. 1(a) [23], similar to YbCuS2 [13]. There are two crystallographically different Se sites. The value of the effective magnetic moment estimated from the magnetic susceptibility above 40 K is 4.77 \mu_{\rm{B}}, which is close to that expected for the trivalent Yb3+ ions (4.54 \mu_{\rm{B}}) [24]. The Weiss temperature estimated from the simple Curie-Weiss fitting of the magnetic susceptibility below 300 K is -71.9 K, indicating the predominance of the antiferromagnetic interactions, similar to YbCuS2. Although the magnetic specific heat exhibits a lambda-type anomaly at the magnetic transition temperature T_{\rm{N}}\sim 1.8 K, the magnetic entropy at T_{\rm{N}} is only 30\% of R\ln 2 expected for the crystalline electric field ground-state doublet, indicating the presence of the magnetic fluctuations above T_{\rm{N}} [24]. As T_{\rm{N}} is much smaller than the Weiss temperature and a peculiar temperature-magnetic field phase diagram similar to that observed in YbCuS2 was obtained [25], magnetic frustration due to the Yb zigzag chains is expected. In this paper, we report the magnetic ordered state and low-energy magnetic excitations investigated from microscopic point of view with the 77Se-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Below T_{\rm N}, the NMR spectral intensity suddenly decreases, and the sharp and broad signals were observed. This indicates that the internal magnetic fields at the two crystallographically distinct sites below T_{\rm{N}} are different from each other. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_{1} stays almost constant above T_{\rm{N}} and suddenly decreases below T_{\rm{N}}, suggesting a gapped magnetic ordered state. T-linear behavior observed in YbCuS2 was not detected down to 1.0 K in YbAgSe2."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09300v1,Large anomalous Hall effect and -phase in hexagonal polar magnet GdNiSn,"While recent theoretical studies have positioned noncollinear polar magnets with C_{nv} symmetry as compelling candidates for realizing topological magnetic phases and substantial intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, experimental realizations of the same in strongly correlated systems remain rare. Here, we present a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect and extended topological magnetic ordering in Gd3Ni8Sn4 with hexagonal C_{6v} symmetry. Observation of topological Hall response, corroborated by metamagnetic anomalies in isothermal magnetization, peak/hump features in field-evolution of ac susceptibility and longitudinal resistivity, attests to the stabilization of skyrmion A-phase. The anomalous Hall effect is quantitatively accounted for by the intrinsic Berry curvature-mediated mechanism. Our results underscore polar magnets as a promising platform to investigate a plethora of emergent electrodynamic responses rooted in the interplay between magnetism and topology.","References Nagaosa and Tokura [2013] N.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09253v1,Emergent inductors in non-helical magnets,"The emergent inductor, which is a concept of inductor employing quantum mechanics on helical magnets, has been studied actively from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Interestingly, finite inductance has been observed not only in spiral magnetic phases but also across various other magnetic phases although the underlying mechanism behind emergent inductance in non-helical magnets remains unresolved. In this study, we broaden the concept of emergent inductance to encompass non-helical magnets and establish a comprehensive formalism of the emergent inductance generated by magnetization dynamics. Using a diagrammatic approach, we derive the linear response of current density mediated by magnetization dynamics and formulate impedance and inductance for general magnetic materials. We reveal that the emergent inductance is composed of two distinct components, each contributing positively or negatively. Notably, the positive inductance arises from Ohmic dissipation including the effect of the emergent electric field (Berry phase in real space) while the negative inductance arises from the polarization of itinerant electrons (Berry curvature in k-t space). We also apply the present method to quasi 1D models and show the numerical results of the inductance, the spin dynamics, the impedance, and the Q-value.","Inductors are fundamental electronic components that exhibits frequency-dependent impedance and are used in electrical circuits as transformers or noise filters and so on. However, the working principle of the prevailing inductor, which is constructed using a coil, follows classical electromagnetism, and thus the inductance of the coil is proportional to cross section of the coil. This relationship poses an obstacle to miniaturization in electrical circuits. In recent years, a novel concept of an inductor employing quantum mechanics on helical magnets has been proposed Nagaosa (2019). This concept, referred to as the emergent inductor, has been studied actively from both theoretical and experimental aspects Yokouchi et al. (2020); Kurebayashi and Nagaosa (2021); Kitaori et al. (2021, 2023, 2024). When a current flows in helical magnets, spin transfer torque Berger (1996); Slonczewski (1996) induces magnetization perpendicular to the co-plane of the helical spins (Fig. 1(b)), and the dynamics of this magnetization in turn drives the current by the spin motive force Stern (1992). The spin-motive force in helical magnet is interpreted as the emergent electric field originating from the dynamical Berry phase in real space, which is caused by the helical spin texture. This inductance, unlike traditional inductors, has been shown to be inversely proportional to the sample’s cross section, thereby overcoming the obstacle to miniaturization mentioned earlier. The emergent inductace in helical magnets is also derived by a more quantum mechanical approach using the Green’s function methods in Ref. Kurebayashi and Nagaosa (2021). They introduce the phenomenological Lagrangian in terms of the magnetization mode and the phason mode that are the collective coordinates of the helical spin texture Tatara and Kohno (2004) and evaluate the linear response mediated by these modes. They rederive the positive inductance originating from the magnetization modes as shown in Ref. Nagaosa (2019), and also find that the phason mode of helical magnets gives rise to the negative inductance in the presence of finite pinning potential. Figure 1: (a) Schematic picture of the emergent inductance in non-helical magnets. (b) Schematic picture of the emergent electric field which is described as the time variation of the Berry phase induced by the spin configuration. The Berry phase is given as a solid angle surrounded by the local spins. In helical magnets, the emergent electric field is associated with the dynamics of the magnetization perpendicular to the co-plane of the helical spins. The theories of the emergent inductance in helical magnets have spurred researchers to search for materials that exhibit this property, and a few measurements of the emergent inductance have already been reported Yokouchi et al. (2020); Kitaori et al. (2021, 2023, 2024). The first reported material was \mathrm{Gd}_{3}\mathrm{Ru}_{4}\mathrm{Al}_{12} Yokouchi et al. (2020), followed by \mathrm{YMn}_{6}\mathrm{Sn}_{6}, which exhibits emergent inductance at room temperature Kitaori et al. (2021). Furthermore, the inductances of the terbium-doped system \mathrm{Y}_{1-x}\mathrm{Tb}_{x}\mathrm{Mn}_{6}\mathrm{Sn}_{6} were measured for the purpose of investigating the doping dependence of the inductance Kitaori et al. (2023), and the frequency dependence of the emergent inductance was investigated in \mathrm{Tb}_{5}\mathrm{Sb}_{3} Kitaori et al. (2024). It is worth noting that the finite inductance has been observed not only in spiral phases but also in other phases Yokouchi et al. (2020); Kitaori et al. (2021, 2023, 2024). Thus, theoretical elucidation of the emergent inductance in non-helical magnets will expand the scope of material search. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the frequency range of emergent inductors is limited by the pinning potential of the magnets Nagaosa (2019); Kurebayashi and Nagaosa (2021). Therefore, emergent inductors that work at high frequencies are likely to be discovered in non-helical magnets whose pinning potential is larger than that of magnetic helices. In this context, there is a demand for the theory for emergent inductance in general magnetic structures which clarifies the origin of emergent inductance in non-helical magnets and provides a guiding principle for material search of more efficient inductors. In the present paper, we study the general formalism of the emergent induction arising from the dynamics of magnetization and analyze its physical meaning (Fig. 1(a)). We derive the linear response of the current density mediated by the dynamics of magnetization using a diagrammatic approach and formulate the impedance and inductance for general magnetic materials. We show that the inductance is composed of two components that contribute positively and negatively to the inductance, like a coil and a capacitor, respectively. We also show that the positive inductance arises from Ohmic dissipation including the effect of the emergent electric field (Berry phase in real space), while the negative inductance arises from the polarization of the itinerant electrons (Berry curvature in k-t space). Furthermore, we apply the present method to several quasi 1D models of non-helical magnets and numerically study behaviors of the inductance, the spin dynamics producing finite inductance, the impedance, and the Q-value. Finally, we discuss the candidate materials for emergent inductors. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present the formalism of the emergent inductance and the impedance arising from the dynamics of magnetization. In Sec. II.1, we introduce the model Hamiltonian of the itinerant electron coupled with localized spins and transform them to the rotated frame which allows us to clearly understand the physical picture of how the magnetization fluctuation couple with the spins of itinerant electrons. In Sec. II.2, using a diagrammatic technique, we derive the general expression of the linear response of the current density induced by the monochromatic AC electric field. In Sec. II.3, we derive the response functions of the itinerant electron system up to the first order in frequency \omega. In Sec. II.4, we discuss the physical meaning of these response functions. In Sec. II.5, we derive the Green’s function of the spin Hamiltonian and obtain the conductivity mediated by the dynamics of magnetization, with which we obtain the impedance and the inductance. In Sec. III, we present the application of the present method for quasi 1D models. We introduce the 1D models in Sec. III.1 and present the numerical results of the inductance (Sec. III.2), the spin dynamics (Sec. III.3), the impedance (Sec. III.4) and Q-value (Sec. III.5). In Sec. IV, we give a brief discussion of candidate materials and the comparison with previous studies."

Cavity Quantum Materials","The strong coupling regime of photons and quantum materials inside optical cavities has emerged as a promising environment for manipulating states of matter with light. Here, in turn, we show that photons bear witness to cavity quantum-electrodynamical modifications of the material, leading to profoundly non-classical properties of light passing through the cavity. By generalizing quantum-optical input-output relations to correlated quantum materials, we study the second-order photon coherence g^{(2)}(t) and demonstrate that antibunching of transmitted photons serves as direct evidence of light-induced changes to the cavity-embedded material. We show that materials near a quantum critical point can realize a collective many-body photon blockade, enabling the generation of single photons or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs via leveraging strong matter fluctuations. Our findings provide new routes for interrogating and harnessing cavity-embedded quantum materials as quantum light sources, as a resource for photon-based computation and quantum sensing.","The strong light-matter coupling regime of photons and correlated quantum materials has recently garnered much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In conventional quantum-optical settings, individual localized emitters become strongly coupled to photon modes inside optical cavities, generating polariton excitations with hybrid light and matter characteristics that are a rich resource for quantum information processing [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Recent studies have started to bridge the fields of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) and correlated electrons, by demonstrating strong coupling of photons to the collective modes of many-body systems in cavities [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], and exploring whether photon fluctuations can suffice to alter ground state properties of quantum materials [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. However, monitoring the quantum electrodynamical dressing of states of matter in cavities, and distinguishing these photon-induced changes from more mundane screening or interface effects due to the cavity remains a central challenge. At the same time, observable ramifications for the state of light remain largely unexplored, raising intriguing questions regarding whether correlated electron systems can be harnessed as sources of quantum photon states, with applications to quantum computing and metrology. The starting point for this work rests on the observation that, if strong light-matter coupling indeed alters the collective phase of a quantum material, then photons must necessarily be witnesses to these changes through their entanglement with the material [41, 46]. Hence, as photons are injected into the cavity and trigger changes in the material, these modifications should become visible to measurements of the statistics of ejected photons. On generic grounds, materials near a quantum critical point (QCP) are a particularly attractive target to test these ideas, as strong quantum fluctuations should make them susceptible to light-induced changes. Light emitted from cavities hosting strongly-correlated and photon-dressed quantum materials should consequently exhibit strongly non-classical properties. Here, we confirm these expectations, showing that the quantum statistics of light transmitted through cavities are direct evidence of quantum-electrodynamical changes to the state of matter in materials. Generalizing quantum optical input-output relations to strongly-correlated cavity quantum materials, we study the second-order photon coherence g^{(2)}(t) for weakly-driven cavities hosting Mott insulators in the strong light-matter coupling regime. We find that transmitted photons exhibit pronounced (anti)bunching, which becomes drastically amplified near an Ising QCP, and establish measurements of g^{(2)} as a probe of the ensuing photon-induced changes to the state of matter. We then show that quantum materials near criticality can in turn become collective single-photon sources, harnessing strong quantum fluctuations in the material to convert a laser drive into single photons. Finally, we demonstrate that chiral Mott insulators embedded in optical cavities can become efficient sources of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs of entangled photons, as a resource for photon-based computation and sensing [47]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09664v1,Enhanced Kohn-Luttinger topological superconductivity in bands with nontrivial geometry,"We study the effect of the electron wavefunction on Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity. The role of the wavefunction is encoded in a complex form factor describing the topology and geometry of the bands. We show that the electron wavefunction significantly impacts the superconducting transition temperature and superconducting order parameter. We illustrate this using the lowest Landau level form factor and find exponential enhancement of T_{c} for the resulting topological superconductor. We find that the ideal band geometry, which favors a fractional Chern insulator in the flat band limit, has an optimal T_{c}. Finally, we apply this understanding to a model relevant to rhombohedral graphene multilayers and unravel the importance of the band geometry for achieving robust superconductivity.","References Peotta and Törmä [2015] S.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08880v1,Fractional Chern mosaic in supermoiré graphene,"We propose the realization of a fractional Chern mosaic: a state characterized by a spatially varying topological order. This state is enabled by a separation of length scales that emerges when three graphene sheets are sequentially rotated by a small twist angle. The resulting structure features not only conventional moiré lattices, but also a much larger supermoiré lattice. We demonstrate that a fractional Chern mosaic arises when electron correlations induce fractionalization locally on the moiré scale, while the pattern of fractionalization varies at the supermoiré scale.","The importance of length scales in physics is exemplified in the rise of two-dimensional moiré materials. Twist engineered moiré lattices on the nanometer scale provide an ideal platform for experimentally realizing a remarkable variety of quantum phenomena [1, 2, 3, 4], from superconductivity [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] to fractional Chern insulators [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. This rich physics is enabled by a separation of length scales between the atomic and moiré lattices. At experimentally relevant scales, the physics is governed by that of the moiré lattice, which behaves as a new artificial crystal. The interplay of length scales is at the forefront in an emerging class of moiré materials with multiple incommensurate moiré lattices. Prominent examples are various multilayer graphene-hBN heterostructures [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] and twisted trilayer graphene at small, generic, twist angles [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53]. The presence of two incommensurate moiré lattices introduces an additional large supermoiré (or “moiré-of-moiré”) length scale, which can be parametrically larger than the moiré lattices. This new supermoiré scale leads to another separation of length and energy scales, opening the door to especially intriguing correlated electronic states. One especially striking example is the Chern mosaic [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. In this state, electrons form Chern insulators at the moiré scale, but the Chern number varies across the supermoiré scale. The result is a mosaic of Chern insulators embedded in a network of topological domain walls. Here, we consider an even more exotic possibility: a “fractional Chern mosaic”, where electrons spontaneously fractionalize within local regions of fractional Chern insulators (FCI) [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], but with the pattern of fractionalization varying at the supermoiré scale. Such a fractional Chern mosaic would represent a novel class of quantum states characterized by a spatially varying topological order. We propose the realization of a fractional Chern mosaic. Specifically, we focus on helical trilayer graphene (HTG), a prototypical supermoiré material consisting of three graphene sheets sequentially rotated by a small twist angle \theta, i.e. in the configuration (\theta_{1},\theta_{2},\theta_{3})=(\theta,0,-\theta). In HTG, adjacent layer pairs produce moiré lattices with periods a_{m}\approx a_{0}/\theta, which combine to form a large supermoiré lattice with period a_{sm}\approx a_{0}/\theta^{2}, where a_{0}=0.246nm is the graphene lattice constant. This supermoiré lattice, on the scale of a few hundred nanometers, was recently imaged with a scanning single-electron transistor (SET) [67]. Lattice relaxation creates large triangular moiré-periodic domains, referred to as h-HTG and \overline{\mathrm{h}}-HTG, as illustrated in Fig. 1 [36, 37]. Due to the separation of lengthscales a_{sm}\gg a_{m}, it suffices to model the system as locally periodic within each domain. Within these periodic domains, the local moiré band structure gives rise to topological flat bands with valley-contrasting Chern number and opposing topology in adjacent domains [36, 37, 38]. Flat band ferromagnetism then leads to spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking, as observed near a magic angle \theta\approx 1.8^{\circ} [51]. The combined presence of broken time-reversal symmetry, flat Chern bands, and supermoiré periodicity sets the stage for the fractional Chern mosaic. The task is to establish whether electrons within each domain can fractionalize. To achieve this, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the correlated physics at partial filling of the flat Chern bands. We begin by characterizing an additional momentum-dependent tunneling (MDT) term in the Hamiltonian, which originates from the decay of the interlayer tunneling amplitude as a function of the in-plane distance between the atomic p_{z} orbitals [68]. We find that accounting for MDT not only explains the particle-hole asymmetry observed in transport [51] but, crucially, stabilizes an FCI at filling factor \nu=3+1/3. The predicted state, illustrated in Fig. 1a, features electron fractionalization into charge e/3 quasiparticles in a spatially varying way due to the opposing band topology in the h-HTG and \overline{\mathrm{h}}-HTG domains, and can be experimentally unveiled by local scanning probes. Figure 1: a) Helical trilayer (HTG) relaxes on the supermoiré scale a_{sm} into h-HTG and \bar{\text{h}}-HTG domains that are locally moiré-periodic, and separated by gapless domain walls (grey). Fractionalization within the domains generates a fractional Chern mosaic. b) Band structure in valley K of the h-HTG domain in the absence of momentum-dependent tunneling (MDT). The central two bands are colored according to Chern-sublattice polarization \tilde{\sigma}_{z}(\bm{k}), where red (blue) indicates polarization onto the A (B) sublattice. Right line trace plots the density of states. c) Same as b) except in the presence of MDT. Non-interacting model—Our starting point is a generalized Bistritzer-MacDonald [69] continuum model description of the local band structure within each h-HTG (or \bar{\text{h}}-HTG) domain [36]. The K valley of h-HTG is described by H_{K}=\begin{bmatrix}-iv\bm{\sigma}\cdot\nabla&T(\bm{r}-\bm{d}_{t})&0\\ T^{\dagger}(\bm{r}-\bm{d}_{t})&-iv\bm{\sigma}\cdot\nabla&T(\bm{r}-\bm{d}_{b})% \\ 0&T^{\dagger}(\bm{r}-\bm{d}_{b})&-iv\bm{\sigma}\cdot\nabla\end{bmatrix} (1) where \bm{\sigma}=(\sigma_{x},\sigma_{y}) acts on the microscopic sublattice, and v=8.8\times 10^{5}\,\text{ms}^{-1}. In the absence of MDT, the interlayer tunneling is \begin{gathered}T(\bm{r})=\begin{bmatrix}w_{AA}t_{0}(\bm{r})&w_{AB}t_{-1}(\bm{% r})\\ w_{AB}t_{1}(\bm{r})&w_{AA}t_{0}(\bm{r})\end{bmatrix}\\ t_{\alpha}(\bm{r})=\sum_{n=0}^{2}e^{\frac{2\pi i}{3}n\alpha}e^{i\bm{q}_{n}% \cdot\bm{r}}\\ q_{n,x}+iq_{n,y}=-ik_{\theta}e^{\frac{2\pi i}{3}n},\end{gathered} (2) where k_{\theta}=2K_{D}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}, with K_{D}=\frac{4\pi}{3a_{0}} the Dirac wavevector, and we fix (w_{AA},w_{AB})=(75\,\text{meV},110\,\text{meV}). Within the h-HTG domain, the relative interlayer moiré shift is \bm{d}_{t}-\bm{d}_{b}=\frac{1}{3}(\bm{a}_{2}-\bm{a}_{1}), where \bm{a}_{1,2}=\frac{4\pi}{3k_{\theta}}(\pm\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\frac{1}{2}) are the basis moiré vectors. We focus only on the physics within an h-HTG domain, as the \bar{\text{h}}-HTG domains are related by \hat{C}_{2z} symmetry. Eq. 1 and 2 obey an exact particle-hole-inversion symmetry111This is only weakly broken when introducing the small twists in the Pauli terms. (PHS) that is strongly broken in experiment [51], where correlated states appear only for electron doping. This symmetry is broken by considering the finite range of interlayer hopping, which generates MDT. This is incorporated to leading order by making the replacement t_{\alpha}(\bm{r})\rightarrow\sum_{n=0}^{2}e^{\frac{2\pi i}{3}n\alpha}e^{i\bm{% q}_{n}\cdot\bm{r}}(1+\lambda_{\mathrm{MDT}}\hat{\bm{q}}_{n,\perp}\cdot\vec{% \nabla}), (3) where \hat{\bm{q}}_{n,\perp}=\left[\cos(\frac{2\pi}{3}n),\sin(\frac{2\pi}{3}n)\right] is a unit vector perpendicular to \bm{q}_{n}. We take a realistic \lambda_{\text{MDT}}\approx-2.3\,Å, as derived in App. A. Fig. 1b,c shows the non-interacting band structure of \theta=1.8^{\circ} h-HTG within a single spin-valley sector. Regardless of MDT, we obtain a pair of narrow bands separated by large gaps \gtrsim 80\,meV to higher remote bands that are not shown. The non-trivial topology is unveiled by diagonalizing the sublattice operator \sigma_{z} projected to the central bands [70, 71, 72]. This yields the so-called Chern basis indexed by a ‘Chern-sublattice’ label \tilde{\sigma}=A,B according to the dominant sublattice polarization222\tilde{\sigma} refers to the Chern basis, while \sigma indexes the microscopic sublattice. They become equivalent in the chiral limit. We will often use the terms Chern and sublattice interchangably.. Within valley K, these bands have Chern numbers C_{K,A}=1,\quad C_{K,B}=-2, (4) and the corresponding values for valley \bar{K} and the \bar{\text{h}}-HTG domain can be obtained by time-reversal and \hat{C}_{2z}. The blue and red colors indicate the expectation value of \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle\equiv\langle P_{A}\rangle-\langle P_{B}\rangle, where P_{\tilde{\sigma}} is the projector onto the \tilde{\sigma} band. In the absence of MDT (Fig. 1b), the central bands obey PHS as reflected in the density of states. Band eigenstates with predominantly B character (\langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle\approx-1) are more dispersive than those with A character, but both have the same energy when averaged over the mBZ. To make this concrete, we can rotate to the Chern basis and switch off the off-diagonal hybridization to define the dispersions E_{\tilde{\sigma}_{z}}(\bm{k}) (see App. B). At \theta=1.8^{\circ}, we find that E_{A}(\bm{k}) and E_{B}(\bm{k}) have zero average, but bandwidths 7.2\,meV and 30.4\,meV respectively. In contrast, introduction of MDT (Fig. 1c) lowers the energy of the B basis relative to the A basis. At \theta=1.8^{\circ}, E_{A}(\bm{k}) has a mean energy of 1.0\,meV and is bounded by -2.9\,meV and 4.2\,meV, while E_{B}(\bm{k}) has a mean energy of -6.4\,meV and is bounded by -22.4\,meV and 9.4\,meV. This strongly breaks the PHS, as evidenced by the substantial asymmetry of the density of states. These details will become important soon when considering correlated states. Interactions—We consider gate-screened Coulomb interactions V(q)=\frac{e^{2}}{2\epsilon_{0}\epsilon_{r}q}\tanh qd_{\text{sc}}, where the gate distance is d_{\text{sc}}=25\,\text{nm} and the relative permittivity \epsilon_{r}\simeq 8-15 is left as a tuning parameter. The large single-particle remote gaps permit projection onto the two central bands per spin and valley H_{\text{int}}=\frac{1}{2A}\sum_{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}V({{\boldsymbol{q}}})% \delta\hat{\rho}_{{\boldsymbol{q}}}\delta\hat{\rho}_{-{{\boldsymbol{q}}}} (5) where A is the system area, and \delta\hat{\rho}_{{\boldsymbol{q}}}=\hat{\rho}_{{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}-4\overline% {\rho}_{{\boldsymbol{q}}} is the projected density operator measured relative to the mean density \overline{\rho}_{{\boldsymbol{q}}} of the central bands (this is the so-called ‘average’ interaction scheme) [52]. H_{\text{int}} satisfies a U(2)_{K}\times U(2)_{\bar{K}} flavor symmetry, which includes charge-U(1)_{c} and valley-U(1)_{v} conservation, and valley-dependent SU(2)_{s} spin-rotations. Figure 2: a) HF phase diagram as a function of twist angle \theta and relative permittivity \epsilon_{r} at \nu=+3 (top) and \nu=-3 (bottom). White shaded regions indicate gapless states. \Lambda, defined in the main text, is a measure of how far the HF solution is from an idealized strong-coupling state. TSB indicates various states that break moiré translation symmetry. System size is 12\times 12, and we allow for spontaneous doubling or tripling of the moiré unit cell along both directions. b) HF band structure of the \nu=+3 Chern insulator. The bands are colored according to their Chern-sublattice polarization. Dots (crosses) denote spin up (down). System size is 24\times 24. c) Schematic of Chern-sublattice transitions induced by the sublattice asymmetry in the effective dispersion. d) HF calculations of Chern-sublattice polarization \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle for fillings 3\leq\nu\leq 4. \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle is defined as the difference of the occupation numbers of the A and B Chern-sublattice bands per moiré unit cell. We enforce moiré translation symmetry and valley U_{v}(1) symmetry. Calculations are performed with MDT unless otherwise indicated. System size is 18\times 18. Hartree-Fock phase diagram— We first consider the physics at integer fillings within Hartree-Fock (HF) theory. In the absence of MDT, Ref. [52] identified a hierarchy of so-called “strong-coupling” insulators at integer fillings \nu. These phases can be understood by fully polarizing into \nu+4 of the eight total Chern bands indexed by spin s\in\{\uparrow,\downarrow\}, valley \tau\in\{K,K^{\prime}\}, and Chern-sublattice \tilde{\sigma}_{z}\in\{A,B\}, with the associated Chern number following from Eq. 4. The phase diagram in Ref. [52] was identical under \nu\leftrightarrow-\nu due to PHS. In contrast, MDT leads to qualitatively different behaviors at negative and positive integer fillings in our HF calculations (Fig. 2a). We diagnose the strong-coupling nature by the deviation from full (\tau,s,\tilde{\sigma})-polarization \Lambda\equiv\text{max}_{\tau,s,\tilde{\sigma}}\Big{[}\text{min}\big{(}\langle n% _{\tau,s,\tilde{\sigma}}\rangle,1-\langle n_{\tau,s,\tilde{\sigma}}\rangle\big% {)}\Big{]}, (6) where \langle n_{\tau,s,\tilde{\sigma}}\rangle is the mBZ-averaged occupation number for the Chern band \tilde{\sigma} in valley \tau and spin s. \Lambda vanishes for an idealized strong-coupling insulator, while it can take values as large as 0.5 for generic states. For \nu=+3, we find a strong-coupling |C|=1 insulator for a range of \theta, including for very weak interactions \epsilon_{r}\gtrsim 25. On the other hand for \nu=-3, the strong-coupling phase only exists for for relatively strong interactions \epsilon_{r}\lesssim 9. Lowering the interaction strength leads to gapless states, or various gapped phases with intervalley coherence and translation symmetry-breaking [52, 73]. Analogous results hold for other integer fillings (Fig. S4), demonstrating that MDT can explain the pronounced particle-hole asymmetry observed in transport [51]. Fig. 2b shows the HF band structure of the |C|=1 insulator at \nu=+3. The state is fully spin-valley polarized within the flat-band manifold, and the strong-coupling nature is evidenced by the near total \tilde{\sigma}_{z} polarization of the conduction band. In the partially-filled flavor, the system occupies the B band (blue) with lower mean kinetic energy, leaving a narrow unfilled A band (red) with |C|=1. Sublattice transitions—At \nu=3, the unfilled conduction band is a narrow |C|=1 band of predominantly \tilde{\sigma}=A character, with favorable quantum geometry (Fig. S5) for hosting FCIs when fractionally occupied. For this to occur, it is crucial that the notion of an isolated conduction A band remains valid at higher fractional fillings like \nu=3+\frac{1}{3}. To this end, we discover a cascade of sublattice transitions (Fig. 2c,d), whose mechanism relies on two key ingredients: (i) sublattice ferromagnetism induced by the dominant Coulomb interactions, and (ii) the lower average but higher peak kinetic energy of the B band compared to the A band. In the following, we discuss the cascade for the filling range 3\leq\nu\leq 4 assuming full flavor polarization (i.e. flat bands in three of four spin-valley flavors are fully filled). Exactly at \nu=3, occupying either Chern band of the remaining flavor yields a valid exchange-driven strong-coupling insulator, but the system chooses to form the |C|=1 insulator and fill the B band due to its lower average kinetic energy, yielding a \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle\approx-1 state. As electrons are doped into the system, they naturally populate the empty A band (Fig. 2c, top), which gradually degrades the initial negative sublattice polarization -1<\langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle<0. Eventually we reach a critical filling \nu_{c} where the system energetically prefers to instead fully occupy the A band and partially occupy the B band so that \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle>0 (Fig. 2c, bottom). The reason is that doing so allows the system to empty the parts of the B band that are kinetically costly, while respecting the tendency towards sublattice polarization. \nu_{c} is determined by the interplay between the relative energy gain from fully polarizing the B band over the A band, and the kinetic cost of occupying the high energy parts of the B band. The outcome is an abrupt sign change of the sublattice polarization at \nu_{c}. Fig. 2d tracks the self-consistent HF sublattice polarization. For all parameters, \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle starts off near -1 and increases linearly with a gradient close to 1 as the empty A band is progressively occupied. With MDT, we find a strongly first-order sublattice jump at which \langle\tilde{\sigma}_{z}\rangle changes sign. Crucially, the transition filling \nu_{c}\approx 3.5 is greater than 3+\frac{1}{3} for realistic parameters. The enhanced dispersion of the B band means that the Fermi surfaces for \nu>\nu_{c} are often flavor-degenerate, but the phase for \nu<\nu_{c} is always fully flavor polarized. These findings are consistent with the experimental observation of AHE persisting to \nu\approx 3.5 [51]. \nu_{c} is lowered when increasing \epsilon_{r}. If MDT is neglected (dotted lines), the sublattice transition occurs almost immediately upon electron doping \nu=+3. The reason is that without MDT, the average kinetic energies of the A and B bands are identical (Fig. 2a), and only the sublattice exchange anisotropy of \lesssim 0.5\,meV favors occupying the B band at \nu=+3 [52]. This tiny splitting is easily swamped at small \nu_{c} by the kinetically-driven mechanism explained above, underscoring the importance of MDT in faithfully capturing the sublattice physics. Similar sublattice transitions occur between every non-negative integer filling, but none occur for \nu<0, where there is significantly less symmetry-breaking (Fig. S7). Figure 3: a) 1-band ED calculation on the 5\times 6 cluster at \nu=3+1/3. Bottom row shows the momentum-resolved many-body spectrum for \epsilon_{r}=8 and 15. Top row shows the corresponding evolutions of the three quasi-degenerate ground states under flux threading \Phi. b) 2-band ED calculation of the Chern-sublattice polarization as a function of filling. Different symbols (see legend) refer to various lattice geometries with corresponding system sizes N=12,15,16. N_{\tilde{\sigma}} is the expectation value of the particle occupation in the Chern-sublattice basis. Red (blue) corresponds to the A (B) basis. The vertical line indicates \nu=3+1/3. All calculations are performed at \theta=1.8^{\circ} and with MDT. Exact diagonalization—We use exact diagonalization (ED) to investigate whether FCIs can be stabilized at fractional fillings. Since full calculations in the eight central bands are expensive, it is necessary to truncate the ‘active’ part of the many-body Hilbert space. In Fig. 3a, we first present 1-band ED results at \nu=3+\frac{1}{3}, where the active subspace is restricted to the |C|=1 conduction band of the \nu=+3 HF insulator. In other words, we constrain the other seven HF bands to be fully occupied333We therefore include the Hartree and Fock potentials from these non-active bands., and work at 1/3 filling of the remaining Chern band which is spin-valley polarized and of predominantly \tilde{\sigma}=A character (see Fig. 2b). We obtain an FCI for \epsilon_{r}=8,15 on a system with N=30 unit cells, as evident from the three-fold quasi-degenerate ground states with correct momenta that remain gapped under flux threading. In App. D, we show N=27 results that rule out charge density waves. Next, we perform ED calculations where we only constrain that three flavors are fully occupied, leading to the restriction 2\leq\nu\leq 4. We emphasize that this effective 2-band calculation is exact within the maximally spin-valley-polarized symmetry sector of the eight central bands. From the HF results, we anticipate that the ground state indeed lies in this flavor sector from \nu=+3 up to at least the sublattice transition at \nu_{c} (see App. C.4). Importantly, this 2-band calculation faithfully captures the interplay between the \tilde{\sigma}=A,B bands. Fig. 3b plots the Chern-sublattice densities \langle n_{A}\rangle and \langle n_{B}\rangle in the 2-band calculation as a function of \nu. Owing to the increased computational difficulty, we collate results for several system sizes. Consistent with the HF analysis, the \nu=+3 ground state is strongly polarized into the B band and is essentially a gapped single Slater determinant (see App. D). Upon electron-doping for \epsilon_{r}=8, the B band maintains a large occupancy >90\% such that the additional carriers primarily populate the A band. Crucially, this picture still holds at \nu=3+\frac{1}{3} across multiple lattice geometries, lending credence to the 1-band ED. The theory of sublattice transitions is corroborated by the abrupt jump at \nu_{c}\approx 3.5. For \epsilon_{r}=15, the B band depopulates more appreciably for certain system sizes when adding electrons to the \nu=+3 insulator, though we still find kinks in the sublattice occupations around \nu_{c}\approx 3.5. We note that direct signatures of FCIs in our multi-band calculations are present but not fully robust (see App. D.4), likely due to finite-size effects since the largest size444The Hilbert space dimension per momentum at N=18,21 is approximately 7\times 10^{7} and 3\times 10^{9} respectively. for which we have 2-band data at \nu=3+\frac{1}{3} is smaller than the threshold N beyond which 1-band ED robustly yields FCIs. Fractional Chern mosaics — Having found evidence for FCIs within the h-HTG domains, we now zoom out and re-examine the structure of HTG at \nu=3+1/3 as a whole. In the h-HTG domain, electrons within the A band of a particular spin-valley (\tau,s) flavor fractionalizes. The resulting state has a local Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy}=-\frac{2}{3}\tau_{z}\frac{e^{2}}{h} where \tau_{z}=1 (for K) or -1 (for K^{\prime}). The fractional Hall conductivity can be decomposed as -\frac{2}{3}=-1+\frac{1}{3}, where -1 arises from the Chern insulator at \nu=3, and 1/3 from the FCI. Since the local physics in the \bar{\text{h}}-HTG domain is related by \hat{C}_{2z}, the corresponding FCI there will arise from a partially filled B band with local \sigma_{xy}=\frac{2}{3}\tau_{z}\frac{e^{2}}{h}. Since the spin-valley polarization is determined spontaneously, there are multiple qualitatively distinct fractional Chern mosaics that may occur. Which of these scenarios is favored will likely depend on fine details of the domain wall energetics [58, 52]. Consider the case where the valley polarizations in the h-HTG and \bar{\text{h}}-HTG domains are identical. In this case, a mosaic of local \sigma_{xy}=\pm\frac{2}{3}\frac{e^{2}}{h} domains is formed. The domain walls necessarily host fractionally charged topological chiral edge modes. In both types of domains, electrons fractionalize into charge e/3 quasiparticles as is known for the 1/3 Laughlin state. However, the anyonic exchange phase e^{\pm i\frac{\pi}{3}} will be opposite for quasiparticles in the two types of domains. The result is a novel state in which fractionally charged quasiparticles exhibit spatially varying anyonic statistics. Another possibility is that the valley polarizations will be opposite in the two domains. This configuration will be favored by a small external magnetic field. For concreteness, suppose that the FCI arises in the K valley for h-HTG, and in the K^{\prime} valley for \bar{\text{h}}-HTG. In this case, while both domains have local \sigma_{xy}=-\frac{2}{3}\frac{e^{2}}{h}, we consider this state a fractional Chern mosaic since the fractionally charged e/3 quasiparticles carry opposite valley quantum numbers in the two domains. Discussion—Our results have important implications for recent and future experiments. The transport study of Ref. [51] observed correlated features only for positive fillings in multiple magic-angle (\theta\approx 1.7^{\circ}-1.8^{\circ}) HTG devices, consistent with our HF calculations in the presence of MDT. The anomalous Hall effect and density-tuned hysteresis observed near 3\lesssim\nu\lesssim 3.5 are consistent with the sublattice transition identified here via the kinetic mechanism at \nu_{c}\approx 3.5. Combined with the recent observation of supermoiré domains in (non magic-angle) HTG by Ref. [67], our analysis implies that a fractional Chern mosaic can be realized at \nu=3+1/3, but is not likely visible in transport [51] due to the network of conducting domain walls and sample inhomogeneity. Local probes are ideal for resolving the real-space mosaic and detecting the local topological state. Scanning single-electron transistors (SET) [74, 75, 76, 67] can identify the state as an incompressible feature that disperses with perpendicular magnetic field B according to the Streda formula. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) [77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84] would further be able to directly image the cascade of sublattice transitions predicted in this work. We also note that the global \hat{C}_{2z} symmetry of pristine HTG implies that identical physics would be present in the h-HTG and \bar{\text{h}}-HTG domains, but alignment to the hBN substrate could introduce a sublattice splitting that favors fractionalization in only one type of domain. Finally, while we have mainly focused on \nu=3+\frac{1}{3}, FCIs may exist at other fillings, especially those which are compatible with the picture above. The simplest candidates are Jain states at \nu=3+\frac{k}{2k+1} for which \nu<\nu_{c}. The periodic resets in flavor and sublattice physics suggest that fractionalization could also occur around other integer fillings, a possibility which we leave for future theoretical studies. In summary, we have predicted the realization of a fractional Chern mosaic enabled by a combination of local topological flat bands and supermoiré periodicity. Our results present an opportunity to engineer and explore novel intricate quantum states with spatially varying topological order. Acknowledgements.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08825v1,Dielectric losses in metals,"Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) in the self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) basis is often used for describing complex many-body effects in material science applications. Its exact solution on the real-frequency axis at finite temperature for polarization using the diagrammatic Monte Carlo method [Phys. Rev. B 109, 045152, (2024)] captures effects of multiple Coulomb scattering of a single particle-hole excitation, but does not account for multiple pair excitations important for studying dielectric loses in metals at frequencies comparable to the plasmon mode. In this paper we report technical developments which allow one to efficiently compute the dielectric response in a wide frequency range from zero to a few Fermi energies without systematic bias at finite T. By applying it to the homogeneous electron gas we demonstrate how at small momenta the gap in the spectral density between the electron-hole and plasmon excitations, existing within the HF-BSE approach, is filled with two particle-hole excitations and is completely washed out already at temperature T\sim\varepsilon_{F}/10.","References [1] D.M.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08816v1,UOTe: Kondo-interacting topological antiferromagnet in a van der Waals lattice,"Since the initial discovery of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials, significant effort has been made to incorporate the three properties of magnetism, band structure topology, and strong electron correlations — to leverage emergent quantum phenomena and expand their potential applications. However, the discovery of a single vdW material that intrinsically hosts all three ingredients has remained an outstanding challenge. Here we report the discovery of a Kondo-interacting topological antiferromagnet in the vdW 5f electron system UOTe. It has a high antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature of 150 K, with a unique AFM configuration that breaks the combined parity and time reversal (PT) symmetry in an even number of layers while maintaining zero net magnetic moment. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal Dirac bands near the Fermi level, which combined with our theoretical calculations demonstrate UOTe as an AFM Dirac semimetal. Within the AFM order, we observed the presence of the Kondo interaction, as evidenced by the emergence of a 5f flat band near the Fermi level below 100 K and hybridization between the Kondo band and the Dirac band. Our density functional theory calculations in its bilayer form predict UOTe as a rare example of a fully-compensated AFM Chern insulator.","The current study of the topological properties of vdW materials is mainly based on a non-interacting, single-ion picture. The introduction of magnetism and strong electron correlations is expected to produce novel topological properties and other exotic phases by breaking symmetries, inducing new types of order, and creating intricate interplay between charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom. In vdW materials, this is typically achieved by twisting adjacent layers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or by utilizing specific lattice geometries 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. A recent milestone along this direction is the discovery of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in ferromagnetic heterostructures, which enables the study of fractional charge and non-Abelian anyons 14, 15. A wealth of exotic phenomena, including topological Kondo insulators, topological Mott insulators, chiral quantum spin liquids, and both integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects with AFM order, is yet to be realized in vdW materials. Achieving these new quantum phases likely requires developing new vdW materials and novel methods to intrinsically integrate strong correlation, magnetism, and topological characteristics. A promising route to naturally incorporate both magnetism and strong correlation arises from the competition between the Kondo effect and magnetic order, where localized magnetic moments interact with conduction electrons to form a many-body entangled state or align via exchange interactions 16, 17, 18, 19. The recently identified vdW Kondo AFM material CeSiI 20 marks the transition of Kondo physics from traditional 3D to 2D. However, it does not exhibit topological properties. To search for these three attributes in a single vdW material, we focus on heavy 5f elements. First, heavy elements have strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can induce topological phases. Furthermore, the dual nature of 5f electrons, which can exhibit either localization or itinerancy, is more promising than the typically-localized nature of 4f electrons. In particular, uranium compounds often possess multiple 5f electrons, with some contributing to magnetic ordering while others engage in Kondo screening 21, 22. Indeed, Kondo coherence has been observed to emerge below the magnetic ordering temperature in a few U-based compounds 21, 22, 23, making U-based systems an ideal platform for probing the rich physics at the convergence of topology, magnetism, and strong correlation. Here we identify the vdW material UOTe as a Kondo-interacting topological antiferromagnet. It features a unique antiferromagnetic structure that naturally breaks the combined parity and time reversal (PT) symmetry in an even number of layers while maintaining zero net magnetization, a simple Fermi surface with Dirac-like crossings close to the Fermi level, and Kondo interactions inside the AFM state. Moreover, its vdW nature offers potential for the investigation and manipulation of a variety of exotic quantum phases in the 2D limit, such as magnetic and electric field-tunable topological phases and an intrinsic fully-compensated AFM Chern insulator in the bilayer form."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08489v1,High-Temperature Phase Separation and Charge-Magnon Liquid in Kinetic Antiferromagnets,"Understanding mechanisms of quantum ordering in strongly correlated systems remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, with implications for designing novel quantum materials. Here, we investigate kinetic antiferromagnetism on a triangular lattice under an applied magnetic field, where spin-polarons emerge as charge-magnon bound states with mutual attraction. Using large-scale diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this interaction drives high-temperature phase separation into charge- and magnon-rich regions, bordered by polarised Mott insulating voids. Spectral function analysis reveals a substantial energy correction from magnon interactions, indicating that these carrier-rich regions form a strongly bound charge-magnon liquid. These findings shed new light on recent experiments on MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers, underscoring kinetic magnetism as a unique pathway for strong inter-carrier attraction and high-temperature quantum ordering, with potential applications in quantum materials.","References Lee et al.

Here, we study the entanglement and spatial quantum correlations in linear spin-wave theory around a classical spin-spiral ground state. We find that the entanglement between pairs of sites is short-ranged, and is completely absent in certain cases. In contrast, the entanglement hidden in multi-site clusters is peaked close to phase transitions and shows an asymptotic behavior modulated by the period of the magnetic structure. These findings motivate further exploring the connection in the entanglement properties of fully quantum and of quasiclassical spin models.","References White (1992) S. R. White, Phys. Rev.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08331v1,Magnetic field control over the axialness of Higgs modes in charge-density wave compounds,"Understanding how symmetry-breaking processes generate order out of disorder is among the most fundamental problems of nature. The scalar Higgs mode - a massive (quasi-) particle - is a key ingredient in these processes and emerges with the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. Its related exotic and elusive axial counterpart, a Boson with vector character, can be stabilized through the simultaneous breaking of multiple continuous symmetries. Here, we employ a magnetic field to tune the recently discovered axial Higgs-type charge-density wave amplitude modes in rare-earth tritellurides. We demonstrate a proportionality between the axial Higgs component and the applied field, and a 90∘ phase shift upon changing the direction of the B-field. This indicates that the axial character is directly related to magnetic degrees of freedom. Our approach opens up an in-situ control over the axialness of emergent Higgs modes.","Charge-density wave (CDW) phases play an essential role in condensed matter physics, where they are closely linked to exotic phases and emergent phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity [1], topologically non-trivial electronic phases [2], or generating novel electronic states along domain walls [3, 4]. On a more fundamental level, charge-density waves serve as valuable platforms to explore general concepts such as the (tunability of the) nature of phase transitions, quantum criticality, and the breaking of symmetries. Especially those CDWs that are linked to unconventional ordering processes may offer access to explore phenomena postulated for high-energy particle physics. A recent polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopic study of the uni-directional charge-density wave materials GdTe3 and LaTe3 revealed a remarkable two-fold (A_{2}) symmetry of the CDW amplitude mode at room temperature and zero magnetic fields. This low symmetry is rationalized by quantum pathway interference processes that uniquely occur in these rare-earth tritellurides with two distinct charge-density wave vectors. In contrast to other, conventional CDW materials, RTe3 hosts two (nearly) degenerate nesting conditions, qCDW and c∗-qCDW, connecting p_{x}–p_{x} (p_{y}–p_{y}) bands of Te, and mixing p_{x}–p_{y} (p_{y}–p_{x}) bands, respectively [5, 6]. The resulting two-fold periodic CDW amplitudon with vector character has since been dubbed as an axial Higgs mode [7], i.e., a condensed matter analogon to a highly elusive elementary particle. Two natural questions arise: what is the microscopic mechanism that generates axialness in RTe3, and how can we control or tune the nature of the Higgs mode? Its axialness dictates the breaking of additional symmetries. We can conceive of several potentially relevant scenarios, illustrated in Fig. 1a: (i) Since GdTe3 orders antiferromagnetically below the Néel temperature T_{\mathrm{N}}=11.5 K, a coupling between the Gd spins and the CDW may be a crucial component to the axial Higgs mode. (ii) A slight lattice distortion of the Te square-net units within the CDW phase may be conducive to a ferro-rotational state with axial properties. (iii) A finite orbital angular momentum (OAM) can be generated from the mixing of Te orbitals via p_{x}\pm\mathrm{i}p_{y}, which breaks time reversal symmetry and can respond to an external magnetic field. Motivated by this open issue, we performed a polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy study on the two sister compounds GdTe3 (with low-temperature antiferromagnetic order) and LaTe3 (without any long-range magnetic order) at various temperatures and with applied magnetic fields. In this work, we show that the low two-fold symmetry of the Higgs mode persistently observed in both materials and across a wide range of temperatures, together with its dramatic field-dependence allows us to rule out spin degrees of freedom as a relevant ingredient, and ultimately highlights the relevance of orbital degrees of freedom to stabilize axial Higgs modes in RTe3."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08322v1,Uncovering the Hidden Ferroaxial Density Wave as the Origin of the Axial Higgs Mode in RTe3,"The recent discovery of an axial amplitude (Higgs) mode in the long-studied charge density wave (CDW) systems \chGdTe3 and \chLaTe3 suggests a heretofore unidentified hidden order. A theoretical study proposed that the axial Higgs results from a hidden ferroaxial component of the CDW, which could arise from non-trivial orbital texture. Here, we report extensive experimental studies on \chErTe3 and \chHoTe3 that possess a high-temperature CDW similar to other \chRTe3 (R = rare earth), along with an additional low-temperature CDW with an orthogonal ordering vector. Combining Raman spectroscopy with large-angle convergent beam electron diffraction (LACBED), rotational anisotropy second-harmonic generation (RA-SHG), and muon-spin relaxation (\muSR), we provide unambiguous evidence that the high-temperature CDW breaks translation, rotation, and all vertical and diagonal mirror symmetries, but not time-reversal or inversion. In contrast, the low-temperature CDW only additionally breaks translation symmetry. Simultaneously, Raman scattering shows the high-temperature CDW produces an axial Higgs mode while the low-temperature mode is scalar. The weak monoclinic structural distortion and clear axial response in Raman and SHG are consistent with a ferroaxial phase in \chRTe3 driven by coupled orbital and charge orders. Thus, our study provides a new standard for uncovering unconventional orders and confirms the power of Higgs modes to reveal them.","Amplitude modes of \chRTe3 \ch RTe3 features two tetragonal Te-RTe-Te slabs separated by van-der-Waals gaps along the c-axis, Fig. 1e, enabling exfoliation[37, 38]. The p-orbitals of the Te square-net make up the Fermi surface with p_{x} (p_{y}) parallel to the a^{\prime}, 45∘ to {a}-axis (b^{\prime}, 45∘ to {b}-axis) axis. The glide-plane along b-axis, between the Te-sheets (Fig. 1e), produces slightly non-equivalent in-plane lattice parameters, resulting in a formally orthorhombic space group[36, 9], but is weak enough that the normal state is effectively tetragonal[39, 40]. The CDW order has the wave-vector \vec{q}_{CDW}=(2/7)b^{*} whose direction is selected by this effective glide field (Fig. 1c)[36, 9, 41]. Within the conventional scenario, as shown in Fig. 1c, the unidirectional CDW order breaks translation, C_{4}-rotation and mirrors m_{a^{\prime}} (pink, 45∘ to ma) and m_{b^{\prime}} (blue, 45∘ to mb). However, for the ferroaxial CDW scenario, all mirrors parallel to the ferroaxial axis are broken, namely the vertical mirrors m_{a} (red) and m_{b} (green), as well as the diagonal mirrors m_{a^{\prime}} and m_{b^{\prime}} (Fig. 1d). This order is unconventional, breaking symmetries beyond those of \vec{q}_{CDW}. Consequently, the system goes directly from a quasi-tetragonal to a monoclinic phase. To simultaneously investigate the lattice and CDW symmetries, we carefully measured the polarization- and temperature-dependent Raman scattering in \chErTe3. Figure 2a shows the Raman spectra from the crystalline a-b plane at 290 K (i.e., in the normal state T>T_{CDW1}\approx 265K), 190 K (T_{CDW1}>T>T_{CDW2}\approx 155K), and 10 K (T<T_{CDW2}) with the incident and scattered light polarized parallel to the a-axis (i.e., in the parallel (XX) configuration). In the normal phase (T>T_{CDW1}), four phonon modes are seen whose symmetries, discussed later, are consistent with a tetragonal, completely undistorted lattice. Upon entering the CDW1 phase, new modes appear either from the zone-folding by the CDW1 or due to the CDW Higgs mode[38, 27]. Upon further cooling below the second CDW transition temperature, additional weak modes at low energy are observed, suggesting further translation symmetry breaking (see the 10 K spectra in Fig. 2a). The temperature evolution of most modes measured via the crossed-circular polarization Raman response (\sigma^{+}\sigma^{-}) is shown in Fig. 2b. This and the other polarization channels (Supplementary Section 1) are consistent with previous measurements[38, 42, 27]. As expected from zone-folded phonons, all but two modes appearing below T_{CDW1} are nearly temperature-independent. In contrast, the substantial energy shift of the 4.1 meV and 8.8 meV modes and their vanishing near T_{CDW2} and T_{CDW1}, respectively, is consistent with the assignment of these excitations to the amplitude modes of the respective CDW orders[10, 33]. As shown in Fig. 2c, the CDW2 amplitude mode (4.1 meV) is well described within a mean-field theory[13], while the high-temperature CDW1 Higgs mode requires a two-mode interaction model[10, 38] to account for the avoided crossing at \sim 130 K with the phonon at \sim 7.5 meV (Supplementary Section 1). The coupling of CDW1 amplitude mode with the folded phonon (7.5 meV) reflects their identical symmetry."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08192v1,Accurate Electron-phonon Interactions from Advanced Density Functional Theory,"Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is key for understanding many properties of materials such as superconductivity and electric resistivity. Although first principles density-functional-theory (DFT) based EPC calculations are used widely, their efficacy is limited by the accuracy and efficiency of the underlying exchange-correlation functionals. These limitations become exacerbated in complex d- and f-electron materials, where beyond-DFT approaches and empirical corrections, such as the Hubbard U, are commonly invoked. Here, using the examples of CoO and NiO, we show how the efficient r2SCAN density functional correctly captures strong EPC effects in transition-metal oxides without requiring the introduction of empirical parameters. We also demonstrate the ability of r2SCAN to accurately model phonon-mediated superconducting properties of the main group compounds (e.g., MgB2), with improved electronic bands and phonon dispersions over those of traditional density functionals. Our study provides a pathway for extending the scope of accurate first principles modeling of electron-phonon interactions to encompass complex d-electron materials.","References Giustino (2017) F.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08107v1,From G_{2} to SO(8): Emergence and reminiscence of supersymmetry and triality,"We construct a (1+1)-dimension continuum model of 4-component fermions incorporating the exceptional Lie group symmetry G_{2}. Four gapped and five gapless phases are identified via the one-loop renormalization group analysis. The gapped phases are controlled by four different stable SO(8) Gross-Neveu fixed points, among which three exhibit an emergent triality, while the rest one possesses the self-triality, i.e., invariant under the triality mapping. The gapless phases include three SO(7) critical ones, a G_{2} critical one, and a Luttinger liquid. Three SO(7) critical phases correspond to different SO(7) Gross-Neveu fixed points connected by the triality relation similar to the gapped SO(8) case. The G_{2} critical phase is controlled by an unstable fixed point described by a direct product of the Ising and tricritical Ising conformal field theories with the central charges c=\frac{1}{2} and c=\frac{7}{10}, respectively, while the latter one is known to possess spacetime supersymmetry. In the lattice realization with a Hubbard-type interaction, the triality is broken into the duality between two SO(7) symmetries and the supersymmetric G_{2} critical phase exhibits the degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states, which are reminiscences of the continuum model.","Exceptional Lie groups play an essential role in the study of modern condensed matter physics zamolodchikov1989 ; coldea2010 ; bernevig2003 ; lopes2019 . E_{8}, the largest exceptional Lie group, is employed to describe an exotic quantum Hall state Kitaev2006 . The E8 excitations are also observed in an anti-ferromagnetic Ising spin chain coldea2010 . On the other hand, the smallest exceptional Lie group G_{2} with rank-2 and 14 dimensional agricola2008 , which is the automorphism group of the non-associative algebra octonion baez2002 , has especially attracted many interests recently Hu2018 ; Gao_2020 ; Luo2020 ; Li2023 . In particular, a lattice model which has an explicit G_{2} symmetry based on 4-component, such as spin-\frac{3}{2}, fermions is constructed Gao_2020 . However, G_{2} symmetry is shown to be intrinsically strongly correlated, that it cannot be realized in non-interacting systems Gao_2020 , which makes it hard to study analytically. Inspired by Ref. rzfa , we investigate the coarse-grained version of the lattice G_{2} model Gao_2020 in (1+1) spacetime dimension, where many powerful tools can be utilized to study strong correlation systems. Through an one-loop renormalization group (RG) calculation, we reveal the hidden SO(8) triality structure. The phase diagram is consistent with the mean-field analysis in the lattice model Gao_2020 . Interestingly, we also find in the phase diagram that one critical phase is described by the tricritical Ising (TCI) conformal field theory (CFT) vafa1995 . TCI CFT actually has spacetime supersymmetry FRIEDAN1985 ; QIU1986 , which is corresponding to the degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states in the lattice model Gao_2020 . Coset constructions based on G_{2} Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models realizing exotic non-Abelian statistics Hu2018 ; Luo2020 ; Li2023 can also emerge in our model. Moreover, our model also exhibits the exotic phenomena of multiversality and unnecessary criticality Bi2019 ; Abhishodh:2023 . The rest part of this article is organized as follows: In Section 2, the models are introduced both in the form of the lattice Hamiltonian and in the coarse-grained continuum version. In Section 3, the one-loop RG analyses are perform to yield the RG flow patterns and the corresponding gapped and critical phases. The embedding of the lattice model in the phase diagram of the continuum model is presented in Section 4. Conclusions are presented in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08105v1,"Anyon polarons as a window into competing phases of the Kitaev honeycomb model
under a Zeeman field","We compute the spectra of anyon quasiparticles in all three superselection sectors (i.e., visons, fermions and bosons) of the Kitaev model, perturbed by a Zeeman field away from its exactly solvable limit, to gain insights on the competition of its non-abelian spin-liquid with other nearby phases, such as the mysterious intermediate state observed in the antiferromagnetic model. Both for the ferro- and antiferro-magnetic models we find that the fermions and visons become gapless at nearly identical critical Zeeman couplings. In the ferromagnetic model this is consistent with a direct transition into a polarized state. In the anti-ferromagnetic model this implies that previous theories of the intermediate phase viewed as a spin liquid with a different fermion Chern number are inadequate, as they presume that the vison gap does not close. In the antiferromagnetic model we also find that a bosonic quasiparticle becomes gapless at nearly the same critical field as the fermions and visons. This boson carries the quantum numbers of an anti-ferromagnetic order parameter, suggesting that the intermediate phase has spontaneously broken symmetry with this order.","References Kitaev [2006] A.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08093v1,Spin-liquid-based topological qubits,"Topological quantum computation relies on control of non-Abelian anyons for inherently fault-tolerant storage and processing of quantum information. By now, blueprints for topological qubits are well developed for electrically active topological superconductor and fractional quantum Hall platforms. We leverage recent insights into the creation and detection of non-Abelian anyons in electrically insulating spin systems to propose topological qubit architectures based on quantum spin liquids. We present two types of prototype designs that enable the requisite control in a potentially scalable framework: one invokes spin liquids integrated into magnetic tunnel junction arrays, the other uses semiconductor-spin liquid hybrids. We further identify various protocols for interrogating spin-liquid-based topological qubits, both to validate the underlying principles of topological quantum computation and to establish gates required for universal quantum computation. These results provide long-term direction for experimental investigation of Kitaev materials and potentially other solid-state spin liquid hosts.","Topological phases of matter hosting non-Abelian anyons (or closely related non-Abelian defects) can emerge in experimental platforms including topological superconductors [1, 2], fractional quantum Hall systems [3], and quantum spin liquids [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Interest in these settings is fueled in large part by their potential utility for intrinsically fault-tolerant topological quantum information processing [11, 12]. Three deeply related non-Abelian-anyon characteristics [13] underlie this technological promise: First, a collection of non-Abelian anyons nucleated in a host platform encodes a degeneracy consisting of locally indistinguishable states. Qubits encoded in that manifold correspondingly enjoy built-in resilience against dephasing errors from local environmental noise. Second, adiabatically braiding non-Abelian anyons nontrivially rotates the system’s wavefunction within the degenerate subspace—enacting a set of ‘rigid’ quantum gates on the protected qubits. Third, non-Abelian anyons can ‘fuse’ into multiple quasiparticle types, with a history-dependent outcome. Measuring their fusion products thus provides a mechanism of quantum-state readout. Building a functional prototype topological qubit requires definitive formation of a non-Abelian topological phase, on-demand creation and controlled manipulation of non-Abelian anyons, and detection of individual anyons and their possible fusion products. Topological qubit blueprints integrating these requirements were first proposed for quantum Hall systems [14, 15, 16] and later adapted to topological superconductors [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] (leading eventually to scalable designs [24]). Despite the rather different nature of the two platforms, both constitute electrically active systems amenable to gating and charge transport—key experimental tools for manipulation and detection. In the quantum Hall setting, for example, electrostatic gating can nucleate fractionally charged non-Abelian anyons that can be electrically detected via anyon interferometry [25, 14, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Similarly, gating can manipulate non-Abelian domain-wall defects in topological superconductors [33], while electrical transport in conjunction with Coulomb charging effects enables interferometric readout [34, 35, 36, 37, 24]. How does one build and interrogate a topological qubit based on a non-Abelian quantum spin liquid? This question is nontrivial because spin liquids appear in electrically inactive spin systems. Consequently, one can not naively import the topological qubit designs and control techniques noted above to this setting. The question is also relevant given intense experimental investigations of a family of magnetic insulators dubbed Kitaev materials [5, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]—believed to exhibit Hamiltonians ‘close’ to the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model [4]. The Kitaev model in particular harbors a magnetic-field-induced non-Abelian spin liquid phase, for which experimental evidence has been reported in \alpha-\mathrm{RuCl}_{3} [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49] (see, however, Refs. 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56). Numerous recent papers have devised schemes for creating and detecting non-Abelian anyons in spin liquids [57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72] (see also the references in Sec. II). We build on these results to propose spin-liquid-based topological qubit blueprints as well as protocols designed to validate the essential underpinnings of topological quantum computation in this setting. We develop two types of architectures that incorporate potentially scalable ingredients: (i) spin liquids integrated into magnetic tunnel junction arrays that allow local, real-time manipulation of the host platform, and (ii) semiconductor-spin liquid hybrids for which electrons bind non-Abelian anyons, enabling charged-based control of the latter. In both cases readout proceeds via anyon interferometry. Following a philosophy similar to Ref. 73, we primarily focus on relatively simple geometries that allow for a series of proof-of-concept topological qubit experiments. We specifically present device designs and protocols for qubit initialization, verification of non-Abelian anyon fusion rules, demonstration of non-Abelian braiding, and extraction of topological qubit lifetimes. The required ingredients in turn allow one to realize both protected and unprotected quantum gates required for a universal gate set, which we also discuss in some detail drawing inspiration from earlier work in other settings [74, 11, 75, 14, 15, 76, 16, 77, 12, 78, 79, 80, 81, 33, 22, 82, 24]. Our designs moreover extend to scalable multi-qubit architectures. While many advances would be required to bring our proposals to life, we hope that the strategies developed here provide useful long-term guidance for quantum spin liquid experiments. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II sets the stage by reviewing the phenomenology of non-Abelian Kitaev spin liquids and surveying previously introduced anyon creation and detection strategies. Next, Sec. III proposes anyon manipulation methods that use either magnetic tunnel junction arrays or electrical setups. Section IV synthesizes these results to propose minimalist spin-liquid-based topological qubit designs and highlight protocols for validating non-Abelian fusion rules, non-Abelian braiding, and qubit lifetime extraction. Section V adapts protocols for gates needed to achieve universal quantum computation in this setting. Finally, we conclude in Sec. VI by highlighting various future challenges and opportunities."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08091v1,Non-Fermi liquids from subsystem symmetry breaking in van der Waals multilayers,"We investigate the spontaneous breaking of subsystem symmetry in a stack of two-dimensional Fermi liquid metals, each maintaining a subsystem number conservation symmetry, driven by interlayer exciton condensation. The resulting Goldstone modes in this broken symmetry phase couple to the quasiparticle current perpendicular to the layers. This coupling, which remains non-zero for small momentum transfers, leads to the emergence of a three-dimensional anisotropic marginal Fermi liquid state when the number of layers is sufficiently large. We propose a possible experimental realization of this phenomenon in two-dimensional multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Using self-consistent mean-field calculations, we characterize the subsystem symmetry-broken metallic state and examine the effects of fluctuations on its physical properties within the random phase approximation. We find that these fluctuations produce additional logarithmic enhancements to the specific heat at low temperature, specifically C\sim T(\log(1/T))^{2}.","Non-Fermi liquids (NFL) are a class of metallic phases of matter that deviate from the paradigmatic Landau Fermi liquid theory. A significant amount of theoretical and experimental effort continues to be devoted to studying these complex, strongly-coupled phases and their experimental realizations [1, 2]. They are typically believed to emerge in strongly correlated materials such as cuprates and pnictides when a bosonic order parameter becomes quantum critical [3, 4, 5]. A recent addition to the catalog of strongly correlated materials are two-dimensional van der Waals materials, which are heterostructures formed by stacking single material layers on top of each other [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. These heterostructures, created by stacking individual material layers, offer remarkable flexibility through gate-voltage tunability and diverse layer combinations, each yielding distinct physical properties. This versatility raises the intriguing possibility of these materials facilitating novel pathways to the realization of NFLs. Figure 1: (a) Stack of two-dimensional Fermi liquid metals with subsystem symmetry and long-lived quasiparticles. (b) Inter-layer coherent, or subsystem symmetry broken, three-dimensional non-Fermi liquid metal with short-lived single-particle excitations. In metallic states that spontaneously break continuous symmetries, the coupling of electrons to Goldstone modes can, in certain cases, result in NFL behavior [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. In scenarios where the broken symmetry generators affect only internal flavor degrees of freedom—such as in an XY ferromagnetic metal—Goldstone modes decouple from the electrons at low energies, thus maintaining the stability of the Fermi liquid [20]. Consider a bilayer metal with separately conserved electron numbers n_{1} and n_{2} in each layer, which can be decomposed into relative (n_{1}-n_{2}) and total (n_{1}+n_{2}) number conservation. The relative number conservation symmetry can be spontaneously broken through interlayer exciton condensation, while the total electron number conservation remains intact. In this context, the layers can be interpreted as flavor degrees of freedom, resulting in an exciton-condensed metallic state analogous to an XY magnetically ordered metal, which is a Fermi liquid state. Now, let us consider a stack of such monolayers, each possessing a subsystem number (n_{i} for the i-th layer) conservation symmetry and discrete translational symmetry perpendicular to the layers. Similar to the bilayer case, we can examine the spontaneous breaking of the relative number conservation symmetries (n_{i}-n_{i+1}) across all pairs of layers, while preserving the total number conservation. In a three-dimensional system with many layers, the relative number conservation symmetry generator cannot merely be viewed as acting on internal flavor degrees of freedom, as it couples electrons that are spatially separated. In this work, we demonstrate that such a subsystem symmetry-broken metallic state strongly couples to Goldstone modes at low energies, resulting in an NFL state. It is important to note that subsystem symmetry breaking at zero temperature necessitates that the spatial dimension of the subsystem where the symmetry generators act non-trivially is at least two. In lower-dimensional subsystems, strong quantum fluctuations will restore the system to a symmetric state [26]. Field theories with subsystem symmetries and their spontaneous breaking have also been considered recently in the context of fractonic systems (for a sample of papers, see Refs. [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]). Subsystem number conservation symmetry can be realized in 2D materials when monolayers are separated by an insulating barrier, such as boron nitride [33, 34], or when the layers are arranged with a large-angle twist [35], significantly suppressing interlayer electron tunneling. In this work, we begin by analyzing a microscopic model of such a multi-layer system. Using self-consistent mean-field calculations, we examine the phase where subsystem symmetry is spontaneously broken. We then derive a low-energy model of a 3D Fermi liquid coupled to Goldstone mode fluctuations, demonstrating that this interaction leads to a marginal Fermi liquid state, whose properties we subsequently analyze."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08810v1,Vortex lattice states of bilayer electron-hole fluids in quantizing magnetic fields,We show that the ground state of a weakly charged two-dimensional electron-hole fluid in a strong magnetic field is a broken translational symmetry state with interpenetrating lattices of localized vortices and antivortices in the electron-hole-pair field. The vortices and antivortices carry fractional charges of equal sign but unequal magnitude and have a honeycomb lattice structure that contrasts with the triangular lattices of superconducting electron-electron-pair vortex lattices. We predict that increasing charge density and weakening magnetic fields drive vortex delocalization transitions signaled experimentally by abrupt increases in counterflow transport resistance.,"References Ma et al.

In contrast to prior work on lattice-trapped gases, here we realize microscopy of quantum gases in the continuum. We reveal Bose-Einstein condensation with single-atom resolution, measure the enhancement of two-particle g^{(2)} correlations of thermal bosons, and observe the suppression of g^{(2)} for fermions; the Fermi or exchange hole. For strongly interacting Fermi gases confined to two dimensions, we directly observe non-local fermion pairs in the BEC-BCS crossover. We obtain the pairing gap, the pair size, and the short-range contact directly from the pair correlations. In situ thermometry is enabled via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our technique opens the door to the atom-resolved study of strongly correlated quantum gases of bosons, fermions, and their mixtures.","References Zwerger [2012] W.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08539v1,Evolution of Electronic Correlations in the Ruddlesden-Popper Nickelates,"We report on optical studies of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Lan+1NinO3n+1 with n=2 (La3Ni2O7), n=3 (La4Ni3O10) and n=\infty (LaNiO3). As the number of the NiO6 octahedra layers n grows, the ratio of the kinetic energy determined from the experimental optical conductivity and that from band theory K_{\text{exp}}/K_{\text{band}} increases, suggesting a reduction of electronic correlations. While the strong electronic correlations in the bilayer La3Ni2O7 place it on the verge of the Mott insulating phase, the trilayer La4Ni3O10 and infinite-layer LaNiO3 exhibit moderate electronic correlations, falling into the regime of correlated metals. The evolution of the electronic correlations in Lan+1NinO3n+1 is likely to be dominated by the Ni-d_{z^{2}} orbital. Our results provide important information for understanding the superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.","References Anisimov et al. (1999) V. I. Anisimov, D. Bukhvalov, and T. M.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08202v1,Latent Haldane Models,"Latent symmetries, which materialize after performing isospectral reductions, have recently been shown to be instrumental in revealing novel topological phases in one-dimensional systems, among many other applications. In this work, we explore how to construct a family of seemingly complicated two-dimensional models that result in energy-dependent Haldane models upon performing an isospectral reduction. In these models, we find energy-dependent latent Semenoff masses without introducing a staggered on-site potential. In addition, energy-dependent latent Haldane masses also emerge in decorated lattices with nearest-neighbor complex hoppings. Using the Haldane model’s properties, we then predict the location of the topological gaps in the aforementioned family of models and construct phase diagrams to determine where the topological phases lie in parameter space. This idea yielded, for instance, useful insights in the case of a modified version of \alpha-graphyne and hexagonal plaquettes with additional decorations, where the gap-closing energies can be calculated using the ISR to predict topological phase transitions.","Topological phases of matter have become a cornerstone of modern condensed matter theory, with applications ranging from material science and photonics through mechanical and non-Hermitian systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. A well-established theoretical framework that characterizes topological phases has been developed and refined in the last three decades, based on a classification of disordered insulators and superconductors subject to anti-unitary symmetries [6, 7, 8, 9]. One of the main properties of topological insulators is the bulk-boundary correspondence, which implies the existence of robust in-gap edge modes in one dimension (1D) and gapless boundary states in two and three dimensions (2D and 3D). To understand bulk properties, one typically considers periodic crystal structures and uses the bulk-boundary correspondence [10]. However, topologically nontrivial insulating states are not restricted to periodic systems, as they have also been found in amorphous, aperiodic, fractals, and disordered systems [11, 12, 13, 14]. One of the paradigmatic models of topological insulators in 2D is the Haldane model [15]. It models tightly-bound spinless electrons on a 2D honeycomb lattice subject to time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking by including complex next-nearest-neighbor hoppings. One of the consequences of nontrivial topology in such a system is the nonexistence of a complete set of exponentially localized Wannier functions, also known as an obstruction to Wannierization [16]. Consequently, a topologically nontrivial state cannot be adiabatically connected to an atomic limit in which electrons occupy maximally localized Wannier states. This model forms the backbone for understanding the quantum spin Hall effect [17, 18], and is also the simplest model to realize the quantum anomalous Hall effect [19]. Because of its importance, it has been dubbed the “hydrogen atom” of topological insulators. Here, we will explore how it can be combined with the isospectral reduction (ISR) technique [20]. In the last few years, the ISR has been used to understand and uncover many phenomena that were previously difficult to grasp. This technique originates in the study of large networks using graph theory, where the adjacency matrices for complicated graphs are reduced on a set of chosen vertices using a projective scheme. As the name implies, the technique reduces the matrix dimension while preserving the spectrum at the cost of introducing a non-linear eigenvalue problem. Initially, the method was shown to be very useful in revealing hidden network structures [21] and obtaining better eigenvalue approximations [22]. In the context of physics, it takes the form of an effective Hamiltonian. It has found use in various applications, including the unveiling of latent symmetries [23], explaining accidental degeneracies [24], designing quantum information transfer protocols [25], or uncovering novel topological phases of Hermitian and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians [26, 27, 28]. In this work, we use ISRs in a range of 2D lattice models to understand some of their features in terms of the Haldane model. In particular, we study a set of selected systems that, upon applying an ISR, reduce to an energy-dependent Haldane model. In doing so, we uncover the mechanisms behind the formation of gaps by breaking latent symmetries. Specifically, we see that a latent Semenoff mass is generated whenever the parameters of the model destroy a latent inversion symmetry. These gaps appear at energies that can be predicted based on the latent Haldane model. Furthermore, when TR symmetry is broken by introducing complex nearest-neighbor hoppings, it is also possible to find topological phases at fillings dictated by specific energy conditions, and directly construct topological phase diagrams from the latent Haldane model. This is in contrast to the usual Haldane model, in which the topological phase is induced by next-nearest-neighbor hopping. As an example, we applied this idea to a modified version of \alpha-graphyne [29, 30] and a decorated hexagonal plaquette. We predicted the gap-closing energies and critical parameter values using the ISR. We emphasize that these features are not model-specific but hold for a family of models that can be constructed from the simple building blocks that we thoroughly study in this paper. This article is structured as follows: in Section II, for pedagogical reasons, we introduce the Haldane model and recall its most essential features, such as its topological phases and the associated edge states in a ribbon geometry. We explain how the phase diagram can be constructed using a low-energy approximation near the gap-closing point and introduce the terminology used in the rest of the manuscript. This is followed by an explanation of the ISR in Section III.1 and an application to \alpha-graphyne in Section III.2. We calculate the gap-closing energies and introduce the ingredients necessary to generate topological phases. Then, we present the first system in which a latent Semenoff mass is generated from a decorated lattice in Section III.3. It provides the realization of a gap-opening mechanism that takes the form of a Semenoff mass, without a staggered on-site potential. We also introduce complex long-range hoppings that yield topological phases and construct a topological phase diagram. In Section III.4, we consider a system that now generates a latent Haldane mass from complex nearest-neighbor hoppings. When combined with the decorated lattice generating a latent Semenoff mass, this yields a variety of topological phases, for which we determine the phase diagram for the fillings that admit them. Finally, in Section V, we summarize our findings and discuss potential future directions of study."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08142v1,Evidence for Atomic-Scale Inhomogeneity in Superconducting Cuprate NMR,"In 1990, the Millis, Monien, and Pines (MMP) model and its improvement, the Zha, Barzykin, and Pines (ZBP) model in 1996, emerged as a realistic explanation of the cuprate NMR. These two models assume a single electronic component, translational symmetry, and that the electrons simultaneously have aspects of localized antiferromagnetic (AF) spins and delocalized Cu d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} band states. NMR experiments were routinely fit to these models in the 1990s and early 2000s until they finally failed as NMR experiments developed further. It appears that cuprate theorists have given up on explaining the NMR and the NMR data is forgotten. Here, we assume a two-component model of electrons where the electrons reside in two regions, one metallic with delocalized band states, and the other antiferromagnetic with localized spins. This model breaks translational symmetry. We show that the normal state spin relaxation for the planar Cu, O, and Y atoms in \mathrm{YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}} and their Knight shifts are explained by this two-component model. The temperature dependence of the Cu spin relaxation rate anisotropy in the superconducting state is also explained qualitatively.","I Model for Atomic-Scale Inhomogeneity in Cuprates We assume a planar Cu is inside the metallic region or the AF region with probabilities p_{M} and p_{AF} such that p_{M}+p_{AF}=1. (1) In prior work, we assumed a four-Cu-site plaquette in the metal region was formed for each planar doped hole [18, 19]. Hence, for dopings up to \sim 0.19, this assumption led to p_{M}=4x where x is the hole doping per planar Cu in the CuO2 planes. For the purposes of this paper, an easy way to approximately relate p_{M} to doping x is to assume p_{M}=0 when x=0 (a pure AF parent compound) and p_{M}=1 (a pure metal) when the T_{c} dome ends at x\approx 0.25. Our relation p_{M}=4x linearly interpolates between these two endpoints. Hence, at optimal doping of x=0.16, p_{M}=0.64 and p_{AF}=0.36. These values for p_{M} and p_{AF} are used for the remainder of this paper. The two-dimensional site percolation threshold is \approx 0.59. Therefore, the metallic region percolates through the CuO2 plane and the AF region does not. The AF region is comprised of disconnected islands of antiferromagnetism. The three-dimensional site percolation threshold for a cubic lattice is \approx 0.31. Hence, the AF region percolates in 3D. However, the inter-layer AF coupling between unit cells is very small and this coupling normal to the CuO2 plane direction can be neglected. Hence, the AF regions are essentially 2D. Figure 1 shows a schematic of a doped \mathrm{CuO_{2}} plane with p_{M}=0.64. In this paper, we consider optimal doping only because pseudogap effects are small. Our prior papers proposed that the pseudogap is due to isolated 4-site Cu plaquettes [18, 19]. Here, we do not model the pseudogap. Figure 1: Schematic diagram of a randomly doped 15\times 15 lattice in a single \mathrm{CuO_{2}} plane with the probability of a Cu site being metallic equal to p_{M}=0.64. The O atoms in the \mathrm{CuO_{2}} plane are not shown. The black “M” represents a metallic Cu atom and the blue “AF” represents an AF Cu atom with a localized spin in the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital. Delocalized electronic band states exist inside the metallic region. The dotted black line shows the boundary between the metallic and AF regions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08102v1,Magnetic-field suppression of tomographic electron transport,"Degenerate two-dimensional electron liquids are theoretically established to possess two vastly distinct collisional electron mean free paths, where even-parity deformations of the Fermi surface are hydrodynamic with a short collisional mean free path but odd-parity deformations remain near ballistic (known as the “tomographic” transport regime). Predicted signatures of this regime rely on the scaling of observables with temperature or device dimension, both of which are difficult to establish with certainty. Here, we consider magnetotransport in a minimal model of tomographic electrons and show that even a small magnetic field suppresses tomographic transport signatures and thus acts as a sensitive and unique probe of this regime. Fundamentally, the magnetic field breaks time-reversal invariance, which is a prerequisite for the odd-even parity effect in the collisional relaxation. We analyze in detail the scaling of the transverse conductivity, which has been linked to small-channel conductance of interaction-dominated electrons, and show that a tomographic scaling regime at intermediate wavenumbers is quickly suppressed with magnetic field to a hydrodynamic or collisionless form. We confirm that the suppression occurs at relatively small magnetic fields when the cyclotron radius is comparable to the ballistic mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode. This occurs at a much smaller magnetic field than the magnetic field strength required to suppress hydrodynamic electron transport, which suggests an experimental protocol to extract the odd-parity mean free path.","Recent advances in the fabrication of ultraclean materials allow to probe interaction-dominated electron transport, for which the electron mean free path due to binary collisions is smaller than the device dimension or the phonon or impurity mean free path [1]. This leads to collective hydrodynamic electron flow with a characteristic scale set by the electron shear viscosity. Hydrodynamics transport is expected to be the generic mode of transport in clean materials, and signatures of hydrodynamic electrons have by now been reported in a wide variety of (predominately two-dimensional) materials like mono-[2, 3] and bilayer graphene [4, 5], (Al,Ga)As [6, 7, 8], WTe2 [9, 10], WP2 [11], PdCoO2 [12], MoP [13], and NbP [14]. Since by Fermi liquid theory, electron interactions are phase-space suppressed at low temperature, the hydrodynamic regime is expected to span an intermediate temperature range where temperatures are large enough that electron interactions dominate over impurity scattering yet high-temperature relaxation due to phonon scattering is not yet prevalent. In this context, it has been suggested that the Pauli principle imposes very different phase space restrictions on electron relaxation depending on the parity of the Fermi surface perturbation [15], which leads to the emergence of not one but two vastly different electronic mean free paths: First, even-parity deformations of the Fermi distribution, which are described by a momentum-parity symmetrized distribution f_{e}({\bf k})=[f({\bf k})+f(-{\bf k})]/2, relax with a short mean free path that at low temperatures increases as an inverse square of temperature \ell_{e}\sim v_{F}T_{F}/T^{2} (where v_{F} is the Fermi velocity and T_{F} the Fermi temperature) [16, 17, 18]. Second, by strong contrast, odd-parity deformations, described by the anti-symmetrized distribution f_{o}({\bf k})=[f({\bf k})-f(-{\bf k})]/2, have a much larger anomalously increased ballistic mean free path, \ell_{o}\gg\ell_{e}. Indeed, for a simple circular Fermi surface (applicable to, for example, GaAs or doped graphene), more recent studies predict an asymptotic low-temperature scaling of \ell_{o}\sim v_{F}T_{F}^{3}/(m^{4}T^{4}), which is significantly increased at low temperatures, with an additional dependence on an angular-momentum index m that labels different odd-parity modes [19, 20, 21, 22]. This odd-even effect in the quasiparticle relaxation is surprisingly robust and predicted to exist up to temperatures T\lesssim 0.1T_{F} with a finite number of {\it O}(\sqrt{T_{F}/T}) decoupled odd-parity modes [19, 20, 21, 22]. Quite generally, the odd-even effect will be present for any system with a parity-even Fermi surface, for which deformations can be classified into even-parity and odd-parity modes. Fundamentally, the symmetry that guarantees this is time-reversal invariance, which implies a parity-even electron dispersion, \varepsilon({\bf k})=\varepsilon(-{\bf k}) [23]. Electron flows exhibiting the odd-even effect have been dubbed “tomographic” to distinguish this new regime from hydrodynamic and ballistic flows. Recent predictions for phenomena exhibited by these flows include anomalous fractional scaling of a narrow channel’s conductivity with its width [24], distinct bulk collective modes [25], and an enhanced nonlinear response [26]. Indeed, two recent experiments report signatures that could be attributable to tomographic flow: First, the observed Hall field profile in a narrow channel is seen to have a slightly larger curvature compared to the strict hydrodynamic Poiseuille profile [27], an observation that appears not fully explained so far but is speculated to be due to odd-parity modes in Ref. [27]. Second, the viscosity as extracted from a hydrodynamic modeling of electron flow in a Corbino geometry shows an anomalous inverse linear-in-temperature scaling at low temperatures [28]. This result is unanticipated since the hydrodynamic shear viscosity involves a microscopic even-parity deformation with a relaxation time that (according to Fermi liquid theory) increases with the inverse square of the temperature [29, 30]. Quite generally, a challenge in detecting existing predictions for tomographic phenomena is that establishing an anomalous scaling with device dimensions requires the fabrication (and theoretical modeling) of different samples, and an anomalous temperature scaling must be distinguished from other relaxation due to phonons and impurities. It would therefore be desirable to have an in-situ method to suppress tomographic effects without changing samples or parameter values. This would discriminate tomographic effects from other non-hydrodynamic phenomena. In this paper, we include magnetic field effects on tomographic transport and demonstrate that due to the breaking of time-reversal invariance, tomographic transport signatures are rapidly suppressed with increasing magnetic fields (illustrated in Fig. 1 below). This implies that if anomalous transport observations are indeed due to tomographic flow, then a hallmark signature would be a rapid suppression of such signatures with magnetic fields to a more conventional hydrodynamic or collisionless form (with a subsequent suppression to standard Ohmic transport at even larger fields). Here, we focus in our analysis on the transverse static conductivity, which is linked to the the shear viscosity and which addresses the recent experiment [28], but the general effect of a magnetic-field induced suppression of tomographic transport should hold more broadly [15]. In general, the magnetic field competes with all possible relaxation processes. Specifically, based only on quasiclassical arguments one can argue that as soon as the cyclotron radius r_{c}=m^{*}v_{F}/eB (here m^{*} is the effective electron mass and e>0 the magnitude of the electron charge) becomes smaller than a mean free path scale of interest \ell, the corresponding relaxation-related effects must be suppressed. The characteristic magnetic field scale is thus B_{\star}\simeq m^{*}v_{F}/e\ell. Introducing the cyclotron frequency \omega_{c}=eB/m^{*}, we find that relaxation channel of interest is suppressed after the cyclotron frequency reaches a corresponding relaxation inverse time scale, i.e., the decay rate v_{F}/\ell. In clean Fermi liquids \ell_{min}\sim\ell_{e} and therefore all electronic relaxation effects should be suppressed for B_{\star}\simeq m^{*}v_{F}/e\ell_{e}, an effect that is elegantly utilized by Zeng et al. [28] to disentangle Ohmic and electron hydrodynamic transport contributions. We will argue in this paper that the characteristic magnetic field which impedes the tomographic regime is much smaller than that and is proportional to the inverse mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode at the corresponding wave number. The focus of this study is to establish and illustrate the principles behind the magnetic-field induced suppression of tomographic effects. We therefore adopt a minimal model of tomographic electrons that allows to make semi-analytical calculations. In this model, we assume rigid deviations of the Fermi surface (as opposed to a temperature or interaction-induced broadening of the Fermi edge) and parameterize deformations of the quasiparticle distribution from local equilibrium as \displaystyle\delta f({\bf r},{\bf p}) \displaystyle=e^{i{\bf k}\cdot{\bf r}}\biggl{(}-\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial% \varepsilon}\biggr{)}h(\theta), (1) where {\bf k} is the wave vector of the perturbation (we assume static perturbations in the following), and we separate a nonanalytical factor involving the derivative of the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution f_{0}. In this way, by the chain rule, h(\theta) can be thought of a rigid deformation of the chemical potential that depends on the angle \theta of the momentum vector under the Fermi surface (see, for example, Fig. 2 below for illustrations). This function can be expanded in angular harmonics, \displaystyle h(\theta) \displaystyle=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}e^{im\theta}h_{m} (2) with angular momentum index m. The even- and odd-parity components of the distribution function discussed above are then composed of even and odd m, respectively. For a circular Fermi surface, binary collisions will not change the angular momentum index, such that collisions can be treated in a generalized relaxation-time approximation with individual decay rates \gamma_{m}\sim v_{F}/\ell_{m} that are inversely proportional to the mean free path \ell_{m} of the mode. Here, the first modes m=0,\pm 1 (the “hydrodynamic” modes) describe a compression and a rigid center-of-mass shift of the Fermi surface, respectively, with infinite lifetime since they are linked to conserved quantities (binary collision do not change particle number or total momentum), i.e., \gamma_{0}=\gamma_{\pm 1}=0. Moreover, we will assume that all remaining even-parity modes follow standard Fermi-liquid scaling, \gamma_{m\,{\rm even}}=\gamma, with no pronounced m-dependence. For odd-parity modes, we will adopt here a Matthiessen rule (with \gamma^{\prime}\ll\gamma) \displaystyle\gamma_{m\,{\rm odd}}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\gamma}+\frac{1}{\gamma^{% \prime}m^{4}}} (3) that interpolates between the relaxation rate of the lowest m modes with anomalously long mean free path and m-independent scaling for large m. The form (3) is an accurate description of the lowest odd eigenvalues at low temperatures and is in good agreement with exact diagonalization studies of the Fermi liquid collision integral [21, 22]. Note that elastic impurity scattering (with scattering rate \gamma_{i}) will contribute to all angular modes except for m=0 [25]. The advantage of the parameterisation (1) is that the kinetic Fermi liquid equation takes an effective tight-binding form (omitting the Landau parameters here), \displaystyle\bigl{(}\gamma_{m}-im\omega_{c}\bigr{)}\ h_{m}+i\frac{v_{F}k}{2}(% h_{m+1}+h_{m-1}) \displaystyle\quad=\frac{v_{F}eE}{2}\bigl{(}e^{i\theta_{E}}\delta_{m,1}+e^{-i% \theta_{E}}\delta_{m,-1}\bigr{)}, (4) where we include an external electric field {\bf E} that forms an angle \theta_{E} with the wave vector {\bf k} [see App. A for a derivation of the kinetic equation in a magnetic field and App. B for a derivation of the tight-binding representation (4)]. The left-hand side of Eq. (3) is reminiscent of a one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian with lattice sites labeled by m, where the term v_{F}k/2 fixes the amplitude of nearest-neighbour hopping, the magnetic field corresponds to an effective constant electric field, and \gamma_{m} is a non-Hermitian on-site decay term. For the tight-binding representation (4), very efficient exact numerical solution algorithms exist to solve for the vector \{h_{m}\} that do not rely on a slowly convergent matrix inversion of Eq. (4) with finite cutoff [25, 31]. This paper is structured as follows: In the next Sec. II, we summarize the main results of our analysis and discuss the magnetic field dependence of the transverse conductivity. The following Sec. III presents a detailed discussion of the minimal kinetic model for odd-mode transport outlined above and describes the crossover between the hydrodynamic, tomographic, and collisionless regimes. We conclude the paper with a summary and outlook in Sec. IV. Basics of Fermi liquid theory in a magnetic field, details of the evaluation of the kinetic equation at large momenta, as well as a link between a derivative expansion and Hilbert expansions used in hydrodynamics are relegated to five appendices."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08095v1,The J_{1}–J_{2} spin chain and the O(3) non-linear sigma model at \theta=\pi,"There are two competing pictures for how the O(3) non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a topological theta term renormalises to the \mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_{1} Wess-Zumino-Witten model. In the Affleck-Haldane picture, an ‘extension field’ parametrises the correlated fluctuations of the couplings and extends the target space from S^{2} to S^{3}; recently, however, Zirnbauer has advanced a competing picture where the extension field is frozen out and the infrared theory is more naturally thought of as a compact free boson dual to \mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_{1}. We show that the J_{1}–J_{2} spin chain evinces a phase transition between these pictures – corresponding to whether the dimer field that parametrises local singlet order is part of a joint O(4) Néel-singlet order parameter or appears as a separate gapped mode. For the O(3) NLSM itself, this analysis supports the Zirnbauer picture.","References Auerbach [2012] A.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08036v1,Superpositions of tree-tensor networks for single-reference ground states in the strong correlation regime,"The fermionic many-body problem in the strong correlation regime is notoriously difficult to tackle. It is inherently non-perturbative and the quantum Monte Carlo method is plagued by the fermionic sign problem when applied to such systems. In a previous work (Phys. Rev. B 101, 045109 (2020)), we have proposed to extend the single-reference coupled-cluster (SRCC) method to the strong correlation regime by truncating entanglement in the cluster operator, instead of truncating it with respect to the number or particle-hole excitations. The proposed extensions are applicable in practice if we can accurately represent the single-reference ground state using low-rank tensor decompositions (LRTD), such that the number of free parameters does not grow faster than a low-order polynomial in the number of excitations. To reach such a polynomially bounded parameterization, we have proposed a new type of LRTD called “superpositions of tree-tensor networks” (STTN), which use the same set of building blocs to define all the tensors involved in the CC equations, and combine different “channels”, i.e. different types of pairing among excited particles and holes, in the decomposition of a given tensor. Those two principles are aimed at globally minimizing the total number of free parameters required to accurately represent the ground state. In this work, we show that STTN can indeed be compact and accurate representations of strongly correlated ground states by using them to express the CC cluster operator amplitudes and wave function coefficients of exact grounds states of small two-dimensional Hubbard clusters, at half-filling, up to three particle-hole excitations. We show the compactness of STTN by using a number of free parameters smaller than the number of equations in the CCSD approximation, i.e. much smaller than the number of fitted tensor elements. We find that, for the systems considered, the STTN are more accurate as the size of the system increases and that combining different channels in the decompositions of the most strongly correlated tensors is crucial to obtain good accuracy.","The coupled-cluster (CC) method is arguably the most accurate method of quantum chemistry [1, 2, 3, 4]. Its success is due to the exponential ansatz for the wave function, which ensures size-extensivity, size-consistency, and makes it infinite-order from a diagrammatic point of view [4]. Single-reference CC (SRCC) is limited to weakly correlated systems however, and fails in the strong correlation regime [5]. Because some of the most interesting physical systems are strongly correlated, e.g. high-T_{c} cuprates, heavy fermions systems and Mott insulators, a strong correlation version of CC would be a great tool to have. So far, attempts to extend CC to the strong correlation regime do so by combining the method with either symmetry projection [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] or a correlation (Jastrow) operator [12, 13, 14], but at the cost of introducing additional approximations on top of the CC main approximation (the truncation of the cluster operator). Multi-reference CC methods [15, 16] are also better adapted than SRCC to strong correlations, but not specifically designed for that purpose, and are considerably more complex to use than SRCC. In Ref.17, we have proposed extensions of SRCC to treat weak and strong correlations using a unique type of approximation. In the most straightforward of those extensions, instead of truncating the cluster operator T with respect the the number of particle-hole excitations, as in conventional CC, it is the entanglement in T that is truncated or, more specifically, the entanglement in the tensors of T. Here, truncating entanglement means that those tensors are represented using low-rank tensor decompositions, or tensor networks (TN), that can drastically reduce the number of free parameters used to define them. The main approximation in our proposed approach would therefore be in the definition of T, as in standard CC, with the important difference that, without the truncation of T with respect to the number of excitations, the resulting SRCC wave function can represent both weakly and strongly correlated ground states. Our other SRCC extension proposal is based on CC-like equations that depend directly on the single-reference wave function coefficients and the TN are used to express those coefficients. Note that tensor decompositions have been used in the context of CC to speedup the calculations, but without extending the domain of validity of CC [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] and tensor network methods originally designed for spin systems have also been used in quantum chemistry, but not in CC [28]. One key requirement for those TN methods to be applicable is that the interactions are short range, a requirement which is not satisfied when delocalized orbitals are used, as is the CC method. Although our proposed extensions of SRCC can in principle be used with different types of TN representation, we have also proposed in Ref.17 a new type of TN representation designed specifically for the CC problem called “superpositions of tree-tensor networks” (STTN). The STTN are based on two principles aimed at minimizing in a global way the total number of free parameters required to express all the tensors involved in the CC equations: 1) all the decompositions for the different tensors share the same building blocs and 2) the decomposition of a given tensor is a sum of different binary tree-tensor networks (TTN) which are possible to construct for that tensor. We call those different TTN contributions “channels”, in analogy with the channels in diagrammatic calculations. The different channels account for the different possible correlations among the excited particles and holes. An important aspect of the STTN representation is that, unlike in well-known TN approaches, no assumption of locality in the interactions between excited particles and holes is required, and thus one could keep using delocalized orbitals, for instance Hartree-Fock orbitals, as in conventional CC calculations. In the present work, we illustrate how the STTN can accurately express either the T-amplitudes, or wave function coefficients, of exact strongly correlated ground states of small two-dimensional half-filled Hubbard clusters, using a number of free parameters much smaller than the number of tensor elements represented. We choose the Hubbard model because it is the simplest Hamiltonian that can model strongly correlated systems, which will help us interpret some of our results. The goal of those benchmarks is, on one hand, to verify the applicability of our proposed extensions of SRCC to interesting strongly correlated physical systems and, on the other hand, to show that STTN are a good choice of representation to implement those extensions. Therefore, they constitute an important step toward the development of those SRCC extensions. The article is divided as follows: our methodology is described in section II, the STTN construction is detailed in section III, numerical results are given in section IV, which is followed by a discussion and a conclusion."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07906v1,Correlated topological flat bands in rhombohedral graphite,"Flat bands and nontrivial topological physics are two important topics of condensed matter physics. With a unique stacking configuration analogous to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, rhombohedral graphite (RG) is a potential candidate for realizing both flat bands and nontrivial topological physics. Here we report experimental evidence of topological flat bands (TFBs) on the surface of bulk RG, which are topologically protected by bulk helical Dirac nodal lines via the bulk-boundary correspondence. Moreover, upon in situ electron doping, the surface TFBs show a splitting with exotic doping evolution, with an order-of-magnitude increase in the bandwidth of the lower split band, and pinning of the upper band near the Fermi level. These experimental observations together with Hartree-Fock calculations suggest that correlation effects are important in this system. Our results demonstrate RG as a new platform for investigating the rich interplay between nontrivial band topology, correlation effects, and interaction-driven symmetry-broken states.","1 Observation of bulk helical Dirac nodes and surface flat bands Figure 1a shows a schematic sideview of RG. The stacking order is analogous to zigzag graphene ribbons [31] or the one-dimensional (1D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) topological model [32]. Here the in-plane momentum (k) kinetic term \hbar v_{F}\lvert k\rvert (v_{F} is the Fermi velocity) and out-of-plane hopping \gamma_{0} are mapped (up to a phase) onto the staggered hopping parameters u and w in the SSH model [33] (see inset in Fig. 1a). In few-layer RG, each carbon sublattice hybridizes with orbitals directly above or below in the neighboring layers, forming conical subbands, while the unpaired orbitals in the outermost layers contribute to weakly dispersing surface flat bands near E_{F}. When increasing the layer number N, the surface flat bands become flatter and a higher density of states is expected at E_{F} (see SI Appendix Fig. S1), while the bulk bands evolve into Dirac cones. Figure 1b shows the calculated electronic spectral weight for bulk RG with N = 70 layers (see Methods for calculation details). Here, the conical regions with light-blue colors correspond to bulk bands, whose Dirac nodes form helixes along the out-of-plane momentum (k_{z}) direction with opposite chiralities near the K and K′ points [34, 28, 35] (see schematic illustration in Fig. 1c). These bulk helical DNLs have a quantized Zak phase of \pi (-\pi) near the K (K′) point when \hbar v_{F}\lvert k\rvert<\gamma_{0}, which guarantees the existence of topologically protected “drumhead” surface states, hereafter denoted as surface topological flat bands (surface TFBs), due to the bulk-boundary correspondence [36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. Bulk RG is therefore a model system for realizing a helical Dirac nodal line semimetal [28], where the surface TFBs (indicated by the red arrow in Fig. 1b) naturally arise as a result of the bulk band topology and are protected by the combined inversion- and time-reversal (\mathcal{PT}) symmetry. Fig. 2 \bm{|}: Observation of surface TFBs and bulk Dirac node. (a-f), ARPES-measured intensity maps at a few representative energies from E_{F} to -0.30\text{\,}\mathrm{eV} measured on sample S2. The photon energy used is 60\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}, which corresponds to k_{z}=0.11c^{*} in the reduced BZ (c^{*}=\frac{2\pi}{c}, where c=$3.34\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolAngstrom}$ is the out-of-plane lattice constant) for the K point. The red arrow indicates the TFBs and the blue arrow in (d) indicates the bulk Dirac node (bulk DN). (g-p), Dispersion images measured by cutting through the K point along different directions indicated by arrows in the insets. (q), Schematic summary of the experimental electronic structure, including the DN (blue color) and the TFBs near E_{F} (red color). The RG samples were prepared by mechanical exfoliation, and the ABC stacking was confirmed by spatially-resolved Raman spectroscopy and NanoARPES intensity maps (see SI Appendix Fig. S2,3). Figure 1d shows an overview of the characteristic ARPES dispersion image measured through the K point and the doping evolution. The surface TFBs near E_{F} (indicated by the red arrow) and the conical bulk states are clearly observed. The surface TFBs show exotic evolution upon electron doping, with a splitting of the surface TFBs indicated by orange and red arrows in Fig. 1e. An increase in the bandwidth is observed for the lower band at high electron doping, while the upper band is pinned near E_{F} (Fig. 1f). The origin of the surface TFBs and their correlated doping evolution are the main focus of this work. To reveal the details of the surface TFBs and bulk states, Figure 2 shows the experimental electronic structure of bulk RG measured at a photon energy of 60\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}. The Fermi surface map in Fig. 2a shows a circular-shaped pocket centered at the K point, which decreases in size and shrinks into a dot when moving down to -0.03\text{\,}\mathrm{eV} (Fig. 2b), indicating small bandwidth of TFBs. In addition, when moving down to -0.10\text{\,}\mathrm{eV} (Fig. 2c,d), a bright spot is observed at the lower-left corner in Fig. 2d (indicated by the blue arrow), which gradually expands in size at lower energies, indicating a conical behavior (Fig. 2e,f). The Dirac cone and TFBs are more clearly resolved in dispersion images measured by cutting through the K point along various azimuthal angles (Fig. 2g-p). The Dirac cone is most clearly observed with the sharpest dispersion when cutting through the bright spot in Fig. 2j, suggesting that it likely originates from the bulk band at a specific k_{z} value corresponding to the probe photon energy of 60\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}, while the weaker and broadened Dirac cones originate from intensity tail at other k_{z} values (see SI Appendix Fig. S4). The Dirac cone is connected to the edges of the flat band near E_{F}, which is observed in all cuts through the circular pockets at E_{F} (indicated by red arrows in Fig. 2g-p). A detailed analysis of the dispersion shows that it has a bandwidth of 32\pm$7\text{\,}\mathrm{meV}$ and a momentum range of \Delta k=0.10\pm$0.02\text{\,}{\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolAngstrom}}^{-1}$ around the K point (see SI Appendix Fig. S5 for more details). According to the theoretical models [33, 41], the momentum radius p_{0} of the flat band in RG is defined by p_{0}=\gamma_{0}/\hbar v_{F}=2\gamma_{0}/(\sqrt{3}at_{0}) where t_{0} is the nearest-neighbor hopping and a is the lattice constant. Using the values t_{0}=$3.16\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}$, \gamma_{0}=$0.39\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}$ (ref. [21]), and a=$2.46\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolAngstrom}$ gives a momentum range of \Delta k=2p_{0}=$0.11\text{\,}{\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolAngstrom}}^{-1}$, in agreement with the experimental result. Therefore, the experimental electronic structure in Fig. 2 can be summarized by the TFBs near E_{F} (red color) and a connecting Dirac cone (blue color), as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2q. Fig. 3 \bm{|}: Observation of bulk helical DNLs and surface TFBs along the out-of-plane momentum direction. (a-n), Energy contours measured at -50\text{\,}\mathrm{meV} at photon energies from 40 to 105\text{\,}\mathrm{eV} to show the rotation of the Dirac node as indicated by pink arrows. The Dirac node is barely detectable at 80-$95\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}$ due to suppression of the intensity by dipole matrix element effects. (o), Energy contours around the K point measured at -100\text{\,}\mathrm{meV} at photon energies from 40\text{\,}\mathrm{eV} (bottom) to 105\text{\,}\mathrm{eV} (top), which correspond to reduced k_{z} values from 1.72c^{*} to 2.79c^{*}. (p), Schematic drawing of helical DNL around the K′ point, which exhibits the opposite chirality to that in the K point. (q-v), Dispersion images measured at photon energies from 40\text{\,}\mathrm{eV} to 105\text{\,}\mathrm{eV} to reveal the non-dispersive TFBs indicated by red arrows. All dispersion images were measured by cutting through the Dirac node and K point at each photon energy, as indicated in the insets. Photon-energy dependent ARPES measurements have been performed to further confirm that the Dirac cone originates from the three-dimensional (3D) bulk bands and the TFBs correspond to the two-dimensional (2D) surface states (see more details in SI Appendix Fig. S6). Figure 3a-n shows intensity contours measured with photon energies varying from 40\text{\,}\mathrm{eV} to 105\text{\,}\mathrm{eV}, which is sufficient to cover an entire k_{z} Brillouin zone. The bulk Dirac node is indicated by the pink dot in Fig. 3a, and the intensity tail from the bottom of the TFBs is indicated by the gray dot. While the bottom of the TFBs remains fixed at the K point, the Dirac node rotates around the K point in the k_{x}-k_{y} plane when changing k_{z}, as indicated by the pink arrows in Fig. 3a-n. The rotation period for the Dirac node agrees with the periodicity of the k_{z} Brillouin zone of RG (see SI Appendix Fig. S7 for supporting information). Figure 3o shows the energy contours in the k_{x}-k_{y}-k_{z} space, where the helix of the Dirac nodes in 3D is indicated by the pink curve. Moreover, ARPES intensity maps covering both K and K′ valleys further show that the Dirac node helix around the K′ point has the opposite chirality to that at the K point, as schematically illustrated by the blue curve in Fig. 3p (see SI Appendix Fig. S8,9 for supporting experimental data and calculations at both K and K′ valleys). Interestingly, in contrast to the k_{z} dependent bulk Dirac helixes which rotate with k_{z}, the TFBs near E_{F} are observed clearly at all photon energies (as indicated by red arrows in Fig. 3q-v) without noticeable k_{z} dependence, confirming their 2D surface state origin. The observation of surface TFBs and bulk helical DNLs demonstrates RG to be a topological helical Dirac nodal line semimetal, where Dirac crossing points form helixes in the three-dimensional momentum space [40]. Here the TFBs form “drumhead” surface states, which are topologically protected by the bulk states. Moreover, the number of Dirac helixes is two, which is the minimum allowed by \mathcal{PT} symmetry, and there are no additional bands near E_{F} to complicate the electronic structure. Therefore, RG provides an ideal system for investigating the physics of helical Dirac nodal line semimetals with surface TFBs as well as electron-electron correlation.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07905v1,Crystal structure evolution induced by the Jahn-Teller effect in mixed-valence silver fluoride AgF,"The silver fluoride Ag3F5 consists structurally of square-planar units formed by four fluoride ions coordinated to a central silver ion, which possesses a partially filled d-subshell and the formal valence of +5/3. In this study, we demonstrate that the previously published crystal structure of Ag3F5 is unstable due to the Jahn-Teller effect, arising from the presence of two energetically degenerate d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} states sharing a single electron hole. Through a full structural relaxation within the DFT+U framework, we identified a new crystal structure for Ag3F5 with reduced symmetry and an energy gain of 151 meV per formula unit relative to the published structure. In this relaxed structure, magnetic chains are formed by silver ions with an electronic hole occupying the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital. These results highlight the crucial role of electron correlation effects and related structural distortions in determining the properties of such materials.","Silver fluorides are isoelectronic analogs of high-temperature superconducting copper compounds, a class of materials that has garnered significant attention [1, 2, 3, 4] because of their unique electronic and magnetic properties. Recently, fueled by the growing interest in copper fluorides, the existence of several new silver fluorides, including Ag2F5, Ag3F4, and Ag3F5, has been theoretically predicted [5, 6] and even synthesized [7]. These compounds are characterized by the presence of silver ions in mixed-valence states, which is particularly notable from both structural and electronic perspectives. In this study, we focus on the compound Ag3F5 and investigate its electronic and magnetic structure in detail. This compound is of particular interest not only due to its mixed-valence state, but also because of the potential formation of low-dimensional magnetic structures, such as planes or chains, similar to those found in Cu2F5 [8, 9]. These structures may lead to significant changes in both the crystal structure and the physical properties of the material. The partially filled electronic d-shell of the silver ions highlights the importance of Coulomb correlation effects, which are intertwined with the lattice degrees of freedom [10, 11]. The formal valence of the silver ion in Ag3F5 is +5/3. As a result, the chemical formula can be written as Ag+Ag{}^{2+}_{2}F5, where the electronic configurations are 5s^{0}4d^{10} for the Ag+ ion and 5s^{0}4d^{9} for the Ag2+ ion, respectively. The crystal structure of Ag3F5 belongs to the symmetry group P\bar{1} [5], with two inequivalent Wyckoff positions for the Ag ions: 1b (0,0,\frac{1}{2}) and 2i (0.3775,0.3163,0.1460). The corresponding crystal structure is depicted in Fig. 1. Each silver ion is surrounded by four fluoride ions, forming a flat plaquette around the 1b position and a slightly convex one near the 2i positions. Following the multiplicity of the Wyckoff positions, it is reasonable to assume that the nonmagnetic Ag ion, with a d^{10} configuration, occupies the 1b Wyckoff position, while the two Ag ions in a d^{9} configuration are located at the two symmetry-equivalent 2i sites. Figure 1: Published crystal structure of Ag3F5 with the symmetry group P\bar{1}. The large gray spheres denote Ag ions in the 1b Wyckoff position, the large blue spheres are Ag ions in the 2i Wyckoff sites. Small light violet spheres are fluoride ions. The square-planar coordination of the ligands induces a splitting of the d-orbitals of the ion at the center of the plaquette into the following subshells, listed from highest to lowest energy: b_{1g}(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}), b_{2g}(d_{xy}), e_{g}(d_{zx},d_{zy}), and a_{1g}(d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}). In Ag3F5, neither of the two types of plaquettes is ideally square: for the Ag1 ion, there are two distinct Ag-F bond lengths (2.14 Å and 2.22 Å), while for the Ag2 ion, all four Ag-F bond lengths differ (2.15 Å, 2.16 Å, 2.24 Å, and 2.26 Å). These deviations from an ideal square geometry lift the degeneracy of the e_{g} subshell of the Ag ions, though the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital remains the highest in energy. It is therefore expected that the electron hole on the Ag2 ion (in the d^{9} configuration) will occupy this orbital. These structural and electronic considerations suggest that the compound may exhibit chains of magnetic Ag2 ions in the d^{9} configuration, with half-filled d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbitals. Given the importance of electron correlation effects in partially filled d-orbitals of transition metals, as well as the potential for different magnetic moment orderings in this compound, we carried out DFT+U calculations to investigate the electronic and crystal structures of Ag3F5. Our analysis revealed that the published crystal structure [5] is unstable for symmetry reduction in the lattice. The electronic structure demonstrates features that indicate the presence of an effect analogous to the Jahn-Teller distortion, where the degeneracy of two partially filled d-orbitals is lifted through distortions in the crystal lattice, specifically via displacements of the ligands that coordinate the d-ions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07429v1,The extended Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice,"The lack of both nesting and a van Hove singularity at half filling, together with the presence of Dirac cones makes the honeycomb lattice a special laboratory to explore strongly correlated phenomena. For instance, at zero temperature the repulsive [attractive] Hubbard model only undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic [s-wave superconducting degenerate with charge density wave (SC-CDW)] for sufficiently strong on-site coupling, U/t\gtrsim 3.85 [U/t\lesssim-3.85]; in between these, the system is a semi-metal, by virtue of the Dirac cones. The addition of an additional interaction, V>0 or V<0, between fermions in nearest neighbor orbitals should break the SC-CDW degeneracy giving rise to a phase diagram quite distinct from the one for the square lattice. Here we perform determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the whole phase diagram, covering the four combinations of signs of U and V; the use of complex Hubbard-Stratonovich fields renders the region |V|\leq|U|/3 free from the ‘minus sign problem’. We calculate structure factors associated with different orderings, which, together with the double occupancy and the average sign allows us to map out the whole phase diagram. We have found that the SM phase forms a zone from which ordered phases are excluded, preventing the stabilization of a d-wave SC phase, i.e., only s-wave pairing is allowed.","The competition between interactions in itinerant fermionic systems usually gives rise to a multitude of interesting phases Fradkin et al. (2015). For instance, while magnetic correlations arise from Coulomb repulsion between electrons, coupling with phonon degrees of freedom may induce charge and pairing correlations. From a theoretical perspective, the Extended Hubbard Model (EHM) is one of the simplest models describing emergent magnetic, charge, and superconducting orders in electronic systems. Indeed, while a repulsive on-site interaction, U>0, favors the formation of magnetic moments and their effective coupling, the presence of a repulsive nearest-neighbor interaction, V>0, enhances charge correlations, thus favoring arrangements of doubly occupied sites. On a half-filled square lattice, an attractive V<0 gives rise to a d-wave superconducting state within a range of values of U>0 Zhang and Callaway (1989); Dagotto et al. (1994); Yao et al. (2022); Chen et al. (2023); Sousa-Júnior et al. (2024); upon doping, this model is expected to have strong bearings on high-T_{c} superconductivity in the cuprates Scalapino et al. (1992). This model has recently been realized in contexts such as the quasi-one-dimensional cuprate Ba2-xSrxCuO3+δ Chen et al. (2021), ultracold atoms in optical lattices Baier et al. (2016); Su et al. (2023), and in few-dopant quantum dot systems Wang et al. (2022). Phases emerging from competing interactions are often sensitive to the underlying lattice geometry. A simple example is provided by the half-filled Hubbard model (HM) on a kagome lattice with anisotropic hopping: a crossover between kagome and Lieb lattices involves phases such as ferromagnetic insulating, paramagnetic metallic, and Mott insulating Lima et al. (2023); Yamada et al. (2011). The recent discovery of correlated insulating phases and superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) Cao et al. (2018a, b) has spawned renewed interest in the study of strongly correlated phenomena on a honeycomb (HC) lattice. Indeed, while electron-electron interactions had previously been invoked to explain the occurrence of a strain-driven semimetal-insulator transition in graphene Lee et al. (2012); Si et al. (2016); Tang et al. (2015), a recent study pointed towards the potential control of electron-electron interaction in graphene through proximity screening Kim et al. (2020). In addition, some transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with low-dimensional hexagonal-like lattice geometries have been found to exhibit charge-density wave and superconducting phases Joe et al. (2014); Manzeli et al. (2017). A Hubbard-like model for magic-angle TBG has been proposed Kerelsky et al. (2019), whose low-energy properties are strongly influenced by electron-electron (e-e) interactions, thus opening the possibility of novel many-body effects Vahedi et al. (2021). Further, recent Matrix-RPA calculations suggest that the superconducting phase in the magic angle TBG is strongly influenced by local and extended e-e interactions Braz et al. (2024). Finally, we stress that the properties of the HM on the HC lattice are quite different from those on the square lattice: the former displays a semimetallic-antiferromagnetic (SM-AFM) transition at a finite value of U Paiva et al. (2005); Assaad and Herbut (2013); Otsuka et al. (2016); that is, the system goes from a gapless Dirac SM to an insulating magnetically ordered phase with a characteristic Mott gap. In view of the above, a thorough study of the EHM on a HC lattice is certainly of interest. We note that the studies so far Wu and Tremblay (2014); Faye et al. (2015); Schüler et al. (2018) have been mean-field–based and focused on the first quadrant of the U-V parameter space, namely U,V>0. The picture that emerged at half filling is that in addition to the AFM and SM phases, already present in the HM, a finite V>0 induces the appearance of a charge-density wave (CDW) phase for V\gtrsim U/3; upon doping, superconducting phases may be stabilized Faye et al. (2015). One should have in mind that similar half-filling physics occurs in the Hubbard-Holstein model Costa et al. (2021), as a result of enhanced charge correlations caused by the electron-phonon coupling. For completeness, we mention that several variants of the EHM on a HC lattice have also predicted the appearance of CDW phases Kotov et al. (2012); Wu and Tremblay (2014); Golor and Wessel (2015); Terletska et al. (2021), as well as bond-ordered phases Xu et al. (2018), and non-trivial topological properties Grushin et al. (2013). Our purpose here is to explore the full parameter space of the half-filled EHM on a HC lattice. Through determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations, we will focus on the nature of the emerging phases, and on an accurate determination of the different phase boundaries. The layout of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we present the Hamiltonian and highlight the DQMC method. Section III presents the results for the ground-state transitions. Finally, Sec. IV summarizes our findings."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07319v1,Unsupervised Machine Learning Phase Classification for Falicov-Kimball Model,"We apply various unsupervised machine learning methods for phase classification to investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model in two dimensions. Using only particle occupation snapshots from Monte Carlo simulations as input, each technique, including a straightforward classification based on principal component analysis (PCA), successfully identifies the phase boundary between ordered and disordered phases, independent of the type of phase transition. Remarkably, these techniques also distinguish between the weakly localized and Anderson-localized regimes within the disordered phase, accurately identifying their crossover, which is a challenging task for standard methods. Among the machine learning approaches used, PCA based analysis outperforms more complex methods, such as neural network predictors and autoencoders. These results underscore the effectiveness of simple unsupervised techniques in examining phase transitions and electron localization in complex correlated systems.","Strongly correlated electron systems are renowned for rich phase diagrams. Due to their complicated nature, it is not uncommon for new phases to be identified in materials or even simple models that have already been investigated for decades. Often, the information about the new phase was already present in the old data, but conventional analysis may have overlooked it. In recent years, a promising solution to this problem has emerged through the application of unsupervised and preferably interpretable machine learning (ML) methods [1, 2, 3]. These techniques can autonomously explore a vast parameter space and identify regions exhibiting distinct features, effectively highlighting potential novel phases. Using well-established physical criteria, researchers can then rigorously analyze the properties of these parameter regions. However, despite the tremendous progress in this field, the methods are still in development. The ever-growing repertoire of techniques presents exciting opportunities, but their applicability to specific systems and tasks requires rigorous evaluation under controlled conditions. In this respect, the Falicov-Kimball model (FKM) [4, 5] assumes a significant role in the realm of correlated electron systems. The model is accessible to exact methods [6], such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) in the infinite-dimensional limit [7, 8] and sign-problem-free Monte Carlo techniques in finite dimensions [9, 10, 11, 12]. Simultaneously, it has complicated ground-state [13, 14] and finite-temperature [15, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18] phase diagrams, details of which are still in debate. FKM is routinely used for the investigation of a multitude of phenomena. For example, it has been applied in its several variations for the description of metal-insulator and valence transitions [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], formation of inhomogeneous charge and spin orderings [30, 31, 32, 33, 15, 14, 12, 34], ferroelectricity [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41], cold atoms in optical lattices [42, 43, 44, 45], transport through layered systems [46, 47, 48, 49, 50] and other non-equilibrium phenomena [8, 51, 52]. Crucial is also its role in the development and benchmarking of new methods for strongly correlated systems [53, 7, 8, 10, 12, 54]. In recent years, these include ML techniques of various kinds. Artificial neural network techniques have been used to boost the equilibrium [55, 56] as well as kinetic [57] Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of FKM. Fully interpretable unsupervised prediction-based methods built on deep learning, as well as on physically motivated mean-based strategies, have recently been introduced for the rich ground-state phase diagram of the FKM [58] and have paved the way for more general strategies [59]. Recently, Richter-Laskowska et al. [60] applied the Learning by Confusion (LbC) approach to investigate the critical temperature T_{c} between the ordered and the disordered phases of the half-filled spinless FKM. The authors have found that T_{c} is correctly determined by LbC only in the case of a continuous phase transition that takes place in the regime of medium and strong electron correlations. For a discontinuous phase transition, there is a large ambiguity. Arnold et al. [61] subsequently proposed a possible remedy to this problem, based on a modified indicator of phase transition. However, as we show in our work, several unsupervised techniques, some of which are simpler than LbC, can locate the correct position of the phase boundary between the ordered and the disordered FKM phase regardless of the type of phase transition. The identification of other phase boundaries, which further divide both ordered and disordered regions of the model, proved to be more challenging. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that unsupervised techniques based on principal component analysis (PCA) [62, 63] and to the same extent also the prediction-based method and autoencoder-based classification can automatically distinguish the weakly localized bad metal regime and the Anderson-localized insulator regime and locate their crossover. This is important because the problem of electron localization in two-dimensional systems is notoriously difficult to analyse [64, 65]. Considering the long history of FKM, this crossover was identified only recently. Its existence in finite-sized systems was proven by Antipov et. al [66] via investigation of the energy-resolved inverse participation ratio (IPR) and conductivity. Yet, unsupervised ML techniques can pinpoint this crossover directly from the particle occupation snapshots. These results highlight the potential of straightforward unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify phase transitions and address electron localization in correlated electron systems. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Sect. II.1 we introduce the spinless FKM at half-filling and briefly discuss its finite-temperature phase diagram. Sect. II.2 describes the Monte Carlo method used and the details of data production. In Sect. III we present the machine learning methods employed, including classification methods based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Sect. III.1, the prediction-based classifier with neural networks used as predictors in Sect. III.2, and the autoencoder method in Sect. III.3. The results of the corresponding automatically constructed phase diagram are provided in Sect. IV. The main conclusions are summarized in Sect. V. Additional technical details and supporting arguments are deferred to the appendices."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07292v1,High-temperature superconductivity from kinetic energy,"In this work, we demonstrate a kinetic superconductor in a simple lattice model with only one term: the nearest neighbor hopping t. The hopping is projected into a constrained Hilbert space, in the same spirit as the usual t-J model with J=0, where kinetic magnetism has been proposed. The ground state in our model is demonstrated as a superconductor from density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation on the cylinder with L_{y} up to 8. Both the pairing gap and the phase stiffness increase with the doping x, which is in contrast to high Tc cuprates where the pairing gap decreases with doping. We show that the pairing gap, measured from the spin gap or charge 1e gap, can be above 1.5t. Our model can be realized in the double Kondo lattice model relevant to the bilayer nickelate system in the limit of infinite inter-layer spin coupling J_{\perp}/t\rightarrow+\infty, with an inter-layer repulsion V scaling alongside J_{\perp} to offset the net attraction. In the double Kondo model, there is no fundamental constraint on J_{\perp}/t, allowing the reachable upper bound of T_{c}/t to be a large number at the order of 0.5. We also argue that the kinetic superconductor discovered in this work can smoothly connect to the more realistic regime with J_{\perp}\sim t, though the pairing gap may be reduced to the order of 0.1t instead of t. Given that t\sim 10^{3}K in typical solid state systems, the material realization of the model may be promising to achieve a T_{c} at the order of hundreds Kelvin. We propose to search for bilayer material with a reduced z-axis lattice constant to closely approach our ideal model.","Searching for a new mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity is one of the most important problems in condensed matter physics. In the familiar high Tc cuprate materials, the pairing exists only at small doping away from the Mott insulatorLee et al. (2006). As a consequence, the critical temperature (T_{c}) is limited by the phase stiffness \rho_{s} which is proportional to the doping level xNelson and Kosterlitz (1977); Emery and Kivelson (1995). It is tempting to expect a larger T_{c} if the optimal doping is larger. However, the pairing usually competes with the kinetic energy and thus the pairing gap decreases with the doping x. The opposite trend of the phase stiffness and the pairing gap over the doping leads to a small optimal doping level x_{p}\approx 0.2Lee et al. (2006). In this work, we ask whether it is possible to make both the pairing gap and the phase stiffness increase with the doping x to achieve a larger optimal doping and thus higher T_{c}. Because the kinetic energy increases with x, this requires an unprecedented mechanism in which kinetic energy assists pairing. To our best knowledge, kinetic driven superconductor has never been unambiguously established even at the theoretical level. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of kinetic superconductivity in an ideal model with only a nearest neighbor hopping. The model can be reached in the strong coupling limit of the double Kondo lattice modelYang et al. (2024a). The double Kondo lattice model can be realized in a tetra-layer optical lattice simulatorYang et al. (2024a) and was also proposedOh and Zhang (2023); Yang et al. (2024a, b) to describe the recently discovered bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 systemSun et al. (2023). In the double Kondo model, we have mobile electrons in the two outer-layers, while the inner two layers host only spin moments coupled together by a large antiferromagnetic inter-layer spin-spin coupling J_{\perp} (see Fig. 1). Then the mobile electron in the outer layer couples to the local moments from the inner layer through a Kondo coupling J_{K}. The Kondo coupling can share the large J_{\perp} to the outer two layers. As a result, the mobile electrons in the top and bottom layers have an effective strong antiferromagnetic inter-layer spin coupling \tilde{J}_{\perp}, despite that there is no inter-layer hopping t_{\perp}. In the bilayer nickelate, the outer-layer and inner-layer are represented by the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} and the d_{z^{2}} orbitals and the Kondo coupling is from the on-site Hund’s coupling J_{H}, so J_{K}=-2J_{H}<0. In either case, the effective J_{\perp} coupling is not generated directly from the hopping term of the active orbitals, so there is separate charge conservation within each layer of itinerant electrons. In the context of the bilayer nickelate, the importance of the inter-layer J_{\perp} of the d_{z^{2}} orbital has been studied in Ref.Luo et al. (2023); Zhang et al. (2023); Sakakibara et al. (2024); Tian et al. (2024); Qin and Yang (2023); Yang et al. (2023a); Zhan et al. (2024); Chen et al. (2024a); Yang et al. (2023b); Gu et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023); Shen et al. (2023); Kakoi et al. (2024). Ref.Oh and Zhang (2023); Yang et al. (2024b); Lu et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024); Lu et al. (2023); Lange et al. (2024); Qu et al. (2024) further consider an effective J_{\perp} coupling also for the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital, shared by the Hund’s coupling. One may naturally imagine that pairing is dominated by the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital only. However, we emphasize that the bilayer nickelate is not simply described by a bilayer one-orbital model. Instead, electrons from the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital and the spin moments from the d_{z^{2}} orbital are intertwined together. In the limit of large Hund’s coupling J_{H}, one can reduce to a bilayer type II t-J modelZhang and Vishwanath (2020); Zhang and Zhu (2021), but the d_{z^{2}} orbital is still alive. When J_{\perp} is finite, the bilayer type II t-J model and the bilayer one-orbital t-J model are quantitatively quite differentYang et al. (2024a, b). There is no fundamental limit on the ratio J_{K}/t and J_{\perp}/t where t denotes the intra-layer hopping. We will focus on the strong coupling limit |J_{K}|\gg t,J_{\perp}\gg t in this work. Note that we need J_{\perp}>0, but allow J_{K} to be either positive or negative. In the strong coupling limit, we reach a much simpler model, the ESD modelYang et al. (2024b), which contains empty (E), singly occupied (S) and doubly occupied (D) states at each super-site combining the two layers. We also introduce an inter-layer repulsion V and fix the ratio V/J_{\perp} in a specific value to exactly offset the attraction from the J_{\perp} term. In this limit, we only need to project the nearest neighbor hopping t into the ESD Hilbert space. The spirit is akin to the familiar t-J model with J=0. In the t-J model with J=0, ferromagnetism or anti-ferromagnetism can arise from the hopping term and the mechanism has been dubbed as kinetic magnetismNagaoka (1966). We will show that in our model the ground state is a superconductor in a large doping range based on density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation. For small hole doping level x such as x=\frac{1}{8}, we can obtain convincing power-law pair-pair correlations with a small exponent for L_{y} as large as 8. The x=0 and x=1 limits represent two trivial insulators which can be viewed as two different vacuums. We find that the pairing gap and the phase stiffness follow tx away from x=0 (or t(1-x) away from x=1), the ‘Fermi energy’ in the free fermion model. We show that the pairing gap can reach above 1.5\ t and the critical temperature T_{c} may be as large as 0.5\ t. In contrast to the previous numerical simulations of the conventional t-J modelDolfi et al. (2015); Yang and Feiguin (2019); Troyer et al. (1996); Poilblanc et al. (2000); Gannot et al. (2020); White and Scalapino (1997, 1999); Huang et al. (2018); Jiang et al. (2018); Dodaro et al. (2017); Jiang et al. (2020); Jiang and Kivelson (2021); Gong et al. (2021); Jiang et al. (2021, 2014); Jiang (2021); Jiang and Jiang (2020); Jiang et al. (2017); Peng et al. (2021); Himeda et al. (2002); Scalapino et al. (2001); White and Scalapino (2009); Corboz et al. (2014); Xu et al. (2019); White and Scalapino (1998); Grusdt et al. (2018); Chen et al. (2018); Zhu and Weng (2015); Zhu et al. (2015); Sun et al. (2019); Zhu et al. (2016); Chen et al. (2024b); Wang et al. (2015), we do not find any signature of stripe orders or other translation-symmetry-breaking orders in our model. This indicates the absence of competing orders. The model unambiguously demonstrates proof of the existence of kinetic superconductor and also provides a mechanism towards very high T_{c} which can scale with the Fermi energy. The pairing mechanism here is clearly beyond any mean field theory given that there is no interaction term for mean field decoupling at the first place in our model. We will offer some intuitions on why the electrons can pair up to minimize the kinetic energy. We provide analytical treatments of the two-electron problem and a special limit with layer-opposite Zeeman field. In these special cases we can really demonstrate pairing in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. For the general case, we do not have an exact analytical solution, but we show that a generalized slave boson theory is in qualitative agreement with the DMRG results. In our model, we have two different carriers, the doublon \ket{d} and the holon \ket{h} states with charges +1 and -1 respectively. The x=0 and x=1 limits correspond to a product of \ket{d} state and a product of \ket{h} state respectively. The normal states close to x=0 and x=1 are two different Fermi liquids (FL), one of which violates the conventional Luttinger theorem of the Fermi volume by half of the Brillouin zone per flavorOshikawa (2000); Yang et al. (2024b). Interestingly the model can be adjusted to have a particle-hole symmetry relating these two FLs at x=0.5. As a consequence a symmetric FL is simply forbidden at x=0.5 and the superconductor can not be viewed as a descendant of a Fermi liquid. This challenges the conventional theoretical frameworks of superconductivity. We offer a variational wavefunction based on our generalized slave-boson theory at the doping x=0.5 to demonstrate the possibility of superconductivity without the need for a Fermi liquid normal state. Although the model is achieved at the limit J_{\perp}/t\gg 1, we show that the superconductor can survive to the more realistic regime with J_{\perp}\sim t. We also demonstrate that the superconductor is robust when increasing V so that there is a net repulsive interaction. Therefore, we believe that it is promising to realize the mechanism in a real material, such as in a bilayer nickelate system similar to the recently studied La3Ni2O7. Because the theoretical upper bound of T_{c} in this class of model is at the order of 0.5\ t, it may not be unimaginable to achieve a T_{c} at least at the order of 0.1\ t by enhancing J_{\perp} in real systems, for example through reducing the z-axis lattice constant. Given that t is typically thousands Kelvin in solid state systems, the model may offer a plausible route toward room-temperature superconductivity. The rest of the paper is organized in the following way. In Sec.II, we introduce the double Kondo lattice model and the ESD model in the strong coupling limit. In Sec.III, we show DMRG evidence for superconductivity in the ESD model with only the hopping term. Sec.IV provides an exact solution to the two-electron and two-hole problems of the ESD model in the 2D limit. In Sec.V, we analytically study a special limit with a strong layer-opposite Zeeman field in the ESD model by mapping the problem to the familiar spin-1/2 free fermion model with additional attractive interaction. In Sec.VI, we show that a slave boson mean field theory captures the phase diagram in qualitative agreement with our DMRG results. In Sec.VII, we demonstrate that the superconductor survives to the realistic regime of J_{\perp}/t for two full models with large negative J_{K} and large positive J_{K}. We emphasize that the bilayer nickelate is described by a bilayer type II t-J model instead of a simple bilayer one-orbital model. In Sec. VIII, we provide some insights on the pairing mechanism and propose a route to experimentally search for a bilayer nickelate system with a reduced z-axis lattice constant to closely approach our ideal model. We summarize our results and conclude the paper in Sec.IX."

natural van der Waals hetrostructure 4H-TaS","The natural van der Waals heterostructure 4Hb-TaS2 composed of alternating 1T- and 1H-TaS2 layers serves as a platform for investigating the electronic correlations and layer-dependent properties of novel quantum materials. The temperature evolution of the conductivity spectra \sigma(\omega) obtained through infrared spectroscopy elucidates the influence of band modifications associated with the charge-density-wave (CDW) superlattice on the 1T layer, resulting in a room-temperature energy gap, \Delta_{\rm CDW}\approx 0.35 eV. Supported by density functional theory calculations, we attribute the behavior of interband transitions to the convergence of the layers, which amplifies the charge transfer from the 1T to the 1H layers, progressing as the temperature decreases. This phenomenon leads to an enhanced carrier density. The presence of an energy gap and the temperature-tunable charge transfer within the bulk of 4Hb-TaS2 – driven by layer-dependent CDW states – contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of other complex compounds of transition-metal dichalcogenides.","References Ribak et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07778v1,"Trapped-ion quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model as a 
lattice gauge theory using hardware-aware native gates","The Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) is a simple yet rich model of strongly interacting electrons with complex dynamics and a variety of emerging quantum phases. These properties make it a compelling target for digital quantum simulation. Trotterization-based quantum simulations have shown promise, but implementations on current hardware are limited by noise, necessitating error mitigation techniques like circuit optimization and post-selection. A mapping of the FHM to a \mathbb{Z}_{2}\ LGT was recently proposed that restricts the dynamics to a subspace protected by additional symmetries, and its ability for post-selection error mitigation was verified through noisy classical simulations. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a suite of algorithm-hardware co-design strategies on a trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting two key aspects of NISQ-era quantum simulation: circuit compilation and error mitigation. In particular, a novel combination of iteratively preconditioned gradient-descent (IPG) and subsystem von Neumann Entropy compression reduces the 2-qubit gate count of FHM quantum simulation by 35%, consequently doubling the number of simulatable Trotter steps when used in tandem with error mitigation based on conserved symmetries, debiasing and sharpening techniques. Our work demonstrates the value of algorithm-hardware co-design to operate digital quantum simulators at the threshold of maximum circuit depths allowed by current hardware, and is broadly generalizable to strongly correlated systems in quantum chemistry and materials science.","The Fermi-Hubbard Model (FHM) is a simple yet powerful model that brings insight into materials’ electronic and magnetic properties [1, 2]. It is promising in studies of quantum magnetism, antiferromagnetism, high-temperature superfluidity, d-wave pairing and superconductivity, and transitions between these different regimes of the rich phase diagram [3, 4, 5, 6]. Ultracold atoms, trapped ions and semiconductor quantum dots have shown significant experimental progress in analog quantum simulation of the FHM [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; however, digital quantum simulation on quantum computers remains challenging due to the infidelities in qubits and gate operations on today’s noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. A lattice gauge theory (LGT) approach for digital quantum simulation of the one-dimensional FHM has been recently proposed and analyzed [13]. Although requiring more qubits and deeper circuits than a direct encoding, the LGT approach allows for a set of local operators on the links between the lattice sites to be fixed to eigenvalues of \pm 1 depending on the sign of the interaction term in the Hubbard Model. It is typical for LGTs to introduce additional conservation laws that restrict time evolution to a small sector of the entire Hilbert space. For example, in quantum link models for lattice quantum electrodynamics [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], time evolution is naturally or artificially restricted to the sector that respects Gauss’s law, and this has been used for post-selection error mitigation [22, 23, 24, 25]. In a similar spirit, the \mathbb{Z}_{2}\ LGT encoding of the FHM, in addition to global spin conservation, introduces a large number of local conserved charges [13], which can enable efficient post-selection error mitigation. More generally, today’s NISQ era digital quantum computers, although large enough to conduct nontrivial gate operations, are limited by qubit coherence time, larger-than-ideal gate execution time, noise in operations, and differing qubit basis sets dependent on the qubit platform. Therefore, minimizing the depth of circuits – often achieved through transpilation, is critical in modeling challenging systems such as the Fermi-Hubbard model. Despite the benefit of an additional post-selection error mitigation technique introduced by the aforementioned LGT encoding, three significant challenges must be surmounted for Trotterized simulation of the FHM encoded in this fashion on a currently available quantum processing unit (QPU). First, transpiling Trotter steps made up of gates non-native to a QPU can significantly increase overall circuit depth, possibly rendering a circuit unfeasible to execute. This challenge is combated with gradient-based circuit optimization. However, this leads to our second challenge: Classically parameterizing and optimizing a Trotter step is infeasible beyond a small number of qubits, due to the Hilbert space of a circuit increasing exponentially with the number of qubits. Such a problem is ubiquitous in variational algorithms [26, 27, 28, 29], including calculating ground state energies on a variational quantum eigensolver [30, 31, 32, 33]. Finally, ensuring that an ansatz possesses the expressibility needed to represent a desired unitary requires optimizing over many parameters, which is difficult for commonly used gradient-based optimizers due to the presence of local minima, sensitivity to noise, and sensitivity to initial starting conditions. Here, we surmount these challenges by exploiting the symmetry of an objective unitary to allow for classically feasible circuit optimization. Specifically, we use the Trotter step of a Fermi-Hubbard Model via \mathbb{Z}_{2}\ LGT transformation as our objective unitary and decompose this unitary as a combination of repeating, static three-qubit circuits. We then create a hardware-aware, parameterizable, three-qubit ansatz using the native gateset of the IonQ Aria QPU, and optimize this hardware-aware ansatz using a newly developed optimization technique –- that of iteratively pre-conditioned gradient descent (IPG) [34] –- and compare the effectiveness of IPG to that of commonly leveraged optimizers for gradient-based circuit optimization. Finally, we run the circuits on the IonQ Aria QPU, leveraging debiasing and sharpening as error mitigation techniques combined with the conserved-symmetry-based error mitigation approach inherent to lattice gauge theories. This novel, systematic method of approaching circuit optimization on a Trotterized system results a 14% reduction in the number of native two-qubit Mølmer-Sørenson (MS) gates per Trotter step, combined with an even larger reduction in the number of single qubit gates. A further reduction of 25% is effected by using von Neumann entropy based arguments for reducing circuit depth while maintaining sufficient expressibility, resulting in a total 37% reduction in 2-qubit gate count. This, combined with debiasing in tandem with symmetry-based error mitigation, demonstrates a strategy to reliably run a large depth circuit of a fermionic system on present day QPU hardware. The structure of the paper is the following. In Sec. II we introduce and outline the quantum circuit of the Trotterized \mathbb{Z}_{2}\ LGT Fermi Hubbard Model. In Sec. III we decompose the circuit into three-qubit sub-circuits and create a thirty-parameter, hardware-aware ansatz with adequate expressibility. In Sec. IV we introduce iteratively pre-conditioned gradient descent (IPG) in the context of our specific quantum circuit optimization. In Sec. V we optimize the sub-circuit with IPG, and combine sub-circuits to create an overall optimized Trotter step. In sec. VI we introduce the several error mitigation techniques we employed. In Sec. VII we run multiple trotter steps on the IonQ Aria QPU with Debiasing and Sharpening as active error mitigation strategies. Sec. VIII reports results on further reducing two-qubit gate counts using von Neumann entropy arguments while maintaining sufficient expressibility to represent the desired quantum circuit. We conclude in Sec. IX."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07624v1,Ising superconductivity in the bulk incommensurate layered material \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right),"Exploiting the spin-valley degree of freedom of electrons in materials is a promising avenue for energy-efficient information storage and quantum computing. A key challenge in utilizing spin-valley polarization is the realization of spin-valley locking in bulk systems. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the noncentrosymmetric bulk misfit compound \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right), showing a strong spin-valley locking. Our investigation reveals Ising superconductivity with a transition temperature of 3.14 K, closely matching that of a monolayer of TaS2. Notably, the absence of charge density wave (CDW) signatures in transport measurements suggests that the PbS layers primarily act as spacers between the dichalcogenide monolayers.This is further supported by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which shows negligible interlayer coupling, a lack of dispersion along the k_{\perp} direction and significant charge transfer from the PbS to the TaS2 layers. Spin resolved ARPES shows strong spin-valley locking of the electronic bands.Muon spin rotation experiments conducted in the vortex phase reveal an isotropic superconducting gap. However, the temperature dependence of the upper critical field and low-temperature specific heat measurements suggest the possibility of multigap superconductivity.These findings underscore the potential of misfit compounds as robust platforms for both realizing and utilizing spin-valley locking in bulk materials, as well as exploring proximity effects in two-dimensional structures.","I INTRODUCTION Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have garnered renewed attention in recent years owing to the emergent topological phases and unusual superconductivity [1, 2]. In addition, leveraging the energy valleys in the band structures of TMDC materials offers a unique opportunity to harness the spin and valley degrees of freedom for valleytronics applications [3]. Apart from the structural varieties, these materials offer great flexibility in terms of tuning the electronic properties easily by different means, such as doping, intercalation, gating, and heterostructure designing[4, 5, 6, 7]. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in designing heterostructured materials with electronic responses different from their constituent layers[8, 9]. The synergy between different material platforms holds immense potential to host novel correlated phases of matter, challenging the conventional understanding and opening the door to new physics and diverse technological applications.[10, 11, 12]. However, realizing high-quality, scalable systems remains a roadblock for further experimentation. The difficulty in obtaining clean interfaces and the tedious process of device fabrication are among the major challenges in this domain [13, 14]. Many of these challenges related to synthesizing heterostructures can be circumvented by studying naturally grown heterostructures, such as misfit materials. Misfit materials hold a general formula of \left(\rm{MX}\right)_{1+x}\left(\rm{TX}_{2}\right)_{n} with stacking of monochalcogenide \left(\rm{MX}\right) and dichalcogenide \left(\rm{TX}_{2}\right) layers[15, 16]. The monochalcogenide layers crystallize into distorted NaCl-type structures, while the dichalcogenide layers consist of T atoms coordinated in a trigonal prismatic arrangement. Due to the fundamentally different symmetry and periodicity of the sublattice, the crystal structure is incommensurate along one of the in-plane crystallographic axes and remains commensurate along the other two axes [17]. Although the sub-lattices are incommensurate, causing a continuous change in the coordination number of the interface atoms, the crystals show high stability with perfect stacking perpendicular to the layers [18, 19]. Furthermore, the incommensurability prevents the formation of any strong interlayer bonding. This structure can also be considered an intercalation of monochalcogenide layers between the weakly bonded TMDC layers. The monochalcogenide spacer layer thus reduces or completely decouples the TMDC monolayers and protects them. This method enables the achievement of a 2D nature in bulk van der Waals materials, providing robust stability. Similar to the intercalation of foreign atoms or molecules, recent reports show a substantial charge transfer between the layers, which helps stabilize the complex structure[16, 20]. However, the spacer layer’s impact on the TMDC layer’s electronic structure, and vice versa, along with the tailored electronic structure of misfit materials, has been less explored. Furthermore, the nature of superconductivity and the superconducting pairing mechanism in misfit compounds remains underinvestigated. Here, we have synthesized the misfit material \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right), consisting of alternating layers of monochalcogenide \rm{PbS} and monolayer \rm{1H-TaS}_{2}. \left(\rm{PbS}\right) is a semiconductor with a direct band gap, while \rm{2H-TaS}_{2} is a superconductor below 0.8~{}\rm{K} [21, 22]. The compound \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right) is particularly intriguing due to its structural similarity to \rm{4Hb-TaS}_{2}, which consists of alternating layers of \rm{1H-TaS}_{2} and strongly correlated \rm{1T-TaS}_{2}. Notably, \rm{4Hb-TaS}_{2} has exhibited signs of topological surface superconductivity with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS). While various measurements suggest the presence of non-trivial superconductivity in this material, the exact underlying mechanism remains unknown [23, 24, 25, 26]. Our measurements have shown superconductivity in \left(\rm{PbS}\right)_{1.13}\left(\rm{TaS}_{2}\right) at 3.14~{}\rm{K} with a possible two-gap nature. Our transport and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data show the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity with strong spin-valley locking. The electronic band structure at the Fermi level is dominated by the TMDC layer, which has a large charge transfer from mono-chalcogenide to the dichalcogenide layer."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07369v1,Topological Hall-like behavior of multidomain ferromagnets,"We investigate the emergence of topological Hall-like (THE-like) signals in disordered multidomain ferromagnets. Non-monotonic behavior in Hall resistivity, commonly attributed to topological spin textures such as skyrmions, is produced in a random resistor network model without any chirality. It arises from simple mechanisms of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in combination with the domain wall scattering. By varying domain configurations and domain wall resistances, we explore the conditions under which the non-monotonic resistivity can be enhanced. Our results emphasize the need for careful analysis in distinguishing between true topological Hall effects and artifacts caused by domain disorders.","The topological Hall effect (THE) has emerged as an essential tool for detecting and studying topological spin textures like magnetic skyrmions in chiral magnets. The THE manifests as a contribution to the Hall resistivity that is neither due to the ordinary Hall effect nor the anomalous Hall effect, and often appears as a characteristic hump or dip in the Hall signal as a function of magnetic field [1, 2]. This distinctive nonmonotonic Hall response has been widely interpreted as a hallmark of skyrmion spin textures, which can impart Berry phase effects on conduction electrons [3]. The THE arises from the interaction of conduction electrons with the non-coplanar spin texture of skyrmions. As an electron moves through a skyrmion, its spin adiabatically follows the local magnetization direction, accumulating a Berry phase. This Berry phase can be described as an emergent magnetic field experienced by the electron, which deflects its motion and gives rise to the THE [4, 5]. The magnitude of the THE is related to the topological charge density of the skyrmion texture. (a) (b) Figure 1: The blue and red circles in panel (a) depict the opposite spin polarization in different domains of the ferromagnetic material.(a) Ferromagnetic Domains. (b) Resistor Network where blue boxes would indicate a resistor with spin down in the system and the red boxes indicating a spin up resistor, The black boxes depict the giant magneto-resistance effect (domain wall resistance). Early observations of THE in bulk B20 compounds like MnSi, MnGe, and FeGe showed a clear hump feature in the Hall resistivity corresponding to the skyrmion lattice phase [1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], which provided strong evidence linking THE to skyrmion formation. Other materials, such as the frustrated triangular-lattice magnet Gd2PdSi3, showed a large THE associated with a field-induced skyrmion phase [11]. However, the situation is more complex in thin film and multilayer systems that have recently attracted interest for their potential to host room-temperature skyrmions[12]. In multilayer films composed of ferromagnetic and heavy metal layers, such as [Ir/Fe/Co/Pt] stacks [13, 14], oxide heterostructures like SrRuO3/SrIrO3 [15] where electric field control of THE has been demonstrated [16], or in (Ca,Ce)MnO3 where a very large THE has been demonstrated [17], the THE features in these systems are often more subtle than in bulk materials. Careful analysis is required to extract the topological contribution from the measured Hall signal by accounting for the ordinary and anomalous Hall effects. Recent works have revealed several important considerations for interpreting THE in multilayer systems. The magnitude of THE does not always scale simply with skyrmion density, and factors like multi-band transport, interfacial effects, and non-adiabatic processes can complicate this relationship [18, 19]. These findings highlight the importance of considering complex spin configurations and magnetic phases beyond isolated skyrmions. Furthermore, The effective Hall coefficient relevant to THE may differ from the ordinary Hall coefficient due to multi-band effects, leading to quantitative discrepancies between observed and predicted THE magnitudes and dimensional crossover effects as the film thickness is varied can dramatically influence skyrmion stability and THE [20]. For example, in Mn-doped Bi2Te3 films, THE was observed only at a critical thickness corresponding to the onset of surface state hybridization [21] as well as the transitions between isolated skyrmions, skyrmion clusters, and labyrinthine stripe domains, plays a crucial role in determining THE behavior . In these interfacial systems, like the work of work by Raju et al.[14] on Ir/Fe/Co/Pt multilayers, THE measurements were complemented by direct magnetic imaging techniques like magnetic force microscopy (MFM), which revealed the presence of skyrmions evolving from labyrinth domains, another work by Wang et al. have used in addition to Hall measurement, the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect microscope, and they have observed in multilayer system of Ta/CoFeB/MgO the transformation of an initial labyrinthine domain patter into dense array of skyrmions [22], with the same behavior observed in Co/Pt nanostructured films [23]. However, not all studies use imaging techniques to confirm the presence of skyrmions, some of them rely only on the hump in the Hall resistivity measurement as a signature of topological spin textures, like in the Heusler alloy Mn2CoAl where the nucleation and annihilation of skyrmions have been interpreted through THE [24]. Kumar et al. used the same THE signals as a signature for the presence of antiskyrmions in another Heusler alloys Mn1.4Pt1-xPdxSn and Mn1.4Pt1-xRhxSn [25]. Another example is found in the thin films of the Heisenberg ferromagnet EuO where they interpreted the peaks in Hall resistivity is suggestive of a 2D topologically nontrivial spin structure even in absence of supporting imaging of this spin textures [26]. The interfacial effects in multilayers, such as the coupling between skyrmions across layers and the formation of hybrid chiral domain walls [27], as well as the interface modification of Berry curvature may lead to the Hall effect peaks and can influence THE in ways not captured by simple models [28]. While THE remains a powerful probe of skyrmion physics, recent studies have raised important caveats about its interpretation. Gerber pointed out that nonmonotonic Hall signals resembling the THE can arise in heterogeneous ferromagnets with competing ordinary and anomalous Hall effects, necessitating careful analysis in interpreting nonmonotonic Hall signals as definitive evidence for topological spin textures [29] and Fijalkowski et al. demonstrated that coexisting magnetic phases in topological insulator heterostructures could produce an AHE-associated response that resembles THE but is not of topological origin [30], and they showed that overlapping AHE signals with opposite signs from surface and bulk magnetic phases could mimic THE-like features. These multiples overlapping AHE signals that mimic THE-like signals could also arise in thin films from thickness variation, defect and interface modification [31], and SrRuO3 thin films are used as a model system to illustrate these issues. Many studies claiming to observe skyrmions in SrRuO3 can be alternatively explained by AHE inhomogeneities[20]. Similarly, Tai et al. developed methods to distinguish genuine THE from artifact ”THE” signals from two-component AHE [32], where they proposed using minor loop measurements, temperature dependence, and gate dependence to differentiate between actual topological signals and AHE artifacts. To address these concerns, Li et al. reported THE in a simplified topological insulator-magnetic insulator bilayer structure of Bi2Se3/BaFe12O19 that excludes the possibility of competing AHE signals [39]. They observed pure THE at low temperatures (2-3 K) and the coexistence of THE and AHE at intermediate temperatures, with opposite temperature dependencies. Their results demonstrate genuine THE in a topological insulator system [34, 35] and highlight the role of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in stabilizing skyrmions. These recent developments underscore the need for careful analysis when interpreting THE signals. Direct imaging of spin textures, systematic exclusion of competing effects, and examination of temperature and field dependences are crucial for establishing the topological origin of observed Hall signatures. The purpose of this work is to prove theoretically that the THE-like signal can be simply induced by anomalous Hall effect of multidomain ferromagnets. The multidomain structure is modeled by a resistor network. We show that the typipcal THE-like nonmonotonic behavior in the hall resistivity can also arise from domain wall scattering in the absence of any topological textures."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07338v1,Topological versus conventional superconductivity in a Weyl semimetal: A microscopic approach,"Starting from a microscopic model for the particle-particle interactions in a Weyl semimetal, we analyzed the possibility for conventional as well as monopole Cooper pairing between quasiparticle excitations at the same (intra-nodal) or opposite (inter-nodal) Weyl nodes. We derived a coupled system of self-consistent BCS-like equations, where the angular dependence of the pairings is directly determined from the microscopic interaction symmetries. We studied the competition between conventional and monopole superconducting phases, thus obtaining explicitly the phase diagrams from the microscopic interaction model parameters. We determined the critical temperatures for both phases, and the low temperature critical behavior, including the specific heat, that we suggest as possible experimental probe for topological quantum criticality in Weyl semimetals.","Topological semimetals are characterized by the presence of nodal points connecting the valence and conduction bands, thus leading to a variety of emerging low-energy quasiparticle excitations [1, 2, 3, 4]. In Weyl semimetals (WSMs), due to the presence of pairs of gapless nodal points with nearly linear dispersion, those quasiparticles are pseudorelativistic Weyl fermions [5, 4], experimentally detected in compounds from the transition metal monopnictide family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs and NbP) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Each Weyl node is a monopolar source of Berry curvature, and hence they are protected from being gapped since their monopole charge \mathcal{C}=\pm 1 (chirality) is a topological invariant [5, 4]. This implies that in Weyl fermions, the projection of spin over their momentum direction is preserved, a condition referred to as “spin-momentum locking”. Some remarkable properties related to the existence of Weyl nodes in the bulk band structure are the presence of Fermi arcs, the chiral anomaly, and the chiral magnetic effect [5, 4]. Therefore, considerable effort has been devoted to the study of the electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of WSMs [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], including the effects of different scattering mechanisms, such as electron–phonon, localized impurities and strain [17]. The unique features of the band structure and its corresponding quasiparticle excitations in WSMs suggest the potential existence of diverse pairing states [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Among them, the monopole superconductor (MSC), recently proposed as a pairing state between the two Fermi surfaces (FSs) enclosing the Weyl points in a doped WSM [21, 22], involves the superposition of the Berry phases of the individual, single-particle states, thus determining the Berry phase of the emerging Cooper pair. Therefore, the resulting chirality, i.e. the vorticity of the pair, will be characterized by the combination of those of the individual Weyl nodes. As it was showed in [21], for spherically symmetric Fermi surfaces, the pairing will be defined by monopole harmonic functions in contrast to the spherical harmonics in usual superconductivity. In order to experimentally detect those non-trivial vorticity effects, magneto-transport measurements can be applied to discriminate chiral versus non-chiral pairing states. This mechanism has been investigated by some of us [23] in the context of the competition between the monopole pairing, characterized by the monopole harmonic functions \mathcal{Y}_{q,j,m}(\theta,\varphi), with conventional spherical harmonic states Y_{j,m}(\theta,\varphi). In this previous work, within a mean-field BCS theory, we showed that the monopole and a conventional spherical harmonic phase may coexist with one another [23], while exclusion of one phase in favor of the other arises when the \theta-dependent form factors of the monopole harmonic \mathcal{Y}_{|q|,j,|m|}(\theta,\varphi) and the spherical harmonic Y_{j,m}(\theta,\varphi) are proportional to each other. We called this mechanism “topological repulsion” [23]. In this work, we expanded the analysis in Ref. [23] by introducing a generic microscopic model for the two-particle interaction potential [20], to self-consistently derive the angular dependence of the BCS order parameters involved in the inter-nodal and intra-nodal pairings leading to the MSC and conventional spherical harmonic (SHSC) superconducting phases, respectively. From this more detailed, microscopic perspective, we revisited the phase diagram predicted by a BCS mean-field theory [23], thus determining the corresponding critical temperatures for the MSC and SHSC in terms of the microscopic interaction potential parameters and its underlying symmetries. We calculated explicitly the specific heat, and showed how the temperature behavior of this material dependent thermal property can provide a signature of the presence of such phases, as well as a direct experimental probe for their critical temperatures. We also investigated the competition between those phases, particularly concerning the topological repulsion mechanism suggested in our previous work [23]. In contrast with this previous work, where disorder effects were included as an asymmetry in the nodal chemical potentials, here we assume a uniform chemical potential. Finally, we provide some explicit examples for different angular dependence’s of the pairing, as inherited by the underlying microscopic interaction potential symmetries."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07226v1,Subleading logarithmic behavior in the parquet formalism,"The Fermi-edge singularity in x-ray absorption spectra of metals is a paradigmatic case of a logarithmically divergent perturbation series. Prior work has thoroughly analyzed the leading logarithmic terms. Here, we investigate the perturbation theory beyond leading logarithms and formulate self-consistent equations to incorporate all leading and next-to-leading logarithmic terms. This parquet solution of the Fermi-edge singularity goes beyond the previous first-order parquet solution and sheds new light on the parquet formalism regarding logarithmic behavior. We present numerical results in the Matsubara formalism and discuss the characteristic power laws. We also show that, within the single-boson exchange framework, multi-boson exchange diagrams are needed already at the leading logarithmic level.","Perturbative expansions are ubiquitous in theoretical physics, and logarithmic divergences therein often lead to power laws in observables. In the 1960s, several works developed self-consistent methods to sum up the leading logarithmic terms from Feynman diagrams of all orders. Among other systems, these techniques were successfully applied to meson scattering [1], the Kondo model [2], the one-dimensional interacting Fermi gas [3, 4], and the Fermi-edge singularity in x-ray absorption in metals [5, 6]. Following Ref. [5], we refer to them as the first-order parquet approach. Presently, the Hubbard model is one of the most studied many-body problems of condensed matter physics [7]. To capture the interplay of its competing fluctuations, another type of self-consistent summation of diagrams was developed, which we here call full parquet approach. It involves the self-energy and the effective interactions in all three channels of two-particle reducibility [8, 9, 10, 11]. As the perturbative series of the Hubbard model does not exhibit logarithmic divergences, such a treatment was not motivated by logarithmic terms, but by the fulfillment of crossing symmetry and self-consistency on the one- and two-particle level [11, 12]. With increasing computational power, the numerical solution of the parquet equations has nowadays become a viable tool [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. In this work, we examine what the transition from the first-order to the full parquet approach entails for logarithmically divergent problems. To this end, we revisit the Fermi-edge singularity, which was recently revived as an inspiring workhorse to better understand diagrammatic techniques [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Although it can be solved in a one-particle scheme [25, 26], a precise analysis in perturbation theory remains challenging. It was shown that the leading logarithmic behavior can be obtained using the one-loop functional renormalization group [23, 24], while the full summation of all parquet diagrams is only recovered in a multi-loop expansion [22, 27, 28]. Remarkably, we find that a well-defined subset of diagrams from the full parquet solution offers a convenient way to not only capture the leading logarithmic singularity but also the next-to-leading contributions. Hence, we close the gap between the traditional summation of leading logarithms (first-order parquet) and the one- and two-particle self-consistent summation (full parquet), giving new insights into the structure of logarithmically divergent perturbation theories. We demonstrate that the power-law exponent of the particle-hole susceptibility is obtained to more-than-linear order in the interaction. This is possible (despite the concerns of Ref. [6]) as the numerical results include the full dependence of individual diagrams beyond logarithmic accuracy. Moreover, we briefly explain that the self-energy diagrams needed to capture Anderson’s orthogonality catastrophe [29] go beyond the present approach. Treating the full frequency dependence of the effective interaction requires huge numerical effort. In recent years, there were several attempts to make use of frequency asymptotics to lower the numerical costs [30]. One of them is the decomposition of the full interaction vertex into bosonic exchange processes, the so-called single-boson exchange [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41] as well as the remaining and numerically most expensive multi-boson exchange terms. We show that multi-boson exchange terms are essential already at the leading logarithmic level; neglecting them is thus not justified in the present case. The rest of our paper is organized as follows. Section II serves as a reminder of the model and the diagrammatic approach. In Sec. III, we discuss the lowest terms in perturbation theory. In Sec. IV, we explain our self-consistent summation scheme and show the corresponding numerical results. We conclude in Sec. V."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07201v1,Fractionalized superconductivity from Majorana glue in the Kitaev–Kondo lattice,"Superconductivity usually emerges from a metallic normal state which follows the Fermi-liquid paradigm. If, in contrast, the normal state is a fractionalized non-Fermi liquid, then pairing may either eliminate fractionalization via a Higgs-type mechanism leading to a conventional superconducting state, or pairing can occur in the presence of fractionalization. Here we discuss a simple model for the latter case: Using a combination of perturbation theory and functional renormalization group, we show that the Kitaev–Kondo lattice model displays a fractionalized superconducting phase at weak Kondo coupling. This phase is characterized by Cooper pairing of conventional electronic quasiparticles, coexisting with a spin-liquid background and topological order. Depending on the sign of the Kitaev coupling, we find the pairing to be either of chiral d-wave or p-wave type for extended doping regions around the van-Hove filling. We discuss applications and extensions.","Transition to conventional superconductivity.— Given the results of Refs. 17, 18, the SC∗ phase established in this paper will transit into a non-fractionalized superconducting phase upon increasing J_{\rm K}. The T=0 SC∗–SC transition is a confinement transition; it can be either of first order or continuous. In the latter case, the simplest theory is that of the condensation of a bosonic field corresponding to Kondo screening [3, 4]. Given the \mathbb{Z}_{2} nature of the spin liquid’s gauge field, this quantum phase transition is of Ising type [15]. Since the normal-state Fermi surface reconstructs at the parent FL∗–FL transition, the fermiology of the two superconducting states (Chern numbers etc.) can be expected to be different. Interestingly, the \mathbb{Z}_{2} confinement transition is only well defined at T=0 in two space dimensions, such that the continuous SC∗–SC transition becomes a crossover between two quasi-long-range-ordered states at finite T. A more detailed study of this transition is left for future work; some of its signatures have been considered in Ref. 15. Summary.— We have shown that the Kitaev–Kondo lattice admits a fractionalized superconducting phase SC∗, where BCS-type superconductivity of conduction electrons coexists with a spin-liquid background and an emergent gauge structure. This phase is separated from a more conventional (heavy-fermion) superconductor by a confinement transition driven by Kondo screening (or the breakdown thereof); this transition is hence the superconducting version of the FL∗–FL transition discussed in the context of Kondo-breakdown quantum criticality. The pairing of SC∗ is driven by the magnetic excitations of the Kitaev spin liquid, i.e., by Majorana glue. Our FRG analysis has revealed the pairing symmetry to be topologically non-trivial and of chiral spin-singlet (chiral spin-triplet) type for AFM (FM) Kitaev interactions, for band fillings away from but near van-Hove filling. Our arguments for an SC∗ phase straightforwardly extend to other Kitaev spin liquids; in three-dimensional systems [44] where true superconductivity exists at finite T the \mathbb{Z}_{2} confinement transition can be expected to persist at finite T as well. More broadly, we have established a new pairing mechanism – the fluctuations of a fractionalized spin liquid – leading to topological superconductivity. Future theory work should establish such pairing beyond the perturbative limit. Experimentally, studying hetero-systems comprised of frustrated local moments and conduction electrons appears most promising to identify the phases proposed here. Note added.— While completing this work, we became aware of Ref. 45 which also studies the emergence of weak-coupling superconductivity in the FM Kitaev–Kondo lattice. Their results are broadly consistent with ours, however, they only consider small dopings near half filling, related to the phase we find at fillings below the van-Hove singularity, with Chern number 2 instead of 4. A very different type of fractionalized superconductor appears in Ref. 46: This has fractional charges and spinor order, but no deconfined gauge field. Acknowledgements.We would like to thank L.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07174v1,"Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings","We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry \mathcal{T}. Different from the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.","In the past few decades, tremendous progress has been made in the study of zero-temperature topological phases[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], which are ground states of local Hamiltonians in closed quantum systems. The huge success of classifying and characterizing pure quantum states and phase transitions between them has motivated recent investigations into the topological properties of mixed states in open quantum systems[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], which has become a flourishing research area in the past few years. In zero-temperature topological phases, the interplay of symmetry and topology in the space of gapped local Hamiltonians gives rise to a rich structure of symmetry protected topological phases[27, 28, 29, 7] and symmetry enriched topological orders[30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. In the case of open quantum systems, it turns out that symmetries in mixed states have a more complicated structure than in pure states, as they can be grouped into weak and strong symmetries[13, 14, 22, 20]. While strong symmetries in mixed states analogous to symmetries in pure states, implying the conservation of symmetry quantum numbers in the whole ensemble of the mixed state, weak symmetries in mixed states has no counterparts in pure states. It has been demonstrated that the presence of both strong and weak symmetries can lead to new mixed state phenomena, which are believed to not exist in pure states[14, 16, 22, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25]. Many recent efforts have been devoted to the theoretical classification of mixed states with symmetries and associated phase transitions[13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Since a large amount of knowledge has been accumulated in the past few decades on many-body pure state phenomena, on how to realize them and to detect them in condensed matters, one natural question is, is it possible to realize various mixed state phenomena with strong and weak symmetries in a pure state of condensed matters? In this work, we provide a positive answer to this question, by introducing a bilayer construction as a specific purification of a mixed state. The bilayer construction makes use of a one-to-one correspondence between a mixed state (in its diagonal basis) \displaystyle\rho=\sum_{j,k}\rho_{j,k}|e_{j}\rangle\langle e_{k}|,~{}~{}~{}% \rho=\rho^{\dagger}\geq 0,~{}\text{Tr}~{}\rho=1. (1) where \{|e_{k}\rangle\} is a complete orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space \mathcal{H}, and a “non-negative”[16] pure state in a bilayer construction consisting of “system layer” A and “environment layer” B with a doubled Hilbert space \mathcal{H}_{A}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{B}: \displaystyle|\psi\rangle=\sum_{j,k}\big{(}\sqrt{\rho}\big{)}_{j,k}|e_{j},A% \rangle\otimes|e_{k},B\rangle (2) constrained by an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry \mathcal{T}: \displaystyle\mathcal{T}|e_{k},A\rangle=|e_{k},B\rangle,~{}~{}\mathcal{T}|e_{k% },B\rangle=|e_{k},A\rangle,~{}~{}\forall~{}k. (3) Note that the wavefunction \psi_{j,k} in the orthonormal basis |e_{j},A\rangle\otimes|e_{k},B\rangle must be non-negative (\psi=\sqrt{\rho}\geq 0 ) in order for the one-to-one correspondence between pure state |\psi\rangle and mixed state \rho. As a specific \mathcal{T}-preserving purification scheme for mixed state \rho, the above bilayer state |\psi\rangle is different from the Choi state \displaystyle|\psi_{\text{Choi}}\rangle=\sum_{j,k}\rho_{j,k}|e_{j},A\rangle% \otimes|e_{k},B\rangle from Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism between operator \rho and state |\psi_{\text{Choi}}\rangle. Although the bilayer state |\psi\rangle and Choi state |\psi_{\text{Choi}}\rangle are similar in terms of symmetry (including strong, weak and \mathcal{T} symmetries as we will clarify in section III.1) and non-negativity, the bilayer purification |\psi\rangle have two unique advantages over the Choi state: (1) Since mixed state \rho is nothing but the reduced density matrix of layer A in bilayer pure state |\psi\rangle \displaystyle\rho_{A}=\text{Tr}~{}_{B}\big{(}|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\big{)}] (4) any physical property of mixed state \rho can be realized and experimentally detected as a property of layer A in the bilayer pure state |\psi\rangle. (2) The anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry \mathcal{T}, crucial for the one-to-one correspondence between mixed state \rho and bilayer pure state |\psi\rangle (as we will clarify in section II), can be realized as the combination of time-reversal and layer-exchange mirror reflection operations. Experimentally, such a symmetry can be generally implemented in two-dimensional (2D) bilayer materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry, even in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. This provides a route to realize and to observe 2D mixed state phenomena as pure state phenomena in 2D quantum materials. In this work, we lay out the framework of bilayer construction for mixed states with strong and weak symmetries, and apply the framework to understand mixed state phenomena such as strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking[22, 20, 35] and decoherence of topological orders by local errors[36, 17, 18, 19, 37, 38, 39]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After introducing the bilayer construction for mixed state in section II, we discuss how to describe strong and weak symmetries in the bilayer construction in section III.1, and derive the criteria (see Table 1) for spontaneous and explicit symmetry breakings in mixed states using the correspondence to symmetry breakings in bilayer pure state in section III.2. Our criteria summarized in Table 1 is equivalent to those proposed by Ref.[22] in terms of fidelity correlator[40, 41]. We also use the bilayer framework to discuss the failure of Renyi-2 correlator[22, 20] in describing strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in section III.3. Next, we investigate two examples of SWSSB in mixed states, which are realized as usual spontaneous symmetry breakings (SSBs) in the bilayer construction: section IV.1 studies SWSSB for discrete Z_{2} symmetry in a two-leg Ising ladder, whose critical scalings of vairous correlators are studied in section IV.1.2; section IV.2 studies SWSSB for continuous U(1) symmetry as the formation of interlayer superconductivity in the bilayer construction. In section V we further discuss various mixed state phenomena can be realized in the bilayer construction: in section V.1 we show the decoherence of topological orders by local quantum channels[36, 17, 18, 19, 37, 38, 39] can be realized as quantum quench dynamics[42] of the bialyer pure state, and in section V.2 we show how symmetry protected topological mixed states and mixed state topologial orders can be constructed from their pure state counterparts in the bilayer construction. Finally we conclude in section VI with a summary and outlook for future directions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07144v1,Autoregressive neural quantum states of Fermi Hubbard models,"Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful ansatz for variational quantum Monte Carlo studies of strongly-correlated systems. Here, we apply recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and autoregressive transformer neural networks to the Fermi-Hubbard and the (non-Hermitian) Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. In both cases, we observe that the convergence of the RNN ansatz is challenged when increasing the interaction strength. We present a physically-motivated and easy-to-implement strategy for improving the optimization, namely, by ramping of the model parameters. Furthermore, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the autoregressive sampling property of both network architectures. For the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model, we identify convergence issues that stem from the autoregressive sampling scheme in combination with the non-Hermitian nature of the model. Our findings provide insights into the challenges of the NQS approach and make the first step towards exploring strongly-correlated electrons using this ansatz.","The Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) describes itinerant, interacting spin-1/2 electrons hopping on a set of spatially localized orbitals. Despite its simplicity, it is paradigmatic for our understanding of electronic correlations in quantum materials in which strong Coulomb interactions play an essential role. Its importance lies in the fact that it accurately captures some of the key characteristics of strongly correlated materials. Numerous phases this model can display have striking similarities to the behaviors observed in a wide range of complex materials [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In recent years, neural network quantum states (NQS) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] have emerged as promising ansatz for variational wave functions. There are several remarkable aspects that make NQS attractive for use in the field of quantum many-body physics. First is the ability of the NQS to capture a wide array of quantum states important to the study of quantum many-body systems [13, 14]. It has been shown that they can encode volume law entangled states [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. The second feature is related to the scaling of computational resources with the system size. The optimization and evaluation of observables in NQS relies on sampling, typically using a Metropolis sampling algorithm, which can become computationally very demanding. Here, we show that autoregressive networks, with normalized wave function amplitudes that allow direct sampling instead of Metropolis sampling, can be very efficient for correlated electron systems. The autoregressive property refers to the use of a chain rule of probabilities to generate a sequence of data elements in which the probability of every element in the sequence depends only on the configuration of the set of elements that came before it. The scaling of the method with the system size can lead to a potentially huge advantage over conventional numerical treatment, such as the exact diagonalization (ED), density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), or quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) [22, 23, 24, 25], which suffer from either exponential scaling or other technical issues arising due to the fermion ‘sign problem’ [26, 27, 28]. Two prominent examples for autoregressive networks are recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [29] and transformer neural networks [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35] (although non-autoregressive versions of transformers are possible, see e.g. [36, 37]). RNNs were initially developed for natural language processing and are generative, i.e., they can be trained to infer the probability distribution of unlabeled data, which can then be used to generate more data. The final joint distribution of configurations in an RNN, P(\sigma), where \sigma represents a configuration in a complete set, is normalized. This is a powerful property; not only can one sample from a trained RNN, but also given a new configuration, the trained RNN can return the associated normalized probability. The same property can be enforced for a transformer neural network by masking out future inputs to the attention mechanism, see e.g. Refs. [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. In a pioneering work [29], Hibat-Allah et. al. showed that ground states of spin models can accurately be represented using a wave function based on an RNN with two output layers for amplitude and phase of the wave function. Namely, samples are drawn from the generative model, the energy is computed and averaged over many samples, and minimized with respect to the parameters of the RNN using the stochastic gradient descent. Weights and biases inside a shared RNN unit are among the quantities that form the optimization parameters. Since then, there have been several notable studies exploring aspects of the use of RNNs in quantum many-body physics, spanning representability, accuracy, performance [38, 39, 40, 41, 42], including through the use of symmetries of the Hamiltonian [43] or more advanced autoregressive architectures such as transformers [44, 32, 33, 34]. Neural network wavefunctions have also been used recently to study itinerant electron models at half-filling and beyond [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 41, 57]. In Ref. [41], the authors use RNNs to represent the ground state of the t-J, t-{XXZ}, and t-{J_{z}} models in one and two spatial dimensions. They present a novel technique for mapping out the dispersion relation of the single hole, complementary to other schemes [58, 59, 60], and show that their results compare well with DMRG. This is accomplished through computing the expectation values of the translation operator for periodic systems. However, they establish that the ground state uncertainties for these models are generally much larger than those for spin models studied previously. Here, we utilize RNNs as a variational ansatz to access the ground state of the FHM. We find that, as expected, a naive application of the technique results in accuracies that are less accurate than in the case of the t-J model. We then introduce a ramping mechanism, in which certain model parameters are gradually tuned from the initial values to the desired final values during the training process, and show that the scheme leads to orders of magnitude improvements in the ground state energy and other observables (this is also known as variational neural annealing [61]). We benchmark our results for the method applied to the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) FHM at half filling and find that the accuracy of ground state properties is generally independent of the system size for the same number of training steps, confirming that the computational resources will indeed grow linearly with system size. We then use the method to study a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in which the tunneling rates to the left and right are unequal [the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model (HNHM)], and discuss the limitations of current RNN architectures for such problems. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present the Fermi-Hubbard model, the observables computed, the details of the RNNs, and the training schemes used. In Sec. III we present our main findings, first for the 1D FHM, second for the 2D FHM, and third for the 1D HNHM. Section IV summarizes our findings and presents an outlook for future studies."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07119v1,The two-dimensional Rashba-Holstein model,"In this work, we investigate the impact of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) on the formation of charge-density wave (CDW) and superconducting (SC) phases in the Holstein model on a half-filled square lattice. Using unbiased finite-temperature Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we go beyond mean-field approaches to determine the ground state order parameter as a function of RSOC and phonon frequency. Our results reveal that the Rashba metal is unstable due to particle-hole instabilities, favoring the emergence of a CDW phase for any RSOC value. In the limit of a pure Rashba hopping, the model exhibits a distinct behavior with the appearance of four Weyl cones at half-filling, where quantum phase transitions are expected to occur at strong interactions. Indeed, a quantum phase transition, belonging to the Gross-Neveu Ising universality class between a semi-metal and CDW emerges at finite phonon frequency dependent coupling \lambda_{c}. In the antiadiabatic limit we observe an enhance symmetry in the IR that unifies SC and CDW orders. These results advance our understanding of competing CDW and SC phases in systems with spin-orbit coupling, providing insights that may help clarify the behavior of related materials.","The interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) remains an open issue in condensed matter physics. Even for the single-excitation case, the leading effects of the competition between the energy gained from coupling with phonons (and its quasiparticle formation) and the electronic dispersion from the SOC are subtle, with the effective polaron+ mass depending on both EPC and SOC Cappelluti et al. (2007); Covaci and Berciu (2009); Li et al. (2010, 2011). This delicate balance could have direct implications for the development of novel devices, particularly in the field of spintronics Žutić et al. (2004). The degree of complexity is quite increased in the many-electron case, due to the inclusion of electronic correlations. As strong electron-electron interactions introduce many-body effects that may lead to long-range ordered phases, the SOC changes the Hamiltonian’s symmetries and, consequently, the electrons’ dynamics. This fundamental change could lead to unpredictable physical responses or new phases of matter Pesin and Balents (2010). Some iridates or pyrochlores materials are prototypes for such interplay, as they are Mott insulators and also exhibit strong SOC effects. Indeed, these compounds show a myriad of phases, from Weyl semimetals and topological insulators, to spin liquid phases Witczak-Krempa et al. (2014); Rau et al. (2016). However, while the interplay between SOC and direct (Coulomb) electron-electron has been vastly scrutinized in the literature Riera (2013); Laubach et al. (2014); Sun et al. (2017); Kennedy et al. (2022); Kawano and Hotta (2023); Beyer et al. (2023); Gastiasoro et al. (2023); Beyer et al. (2023), the leading effects of SOC on indirect interactions, such as the EPC, and vice versa, are much less clear. This interplay can be explored in some transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as 2H-TaSe2 and 2H-TaS2, which exhibit significant EPC and SOC effects Liu et al. (2016); Manzeli et al. (2017); Zhang et al. (2024a). In the former, both in bulk and single-layer forms, the charge-density wave (CDW) phase in the ground state appears to be barely affected by SOC, with the wavevector of this phase remaining almost unchanged, whether SOC is present or not Ge and Liu (2012). In contrast, in 2H-TaS2, SOC has a pronounced impact on the EPC strength, suppressing EPC matrix elements. This suppression of EPC by SOC is essential for accurately explaining the superconducting critical temperatures observed in this material Lian et al. (2022). Another interesting example is the Pb crystal, which is a conventional (strong coupling) superconductor. For this material, the EPC strength, calculated from Eliashberg functions, is drastically affected by the inclusion of SOC, which is essential to replicate the experimentally observed superconducting (SC) properties Heid et al. (2010). Finally, the interplay between charge order and SOC remains a subject of ongoing debate even for 1D systems, such as in atomic wire arrays on semiconductor surfaces Snijders and Weitering (2010), or in the quasi-1D material (TaSe4)2I. The latter, in particular, is considered as a Weyl semimetal Shi et al. (2021), exhibiting Rashba-like band splittings, but also undergoes a CDW phase transition at T_{\rm CDW}=263 K Zhang et al. (2020). From a theoretical perspective, the Holstein model captures the essential features of systems where EPC plays a central role Holstein (1959). This model describes local (dispersionless) harmonic oscillators at each site of the lattice, which couple locally to the electronic density, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). The Holstein model has been extensively studied in the literature, exhibiting a competition between CDW and SC phases that depends on finely tuned external parameters or the lattice geometry Li et al. (2015); Costa et al. (2018); Dee et al. (2019); Zhang et al. (2019); Chen et al. (2019); Cohen-Stead et al. (2019); Dee et al. (2020); Bradley et al. (2021); Xiao et al. (2021); Costa et al. (2021); Araújo et al. (2022); Weber and Freericks (2022); Sousa-Júnior et al. (2023). However, to the best of our knowledge, the many-body problem of interacting electron-phonon coupled electrons in the presence of SOC has only recently been explored, particularly within the context of the Holstein Hamiltonian. Indeed, Ref. Fontenele et al., 2024 investigates the impact of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) on the stability of the CDW phase within a mean-field approximation, while Ref. Zhang et al., 2024b employs an unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approach to explore the emergence of an induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) when the EPC is spin-dependent, both in the half-filled square lattice. The antiadiabatic limit has also been analyzed in Refs. Tang et al., 2014; Rosenberg et al., 2017; Song et al., 2024 using QMC methods, as further discussed below.

To this end, we employ unbiased finite-temperature QMC methods Blankenbecler et al. (1981); Hirsch (1983, 1985); Scalettar et al. (1989), examining the charge and pairing correlations of the two-dimensional Rashba-Holstein model at the half-filling of the square lattice. As our main result, we provide finite temperature and ground state phase diagrams.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06820v1,Re-entrant topological order in strongly correlated nanowire due to Rashba spin-orbit coupling,"The effect of the Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC) on the topological properties of the one-dimensional (1D) extended s-wave superconducting Hamiltonian, in the presence of strong electron-electron correlation, is investigated. It is found that a non-zero RSOC increases the periodicity of the effective Hamiltonian, which results in the folding of the Brillouin zone (BZ), and consequently in the emergence of an energy gap at the boundary of the BZ. If the chemical potential is inside the energy gap and it does not perceive the two-band structure of the resulting energy spectrum the topological phase is removed from the phase diagram.In contrast, if we move the chemical potential upwards towards the highest occupied band the opposite happens and the non-trivial topology is restored. This is the origin of re-entrant nature of the existent topological properties. This property of the system allows us to drive the system in and out of the topological phase only by the proper tuning of the chemical potential. A heterostructure involving van der Waals materials and a 1D Moire pattern for an investigation of the predicted effect has also been proposed and discussed in our work.","(a) (b) Figure 1: (a) The schematics of the energy dispersion of the non-interacting electrons in a 1D chain with (right) and without (left) a three fold periodicity of the lattice. The three fold periodicity results in the folding of the energy dispersion three times and, consequently, in the emergence of the energy gap at the BZ boundaries. If the chemical potential lies within this gap and no other band is involved no topological phase is present. On the right hand side diagram, the tuning of the chemical potential from the lower to the higher band will result in the re-entrant topological order. However, this is absent on the left hand side diagram, as there is no energy gap. (b) Schematics of the proposed heterostructure involving (quasi-)1D Moire lattice for detection of the re-entrant topological phase in strongly correlated system (discussed in Sec. VII). The prediction of spatially separated Majorana fermions (MF) in a 1D topological superconductor (TSC) [1] has marked the paradigm shift in the research for the realization of quantum computers [2]. Several experimental platforms have been proposed to realize MF [3, 4]; among them heterostructures of a semiconducting nanowire (NW) on top of a s-wave SC have got a special attention, mainly due to the ease of synthesis and widespread availability of the constituent materials [5]. Three ingredients are necessary for such NW/SC heterostructures: (i) the RSOC (\alpha), (ii) an external magnetic field (B_{z}), (iii) the proximity induced s-wave superconducting (SC) order parameter (\Delta). The RSOC shifts the momentum parabola sideways locking the electron spin with momentum (k), B_{z} opens a gap at k=0, and \Delta opens a gap at opposite Fermi points. Experimental efforts involving NW/SC have been partially fruitful and are still ongoing [6, 4, 7]. Some of the major concerns regarding NW/SC heterostructures are as follows. The critical field (H_{c2}) and the critical temperature (T_{c}) of the usual s-wave SC are small. Low H_{c2} requires a large Lande g factor in a nanowire so that a large enough gap can be opened at k=0 under such lower magnetic field B_{z}<H_{c2}. A large \alpha in NW is desirable as it allows for stronger spin and momentum locking. From the design point of view, the presence of a magnetic field in electronic circuits is far from ideal, as stray fields hamper the miniaturization of the circuit. The interface between the NW and the SC should be both of high quality (allowing for a higher proximity induced SC gap) and smooth (to suppress disorder induced scattering which is detrimental for p-wave SC). Although, the latter concerns are of a more applied nature, however, the former (i.e., the large \alpha, g) is more of fundamental. Hence, the question arises, whether the requirements for having both RSOC and magnetic field can be completely avoided? A number of alternative platforms have been proposed which don’t require neither RSOC nor magnetic field. Some of them are associated with atop of a magnetic atomic chain on a SC [8], topological insulator/magnetic insulator/SC heterostructure [9], monolayers of WTe2 [10], van der Waals (vdW) materials [11, 12, 13]. Another interesting proposal is to use strong electron-electron (e-e) correlation, in place of a magnetic field, to access the topological SC phase [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Using DMRG it was found that strong e-e correlation favors the formation of the MF even without magnetic field [14, 15]. This favorable scenario can be easily understood in the context of a 1D chain with a single valence electron at every atomic site. Under a magnetic field the spin of every electron is frozen along the direction of the applied field. This results in every atomic site containing at most a single electron, the so called ""no double occupancy"" (NDO) condition. The NDO scenario can also appear due to strong e-e correlation, as the energy penalty for placing one more electron at an already occupied atomic site will be too high for that to take place; of course there is a caveat: the spin is not automatically frozen along a single direction in this case. One way to solve this problem is to invoke the so-so called ""spin-charge separation"" method [19]. Due to the strong e-e interaction the electron-hole excitations delocalize the electron until it becomes totally incoherent. As a result, at low energy, for this strong coupling regime, only separate non interacting collective spin (spinon) and charge (holon) excitations remains. Although e-e correlation is an intrinsic property of the material, but several recent proposals have been put forward to control it extrinsically [20, 21, 22]. With these considerations, in this article we investigate the Hamiltonian of a (quasi-)1D topological SC system in the presence of strong e-e correlation. The SC order parameter is of extended s-wave; proximity induced due to iron based SC. The reason for choosing iron-based SC is because they have higher T_{c}, H_{c2} and superconducting gap [23]. In the Hamiltonian we also included RSOC and magnetic field to understand their affect on the topological properties; although, the overall goal is to get rid of them. To solve the Hamiltonian we use spin-charge separation and su(2|1) path integral method [[][;seeforreviewofthemehod], 24]. This method has been applied to several other systems [25, 26, 27, 28, 18, 29]. The main results of this work is as follows. (i) For non-zero RSOC the system can enter into the topological phase multiple times when the parameters are appropriately tuned (see Fig. 2). This happens due to the folding of the Brillouin zone (BZ), which takes place because of the quasi-periodicity induced by the non-zero RSOC as shown schematically in Fig. 1a. The same property was also observed in Ref. [13] due to Moire potential. (ii) The effective Hamiltonian, Eq. (11), contains the dynamical parameter \theta, which is a function of spinon degree of freedom — they are related through Eq. (9) and Eq. (6). For system to be in topological phase the two conditions should be satisfied, firstly the value of \theta should be 0<\theta<\pi, secondly the \mathbb{Z}_{2} invariant should be Q=-1. From free energy calculation (Fig. 6) we find that both these conditions can be satisfied in some defined range of chemical potential. Therefore only the chemical potential can be used as the tuning parameter to drive the system into and out of the topological phase. It is useful for the design of the devices where chemical potential can be controlled efficiently through gate voltage. (iii) We propose heterostructure involving vdW materials for experimental realization of the effect; a schematic diagram of the same is shown in Fig. 1b. We discuss about this heterostructure thoroughly in Sec. VII."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06671v1,"Entangled orbital, spin, and ferroelectric orders in p-electron magnet CsO","Alkali superoxides differ from conventional transition metal magnets, exhibit magnetism from partially occupied oxygen molecular \pi^{*}-orbitals. Among them, CsO2 stands out for its potential to exhibit novel quantum collective phenomena, such as an orbital order induced Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state. Using ab-initio Hubbard models, superexchange theory, and experimental spin wave measurements, we propose that CsO2 exhibits unconventional magnetoelectric characteristics at low temperature. Our analysis confirms a canted antiferromagnetic ground state and a spin-flop transition, with ferroelectricity is induced by breaking inversion and time-reversal symmetry in the spin-flop phase. Consequently, our analysis reveals a strong interplay not only between exchange interactions but also among magnetically-induced polarization and orbital order. The magnetic structure, stabilized by orbital order, induces magnetically-induced polarization through an antisymmetric mechanism. Overall, our results reveal the coexistence of three highly entangled orders in CsO2, namely, orbital, spin and ferroelectricity.",".1 Results Spin Hamiltonian and magnetic ground state. The resulting spin interactions (AFM in red and FM in green) are illustrated in Fig. 1c and the exchange parameters are summarized in Table 1, respectively. The strongest exchange interaction, J_{A1}, is AFM, and is periodically repeated along the c-axis in a zigzag manner. The alternation of antiferromagnetic (J_{ij}>0) and ferromagnetic (J_{ij}<0), exchange interactions is tied to the hole orbital order: the parallel hole orbital (ferro-orbital, FO) bonds enhance antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, while the anti-parallel hole orbital (antiferro-orbital, AFO) bonds enhance ferromagnetic exchange interaction (see Fig. 1c). This represents the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson (GKA) rules for the exchange interactions [22]. The bonds shown in Fig. 1c can be categorized into two types by their symmetry. The first type is the centrosymmetric bonds (A1 and A3), where only the symmetric exchange components, the first and last terms in (5), are non-zero. In the simplest single-orbital case, the exchange interaction would be further restricted to be isotropic [20]. In these bonds, the symmetric anisotropic interaction is characterized by a parameter \Gamma_{ij}^{||}, and the symmetric anisotropic tensor is restricted to \Gamma_{ij}^{||}(S_{i}^{x}S_{j}^{x}+S_{i}^{y}S_{j}^{y})-2\Gamma_{ij}^{||}S_{i}% ^{z}S_{j}^{z}. The second type is the bonds that are connected by a two-fold rotation around the crystal c-axis. For these bonds, the DM vector is restricted to the c-direction. Moreover, the bond 1-3 (see Fig. 1b) is transformed into the bond 4-2 by spatial inversion. Therefore, \mathbf{D}_{1,3}=-\mathbf{D}_{2,4}=(0,0,dz_{F2}), and both \mathbf{D}_{1,3} and \mathbf{D}_{2,4} are defined by a common parameter dz_{F2}. The symmetric anisotropic tensor for these bonds has the same form as for the centrosymmetric bonds. Minimization of the full spin Hamiltonian (5) results in a single cell-periodic canted AFM structure, depicted in Fig. 1d. The spins lie within the crystallographic \mathbf{ab}-plane, which is principally due to the DM vectors oriented along the c-axis. The obtained spin structure agrees well with the experimental ground state [13]. The calculated transition temperature is approximately 8 K (Supplementary Fig. 2), also in a good agreement with the experimental value 10 K [13]. Table 1: Values of exchange parameters for each bond [meV] \alpha:(i,j,\mathbf{R}_{j}-\mathbf{R}_{i}) J_{\alpha} dz_{\alpha} \Gamma_{\alpha}^{||} A1: \left(2,3\right) 3.067 0.499 A2: \left(1,1,\mathbf{b}\right) 0.653 0.081 -0.002 A3: \left(3,2,\mathbf{b}\right) 0.265 0.487 F1: \left(3,4\right) -1.548 -0.111 -0.235 F2: \left(1,3\right) -0.209 -0.344 -0.255 Figure 2: Experimental and simulated inelastic neutron scattering intensity in CsO2. a, Inelastic neutron scattering data collected at a temperature of 1.6 K, in the magnetically ordered phase. The neutron cross-section is indicated by the color map, and is shown as a function of |Q| (modulus of scattering wavevector) and excitation energy. b, Simulated inelastic neutron scattering intensity for the same range in momentum and energy as shown in a, using the model parameters from Table 1. Inelastic neutron scattering results. To understand the microscopic behavior of the magnetism at low temperature in CsO2 and verify our theoretical model, we performed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum. Fig. 2a shows the INS data, i.e. S(\mathbf{Q},\omega), collected well into the ground state canted AFM phase, at a temperature of 1.6 K, as a function of wavevector and energy. The intense and highly structured signal below \sim 7 meV at lower |Q| arises from spin-wave-like excitations, since they appear to follow the expected magnetic form factor. The intense band of scattering below 0.5 meV corresponds to incoherent elastic scattering, broadened by the instrumental resolution. The sharp dispersive mode centered on the elastic line at |Q|=2 Å-1 corresponds to an acoustic phonon originating at the strong nuclear Bragg peak (1,1,0) and can be disregarded. The magnetic excitations visible in the INS data may be analysed using linear spin wave theory (LSWT), using the exchange interactions described in Table 1. Doing so, the colormap shown in Fig. 2b is produced. Although this does not reproduce the measured signal shown in Fig. 2a especially well, it does capture some of the important features. In particular, it includes a branch of excitations that appear to disperse upwards from |Q|=0. It also reproduces quite well the series of hot spots in intensity along the |Q|–axis with an energy of \sim 2.5 meV. Furthermore, the overall bandwidth of the excitations is \sim 8 meV, which is close to the measured one of \sim 7 meV. Together, this therefore indicates that this set of parameters could serve as a good starting point for fitting the measured neutron spectra, with the expectation that the signs and relative magnitudes of the various terms may not need to change much to yield good agreement. This consistency between LSWT results based on our model, and the INS data, comprises clear experimental verification of the calculated orbital order and exchange interactions in CsO2. A more detailed, but ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to fit the data using this spin wave model is provided in the Supplementary Information. Figure 3: Magnetic ground state, and magnetic and ferroelectric behavior of CsO2 under an external magnetic field. a, Magnetization and polarization (P_{a}) changes under an external magnetic field along the crystalline b-axis, simulated using the model parameters in Table 1 and Table 2. Polarization along other directions, not shown here, remains zero during this process. In the polarization plot, contributions from the isotropic and the antisymmetric mechanisms are shown by solid blue line and dashed black line, respectively. The insets show zoomed plots around the transition field. b, Spin structure evolution under an external magnetic field. The magnetically-induced polarization direction is indicated by a red arrow. In a finite external magnetic field, the polarization keeps the same direction while modulating its magnitude. Magnetically-induced polarization. Although the canted AFM ground state preserves the I\timesT (I=inversion, T=time reversal) symmetry, experiments [23, 13] have suggested the possibility of a spin-flop transition induced by an external magnetic field along the \mathbf{b}-axis. During this process, the I\timesT symmetry can be broken, potentially inducing a finite electric polarization. The tensors characterizing magnetically-induced polarization (6) have several non-zero elements in all bonds, with their form constrained by the bond symmetry. A notable example is the centrosymmetric bonds A1 and A3, where only the antisymmetric exchange striction (the second term in (6)) contributes. Microscopically, this occurs because when the bond is at the inversion center, the hopping integral remains unchanged under the inversion operation, while the position operator changes sign [20]. Other noncentrosymmetric bonds can have finite coefficients in all terms in (6). However, as shown in the subsequent results for magnetically-induced polarization, the antisymmetric mechanism is found to be the main contributor, while other mechanisms do not contribute to polarization in our scenario. Therefore, in discussing the magnetically-induced polarization, we focus solely on the effects arising from the antisymmetric mechanism. In addition, the calculated parameters suggest that finite elements in the antisymmetric exchange striction coefficients for the main bonds given in Fig. 1c are only \mathbf{\mathcal{P}}_{\alpha}^{xz} and \mathbf{\mathcal{P}}_{\alpha}^{yz}. Therefore, the model for the magnetically-induced polarization (6) is reduced to \displaystyle\mathbf{P}_{s}\approx \displaystyle\sum_{<ij>}\left(\mathbf{\mathcal{P}}_{ij}^{xz},\mathbf{\mathcal{% P}}_{ij}^{yz},0\right)\left(S_{i}^{x}S_{j}^{y}-S_{i}^{y}S_{j}^{x}\right). (7) This means that the magnetically-induced polarization will be in the \mathbf{ab}-plane regardless of the magnetic structure. Furthermore, the parameters are related to the bond directions because of the nature of the position operator. In fact, all the coefficients in (7) can be represented as \displaystyle\left(\mathbf{\mathcal{P}}_{ij}^{xz},\mathbf{\mathcal{P}}_{ij}^{% yz},0\right)=p_{ij}(\hat{n}^{z}\times\hat{\epsilon}_{ij}), (8) where \hat{n}^{z}=(0,0,1) and \hat{\epsilon}_{ij} is a unit vector pointing along the bond direction. The parameters of p_{ij} for each bond are presented in Table 2. It is important to note that in our general theory, the polarization is microscopically derived from the perturbation of the Wannier function with respect to the hopping, similar to the exchange parameters. Consequently, the parameter p_{ij} shows a strong correlation with orbital ordering. Specifically, the FO order gives p_{ij}>0, while AFO order gives p_{ij}<0. As a consequence, this behavior is reminiscent of the GKA rule for exchange interactions. Unlike the exchange interactions, the strength of the magnetically-induced polarization tensors does not strongly depend on the level of orbital overlap. This is due to the microscopic polarization tensor being first-order in the hopping integrals, while the exchange interaction is second-order. Table 2: Values of p_{ij} for each bond [\mu C/m^{2}]. A1 A2 A3 F1 F2 20.5 4.8 6.5 -13.5 -4.4 The evolution of magnetization and magnetically-induced polarization, along with the corresponding magnetic structure under the influence of a magnetic field along the crystallographic b-axis (H_{b}) as obtained from the energy minimization, is depicted in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b, respectively. At zero magnetic field, the canted AFM magnetic structure preserves the I\timesT symmetry of the material, resulting in no net electric polarization. As the strength of the magnetic field approaches H_{b}\approx 0.3 T, the magnetic structure undergoes a transition into a spin-flop phase. The critical magnetic field is in a qualitative agreement with the experimental value (2-4 T). In this phase, the spins maintain an AFM vector perpendicular to the external field, while canting towards the direction of the magnetic field. This state breaks the I\timesT symmetry of the ground state, leading to the emergence of a finite electric polarization. This is an example of the canonical magnetoelectric effect, first observed in Cr2O3 [24]. The resulting electric polarization is observed to be along the crystallographic a-axis, originating solely from the antisymmetric mechanism (see Fig. 3a). The disappearance of the isotropic contribution \propto\mathbf{S}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{j} can be explained by the symmetry property of \mathbf{P}_{ij}=(P_{ij}^{x},P_{ij}^{y},P_{ij}^{z}) (Supplementary Note 3). In addition, the disappearance of P_{b} also arises from the symmetry property of the antisymmetric polarization tensor. For instance, the bond A1 exhibits a symmetry property \mathbf{\mathcal{P}}_{2,3}^{xz}=-\mathbf{\mathcal{P}}_{4,1}^{xz}, due to the bond symmetry \epsilon_{2,3}^{y}=-\epsilon_{4,1}^{y}, while \mathbf{\mathcal{P}}_{2,3}^{yz}=\mathbf{\mathcal{P}}_{4,1}^{yz} because \epsilon_{2,3}^{x}=\epsilon_{4,1}^{x}. In the spin-flop phase, the commensurate magnetic structure obeys \mathbf{S}_{4}\times\mathbf{S}_{1}=-\mathbf{S}_{2}\times\mathbf{S}_{3}; thus, only the x-component of the polarization, P_{a}, remains finite. As the magnetic field strength increases, the spins cant, driving a linear increase in net magnetization along the direction of the field. Notably, the polarization exhibits a maximum at around 40 T due to the antisymmetric mechanism of the polarization. At this point, the angles between spins on A1 bond approach approximately 90∘. Subsequently, beyond 40 T, the spins gradually align ferromagnetically, resulting in rapid decrease of the polarization. This decrease occurs because the FM magnetic structure does not break the inversion symmetry. The calculated magnetically-induced polarization aligns with the prediction from Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky (KNB) formula, given by \mathbf{P}_{s}\propto\sum_{ij}\hat{\epsilon}_{ij}\times(\mathbf{S}_{i}\times% \mathbf{S}_{j}) [25]. The maximal value observed here, P_{a}^{\mathrm{max}}\approx 6 \mu C/m^{2}, is comparable to the polarization value observed in other S=1/2 multiferroics [26, 27, 28]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06384v1,Thermal Broadening of Phonon Spectral Function in Classical Lattice Models: Projective Truncation Approximation,"Thermal broadening of the quasi-particle peak in the spectral function is an important physical feature in many statistical systems, but difficult to calculate. Within the projective truncation approximation (PTA) of Green’s function equation of motion for classical systems, we produce the spectral function with thermal broadened quasi-particles peak using an H-expanded basis. We demonstrate this method on two model systems, the one-variable anharmonic oscillator model and the one-dimensional classical \phi^{4} lattice model. Comparison with exact spectral function and the molecular dynamics simulation results shows that the method is semi-quantitatively accurate. Extension of the H-expanded basis to PTA for quantum system is possible.","The Green’s function (GF) is an important tool for studying the physical features of many-body systems in condensed matter physics. In recent works, based on the idea of operator projection [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we developed a GF equation of motion (EOM) projective truncation approximation (PTA) method [6, 7]. PTA is a variant of several other similar approximation methods, such as two-pole approximation [8, 9], composite fermion method [10, 11], self-consistent projection operator approach [12], operator projection method [13, 14, 15], continued fraction [16, 17], and irreducible Green’s function method [18], etc.. PTA overcomes the arbitrariness of traditional Tyablicov type truncation [19] by guaranteeing the analytical structure of GF, diagonal-positivity of spectral function, and the equilibrium state conservation of energy [6]. For a given system, PTA calculation is based on a preselected operator basis. By enlarging the operator basis and implementing the calculation on a modern computer, higher order truncation and systematic improvement of precision are made possible [7]. In a previous work, we extended the formalism of PTA from quantum models [20, 21] to classical many-body statistical models with continuous variables [22]. We applied the method to the one-dimensional \phi^{4} lattice model and obtained improved phonon dispersion compared to the quadratic variational method. PTA provides a way to calculate the phonon dispersion, alternative to the existing methods frequently used in the study of low-dimensional heat transport, such as the variational approximation [23, 24], effective phonon theory from the generalized equipartition theorem [25], and the anharmonic phonons [26] and resonance phonons [27, 28] based on molucular dynamical simulation. In the present work, we address the phonon damping problem in the lattice models that describe particles with harmonic interaction and local non-linear confining potential. In the traditional GF calculation [4, 5] or the generalized Langevin equation approach [1, 2, 3], the damping of quasi particles are described by self-energy or the memory function. It poses a challenge for PTA, however, since PTA directly gives approximate spectral function composed of N discrete delta peaks, with N being the dimension of basis. Naively increasing N to infinity is shown to be very inefficient for describing the broadening the spectral function and damping of quasi particles. Here, we propose an H-expanded basis to solve this problem. The idea is to first produce the approximate eigen excitation operator O, with [O,H]\approx\epsilon O, from a low-order PTA. The corresponding spectral function has a delta peak at \omega=\epsilon. Then we build the new basis of operators by expanding O using (exact or approximate) conserved quantities such as the Hamiltonian H of the studied system or mode Hamiltonian H_{\nu k} of mode (\nu k). That is, our new basis has the form \{Of_{i}(H)\} (i=1,2,...,N), with f_{i} being linearly independent functions of H. On the level of low-order PTA, these basis operators are degenerate excitation operators corresponding to the excitation energy \epsilon. A new PTA calculation on the expanded basis will introduce the thermal fluctuation beyond the low-order PTA and hence split the degeneracy, producing refined spectral functions composed of N closely distributed delta peaks around the low-order quasi-particle peak \delta(\omega-\epsilon). This provides a means to describe the thermal broadening of the quasi particle. In this work, the above idea is implemented for classical models, which have only thermal broadening effect at finite temperature due to the existence of nonlinear interaction between particles. We demonstrate the success of this H-expanded basis PTA on two models. One is the one-variable anharmonic oscillator (AHO) model, whose static averages and spectral function are exactly solvable [29]. The other is the one-dimensional \phi^{4} lattice model, which has been frequently used in the study of thermal transport in low-dimensional materials. Our results show that PTA on the H-expanded basis produces semi-quantitatively accurate spectral function with thermal broadening effect of the quasi particle peak. The extracted peak position and width are reliable for all temperatures. Using this method, we obtain the low and high temperature asymptotic behavior of phonon frequency and line width. The method could be further extended to quantum many-body systems where the interaction between particles may give rise to damping of quasi particles even at zero temperature. The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. For completeness, in Sec. II, we first review the formalism of GF EOM and PTA for classical systems. In Sec. III, we develop the formalism of PTA on H-expanded basis for the AHO model. In Sec. IV, we apply this method to one-dimensional \phi^{4} lattice model and analyse the thermal broadening effect in phonon spectral function. Section V is devoted to discussion and summary."

However, its clear experimental realizations remain absent. Here, we present a thorough investigation of the magnetism of the structurally disorder-free compound LuCu(OH)3SO4. By conducting magnetization and electron-spin-resonance measurements on the single-crystal sample, we establish that the title compound approximates the spin-1/2 ferromagnetic XXZ chain model with a nearest-neighbor exchange strength of J_{1} \sim 65 K and an easy-plane anisotropy of \sim 0.994. The specific heat demonstrates a distinctive power-law behavior at low magnetic fields (with energy scales \leq 0.02J_{1}) and low temperatures (T \leq 0.03J_{1}). This behavior is consistent with the expectations of the ideal spin-1/2 ferromagnetic XXZ chain model, thereby supporting the formation of a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger spin liquid in LuCu(OH)3SO4.","Spin-1/2 many-body correlated systems can give rise to exotic phases and elementary excitations due to their inherent strong quantum fluctuations and entanglements, capturing significant attention in condensed matter physics and materials science. The exploration, understanding, and control of these exotic phases have been a longstanding goal with promising applications in various fields, including future topological quantum computation Nayak et al. (2008). However, achieving this task is exceptionally challenging, stemming from two key aspects: 1. The majority of many-body-correlated quantum systems are too complex to have exact solutions, including eigenstates and eigenvalues. For instance, the ground-state nature of the spin-1/2 kagome-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet has been extensively studied for many years but remains elusive Yan et al. (2011); Depenbrock et al. (2012); Ran et al. (2007); Liao et al. (2017). 2. Real strongly correlated materials are so complex that their properties cannot be fully captured by simplified theoretical models, particularly in systems with low-lying small-gapped or gapless excitations. The Kitaev model is one of the few exactly solvable spin-1/2 many-body models Kitaev (2006), but its experimental realizations are still under heated debate due to the widespread presence of significant non-Kitaev interactions in real materials Janssen et al. (2017); Wang et al. (2019). The spin-1/2 XXZ or XXX (Heisenberg) chain, originally proposed by Werner Heisenberg and Hans Bethe, is a prototypical many-body model with eigenstates and eigenvalues that can be exactly solved using the integrable Bethe ansatz method Bethe (1931); Heisenberg (1985). In the case of a ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange interaction (strength: J_{1}) and an easy-plane anisotropy (0 < \Delta < 1), the model resides deeply within a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger spin-liquid phase Furukawa et al. (2010, 2012). Numerous candidate compounds for the spin-1/2 ferromagnetic XXZ chain have been previously reported, such as LiCuVO4 Enderle et al. (2010); Drechsler et al. (2011); Mourigal et al. (2012); Nawa et al. (2013); Ruff et al. (2019), LiCuSbO4 Dutton et al. (2012); Grafe et al. (2017); Bosiočić et al. (2017), Li2ZrCuO4 Dussarrat et al. (2002); Drechsler et al. (2007), Li2CuO2 Sapina et al. (1990); Lorenz et al. (2009), Ca2Y2Cu5O10 Kuzian et al. (2012); Thar et al. (2006); Matsuda et al. (2019), CuAs2O4 Caslin et al. (2014), PbCuSO4(OH)2 Willenberg et al. (2012); Heinze et al. (2022), and others. However, these candidates consistently show substantial next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) antiferromagnetic coupling (J_{2}), comparable to J_{1}. Despite their significance as strongly frustrated J_{1}-J_{2} systems, the presence of substantial J_{2} typically hinders exact resolution Wang et al. (2022). Furthermore, in the aforementioned Li-based compounds Nawa et al. (2013); Dutton et al. (2012); Dussarrat et al. (2002) and Ca2Y2Cu5O10 (Ca/Y disorder) Thar et al. (2006), structural disorders are inherent and unavoidable. These disorders can introduce significant complications for many-body modelling, given the apparent interaction randomness Li et al. (2017); Li (2019); Li et al. (2020, 2021); Lu et al. (2022). Recently, Huangjie Lu et al. reported the successful synthesis of the structurally disorder-free Cu2+ (spin-1/2) chain compound LuCu(OH)3SO4, featuring a crystal size of approximately 10\times25\times10 \mum Lu et al. (2020). However, to the best of our knowledge, its magnetism has not been reported so far. In this study, we implemented a new synthesis method and achieved successful growth of significantly larger single crystals of LuCu(OH)3SO4, typically with a size of \sim 0.08\times1\times0.08 mm. Through magnetization and electron-spin-resonance (ESR) measurements on the single-crystal sample, we determined the detailed spin Hamiltonian. Our findings indicate that both interchain and next-nearest-neighbor intrachain couplings are less significant, J_{\mathrm{p1}}/J_{1} \sim 1.01%, J_{\mathrm{p2}}/J_{1} \sim -0.18%, and J_{2}/J_{1} \sim 1% (see Fig. 1). LuCu(OH)3SO4 closely approximates the ideal spin-1/2 ferromagnetic XXZ chain model with J_{1} \sim 65 K and \Delta \sim 0.994. The specific heat and magnetization measurements down to T = 35 mK (\sim 0.0005J_{1}) are consistent with the expectations of the ideal model, supporting the emergence of a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger spin liquid in LuCu(OH)3SO4. Figure 1: (a) Crystal structure of LuCu(OH)3SO4. (b) View along the spin chain (b axis) of the crystal structure. (c) CuO2 chain viewed along the z axis. Dominant nearest-neighbor (NN) ferromagnetic exchange (J_{1}) and weaker couplings beyond first neighbors (J_{2}, J_{\mathrm{p1}}, and J_{\mathrm{p2}}) are displayed in (b) and (c). NN Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction vectors are shown in (c). The local xyz-coordinate system for spin components is defined, and thin black lines mark the unit cells. Figure 2: Determining couplings J_{1}, D, and J_{\mathrm{p}} \equiv J_{\mathrm{p1}}/3+2J_{\mathrm{p2}}/3. (a) Inverse magnetic susceptibilities measured on single-crystal and powder samples, with Curie-Weiss fits (lines) above 200 K. (b) Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum measured along the b axis (H^{\perp}) on the single-crystal sample at 300 K. The blue line represents the fit using the derivative Lorentzian function, with resonance field (g^{\perp} = 2.146) and full width at half maximum (FWHM = \mu_{0}\Delta H^{\perp}) marked. (c) Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) strength (D) dependence of \mu_{0}\Delta H^{\perp}, calculated using exact diagonalization (ED) with J_{1} = 65 K and at T = 300 K. The determined DM anisotropic strength is D/J_{1} = 0.110(5). (d) Magnetization measured on the single-crystal sample with magnetic fields along the b axis, with stochastic series expansion (SSE) calculations (lines) shown using least-square parameters. Inset: Standard deviation \sigma as a function of J_{\mathrm{p}}/J_{1} calculated using the experimental data between 1.8 and 20 K at \mu_{0}H^{\perp} = 1 and 3 T. The arrow denotes the optimal parameter J_{\mathrm{p}}/J_{1} = 0.21(1)%. Periodic boundary conditions are used in both ED and SSE computations."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05919v1,SU(N) spin-phonon simulations of Floquet dynamics in spin S>1/2 Mott insulators,"The dynamics of magnetic moments coupled to phonons is of great interest for understanding spin transport in solids as well as for our ability to control magnetism via tailored phonon modes. For spin S>1/2, spin-orbit coupling permits an unusual linear coupling of phonons to quadrupolar moments, so that phonons act as a dynamical transverse field for the spins. Here, we develop a generalized SU(N) spin-phonon Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics technique to simulate the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of such spin-orbital-phonon coupled Mott insulators, and apply it to a spin-1 model with competing XY antiferromagnet (AFM) and quadrupolar paramagnet (QPM) phases which is relevant to the Mott insulator \rm{Ba_{2}FeSi_{2}O_{7}}. We uncover a rich variety of dynamical phenomena in this system induced by linear or chiral phonon drives, including the generation of a uniform magnetization in the QPM and AFM, strengthening of Néel order and gapping of the AFM Nambu-Goldstone mode by Floquet-Ising anisotropy, a non-equilibrium QPM to AFM transition, and creation of Floquet copies of transverse and longitudinal spin waves. We discuss implications of our work for \rm{Ba_{2}FeSi_{2}O_{7}} and highlight future research directions in this field.","References Khomskii [2014] D. I.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05908v1,Charge transfer spin-polarons and ferromagnetism in weakly doped AB-stacked TMD heterobilayers,"We study the formation of ferromagnetic and magnetic polaron states in weakly doped heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides in the “heavy fermion” limit in which one layer hosts a dense set of local moments and the other hosts a low density of itinerant holes. We show that interactions among the carriers in the itinerant layer induces a ferromagnetic exchange. We characterize the ground state finding a competition, controlled by the carrier concentration and interlayer exchange, between a layer decoupled phase of itinerant carriers in a background of local moments, a fully polarized ferromagnet and a canted antiferromagnet. In the canted antiferromagnet phase the combination of the in-plane 120∘ Néel order and Ising spin orbit couplings induces winding in the electronic wavefunction giving rise to a topologically non-trivial spin texture and an observable anomalous Hall effect. At larger carrier density the ferromagnetically ordered phase transitions into a paramagnetic heavy Fermi liquid state. This theory enables a comprehensive understanding of the existing experimental observations while also making predictions including experimental signatures enabling direct imaging of spin polaron bound states with scanning tunneling microscopy. Our work shows that the prevailing paradigm of the (Doniach) phase diagram of heavy fermion metals is fundamentally modified in the low doping regime of heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.","References Andrei et al.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06932v1,Octupolar Weyl Superconductivity from Electron-electron Interaction,"Unconventional superconductivity arising from electron-electron interaction can manifest exotic symmetry and topological properties. We investigate the superconducting pairing symmetry problem based on the 3D cubic O_{h} symmetry with both weak- and strong-coupling approaches. The dominant pairing symmetries belong to the two-dimensional E_{g} representation at low and intermediate doping levels, and the complex mixing gap function of the d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}+id_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-type is energetically favored in the ground state. Cooper pairs with such a symmetry do not possess orbital angular momentum (OAM) moments, which is different from other time-reversal symmetry breaking pairings such as p_{x}+ip_{y} (e.g 3He-A) and d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}+id_{xy} under the planar hexagonal symmetry. Instead, they develop the octupolar O_{xyz} component of OAM, which results in 8 nodal points along the body diagonal directions exhibiting an alternating distribution of monopole charges \pm 1. This leads to an intriguing 3D Weyl topological SC, which accommodates nontrivial surface states of Majorana arcs. Our results appeal for material realizations and experimental tests in optical lattices.","Introduction The seeking for topological superconductor (TSC) has caught enduring interests, partly due to its relation to topological quantum computation [1, 2, 3]. Much of the focus has been on fully gapped TSCs [4, 5], including the p-wave Kitaev chain [6] and two-dimensional (2D) chiral superconductors of (p_{x}+ip_{y}) and (d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}+id_{xy}) symmetries [7, 8, 9, 10]. A comprehensive classification of gapped TSCs has been developed, within the ten-fold Altland-Zirnbauer classification [11, 12, 13], which categorizes these systems based on their symmetry and dimensionality. In three dimensions (3D), there exists a particular type of TSC exhibiting point gap nodes, i.e., the Weyl TSC [14], which is a superconducting analogy to the Weyl semimetal [15, 16]. The concepts of Weyl points are extended to Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors [14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. The Weyl TSCs not only inherit the non-trivial topological characteristics of Weyl semimetals but also exhibit unique superconducting properties, including gapless surface Majorana modes. Typically the Weyl semimetal or the Weyl TSC except the 3He-A phase appears in complicated compounds with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which is a single-particle band effect from relativistic Dirac equation [30, 31]. On the other front, unconventional superconductivity (SC) from many-body interactions is of considerable interests, particularly due to its connection to the high-T_{c} SC in cuprates [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. The Hubbard model [38] is well-known as the simplest lattice model for interacting electrons only with the onsite interaction energy U, and plays an important role in the study of strong correlation physics [39, 40]. In 2D, this model exhibits the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at half-filling in the square lattice[41, 42, 43, 44]. Upon doping whether it could yield the d-wave SC [45, 46, 47] is still under intensive debates in numerical simulations [40]. The 3D Hubbard model has been successfully simulated in optical lattices [48], leading to the observation of the AFM order consistent with previous numerical simulations [49, 50, 51, 52, 53]. This success offers a new platform for studying interaction effects, allowing for precise control over the interaction strength and the temperature to explore various quantum phases [54, 55, 56]. Particularly, this opens avenues for investigating the emergence of SC in doped systems, where long-range AFM order can be suppressed, leading to the formation of superconducting phases mediated by residual short-range AFM fluctuations. It is interesting to investigate what types of exotic SCs are allowed by different 3D point groups, with a focus on the topological aspect. In this article, we explore the pairing nature from interactions according to the cubic symmetry point group O_{h}. The plain Hubbard model in the 3D cubic lattice is taken as a prototype. Weak-coupling analysis is employed as well as the strong-coupling approach, consistently yielding that the doubly-degenerate (d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}},d_{x^{2}-y^{2}})-wave pairing is dominant at low and intermediate doping levels. Ginzburg-Landau (G-L) analysis combined with numerical calculations show that the d+id complex gap function with the octupolar O_{xyz} component of orbital angular momentum (OAM) is energetically favored. This gap function exhibits 8 nodes exhibiting the alternating pattern of monopole charges \pm 1 determined by the octupolar symmetries. This is a octupolar Weyl TSC hosting nontrivial surface states of topologically protected Fermi arcs. Our result does not depend on a particular model, but is general for systems with the cubic symmetries under repulsive interactions. It opens a door for studying exotic quantum states in 3D from electron-electron interactions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06648v1,Driven Critical Dynamics in Measurement-induced Phase Transitions,"Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT), characterizing abrupt changes in entanglement properties in quantum many-body systems subjected to unitary evolution with interspersed projective measurements, have garnered increasing interest. In this work, we generalize the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) driven critical dynamics that has achieved great success in traditional quantum and classical phase transitions to MIPT. By linearly changing the measurement probability p to cross the critical point p_{c} with driving velocity R, we identify the dynamic scaling relation of the entanglement entropy S versus R at p_{c}. For decreasing p from the area-law phase, S satisfies S\propto\ln R; while for increasing p from the volume-law phase, S satisfies S\propto R^{1/r} in which r=z+1/\nu with z and \nu being the dynamic and correlation length exponents, respectively. Moreover, we find that the driven dynamics from the volume-law phase violates the adiabatic-impulse scenario of the KZ mechanism. In spite of this, a unified finite-time scaling (FTS) form can be developed to describe these scaling behaviors. Besides, the dynamic scaling of the entanglement entropy of an auxiliary qubit S_{Q} is also investigated to further confirm the universality of the FTS form. By successfully establishing the driven dynamic scaling theory of this newfashioned entanglement transition, we bring a new fundamental perspective into MIPT that can be detected in fast-developing quantum computers.","References Calabrese and Cardy [2005] P.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06537v1,"Calculations of Spin Fluctuation Spectral Functions \alpha^{2}F in
High-Temperature Superconducting Cuprates","Spin fluctuations have been proposed as a key mechanism for mediating superconductivity, particularly in high-temperature superconducting cuprates, where conventional electron-phonon interactions alone cannot account for the observed critical temperatures. Traditionally, their role has been analyzed through tight–binding based model Hamiltonians. In this work we present a method that combines density functional theory with a momentum- and frequency-dependent pairing interaction derived from the Fluctuation Exchange (FLEX) type Random Phase Approximation (FLEX-RPA) to compute Eliashberg spectral functions \alpha^{2}F(\omega) which are central to spin fluctuation theory of superconductivity. We apply our numerical procedure to study a series of cuprates where our extracted material specific \alpha^{2}F(\omega) are found to exhibit remarkable similarities characterized by a sharp peak in the vicinity of 40–60 meV and their rapid decay at higher frequencies. Our exact diagonalization of a linearized BCS gap equation extracts superconducting energy gap functions for realistic Fermi surfaces of the cuprates and predicts their symmetry to be d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} in all studied systems. Via a variation of on–site Coulomb repulsion U for the copper d–electrons we show that that the range of the experimental values of T_{c} can be reproduced in this approach but is extremely sensitive to the proximity of the spin density wave instability. These data highlight challenges in building first–principle theories of high temperature superconductivity but offer new insights beyond previous treatments, such as the confirmation of the usability of approximate BCS–like T_{c} equations, together with the evaluations of the material specific coupling constant \lambda without reliance on tight–binding approximations of their electronic structures.","Strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations have long been considered a potential mechanism for unconventional superconductivity, following early theoretical proposalsVarma (1986); Scalapino (1986). Shortly after these foundational papers the first high–temperature superconductor was discoveredSC_Discover (1987). In spin fluctuation theory, the interaction vertex is commonly modeled using the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), which serves as a simplified representation of the true interaction vertex. Despite its simplicity, the RPA approach provides good qualitative results, particularly in capturing the divergent behavior as the spin density wave (SDW) is approached, an essential feature of many unconventional superconductors. The RPA vertex also naturally takes into account Fermi surface nesting, a phenomenon frequently observed in these systemsUnconventional_review (2002). As a result, spin fluctuations have remained a popular candidate for explaining superconductivity and have been applied extensively in the theoretical analysis of various unconventional superconductors. These materials include cupratescu_flex1 (1988, 1991, 2005, 2004), nickelatesni_flex1 (2020, 2024), ruthenatesru_flex1 (1997, 2000), cobaltatesco_flex1 (2005), ironatesfe_flex1 (2008, 2010, 2009, 2004), and heavy fermionhf_flex1 (2004, 2008) systems. At a given level of doping, theoretical methods typically aim to predict the onset of superconductivity, characterized by the transition temperature T_{c}, as well as the symmetry of the resulting superconducting gap function. Most approaches utilize simple tight–binding models with a limited number of orbitals and band structures, found using the Local Density ApproximationLDA_review (1983) (LDA), which serve as an input to the Hubbard model Hamiltonian. The latter is subsequently solved by an available many–body technique, such, for example, as the Fluctuational Exchange Approximation (FLEX) FLEX . FLEX is a diagrammatic method that includes RPA diagrams given by the particle–hole ladders and bubbles as well as particle–particle ladder diagrams. It is however known that in the vicinity of the SDW instability the most divergent terms are due to the particle–hole laddersParamagnons ; BerkSchrieffer , and the contribution from the particle–particle ladders can be neglectedMuller . Although a lot of past studies of spin fluctuational superconductivity utilized RPA and FLEXFLEX-Review , the extension of this technique has been proposed recently by combining them with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) FLEX+DMFT (2015). It has resulted in reproducing doping dependence of the T_{c} in the simulation of the two–dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice relevant to the cuprates. More accurate Quantum Monte Carlo simulations provide further ways to improve this approachMaier ; Maier2 , and realistic electronic structures can be incorporated via the use of theories such as LDA+ULDA+U and LDA+DMFTLDA+DMFT by utilizing the method of projectors. Our own recent combination of the LDA with FLEX and RPALDA+FLEX (LDA+FLEX) has allowed us to extend these methodologies to incorporate \mathbf{k}– and \omega dependence of the electronic self–energy by evaluating dynamical spin and charge susceptibilities in a restricted Hilbert space given by correlated orbitals. With a further extension of this method to compute the FLEX interaction vertices for the Cooper pairsLDA_FLEX1 (2018), the description of unconventional superconductors in a realistic material framework became possible. Our most recent applications to HgBa2CuO4LDA_FLEX1 (2018) recovered the known d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} symmetry of the order parameter here, and predicted various competing pairing states in a recently discovered superconducting nickelate La3Ni2O7 LDA_FLEX2 and in vanadium kagome metal CsV3Sb5LDA_FLEX3 . Estimates of the transition temperature T_{c} represent an additional challenge. In electron–phonon superconductors, it is typically calculated using Bardeen-Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theoryBCS_theory (1957) where the central quantity to determine is the coupling constant of the interaction \lambda, from which the T_{c} can be found via the McMillan equationMcMillan_1968 (1968). Although this approach is straightforward, these estimates exhibiting exponential sensitivity to the errors in \lambda and uncertainties in the treatment of the Coulomb pseudopotential \mu^{\ast} usually serve to obtain the correct order of magnitude for the T_{c}. More rigorous Eliashberg theory of superconductivity requiring the input of the spectral function \alpha^{2}F\left(\omega\right) and the evaluation of the screened Coulomb interaction can be utilized to improve the accuracy of these estimatesGross , but in a semiquantitative way, the McMillan theory is known to suffice in many cases. There are good reasons for the successes of the BCS approach, in particular, because in the electron–phonon superconductors the \alpha^{2}F\left(\omega\right) is limited by the Debye frequency \omega_{D} which is small comparing to the typical energies of the electronic states. For unconventional superconductors, technically, the Coulomb interaction vertex as, for example, given by FLEX, does not provide such a small parameter, therefore, many model calculations based on diagonalizing the BCS–type equations in case of spin fluctuationsFLEX-Review necessitate additional assumptions. To overcome this difficulty, the Eliashberg equation can be solved directly on the imaginary Matsubara axis and predict the T_{c} directlyArita2000 ; FLEX-Review , but the methodology hides the transparency of the BCS approach which has allowed to guide the discoveries of many conventional superconductors by searching for the materials with large \lambda. Here, we provide new insights to the superconductivity of single– and double–layer cupratesHg-Supra (1993, , , 1986, , , , ) by calculating their spin fluctuational spectral functions \alpha^{2}F(\omega) for a given pairing symmetry on the basis of frequency– and momentum–resolved FLEX–RPA pairing interaction and by utilizing their realistic LDA based electronic energy bands and wave functions. We first exactly diagonalize the linearized BCS gap equation and extract the highest eigenstate and the eigenvector as a function of the Fermi momentum set on a realistic Fermi surface of the material. We find the corresponding superconducting gap functions to be of d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} symmetry in all studied cuprates for a wide range of on–site Coulomb repulsions U and dopings that we scan during our simulations. We further utilize the Kramers–Kronig relations for the frequency dependence of the FLEX vertex, and its averaging over the eigenvectors provides a frequency resolution for each eigenstate. This gives rise to the definition of the spectral functions \alpha^{2}F(\omega) whose inverse frequency moments correspond to the eigenvalues of the BCS gap equation. Our calculated material specific \alpha^{2}F(\omega) are found to exhibit remarkable similarities characterized by a sharp peak in the vicinity of 40–60 meV which has been known to exist from a wealth of experimental data in cuprates such, e.g., imaginary spin susceptibility accessible via the neutron scattering experimentINS , the existence of a 40 meV resonance visible in the superconducting state40meV , as well as the kinks in the one–electron spectra seen at this energy range in angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) experimentSF_3 . We also find that \alpha^{2}F(\omega) decays rapidly at higher frequencies which justifies the use of the BCS–type treatment in the cuprates. The maximum eigenvalue \lambda_{\max\text{ }}deduced from this procedure represents a spin fluctuational coupling constant similar to the electron–phonon (e–p) \lambda_{e-p}. We find it to be particularly large when the system is close to SDW, which in this theory appears for a particular value of U=U_{SDW}, that corresponds to the divergent static spin susceptibility at some wavevector. To allow evaluation of the T_{c} via the McMillan theory, we calculate the normal state self–energy and extract the electronic mass enhancement m^{\ast}/m_{LDA}=1+\lambda_{sf}. The mass enhancement is also large in the vicinity of SDW. However, the evaluated renormalized coupling constant \lambda_{eff}=\lambda_{\max\text{ }}/(1+\lambda_{sf}) that determines the BCS T_{c} was found to be modest unless we tune U to be within a few percent of U_{SDW}. Several numerical approaches to find U were proposed and applied to the cuprates in the past, such as constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA)cRPA_1 (2018, 2022), or fitting U to reproduce some experiments, but such a great sensitivity to the proximity to U_{SDW} rules out the applicability of these methods here. As the oldest and most extensively studied family of unconventional superconductors, cuprates provide a wealth of published mass enhancement data that can be extracted from ARPES, quantum oscillation and specific heat experiments. This data offer additional comparisons with the values of \lambda_{sf} that we calculate in the hope to find further constrains for the material specific U that is needed to predict the T_{c}. However, when comparing experimental data with theoretical predictions, different experimental techniques require specific considerations. For example, ARPES measures a two–dimensional spectral function, from which the Fermi velocity v_{F}^{\ast} can be extracted. Quantum oscillation studies use magnetic fields to induce oscillations around the Fermi surface. The frequency of these oscillations provides a measurement of the effective mass m^{\ast}. Specific heat measurements give the electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma^{\ast} found from all bands. Many of these experiments are surveyed in our work but the spread in the deduced values of \lambda_{sf}, while being well within our theoretical predictions, does not offer further tuning of the constrains on the best determination of U. The results presented here highlight challenges in building first–principle theories of high–temperature superconductivity but still offer new insights that go beyond previous treatments, such as the calculations of \alpha^{2}F’s, the confirmation of the usability of approximate BCS–like T_{c} equations, and the evaluation of the material specific coupling constant \lambda without reliance on the tight–binding approximations of their electronic structures. This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we survey our LDA+FLEX method and describe the numerical procedure to calculate the spin fluctuational spectral functions \alpha^{2}F(\omega). In Section III we report our results on the calculated behavior of superconducting energy gaps, \alpha^{2}F(\omega), the coupling constants \lambda_{\max} and the mass enhancement parameters \lambda_{sf} for a series of single– and double–layer high–T_{c} cuprates. In Section IV we analyze available experimental data on the electronic mass renormalization deduced from ARPESVishik (2014); Birgeneau (1994); Peets (2007); ARPES-MASS2 (2007); Uchida (2003); Raffy (2005); Follath (2006); Muller (1988); Vishik (2009); Bi_overdoped (2016); Berger (2006); Shen (1999), quantum oscillationsHarrison (2019); Greven (2013, 2016); Carrington (2010); Wilson (2009); Crooker (2021); Proust (2008); Taillefer (2007); Klein (2018) and measured values of the specific heatKlein (2020); Tallon (1994); Hussey (2003); Klein_2019 (1988).

In this work, we analyzed published data on QPTs in three one-dimensional arrays and two two-dimensional arrays using a recently developed phenomenological model of QPTs. The model is based on the insight that the scaled experimental data depend in a universal way on two characteristic length scales of the system: the microscopic length scale L_{0} from which the renormalization group flow starts, and the dephasing length, L_{\varphi}(T) as given by the distance travelled by system-specific elementary excitations over the Planckian time. Our analysis reveals that the data for all five arrays (both 1D and 2D) can be quantitatively and self-consistently explained within the framework of interacting superconducting plasmons. In this picture, L_{\varphi}=v_{p}\hbar/k_{B}T, and L_{0}\approx\Lambda, where v_{p} is the speed of the plasmons and \Lambda is the Coulomb screening length of the Cooper pairs. We also observe that, in 1D arrays, the transition is significantly shifted towards the insulating side compared to the predictions of the sine-Gordon model. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences with recent microwave studies of extremely long JJ chains, as well as with the pair-breaking QPT observed in superconducting nanowires and films.","References [1] M.T.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06088v1,A Existence of dual topological phases in -based ternary chalcogenides,"It is quite intriguing to investigate the transition from a topological insulator (TI) phase to topological crystalline insulator (TCI) phase in a material as the latter has an advantage over the former in controlled device applications. This work investigates the existence of this dual topological behavior in Sn-based ternary chalcogenides family PbSnX2 (X=S, Se, Te) under the hydrostatic pressure using first-principles approach. These materials are dynamically stable at ambient and elevated pressure conditions up to which the topological phase transitions (TPTs) are studied. This family have a topologically trivial ground state with direct band gap values 0.338 eV, 0.183 eV and 0.217 eV for PbSnS2, PbSnSe2 and PbSnTe2, respectively. The first TPT i.e., TI phase for these materials is observed, under the effect of external pressure of 5 GPa, 2.5 GPa and 3.5 GPa, with a single band inversion at F-point in the bulk band structure and an odd number of Dirac cones along the (111) surface. A further increase in pressure to 5.5 GPa, 3 GPa and 4 GPa results in another band inversion at \varGamma-point and an even number of Dirac cones along the (111) plane. These even number of band inversions suggest that (\bar{1}2\bar{1}) surface has mirror symmetry around (\bar{1}0\bar{1}) plane and hence, the TCI phase is obtained. This TCI phase is further corroborated with even value of mirror Chern number calculated using winding of Wannier charge centers.Topological phase transition, ternary chalcogenides, first-principles calculations, topological crystalline insulators, mirror Chern number.","I INTRODUCTION A new phase of matter with unusual metallic edge/surface states known as topological materials (TM) has been studied intensively in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The TMs can be divided into few categories such as topological insulators (TIs) [3, 4, 5, 6], topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) [7, 8, 9], Dirac semimetals (DSMs) [10, 11], Weyl semimetals (WSMs) [12, 13], nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) [14, 15], \mathrm{Z_{2}} topological semimetals [16, 17] and triply degenerate node semimetals [18, 19], etc. The metallic Dirac-like electronic states on the surface of the crystal with insulating bulk are the signature of the existence of TI. These metallic edge/surface states appear in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) which are protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and provides robust spin-polarized conduction channels [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. These materials have potential applications in low-power high-speed electronic and spintronic devices, quantum computing, and thermoelectric applications [20, 21, 22] etc. The careful alteration in the strength of SOC plays an important role in realizing topological phases in specific materials. The hydrostatic pressure is a non-destructive way of enhancing SOC without affecting the charge neutrality of the materials. The binary and ternary materials like \mathrm{Bi_{4}Br_{4}} [23], LaAs [16], YbAs [24], LnSb (Ln=La, Gd, Tm) [17, 25], YX (X=As, Sb, Bi) [26, 27] and \mathrm{KNa_{2}Bi} [28], BiTeI [29], \mathrm{Bi_{2}S_{3}} [30], BiTeBr [31] have shown the topological phase transition (TPT) with hydrostatic pressure. The term “topological crystalline insulators,” has been introduced by L. Fu, which defines a class of materials having robust topological states and are protected by crystalline symmetries [7]. This new phase was first proposed in SnTe and later angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) verified the topological surface states (TSSs) in the (001) plane of this material [8]. Unlike TIs, TCIs have persisted protection by mirror symmetry even when TRS is broken. It is quite intriguing to investigate the TPT from TI to TCI in a material. TCI phase is more robust against impurities or defects and has diverse and tunable topological characteristic states [7, 32]. TCI materials hold higher-order topological hinge or corner states which can be identified with different topological invariants depending on the crystal symmetries [33, 34] and can have potential applications in stable qubits and novel electronic devices [7, 32, 33, 34]. The TCI phase has an advantage over the TI phase for controlled device applications such as a topological field effect transistor [32]. The narrow band-gap semiconductors are amongst the highly sought-after materials to realize TPT. Several narrow gap IV-VI semiconducting materials such as PbTe, SnSe, SnS, TlSe, TlS, and \mathrm{Pb_{1-x}Sn_{x}X} (X = Se, Te) have been studied for the existence of TIs and TCIs phases [35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. Other than these, the ternary chalcogenides \mathrm{TlXY_{2}} (X = Sb, Bi; Y = Te, Se) have also been reported as strong TIs [40, 41] but the TCI phase has not been explored in these materials except for \mathrm{TlBiS_{2}} and \mathrm{TlSbS_{2}} [42]. The present study focuses on the realization of TI and TCI phases in ternary chalcogenides \mathrm{PbSnX_{2}} (X= S, Se, Te) with the application of external hydrostatic pressure. For this family, trivial to non-trivial phase are obtained with single band inversion at \varGamma-point under hydrostatic pressure. With further increases in pressure, a pair of Dirac cones are observed along the (111) plane and made these systems trivial again. However, a TCI phase emerges at this elevated pressure as confirmed by non-trivial TSSs along (\bar{1}2\bar{1}) plane which is symmetric around the mirror plane (\bar{1}0\bar{1})."
