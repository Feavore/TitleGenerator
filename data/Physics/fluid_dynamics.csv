https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10376v1,Soliton Dynamics over a Disordered Topography,"We report on the dynamics of a soliton propagating on the surface of a fluid in a 4-m-long canal with a random or periodic bottom topography. Using a full space-and-time resolved wavefield measurement, we evidence, for the first time experimentally, how the soliton is affected by the disorder, in the context of Anderson localization, and how localization depends on nonlinearity. For weak soliton amplitudes, the localization length is found in quantitative agreement with a linear shallow-water theory. For higher amplitudes, this spatial attenuation of the soliton amplitude is found to be enhanced. Behind the leading soliton slowed down by the topography, different experimentally unreported dynamics occur: Fission into backward and forward nondispersive pulses for the periodic case, and scattering into dispersive waves for the random case. Our findings open doors to potential applications regarding ocean coastal protection against large-amplitude waves.","References [1] W. H. Bragg and W. L.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10372v1,Compressible turbulent convection at very high Rayleigh numbers,"Heat transport in highly turbulent convection is not well understood. In this paper, we simulate compressible convection in a box of aspect ratio 4 using computationally-efficient MacCormack-TVD finite difference method on single and multi-GPUs, and reach very high Rayleigh number (Ra)— 1015 in two dimensions and 1011 in three dimensions. We show that the Nusselt number Nu \propto\mathrm{Ra}^{0.3} (classical scaling) that differs strongly from the ultimate-regime scaling, which is Nu \propto\mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}. The bulk temperature drops adiabatically along the vertical even for high Ra, which is in contrast to the constant bulk temperature in Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RBC). Unlike RBC, the density decreases with height. In addition, the vertical pressure-gradient (-dp/dz) nearly matches the buoyancy term (\rho g). But, the difference, -dp/dz-\rho g, is equal to the nonlinear term that leads to Reynolds number \mathrm{Re}\propto\mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}.","Turbulent thermal convection occurs in a wide range of geophysical and astrophysical flows, as well as in many natural and industrial processes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. There are various models of turbulent convection, the leading one being Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RBC) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] that follows Oberbeck-Boussinesq (OB) approximation. In RBC, a horizontal layer of fluid confined between two parallel plates is heated from below and cooled from above. In the OB approximation, the density of the fluid is nearly constant, except for a small variation in the buoyancy term. For example, for water, whose thermal expansion coefficient \alpha\approx 3\times 10^{-4}~{}\mathrm{K}^{-1} at room temperature, the relative change in density (\delta\rho)/\rho\approx\alpha(\Delta T)\approx 10^{-3} when the temperature difference between the two plates is around 30 K [5]. However, (\delta\rho)/\rho in a turbulent star is of the order of unity [9]. Let us assume that the star is made of ideal gas, whose thermal expansion coefficient is 1/T, where T is the gas temperature. Hence, (\delta\rho)/\rho\approx\alpha(\Delta T)\approx 1 when (\Delta T)\approx T. Therefore, the OB approximation and the RBC equations become invalid for stars and related astrophysical systems [6, 10, 11, 12]. To study such systems, researchers often employ equations for compressible convection or intermediate models that employ non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects [13, 14, 15] or anelastic approximations [16, 17]. In this paper, we employ fully compressible equations to study turbulent convection at very large Rayleigh numbers (Ra)—up to 10^{15} for two-dimensions (2D), and 10^{11} for three-dimension (3D). Note, however, that the solar convection has even larger Ra (\sim 10^{24}) than the above [6]. Many aspects of turbulent convection, which is more complex than hydrodynamic turbulence, are understood quite well, in particular for RBC systems. Grossmann and Lohse (GL in short) [18, 19] modelled the Reynolds number (Re) and Nusselt number (Nu) scaling using the relations for viscous and thermal dissipation rates [20, 21]. The GL relations have been verified by many experiments and numerical simulations [22]. Recently, Bhattacharya and Verma [23] employed machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more accurate dissipation rates for Ra and Pr predictions. In addition, it has been shown that for small and moderate Prandtl numbers (Pr \lessapprox 1), turbulent convection has properties similar to hydrodynamic turbulence [5, 24]. For example, the energy spectrum for turbulent convection follows Kolmogorov’s 5/3 spectrum. For the RBC setup, while the Reynolds number scaling is reasonably well established, the properties of velocity fluctuations remains to be quantified [25]. Additionally, accurate characterization of the Nusselt number scaling remains a challenge. Two main theories describe the dependence of Nu on Ra. In the extreme turbulent regime, known as ultimate regime, Kraichnan argued that Nu scales as \mathrm{Ra}^{1/2} [26, 27]. On the contrary, Malkus [28] proposed that Nu is proportional to \mathrm{Ra}^{1/3}, referred to as the classical scaling [1, 2, 3, 4, 18, 27]. It is reported both in experiments and numerical simulations that up to \mathrm{Ra}=10^{12}, the Nu scaling exponent is near 0.30. However, Chavanne et al. [29], He et al. [30], Zhu et al. [31] and some others argued that the Nu exponent gradually increases to about 0.38 near \mathrm{Ra}=10^{15}. Therefore, some researchers believe that the exponent might reach the value 1/2 at extreme Ra’s [27]. But, some others, based on different experiments and related simulations, argue that the classical scaling will remain valid for all Ra’s [6, 32, 33, 34]. The scaling of Nu is discussed in detail in recent articles [27, 35]. Turbulent compressible convection behaves very differently than RBC turbulence [36]. Unlike the constant bulk temperature in RBC, the bulk temperature in compressible convection falls adiabatically [17]. In compressible convection, the fluid at the bottom is heavier than that at the top, which is in sharp contrast to that in RBC. Unfortunately, compressible convection has not been studied extensively. In recent times, Verhoeven et al. [17], and John and Schumacher [36, 37, 38] analyzed turbulent compressible convection. Verhoeven et al. [17] performed a comparative study of the anelastic approximation and fully compressible turbulent convection. John and Schumacher [36, 37] performed numerical simulations of fully compressible convection up to \mathrm{Ra}=10^{7} and explored different regimes of compressible convection. Some compressible simulations use inviscid flows [39] whose Ra estimates are somewhat uncertain. We find that there are no existing studies on fully compressible convection at very high Rayleigh numbers. The present paper aims to fill this gap. In this paper, we simulate turbulent compressible convection using a computationally-efficient MacCormack-TVD (total variation diminishing) finite difference method that eliminates numerical oscillations [40]. Our method is an extension of the novel and stable numerical scheme proposed by Ouyang et al. [40], Yee [41], and Liang et al. [42] for shallow water equations to compressible turbulent convection. Our stable numerical scheme enabled us to perform convection simulations at very large Ra’s, e.g., 10^{15} for 2D flows, and 10^{11} for 3D flows. We quantify various quantities using the data generated by our numerical simulations. Our numerical data show that the internal energy dominates the fluid kinetic energy even at very large Ra. We attribute adiabaticity to this effect. In addition, we study the superadiabatic temperature and density of the flow. Based on numerical data, we report that \mathrm{Nu}\sim\mathrm{Ra}^{0.3} up to \mathrm{Ra}=10^{15} in 2D and up to 10^{11} in 3D. We caution that our results differ significantly from those for RBC, which is very different from compressible convection. Among the two, compressible equations model the astrophysical systems better. Simulations of 3D turbulent convection at extreme Ra’s are very expensive. Fortunately, in the RBC framework, the scaling of Nu and Re for 2D and 3D flows are reasonably similar for Pr \gtrapprox 1 [43, 44, 45]. Motivated by these observations, we examine the Nu and Re scaling for extreme Ra in 2D, and for moderate Ra in 3D. We believe that these important findings will improve the models of stellar and planetary convection. We have organised the paper as follows. In Sec. 2, we describe the physical system along with the governing equations. Sec. 3 discusses the numerical scheme along with the simulation parameters. In Secs. 4 and 5, we describe the adiabaticity and boundary layers in turbulent convection. Section 6 contains discussions on Nu and Re scaling. We conclude in Sec. 7.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10162v1,Turbulent pipe flow with spherical particles: drag as a function of particle size and volume fraction,"Suspensions of finite-size solid particles in a turbulent pipe flow are found in many industrial and technical flows. Due to the ample parameter space consisting of particle size, concentration, density and Reynolds number, a complete picture of the particle-fluid interaction is still lacking. Pressure drop predictions are often made using viscosity models only considering the bulk solid volume fraction. For the case of turbulent pipe flow laden with neutrally buoyant spherical particles, we investigate the pressure drop and overall drag (friction factor), fluid velocity and particle distribution in the pipe. We use a combination of experimental (MRV) and numerical (DNS) techniques and a continuum flow model. We find that the particle size and the bulk flow rate influence the mean fluid velocity, velocity fluctuations and the particle distribution in the pipe for low flow rates. However, the effects of the added solid particles diminish as the flow rate increases. We created a master curve for drag change compared to single-phase flow for the particle-laden cases. This curve can be used to achieve more accurate friction factor predictions than the traditional modified viscosity approach that does not account for particle size.","It is well known that the presence of a non-negligible mass fraction of a solid phase in a turbulent flow will modulate the flow dynamics in intricate ways (Balachandar and Eaton, 2010), especially if the particle size is comparable to or greater than the most minor (Kolmogorov) length scales of the flow Brandt and Coletti (2021). This is undoubtedly the case in many industrial applications, where the particle size d_{p} varies from a few microns to a few centimetres. In contrast, the diameter D of the pipe that conveys the mixture could reach the meter scale Pullum et al. (2018). In addition, it is expected that the flow features a dense concentration of such finite-sized particles, resulting in vibrant dynamics where particle-fluid and particle-particle interactions modulate the flow dynamics Elghobashi (1994). Pressure-driven transport of solid-fluid mixtures in pipelines is a fundamental flow problem of considerable practical significance (e.g., transport of slurries or wastewater, processes related to drinking water treatment, food industry and transport of pulp fibres in paper-making processes). In these pipelines, a large portion of the energy is lost due to turbulence-induced drag and a fundamental understanding of how this is modified by the presence of a dispersed solid phase would give clues and insights on how to predict, control and modify the flow, aiming for either lower energy consumption or higher product quality (e.g. via increased mixing). Due to the complex interplay between different physical effects and the vast number of input parameters, mainly empirical relationships have been proposed to estimate the pressure drop in hydraulic transport of solid-fluid mixtures (Durand, 1953; Zandi and Govatos, 1967). Over the years, both experiments and simulations have been fraught with high uncertainties, making it challenging to achieve repeatability between two similar tests under the same conditions (Zandi, 1971). Thanks to the development of efficient algorithms for particle resolved simulations Uhlmann (2005); Breugem (2012) and increased measurement capabilities (Brandt and Coletti, 2021) turbulent pipe and channel flow laden with mono-dispersed rigid spherical neutrally-buoyant particles have now been studied to a somewhat larger extent with great detail both numerically (see, e.g. Yu et al. (2013); Zhao et al. (2010); Shao et al. (2012); Lashgari et al. (2014); Picano et al. (2015); Lashgari et al. (2016); Fornari et al. (2016a); Costa et al. (2016); Niazi Ardekani et al. (2017); Eshghinejadfard et al. (2017); Peng and Wang (2019); Yousefi et al. (2023); Hogendoorn et al. (2023)) and experimentally (see e.g. Zade et al. (2018); Leskovec et al. (2020); Hogendoorn et al. (2023)) and thanks to this we have been given insights into the physics governing these flows. An approach to modeling suspension flows is to treat the suspension as a continuous medium with an effective viscosity \nu_{e} compared to the viscosity of pure fluid \nu (Guazzelli and Morris, 2011). This has been a common approach in rheology, dating back to the works of Einstein (1911); Batchelor (1970) and Batchelor and Green (1972). These works studied the rheological properties of suspensions using theory and semi-empirical arguments to derive relations for the effective suspension viscosity \nu_{e} at dilute (\lesssim 0.01) and semi-dilute (\lesssim 0.10) solid volume fractions. Due to the increasing problem complexity with increasing volume fraction, \phi – even in laminar flows – only entirely empirical or semi-empirical fits are available for characterization of the suspension rheology, such as the ones suggested by Eilers (1941) and Krieger and Dougherty (1959). A drawback of these semi-empirical fits and the continuum approach is that only the solid phase volume fraction is considered, and the size and shape of the suspended particles are left out. The importance of particle size was highlighted by, e.g. Matas et al. (2003), who studied how the particle-to-pipe-diameter ratio, d_{p}/D, for mono-dispersed rigid neutrally-buoyant spherical particles, influenced the behaviour of transition to turbulence for particle-laden flows. Non-monotonic trends for the onset of turbulence were found. These experiments were numerically reproduced by Yu et al. (2013). More recent experimental work continued along this line Leskovec et al. (2020); Hogendoorn et al. (2022) arguing that there is a need to include particle size to predict suspension effects on wall-bounded turbulent flow. Using an effective viscosity approach to estimate the turbulent drag was proven by Costa et al. (2016) to result in a lower drag than what is observed in turbulent suspensions. The discrepancy was explained to originate from the formation of a layer of particles near the solid wall. A scaling law was proposed for predicting the friction Reynolds number as a function of the bulk Reynolds number based on the thickness of the particle wall layer. Lashgari et al. (2014, 2016) performed numerical simulations of particle-laden channel flow and identified three different flow regimes for suspensions of neutrally buoyant particles: laminar-like regime where viscous stresses dominate, a turbulent-like regime, where Reynolds shear stresses are the main mechanism for momentum transfer and finally, at higher concentrations, a so-called inertial shear-thickening regime where particle stresses are enhanced and are the main contributors to the overall drag. For low Reynolds numbers and low concentrations, viscous stresses dominate, whereas, at higher speeds, the Reynolds shear stresses take over, and at higher volume fractions, particle stresses are enhanced. Focusing on high Reynolds numbers, a migration of particles to the core region was reported, which was significant in dense cases, \phi\gtrsim 0.30. Picano et al. (2015) studied dense suspensions in turbulent channel flows up to volume fraction \phi=0.20. They demonstrated that, despite the overall drag continuing to grow, the Reynolds shear stress and velocity fluctuation intensities increased with volume fraction before suddenly declining after a local maximum. The drag increase was attributed to the increased turbulence up to a certain volume fraction threshold and particle-induced stresses. Yousefi et al. (2023) investigated dense suspensions (up to \phi=0.30) in turbulent channel flow for Reynolds numbers as high as 10\,000. They found that the main contributors to overall drag was the particle-induced stresses and the turbulence stresses, only a small part of the drag was attributed to viscous stresses. The flow is turbulent-like for 0<\phi<0.15 and 3\,000<Re_{b}<15\,000 and moves into the inertial shear-thickening regime when the volume fraction is increased (0.15<\phi<0.30) and the flowrate is reduced slightly (3\,000<Re_{b}<10\,000). Under dense conditions (\phi=0.30), the flow becomes turbulent-like again as the flow rate increases and the turbulent stresses dominate the particle-induced stresses. This is attributed to flattening the particle volume fraction profile where fewer particles move to the channel’s core. As a result, the particle-induced stress becomes less significant, and the turbulent activity rises. According to their findings, the flow will experience high enough Reynolds stresses and velocity variations to revert to homogeneously turbulent conditions, leaving the particle-induced stresses regime. Shao et al. (2012) studied a turbulent channel flow for two different values d_{p}/D and volume fraction \phi\approx 0.07 and showed that the particle size effect on turbulence is connected to the volume fraction. A higher number of smaller particles are present for a given \phi, leading to a larger total particle surface area and, hence, an increase of the Reynolds shear stresses. Similar results were reported by Eshghinejadfard et al. (2017), who found that for two different particle sizes in a turbulent channel flow, the smaller of the two had the most profound effect on velocity statistics. Peng and Wang (2019) investigated two different particle sizes in particle-laden turbulent channel and pipe flows and found that smaller particles lead to stronger ejection and sweeping events near the wall due to faster rotation of the small particles and a larger total surface area. They also found that for a given \phi and particle size, there is a stronger migration towards the core for a pipe than a channel flow due to the shrinking volume of the pipe in the centre region. Turning our attention to experimental work, Zade et al. (2018) reported similar migration trends for a duct flow compared to a channel flow. They studied three different particle sizes and a range of Reynolds numbers. Also, non-monotonic trends for the pressure drop as a function of particle size were found for high-volume fractions where a reduction of turbulent stresses but an increase of particle-induced stresses was reported. The complex interaction of spherical particles and flow structures in a turbulent channel flow was investigated by Van Hout et al. (2022) who found that the particles might affect the evolution of structures in the boundary layer. Only dilute conditions were studied, but the findings indicate that for increased volume fractions the finite-sized particles will modify the near-wall turbulent structures to a large extent and hence impact the wall friction and turbulent drag. Hogendoorn et al. (2023) performed a combined experimental and numerical study of a turbulent pipe flow of dense suspensions (up to \phi=0.47) where three characteristic cases were identified and a parameter space (\phi vs. Re) created. The Re in the study is the suspension Reynolds number based on the effective viscosity from the semi-empirical fit by Eilers (1941). The first case was characterised as low \phi and high Re and dominated by turbulence with a homogeneous particle distribution. In the second case, at moderate \phi, particle migration towards the pipe centre and forming a solid core were observed at moderate \phi. For even higher \phi, the third identified case, the solid core expanded from the centre towards the pipe walls due to maximum packing being reached in the pipe centre. Pressure drop measurements for \phi and Re and non-monotonic trends in the turbulent drag were reported. An increase in drag was seen for the first case, then a decreasing drag for the second case and an even further decrease for the third case. The authors speculated that additional friction from the particle wall layer for low \phi introduces the drag increase first seen, and for higher \phi, gradients in the solid volume fractions result in a strong non-uniform effective viscosity in the wall-normal direction. The near-wall region, with its relatively lower \phi, acts as a lubrication layer, reducing drag. Over the years, progress in understanding particle-laden turbulent transport has been driven by the evolution of experimental and numerical techniques. As stated in the recent review of Brandt and Coletti (2021), there is great potential when both approaches are used in a complementary way, as in the studies by Wang et al. (2019) and Hogendoorn et al. (2023). This is also the approach taken in the present study, where we aim to investigate the effect of neutrally buoyant spherical particles in turbulent pipe flow using interface-resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) and experimental measurements of pressure drop and velocity statistics from phase-contrast magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV). Different flow cases are investigated by varying the particle size, concentration, and flow rate of the mixture. Changing the flow rate in the experimental rig is a quick way to vary one of the parameters in the large parameter space. From this parameter variation, exciting cases are identified and further examined using DNS, aiming at revealing the secrets of turbulent particle-laden flow. In particular, we examine how the overall pressure gradient changes for the single-phase flow upon the addition of particles, how the velocity field changes, and how these changes are connected to particle migration. We also report a universal drag increase curve based on the scaling of pressure drop measurements for a wide range of flow rates, solid volume fractions and particle sizes."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10112v1,On the solutions of a factorized wave equation,"Long-distance transmission of energy by waves is a key mechanism for many natural processes. It becomes possible when the inhomogeneous medium is arranged in such a manner that it enables a specific type of waves to propagate with virtually no reflection or scattering. If the corresponding wave equation admits factorization, at least one of the waves it describes propagates without reflection. The paper is devoted to searching for conditions under which both solutions of a one-dimensional factorized wave equation of the second order describe traveling waves, that is, waves propagating without reflection. Possible variants of wave structure are found and the results are compared with those obtained in previous studies.","Studying the possibility of wave propagation without reflection and scattering in inhomogeneous environment is necessary to explain phenomena of energy transmission by waves over long distances observed in nature. In the Earth’s atmosphere, the energy is transferred from the lower layers to the upper ones by acoustic-gravity and internal waves [1, 2]. In the seas and oceans, storm waves and tsunamis are able to transmit the energy over long distances [3, 4]. In space and astrophysical plasmas, this work is often performed by Alfvén waves [5], that is, by transverse (with respect to the directions of the magnetic field and phase velocity) oscillations which practically do not disturb the density. In particular, it is Alfvén waves that play a key role in the transfer of energy from the lower solar atmosphere into the corona and in the corona heating (see, for example, [6, 7] and references cited). Theoretical search for configurations of an inhomogeneous medium that allow wave propagation without reflection is very difficult and analytical results have been obtained, as a rule, for cases of one spatial dimension (or those reducible to one-dimensional) which we shall assume below. The main way to finding the parameters of inhomogeneous non-reflective media is in reducing the equation for waves to some reference equation. For media at rest, the equations with coordinate-independent coefficients are usually chosen as such, for example, the classical equation for waves propagating with a velocity c, \displaystyle\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial t^{2}}-c^{2}\displaystyle\frac{% \partial^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}=0, (1) whose general solution f(x,t)=F_{1}\left(\displaystyle\frac{x}{c}+t\right)+F_{2}\left(\displaystyle% \frac{x}{c}-t\right) represents two waves of arbitrary forms running in opposite directions, or the Klein-Gordon equation (see [8, 9, 10, 11] and references cited). Recently, the set of reference equations has been extended [12, 13, 14] to include the Euler-Darboux-Poisson equation, \displaystyle\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial t^{2}}-\displaystyle\frac{\partial^% {2}f}{\partial\xi^{2}}-\displaystyle\frac{2m}{\xi}\,\displaystyle\frac{% \partial f}{\partial\xi}=0,\quad\xi=\int\!\displaystyle\frac{{\rm d}x}{c(x)}, (2) and some related equations. For m=0 Eq. (2) is equivalent to Eq. (1), and for m=1 it describes spherically symmetric traveling waves in homogeneous three-dimensional environment. For any integer m, its solution also describes two independent traveling waves, each in the form of a finite sum (see, for example, [15], §12.4), f(\xi,t)=\sum_{k=0}^{|m|}C_{k;m}\xi^{k+m_{0}}\displaystyle\frac{\partial^{k}F}% {\partial\xi^{k}},\qquad F(\xi,t)=F_{1}(\xi+t)+F_{2}(\xi-t),\quad C_{k;m}=% \mbox{const}, (3) where F_{1} and F_{2} are arbitrary functions, m_{0}=1-2m for m>0, m_{0}=0 for m<0, C_{0;m}=1, and the remaining constants can be easily found by substituting into Eq. (2). We call attention to the fact that F_{1}(Z) serves as a generating function for all functions dependent on the phase (\xi+t) of the first wave, and F_{2}(Z) plays the same role for the functions dependent on the phase (\xi-t) of the second wave. Taking these results into account, one can formulate an extended concept of traveling waves. Namely, such a wave [with the speed c(x)] can be described by a finite sum, f(x,t)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k}(x)\Phi_{k}\left(t-\!\displaystyle\int\limits% \displaystyle\frac{{\rm d}x}{c(x)}\right)\,, (4) in which the form factors a_{k}(x) are determined by the medium arrangement, and the phase functions \Phi_{k}(Z) have a common generating function \Phi(Z). In isotropic media, an oppositely propagating traveling wave is represented by a similar sum with the same form factors but its own generating function \tilde{\Phi}\Bigl{(}t+\int{\rm d}x/c(x)\Bigr{)}. If the inhomogeneous medium moves with a velocity V(x), the waves are carried away by the flow and propagate with different velocities, V(x)+c(x) and V(x)-c(x). In addition, the flow creates a preferred direction and violates isotropy. Therefore, to search for non-reflective configurations of moving media, it was proposed another approach [16, 17] based on factorization of wave equations. To do this, the function f(x,t) describing wave motion is represented as f(x,t)=a(x){\cal F}(x,t) and then the conditions for the flow parameters and the dependence of a(x) on these parameters are found under which the wave equation takes the form \left[\displaystyle\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+w_{1}(x)\,\displaystyle\frac{% \partial}{\partial x}+G(x)\right]\left[\displaystyle\frac{\partial}{\partial t% }+w_{2}(x)\,\displaystyle\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right]{\cal F}(x,t)=0, (5) where w_{1,2}(x) are the wave velocities. By this method, wide classes of shallow water flows were found, in which surface [16, 17] or internal [18, 19, 20] gravity waves can propagate without reflection. It turned out that for all these diverse flows G(x) is equally related to w_{1,2}(x), G(x)=G_{0}(x)=\displaystyle\frac{w_{1}(x)w^{\prime}_{2}(x)-w^{\prime}_{1}(x)w_% {2}(x)}{w_{1}(x)-w_{2}(x)}, (6) and is invariant under the permutation of w_{1} and w_{2} (hereinafter the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the function argument). Moreover, the equation (5) is invariant as well and the general solution to the problem, f(x,t)=a(x){\cal F}(x,t)=a(x)\left[{\cal F}_{a}\left(t-\displaystyle\int% \limits_{x_{0}}^{x}\displaystyle\frac{{\rm d}x_{1}}{w_{1}(x_{1})}\right)+{\cal F% }_{b}\left(t-\displaystyle\int\limits_{x_{0}}^{x}\displaystyle\frac{{\rm d}x_{% 1}}{w_{2}(x_{1})}\right)\right],\quad x_{0}=\mbox{const}, (7) is a superposition of two waves of arbitrary shape having a common form factor a(x) specified by the flow arrangement. A similar study for Alfvén waves in plasma flows along magnetic field [21] has shown, however, that there are two types of non-reflective currents. For the currents of one type, G=G_{0} and the wave structure is described by Eq. (7). By contrast, for the currents of another type, even very similar structurally, G\neq G_{0}, the symmetry with respect to w_{1} and w_{2} permutation is broken, and the waves differ in both the speed and structure. Equation (5) is integrable in quadratures. In its general solution {\cal F}(x,t)=\!\displaystyle\int\limits_{x_{0}}^{x}\!\displaystyle\frac{{\rm d% }x_{1}}{w_{2}(x_{1})}\,\exp\left[\!-\!\displaystyle\int\limits_{x_{0}}^{x_{1}}% \!\displaystyle\frac{{\rm d}x_{2}G(x_{2})}{w_{1}(x_{2})}\right]H_{1}\left(t\!-% \!\!\displaystyle\int\limits_{x_{0}}^{x_{1}}\!\displaystyle\frac{{\rm d}x_{3}}% {w_{1}(x_{3})}\!-\!\!\displaystyle\int\limits_{x_{1}}^{x}\!\displaystyle\frac{% {\rm d}x_{3}}{w_{2}(x_{3})}\right)+H_{2}\left(t\!-\!\!\displaystyle\int\limits% _{x_{0}}^{x}\!\displaystyle\frac{{\rm d}x_{1}}{w_{2}(x_{1})}\right) (8) an arbitrary function H_{2}(Z) describes the second wave (running at speed w_{2}(x)). The argument of another arbitrary function, H_{1}(Z), is arranged in such a manner that a part of the path between x_{0} and x is passed with the speed of the first wave, w_{1}(x), and the remainder – with the speed of the second wave. In general case, the corresponding contribution to {\cal F}(x,t) describes a mutual transformation of waves in the course of their propagation. In other words, if H_{1}=0, there is the second wave only. But if H_{1}\neq 0, then both waves a generally present for any H_{2}(Z). From a physical point of view, such a fundamental difference between waves seems strange. In the case of Alfvén waves, it was possible to show that the solution (8) with properly chosen H_{2}(Z) does not contain the second wave, hence, there is no wave transformation. This fact is a consequence of the specific to Alfvén waves dependence of G on the flow parameters. Our main objective is to find out what a dependence of G on w_{1} and w_{2} should be in order that Eq. (5) will describe a pair of independently propagating waves, and what the structure these waves should have. Section 2 is devoted to a detailed analysis of the problem. The results obtained and their relation to the results of previous studies are discussed in Sec. 3."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09855v1,A Study of Spherical and Sessile Droplet Dynamics by Fluctuating Hydrodynamics,We simulate the mesoscopic dynamics of droplets formed by phase separated fluids at nanometer scales where thermal fluctuations are significant. Both spherical droplets fully immersed in a second fluid and sessile droplets which are also in contact with a solid surface are studied. Our model combines a Cahn-Hillard formulation with incompressible fluctuating hydrodynamics; for sessile droplets the fluid-solid contact angle is specified as a boundary condition. Deterministic simulations with an applied body force are used to measure the droplets’ mobility from which a diffusion coefficient is obtained using the Einstein relation. Stochastic simulations are independently used to obtain a diffusion coefficient from a linear fit of the variance of a droplet’s position with time. In some scenarios these two measurements give the same value but not in the case of a spherical droplet initialized near a slip wall or in the case of sessile droplets with large contact angles (\geq 90^{\circ}) on both slip and no-slip surfaces.,"The study of microscopic fluid droplets has received considerable attentionBonn et al.

Additionally, the interaction between nano-droplets and solid surfaces has been a subject of interest, with phenomena like wetting, spreading, and adhesion exhibiting unique features at near-molecular scales. Most of these studies have considered either the dynamics of spherical droplets floating in a medium or static sessile droplets on surfaces. There have been a number of nanoscale fluid simulations of surface wettingde Ruijter, Blake, and De Coninck (1999); Bertrand, Blake, and Coninck (2009) yet the Brownian motion of surface droplets has been investigated in only a few molecular dynamicsLi, Huang, and Li (2016); Niu, Huang, and Chen (2018); Zhao et al. (2022a) and Multiparticle Dissipative Particle DynamicChang, Sheng, and Tsao (2016); Chang et al. (2016) studies. In this paper we use a multiphase fluctuating hydrodynamic (FHD) modelChaudhri et al. (2014); Klymko et al. (2020); Gallo (2022); Zhao, Sprittles, and Lockerby (2019) to simulate fluid droplets in a fluid medium both on and near solid surfaces. The theoretical foundation of our model is the stochastic extension of the Navier-Stokes equations introduced by Landau and LifshitzLandau and Lifshitz (1959); de Zarate and Sengers (2007). In this regard it is similar to stochastic lubrication theory, which has been successful in describing capillary wave fluctuations and instabilitiesMecke (2001); Grün, Mecke, and Rauscher (2006); Zhang, Sprittles, and Lockerby (2021); Zhao et al. (2022b); Liu et al. (2023), however, our FHD formulation does not assume a thin film covering the entire surface. Our fluctuating multiphase formulation is based on the Cahn-Hillard modelCahn and Hilliard (1958); Anderson, McFadden, and Wheeler (1998) that describes a phase separated, binary liquid mixture. The deterministic form of this model is commonly applied to the study of droplet dynamics (e.g., surface impactKhatavkar et al. (2007)) and deterministic Cahn-Hillard Navier-Stokes calculations of droplet coalescence are found to be in excellent agreement with molecular dynamics simulations over the entire coalescence process, including the decay of the inertia-induced oscillation of the merged droplet Heinen et al.

Our model uses a fluid-solid boundary condition derived from a surface free energy that specifies contact angle.Jacqmin (2000); Dong (2012) As originally shown by Seppecher Seppecher (1996); Sibley et al. (2013), in the diffuse interface model sessile droplets are not pinned because there is no dynamical singularity near the contact line, in contrast to a sharp interface model that has a singularity where the interface intersects the boundary.Huh and Scriven (1971); Bonn et al. (2009); Snoeijer and Andreotti (2013) The next section outlines the model, followed by a description of the algorithm and its validation. Numerical results for the mobility and diffusion coefficient of spherical and sessile droplets are then presented for a variety of scenarios. We report the conditions for which the diffusion coefficient obtained from Einstein relation using the measured mobility matches the value from the Brownian motion of the droplets as measured in the simulations as well as conditions in which they differ. We conclude with a summary of the current work and potential future studies."

This article appeared in Phys. Fluids 36, 113342 (2024) and may be found at https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0238582.","In a recent paper (Gonzalez et al., 2023), we investigated the motion of grains within a granular bed sheared by a viscous fluid, and showed how segregation and hardening occur in the fluid- (bedload) and solid-like (creep) regions. In this paper, we inquire further into the mechanisms leading to grain segregation in a bidisperse bed, and how the forces are distributed. For that, we carried out numerical simulations at the grain scale by using CFD-DEM (computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method), with which we were able to track the positions, velocities, forces, and solid contacts underwent by each grain. We show that during the upward motion of large grains the direct action of fluid forces is significant in the middle and upper parts of the bedload layer, while only contact forces are significant in the creep layer and lower part of the bedload layer. We also show that in all cases the particles experience a moment about a -45∘ contact point (with respect to the horizontal plane) when migrating upward, whether entrained by other contacts or directly by the fluid. In addition, we show the variations in the average solid-solid contacts, and how forces caused either by solid-solid contacts or directly by the fluid are distributed within the bed. Our results provide the relationship between force propagation and reorganization of grains in sheared beds, explaining mechanisms found, for example, in river beds and landslides.","I INTRODUCTION When a granular bed is sheared by a liquid flowing under moderate shear stresses (shear forces comparable to the grains’ weight), grains are transported as bedload: a moving layer in which grains are entrained by rolling and sliding over each other [1, 2]. The bedload layer moves over a creep layer, where small and slow rearrangements of grains deform this part of the bed [3, 4]. Because the creep layer is deformed over long times, while the bedload layer presents a durable and high rate of deformation, they are described as solid- and fluid-like layers, respectively [3, 4]. Bedload in liquids is known to take place after a given threshold of the shear stress is surpassed, since below that threshold the fluid drag is not strong enough for causing grains to roll over one another (promoting motion). For conditions below that threshold, the bed has been described, until recently, as static. In addition, because shear stresses of the liquid decrease to the threshold value within the bedload layer (evaluating the shear stress profile from top to bottom), the layer beneath bedload has also been described as static [2, 5]. However, Houssais et al. [3] and Allen and Kudrolli [6] showed that that portion of the bed creeps, and that this creeping layer can exist even when shear stresses are below the threshold for bedload, i.e., without relevant grain transport (there are only rearrangements of grains). Investigating further the motion of sheared beds, Houssais et al. [3] showed that there is a continuous transition between bedload and creep, and that the transition occurs at a height characterized by the ratio between the microscopic (related to the rearrangements of grains) and macroscopic (related to the macroscopic rate of deformation) timescales. In the case of viscous liquids this ratio corresponds to the viscous number [7] I_{v}, and Houssais et al. [3] found that transition occurs at the height for which I_{v} = 10-7. The threshold for bedload is not constant, but varies over time [8]. Under constant flow velocities, the threshold stress increases with time, implying the decrease in grains’ mobility. Moreover, in cases of small applied stresses it can stop completely bedload from a certain time on. The decrease in granular mobility over time is known as bed hardening, and it is caused by (i) the reorganization of grains within the bed (happening in both mono and polydisperse beds); and, (ii) the armoring due to particle segregation in polydisperse beds, i.e., an increase in the concentration of larger particles on the bed surface, sheltering from the fluid flow the smaller (and more mobile) particles. For the reorganization of grains in a monodisperse bed, we can identify isotropic and anisotropic contributions. The isotropic contribution is that caused by purely geometric rearrangements of grains, in which grains percolate within the bed toward vacancies, leading, thus, to an increase in bed compactness. This idea has been proposed, for example, by Charru et al. [8] and Masteller and Finnegan [9], who carried out flume experiments in which they measured the decay in the mobility of a bedload layer. This decay was also measured in the field by Masteller et al. [10], who identified hardening in the bed of the Erlenbach river by analyzing a 19-year-series dataset of fluid stress and sediment transport. However, the explanation of bed hardening caused only by percolation does not suffice: there is also an anisotropic contribution due to the organization of grains in preferential directions, forming chains that percolate forces by solid-solid contacts. The formation of those force chains, and transmission of forces through a contact force network, was initially studied in the context of static or quasi-static granular matter [11, 12, 13]. In particular, Cates et al. [11] showed that fragile states where force chains are aligned in preferential directions can appear, so that a granular matter in those states jams and supports loading in such directions, but not in others, while Bi et al. [13] showed that granular matter is prone to fragile states and shear jamming (when external shear stresses are applied) at particle fractions lower than those necessary for jamming by an isotropic compression. Later, Cúñez et al. [14] investigated experimentally the time evolution of the structure of a granular bed sheared by a viscous fluid. In their experiments, the bed was submitted to different shear cycles, with and without variations in direction, in order to inquire into the formation and breakage of contact chains. They showed that, when sheared by a viscous flow in a constant direction during a certain period, an anisotropic structure appears, but this structure is broken by reversing the flow direction, while the bed compaction, which corresponds to the isotropic hardening, is not affected. This implies a decay in sediment transport if the fluid flow is sustained in one direction, and the recovery of a portion, corresponding to the anisotropic structure, if the flow is reversed. The portion due to compaction is only recovered if the shear is strong enough for dilating the bed. Concerning polydisperse beds, the migration of larger particles toward the bed surface leads to size armoring: smaller particles become sheltered from regions where the flow velocities are higher [15]. For this reason, some of previous studies investigated grain segregation in bidisperse bedload and debris flow [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 4]. In particular, Rousseau et al. [18] investigated the upward motion of a single particle inserted in a bedload layer consisting of smaller grains, and showed that its upward motion has two distinct phases: an intermittent and slow motion from deeper regions within the bedload, followed by a fast motion to the bed surface (later, Gonzalez et al. [4] conjectured that the first phase corresponds to the limit between the creep and bedload layers). Ferdowsi et al. [20] investigated segregation and hardening in a bidisperse bed sheared by a steady viscous flow by carrying out experiments in which the ratio between the solid and fluid densities S was 1.13 (close to unity), while in nature S \approx 2.65 (water and sand). In addition, they performed numerical simulations for the grains only (without fluid), in which the particles were sheared by an imposed boundary condition. They found that in deeper regions creep leads to a slow segregation in a diffusion-like manner, while closer to the surface bedload leads to a fast, shear-dependent segregation, in agreement with the results of Rousseau et al. [18]. Both Zhou et al. [16] and Cui et al. [17] investigated the effect of an interstitial fluid in particle segregation, the former for debris flows and the latter for shear flows, and found that segregation decreases with increasing the fluid viscosity. They proposed that the fluid diminishes particle-particle contacts and dampens particle fluctuations (an effect that increases with viscosity), weakening, thus, particle segregation. In a recent paper [4], we investigated experimentally bed hardening and particle segregation in a bidisperse bed sheared by a viscous liquid, for the case S = 2.7 (close to values found in nature). Each experimental run was carried out for 140 hours and we used refractive index matching, allowing measurements of both bedload and creep in a plane far from the channel walls (a plane inside the bed). Among other findings, we showed that there exist diffusive, advective and constrained regions, that segregation occurs within the bedload layer and in the 5% topmost region of the creep layer (at least for the total duration of our experiments), that most of segregation occurs during the very first stages of the flow, that bed hardening becomes stronger while bedload and creep weaken along time, and we proposed characteristic times for segregation and hardening. In our experiments, the creep-bedload transition occurred at I_{v} \approx 2 \times 10-8, instead of 10-7. For the moment, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a real understanding of the forces driving the larger particles upward. For instance, mechanisms of kinetic sieving, for which an interstitial fluid would hinder segregation, have been proposed, but no measurements of the solid-solid contact forces and of the fluid forces acting on each grain have been reported. Measurements of the forces caused by the fluid would help understanding its real role (of promoting or hindering segregation), while those of contact forces would explain if there is kinetic sieving or other mechanism pushing large grains upward. In addition, the knowledge of the magnitude and direction of forces would show if vertical forces act directly on the segregating particle, or if horizontal components make then roll over specific contact points (moving, thus, upward). The previous studies have advanced our knowledge on segregation and hardening, but important questions on the mechanics of hardening and segregation remain, however, to be answered. For example, what are the magnitudes of forces acting on grains being segregated? What are the relative contributions of forces due directly to the fluid and to solid-solid contacts? How are solid-solid contacts distributed around segregating particles, and how they evolve as those particles move upward? And how the network of contact forces varies along time? In this paper, we aim to answer these questions by carrying out numerical simulations at the grain scale of a bidisperse bed sheared by a viscous fluid. We made use of CFD-DEM (computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method), and, because we computed the motion of each grain at all times, we tracked the positions, velocities, forces, and solid contacts underwent by each one of them. For the larger grains moving upward, we show that the direct action of fluid forces is significant in the middle and upper parts of the bedload layer, while only contact forces are significant in the creep layer and lower part of the bedload layer. We also show that those grains experience a moment about a -45∘ contact point (with respect to the horizontal plane) whether entrained by other contacts or directly by the fluid. In addition, we present the variations in the average solid-solid contacts, and how forces caused either directly by the fluid or solid-solid contacts are distributed within the bed. In the following, Sec. II presents the fundamental equations and numerical setup, Sec. III shows the results and discussion, and Sec. IV concludes the paper."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10426v1,Exploitation-exploration transition in the physics of fluid-driven branching,"Self-organized branching structures can emerge spontaneously as interfacial instabilities in both simple and complex fluids, driven by the interplay between bulk material rheology, boundary constraints, and interfacial forcing. In our experiments, injecting dye between a source and a sink in a Hele-Shaw cell filled with a yield-stress fluid reveals an abrupt transition in morphologies as a function of injection rate. Slow injection leads to a direct path connecting the source to the sink, while fast injection leads to a rapid branching morphology that eventually converges to the sink. This shift from an exploitative (direct) to an exploratory (branched) strategy resembles search strategies in living systems; however, here it emerges in a simple physical system from a combination of global constraints (fluid conservation) and a switch-like local material response. We show that the amount of fluid needed to achieve breakthrough is minimal at the transition, and that there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy in these arborization patterns. Altogether, our study provides an embodied paradigm for fluidic computation driven by a combination of local material response (body) and global boundary conditions (environment).","References Saffman and Taylor [1958] P.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10320v1,Ghost states underlying spatial and temporal patterns: how non-existing invariant solutions control nonlinear dynamics,"Close to a saddle-node bifurcation, when two invariant solutions collide and disappear, the behavior of a dynamical system can closely resemble that of a solution which is no longer present at the chosen parameter value. For bifurcating equilibria in low-dimensional ODEs, the influence of such ‘ghosts’ on the temporal behavior of the system, namely delayed transitions, has been studied previously. We consider spatio-temporal PDEs and characterize the phenomenon of ghosts by defining representative state-space structures, which we term ‘ghost states,’ as minima of appropriately chosen cost functions. Using recently developed variational methods, we can compute and parametrically continue ghost states of equilibria, periodic orbits, and other invariant solutions. We demonstrate the relevance of ghost states to the observed dynamics in various nonlinear systems including chaotic maps, the Lorenz ODE system, the spatio-temporally chaotic Kuramoto–Sivashinsky PDE, the buckling of an elastic arc, and 3D Rayleigh–Bénard convection.","Characterizing dynamical systems from a geometrical point of view provides a powerful approach to complex nonlinear systems, where obtaining analytical or closed-form solutions is typically impossible. In this approach, the state of the system at a given time is viewed as a ‘point,’ and its evolution is viewed as a ‘trajectory’ within an abstract, possibly very high-dimensional, and often formally infinite-dimensional state space. Instead of describing the behavior of individual solutions for given initial conditions, a geometrical approach characterizes the dynamics in terms of the topology of the ensemble of all these trajectories, known as the phase portrait of the system. The idea for such a geometrical approach was initiated in the late nineteenth century [1, 2], which later became a key element in the study of deterministic chaos [3]. Thanks to advances in computational resources and methods over the past three decades, this approach has been successfully transferred from low-dimensional dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to those governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The function space of a PDE is infinite-dimensional, which, in discretized form, results in finite but very high-dimensional problems. Examples of such PDE systems include fluid flows [4, 5] and nonlinear optics [6, 7], among others, where a geometrical approach has proven to be particularly useful. A geometrical approach aims first to characterize how general trajectories are organized within the state space of a dynamical system, and then to discover how this organization changes as the control parameters of the system are varied. The shape of the general trajectories is determined by special trajectories corresponding to dynamically invariant solutions with a simple dependence on time. The simplest of these invariant solutions include steady states, where the system does not evolve over time, and periodic orbits, where the state recurs exactly after a given period. These invariant solutions might be dynamically unstable and, thus, never realized naturally in a numerical simulation or a laboratory experiment. However, their local dynamics and the dynamical connections between them dictate the shape of the other trajectories. When the control parameters of a dynamical system are varied, a geometrical description is typically concerned with bifurcations. A bifurcation is the appearance of a topologically nonequivalent phase portrait at precise parameter values [8]. This topological change involves the appearance or disappearance of fixed points, periodic orbits, or more complex invariant sets, or changes in their stability properties. A bifurcation is local if its associated topological change can be detected within any small neighborhood of the invariant solution involved in the bifurcation; if this change cannot be identified within small neighborhoods of the invariant solution, then the bifurcation is global. Through a local bifurcation, the shape and dynamical properties of trajectories outside a small neighborhood around the involved invariant solution do not change immediately. Consequently, whenever two invariant solutions collide and annihilate in a saddle-node (fold) bifurcation, the properties of these solutions are still ‘felt’ by the dynamics even though the solutions are not present anymore. This phenomenon is called the ‘ghost’ of the saddle-node bifurcation [9]. When two fixed points collide in a saddle-node bifurcation, slow evolution emerges in the ghost region as the key remaining property of the disappeared equilibria. The ghost region attracts and slows down the flow of nearby trajectories, delaying their transition to another attracting region in the state space. As the control parameter approaches the bifurcation value, the time spent in the vicinity of the ghost (or, equivalently, the transition time needed for the system to pass the ghost and move to some other equilibrium state) increases and diverges in a predictable manner. The scaling of the transition time with the distance from the bifurcation point in the parameter space has been extensively studied before [10, 11, 12]. Some authors [11, 13], particularly in quantum mechanics [14, 15], interpret ghosts by extending the real-valued state space of the dynamics to the space of complex-valued state variables. In this picture, two fixed points in the real-valued subspace collide and disappear from that subspace, giving rise to two repelling fixed points outside the real-valued subspace. The effect of these complex-valued repellers on the real-valued subspace, i.e., the original state space of the system, is what we identify as the ghost phenomenon. Such an approach, however, does not generalize to very complicated systems such as PDEs. Ghosts of equilibrium solutions have been investigated across a variety of applications. These include electronic circuits [16], population dynamics and catalytic hypercycles of biochemical reactions [17], the buckling of elastic solid structures [18], and understanding and predicting financial crises [19, 20], to name a few. Ghosts of equilibria play a significant role in so-called critical transitions: when the control parameter of a system, which is at a stable equilibrium state, is changed slowly toward and then beyond a critical value, where the equilibrium solution disappears through a saddle-node bifurcation or loses stability through other bifurcations, the system transitions to a new attracting region of the state space. In the case of a saddle-node bifurcation, the transition time is controlled by the ghost. This phenomenon is known as a critical transition, and the critical threshold is often referred to as the tipping point. The significance of a critical transition is that the new equilibrium state may be undesirable while, due to strong hysteresis, the transition cannot be reversed immediately by returning to a parameter value for which the desirable equilibrium exists again [21, 22]. Recently, Calsina et al. [23] considered a one-dimensional (1D) PDE model for a spatially extended population dynamics. They studied how the strength of the diffusion term in their model affects the delayed transition times to extinction. The transition time is governed by the ghost, as the parameter value is chosen close to a saddle-node bifurcation through which two other equilibria disappear and leave the uniform zero as the only attracting solution. However, the majority of previous research has investigated simple ODE systems. In this work, we formalize the ghost phenomenon by defining representative state-space structures without the necessity of being asymptotically close to the saddle-node bifurcation point in the parameter space. We term these representative structures the ‘ghost states.’ Characterizing the ghost phenomenon in terms of the representative ghost states enables us to follow three main objectives that have not been fully addressed previously. First, unlike previous works that study the ghost phenomenon as the system approaches the bifurcation point in the parameter space, we are interested in this phenomenon as the system moves away from it, so that less time is expected to be spent in the ghost region. The ghost states enable us to investigate how the ghost region evolves and whether it remains relevant to the dynamics as the control parameter is varied further from the bifurcation value. Secondly, we are interested in the ghost phenomenon in spatially extended dynamical systems governed by PDEs, such as fluid flows. We aim to explore the relevance of ghosts to both the spatial and temporal properties of the dynamics, rather than solely the temporal characteristics of delayed transitions, which have been the primary focus of previous studies. If the numerical computation of the ghost states can be scaled to high-dimensional problems, as will be demonstrated, the proposed characterization of the ghost phenomenon can be applied to high-dimensional discretizations of PDEs as well as low-dimensional ODEs. Finally, in addition to equilibrium solutions, we are interested in the ghosts resulting from the saddle-node bifurcation of time-varying invariant solutions, which has not been explored previously. We propose a family of methods that, based on a single unifying idea, defines and computes the ghost states for different types of invariant solutions. This enables us to pursue the previous two objectives for the ghosts of invariant solutions of various types. Specifically, we study the ghosts of periodic orbits as well as equilibria in the present work. We define the ghost state in the space of all sets that have the same topological structure as the invariant solutions involved in the saddle-node bifurcation. For the ghosts of equilibria and periodic orbits, this space includes all points and all loops in the state space, respectively. Within the respective search space, we formulate invariant solutions as the global minima (zeros) of a suitably defined non-negative cost function. Following this formulation, we define the ghost states as the non-zero minima of the cost function, which lift from zero as soon as the control parameter passes the bifurcation value. As the control parameter approaches the bifurcation value, the minimum value of the cost function decreases to zero, and the ghost state becomes the invariant solution itself, by construction and as expected. We demonstrate that as the control parameter is varied further from the bifurcation value, the ghost state captures the essential properties of the ghost phenomenon. Defined as such, the ghost of an equilibrium solution represents the locally slowest point in the state space at the chosen parameter value, and the ghost of a periodic orbit represents the best-fit loop to the vector field induced by the governing equations. A recently developed family of variational methods [24, 25, 26, 27] enables us to apply this approach to high-dimensional dynamical systems, including discretizations of PDEs. However, the cost functions whose minima represent the ghost states are not uniquely defined. Therefore, the ghost states are not purely a property of the dynamical system, and their exact properties depend on the specific choice of the cost function. Nevertheless, we will see that the ghost states defined based on different cost functions consistently capture the characteristics of the ghost phenomenon, providing important insight into the dynamics of a system. One particular application of ghosts is to intermittent chaos. In some instances (the type-1 transition of Pomeau and Manneville [28]), intermittent chaos is preceded by the saddle-node bifurcation of a periodic orbit. The trajectories of the subsequent chaotic attractor intermittently visit the region of the state space where the solutions formerly existed—the ghost of the bifurcation. We compute the ghost of such a periodic orbit in the Lorenz system. We demonstrate that, compared to the periodic orbit at the bifurcation point, the ghost state provides a better match with the regions of the state space frequently visited by the intermittent chaos at the studied parameter value. This paper proceeds as follows: in Sec. II, we present the mathematical background of ghosts. Section III details the general principles of the family of methods we have developed. In Sec. IV, we present several examples of applying our methods to problems of various complexities, to show the power but also the pitfalls of our methods. In Sec. V, we apply our methods to the three-dimensional (3D) Rayleigh–Bénard convection problem. We give concluding remarks in Sec. VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09620v1,Melting of floating ice cylinders in fresh and saline environments,"We experimentally investigated the melting of floating ice cylinders. Experiments were carried out in an aquarium, with ice cylinders with radii between 5\text{\,}\mathrm{cm}\text{/} and 12\text{\,}\mathrm{cm}\text{/}, floating horizontally with their axis perpendicular to gravity. The water in the aquarium was at room temperature, with salinities ranging from 0\text{\,}\mathrm{g}\text{/}\mathrm{L} to 35\text{\,}\mathrm{g}\text{/}\mathrm{L}. These conditions correspond to Rayleigh numbers in the range 10{}^{5}\lesssim Ra \lesssim 109. The relative density and thus the floating behaviour could be varied by employing ice made of H2O–D2O mixtures. In addition, we explored a two-layer stable stratification. We studied the morphological evolution of the cross-section of the cylinders, and explained it through the interaction with the convective flow. The cylinders only capsize in fresh water but not when the ambient is saline. This behaviour can be explained using geometrical arguments. We modelled the oscillatory motion of the cylinders after a capsize as a damped non-linear oscillator. The downward plume of the ice cylinders follows the expected scalings for a line-source plume. The plume’s Reynolds number scales with Rayleigh number in two regimes, namely Re \propto Ra1/2 for Ra <\mathcal{O}(10^{7}) and Re \propto Ra1/3 for Ra >\mathcal{O}(10^{7}), and the heat transfer (nondimensional as Nusselt number) scales as Nu \propto Ra1/3. These scaling relations hold irrespectively of the initial size or the water salinity. Our results can qualitatively be connected to natural phenomena occurring in fjords and around isolated icebergs.","The lack of understanding of ice-sheet melting dynamics is the largest source of uncertainty in the projections of sea-level rise (Robel et al., 2019). The complexity of the phase-change physics and the uncertainties in the parametrisations (e.g. for albedo changes and for the interactions of the ice with ocean currents) implies that most of today’s climate models poorly model the sea ice variations (Stroeve et al., 2007; Malyarenko et al., 2020). The different contributors to sea level rise (among which, thermal expansion and ice sheets) are commonly assumed to be independent of each other, and this is deemed to be the reason for an underestimation of the uncertainty in sea-level projections (Le Bars, 2018). One of the processes that connect the ocean with ice structures is calving at the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS), where ice chunks up to hundreds of meters of length (Orlowski, 2012) detach from the edge of a glacier, becoming icebergs. On top of being a major component in both the AIS and GrIS mass balance (Bigg et al., 2014; Cenedese & Straneo, 2023), icebergs and their freshwater fluxes have been proved to be responsible for the global climate (Silva et al., 2006), through a feedback mechanism which may contribute to an accelerated ice mass loss (Schloesser et al., 2019). Oceanographic surveys are precautionally kept far from icebergs, due to the unpredictability of capsizing events, thus limiting the data collection in close proximity of icebergs (Yankovsky & Yashayaev, 2014). Correspondingly, limited research has been conducted on freely floating melting objects. A historically significant branch of studies developed in the second half of the 20th century, when the interest in harvesting icebergs for freshwater motivated research on their melting during towing, see e.g. Hult & Ostrander (1973) and Russell-Head (1980). More recently, growing interest in iceberg research led to experimental and numerical investigations on the capsizing of icebergs. Burton et al. (2012) and Bonnet et al. (2020) model natural icebergs as plastic rectangular cuboids, with well-defined aspect ratios, but excluded melting. Their research focuses on the capsizing events: how it is affected by the aspect ratio, how energy is released by a calving event, and how the capsizing triggers mixing and flow around the iceberg. The essential physics of an isolated iceberg melting in the ocean is that of a Stefan problem (Rubinstein, 1971), where a cold ice mass lays on top of a warm, saline water reservoir. Three fields control the meltrate of the ice: temperature, salinity, and velocity of the fluid. First and foremost, the melting temperature of the water is a function of the salinity T_{\text{melt}}=T_{\text{melt}}(S) and decreases with increasing salinity. Secondly, the Lewis number (Le =\kappa_{S}/\kappa_{T}, the ratio between saline diffusivity and thermal diffusivity) controls the relative thickness of the thermal and boundary layers. Lastly, the density of water is itself a function of temperature and salinity, \rho_{\infty}=\rho_{\infty}(T,S). The interactions between the melting and the water density are mutual, with the temperature and salinity fields that are affected by the melting ice, and the resulting density differences that set the water in motion, advecting water to the ice surface, whose temperature and salinity affect the melting itself. Additional complexity arises if the free surface around the ice is considered, and the ice is unconstrained. In fact, in this configuration, the ice floats expose only a fraction of their volumes to air, and the floating behavior is controlled by the ratio between ice and water densities, \Lambda=\rho_{\text{ice}}/\rho_{\infty}. The lower heat transfer rate with air compared to water causes a significant difference in the meltrate between the submerged ice and the ice exposed to air. Furthermore, the ice’s motion can be both in response to its own morphological evolution and to the liquid’s motion, with the ice exposing different parts of itself to the liquid, depending on its orientation. Hitherto, most experimental lab-scale research has focused on the melting of submerged ice. The studies on boundary layers of submerged slabs are extensive (Josberger & Martin, 1981; Carey & Gebhart, 1982), with recent particular interest in the appearance of scallops, both in melting and dissolution problems (Davies Wykes et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2020). At the same time, melting in symmetrical domains has received interest due to the relative simplicity of theoretical description of the heat transfer. For this reason, Fukusako et al. (1992) and Yamada et al. (1997) have investigated the melting of a fully-submerged fixed horizontal ice cylinder, for different ambient temperature and salinity conditions. They grew ice around a cooled pipe in a water bath and then let it melt, imaging the cross section with a SLR camera and visualising the flow using streakline photography. They concluded that the flow profile in the vicinity of the cylinder was laminar and bidirectional in the lower portion of the cylinder, and turbulent unidirectional in the upper portion of the cylinder, with the flow severely affecting the meltrate. Another line of research that has run in parallel to the aforementioned ones, is the study of plumes around a heated submerged object. The most relevant references here are the work of Grafsrønningen et al. (2011) and Grafsrønningen & Jensen (2012, 2017), who extensively investigated the plumes above a horizontal heated cylinder, both numerically and experimentally. They control the Rayleigh number by changing the temperature difference between the cylinder and the fluid, allowing them to explore Rayleigh numbers from 2.05\text{\times}{10}^{7} to 7.94\text{\times}{10}^{7}. To the best of our knowledge, the only study that integrated the analysis of a floating melting object with a theoretical description of the heat transfer is by Hosseini & Rahaeifard (2009). The authors put an ice cylinder to float in a tank, and measured its cross-sectional width constraining it between vertical wires and measuring the distance between the wires. They find that the Rayleigh number (in their case, Ra =\mathcal{O}(10^{7})) scales with the Nusselt number with a 1/3 power law, for experiments conducted in freshwater. We extend their results by analysing images of the cross-section, thus being able to deliver a more complete morphological analysis. In several natural circumstances, icebergs (or ice chunks, of all sizes) melt in stratified waters. The most studied example is the one of Greenlandic fjords, where icebergs calve from a glacier and accumulate in the fjord, where they melt, releasing cold fresh water, which accumulates on top of of the warmer saline water. The draft of icebergs is various, and with it the fraction of mass immersed in each layer (Jackson et al., 2014; FitzMaurice et al., 2016). A similar stratification mechanism applies to open-water icebergs, as described in existing studies on plumes around icebergs (e.g. Helly et al. (2011); Yankovsky & Yashayaev (2014)). As described in Yankovsky & Yashayaev (2014), the meltwater from an iceberg accumulates around the iceberg itself, and the iceberg will find itself in a stably-stratified two-layer environment, where the less saline and thus lighter top layer has been produced by the accumulation of the iceberg’s meltwater itself. In this paper we will focus on three aspects of the floating melting problem. First, how do size and salinity affect the morphology of the ice? And how can the local meltrate be derived from the flow and boundary layer characteristics? The melt characteristics of the ice are a direct consequence of the local heat transfer with the water, which is a function of salinity, temperature, and velocity fields. This leads to the second point: How can the interactions of the ice with the surroundings be described? What are the terms that dominate the heat transfer between the ice and the water? How does the plume of the ice vary in depth, as a function of the water’s density? And what are the scaling relations that summarise the physics? Lastly, we investigate the dynamic stability against rotations of the object. Both uneven melting and flow asymmetries can give rise to changes in the rotational stability of the object: What equations describe the motion? Can the stability of the ice be quantified? This article is organised as follows. In Section 2 we provide our experimental methods. In Section 3 we develop theoretical interpretations to the morphological evolution, convective heat transfers, plume, rotational stability and rotations. In Section 4 we present and analyse our experimental results and put them in the theoretical framework. In Section 5 we extend our findings to the more general two-layers stable stratifications. Lastly, in Section 6 conclusions and an outlook are provided."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09545v1,Equation-informed data-driven identification of flow budgets and dynamics,"Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an indispensable method of fluid modelling in engineering applications, reducing the need for physical prototypes and testing for tasks such as design optimisation and performance analysis. Depending on the complexity of the system under consideration, models ranging from low to high fidelity can be used for prediction, allowing significant speed-up. However, the choice of model requires information about the actual dynamics of the flow regime. Correctly identifying the regions/clusters of flow that share the same dynamics has been a challenging research topic to date. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid approach to flow clustering. It consists of characterising each sample point of the system with equation-based features, i.e. features are budgets that represent the contribution of each term from the original governing equation to the local dynamics at each sample point. This was achieved by applying the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical systems (SINDy) method pointwise to time evolution data. The method proceeds with equation-based clustering using the Girvan-Newman algorithm. This allows the detection of communities that share the same physical dynamics. The algorithm is implemented in both Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks. In the Lagrangian, i.e. dynamic approach, the clustering is performed on the trajectory of each point, allowing the change of clusters to be represented also in time. The performance of the algorithm is first tested on a flow around a cylinder. The construction of the dynamic clusters in this test case clearly shows the evolution of the wake from the steady state solution through the transient to the oscillatory solution. Dynamic clustering was then successfully tested on turbulent flow data. Two distinct and well-defined clusters were identified and their temporal evolution was reconstructed.","Today, computer-aided simulation is an indispensable part of the engineering and design process. Simulations make it possible to understand and analyse the behaviour of such complex systems, paving the way for solutions to optimise their performance and improve their efficiency. Despite their general reliability, simulations may not achieve the desired accuracy if the appropriate model is not selected to analyse a particular physical state. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an example where the results are directly linked to the fidelity of the model selected by the user, such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Each model is designed to have a certain level of complexity/accuracy and is suitable for specific flow dynamics. For example, RANS models have reduced complexity and can make accurate predictions for specific turbulent flow configurations for which they are calibrated. Conversely, DNS is designed for computationally intensive computations of high accuracy predictions with an additional level of complexity; i.e. unsteady flows, wall bounded turbulence, to name a few examples. Therefore, understanding the type of dynamics involved in each region of the system is crucial to avoid unnecessary application of resource-intensive models such as DNS to flows that could be predicted just as accurately by lower fidelity models [1]. While traditionally a single model has been used to predict the entire flow dynamics within a system, researchers have also investigated the possibility of decomposing different regions of the same system based on the dominant flow dynamics. Hybrid RANS-LES simulations, for example, can be considered as one such effort [2], [3]. Following this approach, simpler RANS models are used in less complex regions and higher fidelity LES models are used in complex turbulent regions, thus optimising accuracy together with computational cost. However, the main challenge is how to make this regional clustering automatic and not user-specified. The solution lies in the simulations themselves. While accurate simulations remain computationally expensive, they are a source of large and detailed data. Given recent advances in machine learning and the availability of data, researchers have naturally turned to data-driven techniques for clustering flow regimes. This data-driven approach allows the automatic identification of dynamically distinct regions for the application of appropriate modelling techniques. However, purely data-driven techniques for dynamic identification are sometimes considered to be a black-box approach (fidelity was described by Wiener [4]), as the dynamics are identified taking into account the response of the overall flow process. Thus, the small nuances of the underlying flow dynamics are overlooked in the identification process. In order to increase the accuracy, it seems much more constructive to find a way to incorporate some level of physical knowledge into the dynamics identification process. To this end, Brunton et. al. [5] suggested that this wealth of data could be used to derive the equations governing the existing dynamics, which can be considered as an alternative grey box approach, as some information about the underlying physics is included in the identification process. Other researchers have also explored similar identification processes using data [6], [7], [8], [9]. Such grey box approaches can lead to models that can then be integrated into control applications, as they identify the system by analysing the relationship between its inputs and outputs. Linear system identification [10], has been applied in flow control [11, 12], but led to instabilities when applied to transient measurements of nonlinear problems [12]. For transient and nonlinear environments, the nonlinear algorithms are then used to determine the existing nonlinear correlation between the underlying structures. One of these nonlinear algorithms is SINDy [5], which is capable of identifying nonlinear models from data. In SINDy, complex nonlinear dynamics are represented as a linear combination of simpler nonlinear functions. These functions have been rapidly replaced by terms from real physical equations, allowing the algorithm to incorporate relevant physical context into its calculations [13]. This method can be considered a grey box approach and has recently been applied to fluid mechanics [14], showing great promise. However, what we propose in this paper differs from pure equation identification as proposed in SINDy and its variants. Here, the aim is to cluster the important dynamics of the system by identifying the dominant terms of the governing equation and then clustering the regions accordingly. In other words, we do not aim to learn the governing equations, but rather the terms that are most active in the overall dynamics. Our approach follows what was originally proposed by [15] and is based on the idea that many regimes described by complex partial differential equations are governed by only a few nonlinear terms, allowing the creation of simpler models for specific dynamics of the system. For example, depending on the application and regime of interest, the Navier-Stokes equation can be simplified using dimensionless parameters, modified to neglect the effect of compressibility and modelled using turbulence models. Identifying and locating the different dynamics present in complex physical systems, and ultimately understanding how they affect the overall solution, can increase the accuracy of the numerical model used. In other areas, such as reactive flows, this idea has been successfully used to cluster different flow regimes based on the level of detailed chemical mechanisms required to represent the interaction of flow and chemistry [16]. However, unlike [15], we use graph clustering, which has been shown to be suitable for such problems in the past [7], [6], [17]. More importantly, we propose a novel algorithm to dynamically evolve the clusters, moving from a conventional Eulerian framework used in such identification algorithms to a Lagrangian alternative. This would make the algorithm more suitable for intermittent problems or unsteady transient problems where the significant dynamic regions might evolve over time. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the basics of the identification algorithm in a Eulerian framework, where the sample points are kept stationary in physical space and the temporal dynamics are discovered locally at each point, leading to the algorithm termed BIA. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using an academic test case of flow around a cylinder. Section 3 then discusses the modification of the algorithm by considering a Lagrangian frame of reference, where each sample point is allowed to move in the physical domain and the inference is performed in this moving frame of reference for each point, leading to a dynamic version of the algorithm; i.e. Dynamic-BIA. Following this strategy, the dynamically distinct regions of the flow are allowed to evolve as the flow evolves. Finally, in section 4, the dynamic algorithm is applied to a turbulent stratified flow to identify different regions of dynamic significance. Conclusions and future work are then discussed in section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09476v2,Graph Neural Networks and Differential Equations: A hybrid approach for data assimilation of fluid flows,"This study presents a novel hybrid approach that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations to enhance the accuracy of mean flow reconstruction across a range of fluid dynamics applications. Traditional purely data-driven Neural Networks (NNs) models, often struggle maintaining physical consistency. Moreover, they typically require large datasets to achieve reliable performances. The GNN framework, which naturally handles unstructured data such as complex geometries in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is here integrated with RANS equations as a physical baseline model. The methodology leverages the adjoint method, enabling the use of RANS-derived gradients as optimization terms in the GNN training process. This ensures that the learned model adheres to the governing physics, maintaining physical consistency while improving the prediction accuracy. We test our approach on multiple CFD scenarios, including cases involving generalization with respect to the Reynolds number, sparse measurements, denoising and inpainting of missing portions of the mean flow. The results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of the reconstructed mean flow compared to purely data-driven models, using limited amounts of data in the training dataset. The key strengths of this study are the integration of physical laws into the training process of the GNN, and the ability to achieve high-accuracy predictions with a limited amount of data, making this approach particularly valuable for applications in fluid dynamics where data is often scarce.","In recent years the integration of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms into Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) has seen a significant boost, driven by the increasing efficiency of ML models in processing large dataset and their impressive inference and predicting capabilities. Literature is already disseminated with different effective ways to combine ML algorithms into CFD, as can be found in the annual review Brunton et al. (2020) and in Vinuesa and Brunton (2022). These various applications are ranging from addressing the closure problem of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations to optimization problems. A broader overview for the first application can be found in Duraisamy et al. (2019) and Beck and Kurz (2021). In Ling and Templeton (2015), authors used classification methods to identify regions of high uncertainty in RANS fluid flow predictions. In Ströfer and Xiao (2021), authors combined NN with a Spalart-Allmaras turbulence baseline model to enhance fluid flow RANS predictions. However, while ML has proven to be powerful, its unconstrained use in physical models can lead to solutions that violate fundamental physical laws. Therefore, integrating ML within physical models is crucial to ensure that the learned solutions are physically plausible. This approach leads to more reliable results and interpretable models and helps maintain the integrity of the simulations. This idea leads to the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in which physical equations are part of the NN’s training process. A broad overview of the use of PINNs can be found in Cai et al. (2021). In this study we propose a novel approach by combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as our ML framework with Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations as our physical baseline model. GNNs are particularly suited for CFD problems due to their ability to naturally handle the complex, irregular geometries often encountered in fluid flow simulations. They extend traditional neural networks by considering the relationships between data points, making them ideal for capturing the particles interactions in a fluid flow system. Our primary goal is to develop an hybrid ML-CFD model to accurately reconstruct the mean flow of a fluid dynamics simulation across various application cases. Specifically, we aim to integrate RANS equations into a GNN training process, leveraging the RANS closure term as an optimization term through the adjoint method. Adjoint method is a powerful mathematical tool used in CFD to compute gradients efficiently, which are essential in a classical optimization process. We use the adjoint method to ensure that the gradients used in the GNN training process are obtained through a deterministic physical model. With this approach we can train our ML model integrating physical consistency in it, leading to improved performance and accuracy. We test our approach on different CFD scenarios showing remarkable improvements in mean flow reconstruction accuracy for different learning tasks as compared to the non physics constrained counterpart. The reminder of this article is structured as follows: the mathematical framework is described in Sec. 2. Specifically, the physical baseline model for the CFD simulations is detailed in Sec. 2.1 while the adjoint optimization method in Sec. 2.2. Sec. 3 describes the ML framework, detailing the GNN architecture (Sec. 3.1), the dataset preprocessing (Sec. 3.2) and the training algorithm (Sec. 3.3). We continue, then, by presenting our innovative approach to combine these two frameworks in Sec. 4. Results, along with the different application cases, are presented in Sec. 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09367v1,Goal-oriented Feature Extraction: a novel approach for enhancing data-driven surrogate model,"Surrogate model can replace the parametric full-order model (FOM) by an approximation model, which can significantly improve the efficiency of optimization design and reduce the complexity of engineering systems. However, due to limitations in efficiency and accuracy, the applications of high-dimensional surrogate models are still challenging. In the present study, we propose a method for extracting hidden features to simplify high-dimensional problems, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of surrogate models. We establish a goal-oriented feature extraction (GFE) neural network through indirect supervised learning. We constrained the distance between hidden features based on the differences in the target output. This means that in the hidden feature space, cases that are closer in distance output approximately the same, and vice versa. The proposed hidden feature learning method can significantly reduce the dimensionality and nonlinearity of the surrogate model, thereby improving modeling accuracy and generalization capability. To demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed ideas, We conducted numerical experiments on three popular surrogate models. The modeling results of typical high-dimensional mathematical cases and aerodynamic performance cases of ONERA M6 wings show that goal-oriented feature extraction significantly improves the modeling accuracy. Goal-oriented feature extraction can effectively reduce the error distribution of predicting cases and reduce the convergence and robustness differences caused by various data-driven surrogate models.","In recent years, computer simulation methods, which are often used to solve physical problems via mathematical models and computer code, have begun to play a crucial role in engineering problems[1],[2]. With the emergence of a large number of numerical simulation results, data-driven methods have developed rapidly to enhance the understanding and application capabilities of engineering data[3],[4],[5],[6]. The aerodynamic performance of aircraft has a significant impact on the economy and safety of aviation engineering. However, the aerodynamic performance data of aircraft is characterized by high dimensionality and nonlinearity. Despite the availability of advanced computational and experimental conditions, the excessive cost makes it difficult to rely solely on numerical simulation and experimental techniques to generate complete aerodynamic data, optimize aerodynamic shapes, and explore the design space of a flight vehicle[7]. Surrogate model can replace the parametric full-order model (FOM) by an approximation model, which can significantly improve the efficiency of optimization design and reduce the complexity of engineering systems. Due to the increasing relevance of data-driven approaches in computational science and engineering[3], data-driven surrogate models provided an engineered analytical method for rapid simulation of aerodynamic performance[8],[9]. Data-driven surrogate models have been widely applied in the optimization, evaluation, and verification of aerodynamic performance for aircraft[10]. Researchers have developed a series of surrogate models and applied them to aeronautical engineering, such as Polynomial Response Surfaces[11],[12], Support Vector Machines (SVM)[13],[14], Kriging method[15],[16], Random Forrest (RF)[17] and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)[18],[19]. Based on the Kriging model, Raul et al.[15] established a surrogate model from airfoil shape to dynamic stall aerodynamic characteristics. By constructing a surrogate model with six design variables, they achieved optimized design of the dynamic characteristics for the airfoil. Zhang et al.[10] established a multi-fidelity optimization design framework using multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN). Using this architecture, they achieved efficient optimization design of three-dimensional geometric shapes. Shirvani et al.[20] proposed a deep learning based aerodynamic inverse design method, witch significantly expanded the scope of use of the surrogate models. Based on Co-kriging method, Yamazaki et al.[21] proposed a derived-enhanced variable-fertility surrogate model. Numerical examples show that this method can be used for efficient aerodynamic data modeling and accurate uncertainty analysis, with lower cost requirements compared to other methods. Overall, the emergence of data-driven methods has made it possible to learn low-dimensional features from high-dimensional sparse datasets and train accurate prediction models using large amounts of data. Li et al.[22] reviewed the application scenarios of deep learning methods in the field of aerodynamic shape optimization and affirmed the important potential of machine learning methods. Kou and Zhang [23] reviewed the unsteady data-driven models in the field of aeroelasticity and provided evaluation indicators for data-driven models. Brunton et al.[9] proposed data-driven aerospace engineering, believing that data-driven models will further influence the understanding and solution of engineering problems. Alizadeh et al.[1] reviewed the characteristics of data-driven surrogate models and their selection criteria in engineering problems. In the surrogate modeling process, addressing the problem of size, which is related to the number of variables, is among the greatest challenges[1]. In aviation engineering, the dimensionality of the geometric design space is a parameter that needs to be carefully considered. The traditional geometric parameterization methods are high-dimensional and complex, which brings great difficulties to the construction of surrogate models. In order to further reduce the difficulty in modeling surrogate models, dimensionality reduction methods have been proposed[24]. Dimensionality reduction algorithms have been used for feature extraction, selection, and elimination to simplify surrogate models for high-dimensional problems. The commonly used dimensionality reduction (DR) methods include Principal Component Analysis (PCA)[25],[26], Partial Least Squares (PLS)[27], Active Subspace Methods (ASM)[28], Auto-encoders[29] and manifold learning[30],[31]. Combining feature extraction with surrogate modeling, Bird et al.[32] proposed to predict the finite element analysis results of a jet engine compressor blade. Based on ASM, Li et al.[33] have achieved optimized design of wings with high-dimensional parameters, resulting in improved efficiency. By integrating PCA with Global Local Neural Networks (GLNN), Moni et al.[34] have achieved the construction of a surrogate model for surface pressure, forces, and moments in reduced dimensional parameter space. Xiao et al.[35] proposed to use the Isometric Feature Mapping (ISOMAP) method to construct geometric space and implemented aerodynamic shape inverse design of the wing. In most of current research, dimensionality reduction models and surrogate models are considered separately, making it difficult to improve the global effectiveness of surrogate models from the perspective of dimensionality reduction models. Indeed, these DR and data-driven surrogate methods are still evolving and will continue to be applied to high-dimensional problems in engineering fields[24]. Despite extensive work on construction methods for surrogate model, there are still two important issues that need to be addressed in data-driven approaches. One is how to construct lower dimensional features to reduce data requirements. The second is how to select appropriate modeling methods (dimensionality reduction methods and data-driven surrogate methods) to ensure the generalization capability of the surrogate model. In this study, we hope to provide a universal feature space processing criterion, which can also compensate for the differences of the generalization capability between diverse modeling methods. On this basis, we proposed a goal-oriented feature extraction method from another perspective, which significantly reduced input parameters while enhancing the generalization capability of diverse surrogate models. To overcome the loss of accuracy and efficiency caused by high-dimensional parameters in the construction of surrogate models, we proposed a goal-oriented feature extraction (GFE) method to restructure the design parameters, thereby improving the global accuracy and robustness. We proposed a neural network architecture for feature learning by constraining the distribution form of the hidden feature space. Through feature learning, we have obtained a compact representation of geometric features. Based on the features extracted by GFE, we compared the modeling capabilities of three mainstream algorithms for surrogate models. Numerical and aerospace engineering examples show that GFE effectively improves the accuracy and convergence of surrogate models, while eliminating modeling differences between different models. For data-driven surrogate models, this method is not limited to the current research object and has broad generalization. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the general problem setup is presented. Section 3 elucidates the proposed feature extraction approach and the modeling methods of surrogate models. This is followed by numerical examples and industrial examples, illustrated utilizing the proposed approach, in Section 4. Finally, the concluding remarks are provided in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09364v2,"CaLES: A GPU-accelerated solver for large-eddy simulation 
of wall-bounded flows","We introduce CaLES, a GPU-accelerated finite-difference solver designed for large-eddy simulations (LES) of incompressible wall-bounded flows in massively parallel environments. Built upon the existing direct numerical simulation (DNS) solver CaNS, CaLES relies on low-storage, third-order Runge-Kutta schemes for temporal discretization, with the option to treat viscous terms via an implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme in one or three directions. A fast direct solver, based on eigenfunction expansions, is used to solve the discretized Poisson/Helmholtz equations. For turbulence modeling, the classical Smagorinsky model with van Driest near-wall damping and the dynamic Smagorinsky model are implemented, along with a logarithmic law wall model. GPU acceleration is achieved through OpenACC directives, following CaNS-2.3.0. Performance assessments were conducted on the Leonardo cluster at CINECA, Italy. Each node is equipped with one Intel Xeon Platinum 8358 CPU (2.60 GHz, 32 cores) and four NVIDIA A100 GPUs (64 GB HBM2e), interconnected via NVLink 3.0 (200 GB/s). The inter-node communication bandwidth is 25 GB/s, supported by a DragonFly+ network architecture with NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand HDR. Results indicate that the computational speed on a single GPU is equivalent to approximately 15 CPU nodes, depending on the treatment of viscous terms and the subgrid-scale model, and that the solver efficiently scales across multiple GPUs. The predictive capability of CaLES has been tested using multiple flow cases, including decaying isotropic turbulence, turbulent channel flow, and turbulent duct flow. The high computational efficiency of the solver enables grid convergence studies on extremely fine grids, pinpointing non-monotonic grid convergence for wall-modeled LES.","Large-eddy simulation (LES) has become an important tool in the design processes of spacecraft, aircraft, automobiles, ships, and other engineering systems, for cases where traditional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models fall short. RANS models often struggle to accurately predict complex flow phenomena, such as flow separation, rotational turbulence, and three-dimensional turbulent boundary layers [1]. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) can provide accurate results but become computationally prohibitive at high Reynolds numbers due to the high mesh resolutions required. As a result, LES has gained popularity for offering a reasonable balance between computational cost and predictive accuracy, particularly for complex aerodynamic and hydrodynamic applications. In recent years, LES has been increasingly applied to external aerodynamic flows, especially at the edges of flight envelopes, such as high-lift aircraft aerodynamics [2] and iced-wing separated flows [3]. It has also been used in internal flows, including those within aircraft engines [4]. These applications establish LES as a critical component in the industry push toward Certification by Analysis [5]. Despite significant advancements, both wall models and subgrid-scale (SGS) closures for LES remain areas of active development. For wall modeling, researchers have been exploring robust models that account for more complex flows, such as laminar-turbulent transitions [6] and flow separation [7] among others. Concurrently, advancements in SGS models have been made, with some of the recent studies emphasizing robust SGS models suited to anisotropic grids [8]. It is well established that LES is significantly more computationally demanding than RANS, making the development of faster LES solvers a critical need. An efficient LES solver is not only essential for large-scale production simulations, but also invaluable for the development and testing of subgrid-scale and wall models. Indeed, as data-driven approaches and machine learning techniques are increasingly applied to turbulence modeling, the demand for efficient LES solvers becomes even more pressing. Previous studies have trained SGS models using filtered DNS data [9, 10]. However, relying on DNS data can be problematic, as the SGS tensor in implicitly filtered LES does not perfectly align with the SGS stress terms derived from the filtered Navier-Stokes equations [11]. This inconsistency is especially significant when grid sizes are significantly larger than the Kolmogorov scale, as the numerical and modeling errors can then be comparable. As a result, SGS models trained on filtered DNS data may perform well in a priori tests but fail in a posteriori assessments, whereby performance is evaluated in actual LES simulations. Consequently, research has increasingly shifted toward generating training data directly from LES, and turbulence models are optimized for accurate statistical metrics such as mean velocity and wall shear stress [12]. In the same vein, reinforcement learning has been explored for both SGS and wall modeling [13, 14]. Such strategies have been referred to as “model-consistent” approaches [15]. While these strategies show promise, they often require hundreds or even thousands of LES runs to generate training data or complete one-time training, underscoring the need for fast and efficient solvers. Moreover, the grid convergence properties of wall-modeled LES (WMLES) have become increasingly studied [16, 17], which also requires many LES runs on a series of refined meshes for thorough analysis. Fast LES solvers are therefore desirable to enable grid convergence investigations at high Reynolds numbers. Table 1 gives some popular open-source solvers used in academic research. Whereas all those solvers are capable of performing DNS for canonical flow cases, only URANOS and LESGO currently support LES capabilities. It is well-known that incompressible solvers, such as LESGO, are typically more efficient than compressible solvers like URANOS for simulations of low-Mach-number flows. This efficiency mainly derives from allowing much larger time steps when explicit time-integration schemes are used. However, a key limitation of LESGO is the absence of GPU acceleration, which restricts its scalability and efficiency on modern high-performance computing platforms. Given the high demand for LES in simulating incompressible flows, particularly for machine-learning-based turbulence modeling and grid convergence studies, the development of a GPU-accelerated incompressible LES solver is highly desirable in academia. Table 1: Open-source DNS/LES solvers for academic research. Solver Governing equations GPU-supported Purposes STREAmS-2 [18] Compressible NS Yes DNS URANOS [19] Compressible NS Yes DNS/LES AFiD [20] Incompressible NS Yes DNS LESGO [21] Incompressible NS No DNS/LES CaNS [22] Incompressible NS Yes DNS CaLES Incompressible NS Yes DNS/LES The present work introduces CaLES, a GPU-accelerated incompressible LES solver specifically designed for wall-bounded flows. CaLES builds on the capabilities of CaNS [22, 23], an open-source DNS solver known for its efficiency in solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The solver uses a fractional-step method [24]. Temporal discretization is carried out using a low-storage, third-order Runge-Kutta scheme [25]. Spatial discretization is performed using a second-order finite-difference method on staggered grids [26], which avoids odd-even decoupling phenomena and preserves energy at the discrete level in the inviscid limit [27]. The solver employs eigenfunction expansions [28] to efficiently solve the Poisson equation. GPU acceleration is achieved using a combination of CUDA Fortran and OpenACC directives, and performance benchmarks demonstrate that the code performance on 4 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs in a DGX-2 system is roughly equivalent (0.9 times slower to 1.6 times faster) to 2048 cores on state-of-the-art CPU-based supercomputers, and 3.1 to 5.6 times faster when all 16 GPUs in the DGX-2 cluster are used [22]. CaLES extends CaNS by supporting LES through the inclusion of the classical Smagorinsky model [29] with the van Driest damping function [30], and the dynamic Smagorinsky model [31, 32], along with a logarithmic-law wall model. The solver can simulate various canonical flows in Cartesian single-block domains, including isotropic turbulence, temporally-evolving turbulent boundary layers, channel flows, duct flows, cavity flows, etc. Flexibility and efficiency make it an ideal platform to develop subgrid-scale and wall models, particularly those based on machine learning techniques, and to perform grid convergence studies at high Reynolds numbers. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the governing equations, subgrid-scale models, and numerical methods. Section 3 discusses the implementation and performance of the solver. Section 4 validates the LES capabilities using decaying isotropic turbulence, turbulent channel flow, and turbulent duct flow. Finally, Section 5 provides the conclusions of this study."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09021v1,"Modeling  acoustic interactions of cavitation bubbles and
bubble clusters","We propose a low-dimensional modeling approach to simulate the dynamics, acoustic emissions and interactions of cavitation bubbles, based on a quasi-acoustic assumption. This quasi-acoustic assumption accounts for the compressibility of the medium surrounding the bubble and its finite speed of sound, whereby the potential of the acoustic wave emitted by the bubble propagates along outgoing characteristics. With these ingredients, a consistent set of equations describing the radial bubble dynamics as well as the resulting acoustic emissions and bubble-bubble interactions is obtained, which is accurate to the first order of the Mach number. This model is tested by considering several representative test cases, including the resonance behavior of multiple interacting bubbles and the response of dense mono- and polydisperse bubble clusters to a change in ambient pressure. The results are shown to be in excellent agreement with results reported in the literature. The differences associated with the finite propagation speed of the acoustic waves are observed to be most pronounced for the pressure-driven bubble dynamics in dense bubble clusters and the onset of cavitation in response to a change in ambient pressure.

Understanding the physics of cavitation is essential, as the collapse of cavitation bubbles can focus a large amount of energy and, consequently, may cause serious damage to surrounding objects Dular et al. (2019), such as tissue Salzar et al. (2017), cells in bioreactors Walls et al. (2017), or solid walls (Johnsen and Colonius, 2009). In most of these applications, bubbles are aggregated as clusters, whereby the bubbles interact with their neighbors through the generated acoustic emissions, leading to complicated dynamics that a single isolated bubble does not exhibit. For instance, the acoustic interactions delay the onset of cavitation by changing the pressure experienced by a bubble Ida (2009) or promote a more violent bubble collapse than in the case of a single bubble Wang and Brennen (1999); Matsumoto and Yoshizawa (2005); Shen et al. (2021); Deng et al. (2024). The radial dynamics of cavitation bubbles can be described by Rayleigh-Plesset (RP) equations, which are based on the seminal work of Lord Rayleigh on the collapse of an empty cavity in an incompressible liquid (Rayleigh, 1917). These RP-type equations have since been extended to include the compressibility of the liquid Gilmore (1952); Trilling (1952); Keller and Miksis (1980); Prosperetti and Lezzi (1986); Lezzi and Prosperetti (1987); Denner (2021) as well as the interactions between bubbles due to their acoustic emissions Fuster, Conoir, and Colonius (2014); Fuster (2019), although RP-type equations typically assume that the bubbles remain spherical, which is a significant limitation in practice. Nevertheless, RP-type equations have been used successfully to study pressure-driven bubble dynamics (Plesset and Prosperetti, 1977; Lauterborn and Kurz, 2010; Denner, 2024), including confinement (Fu et al., 2023), heat transfer (Stricker, Prosperetti, and Lohse, 2011; Zhou and Prosperetti, 2020), non-spherical behavior (Klapcsik and Hegedűs, 2019), and other phenomena. Even though fully resolved two-/three-dimensional numerical simulations are frequently used today to study the pressure-driven behavior of individual and multiple bubbles Folden and Aschmoneit (2023); Mnich et al. (2024); Saini et al. (2024), RP-type equations are widely used to gain a more detailed understanding of the complex nonlinear pressure-driven dynamics of individual and multiple interacting bubbles Fuster (2019); Folden and Aschmoneit (2023). Compared to fully resolved simulations, RP-type equations offer accurate solutions for spherical bubbles at a computational cost that is orders of magnitude smaller. Using RP-type equations, the bubble-bubble interactions are typically modeled as instantaneous, even when using models that account for the compressibility of the surrounding medium, such as the for instance Keller-Miksis (Keller and Miksis, 1980) or Gilmore (Gilmore, 1952) models, meaning that compressibility is not consistently taken into account. The RP-type equations governing the behavior of the bubbles, including the additional driving pressure induced by the emissions of the neighbor bubbles, can then be solved conveniently in a coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations, which is not possible if the finite propagation time between bubbles is to be considered. Fan, Li, and Fuster (2021) proposed a model where time-delayed interactions were considered as part of an RP-type model, which, however, is based on a linearized equation of motion and solved in the frequency domain. Haghi and Kolios (2022) proposed to account for the time-delay associated with a finite speed of sound by treating the Keller-Miksis equation including an acoustic interaction term as a delay differential equation; the acoustic interactions are, however, derived by considering the liquid to be incompressible. The simplifying assumption of an infinite propagation speed of acoustic emission is, in the context of bubble interactions, often justified by the short propagation time in comparison to the excitation period (Mettin et al., 1997). This approach has, for instance, been used to study the change in collective bubble response (Shen et al., 2021) and emitted noise (Jiang et al., 2012) compared to single-bubble systems, the nonlinear behavior of bubble clusters (Jiang et al., 2017; Haghi, Sojahrood, and Kolios, 2019), the subharmonic threshold (Guédra, Cornu, and Inserra, 2017) and the destruction of encapsulated microbubbles (Yasui et al., 2009) used in medical imaging. In general, the interactions between bubbles in a bubble cluster hinder their expansion, resulting in bubble oscillations that are slower and reach smaller amplitudes (D’Agostino and Brennen, 1989; Arora, Ohl, and Lohse, 2007; Nasibullaeva and Akhatov, 2013; Zhao et al., 2020). This observation is explained by the fact that bubbles are acting as a low-pass filter (Ohl et al., 2024), resulting in a shielding effect with the bubbles located at the edge of a cluster affecting the strength of the incident pressure wave experienced by distal bubbles (Wang and Brennen, 1999; Bremond et al., 2006; Deng et al., 2024). The presence of neighbor bubbles also influences the response of the bubbles of a polydisperse bubble cluster to a sudden drop in ambient pressure, with a lower pressure required for the smaller bubbles to grow explosively (Ida, 2009). Moreover, a bubble cluster has several resonance frequencies, the largest being the one of a single bubble, also known as the Minneart frequency (Minnaert, 1933), as suggested in the review of Fuster (2019). Haghi, Sojahrood, and Kolios (2019) showed that in polydisperse bubble clusters, the larger bubbles dominate the oscillations of the smaller bubbles, forcing them to oscillate at the same frequency. In this article, we propose a consistent model of the radial dynamics, acoustic emissions, and acoustic interactions of pressure-driven bubble dynamics based on a quasi-acoustic assumption. This model assumes that the bubbles are spherical and stationary, and the liquid surrounding the bubbles is compressible, and uses a Lagrangian wave tracking algorithms to model the acoustic emissions and interactions of the bubbles. Considering a variety of representative test cases, we demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model for predicting the complex bubble-bubble interactions and resulting dynamic behavior in mono- and polydisperse bubble clusters. This article is organized as follows. The governing equations are presented in Section II and the RP-type equation that governs the bubble dynamics is derived in Section III. Subsequently, the models for the acoustic emissions and interactions are presented in Sections IV and V, respectively. Section VI presents a comprehensive validation of the proposed model and conclusions are drawn in Section VII."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09456v1,A trade-off between hydrodynamic performance and morphological bias limits the evolution of symmetric lattice animal wings,"Bristled and membranous insect wings have co-evolved despite apparently serving the same functionality. We emulate flight physics using an automated free-fall experiment to better understand how and why several distinct wing forms may have developed. Biomimetic two-dimensional lattice animals were laser cut from a continuous sheet of paper, and their descent in a settling tank was tracked using a camera. Data from 31 generic symmetric polyominos (1,692 experiments) reveal that morphology impacts the drag coefficient C_{D} and hence flight efficiency. Some polyominos rapidly sediment while others remain suspended for longer. Positioning the search for an optimal shape within an evolutionary context, we relinquished control of the automated setup to a genetic algorithm. Hereditary information passes between generations in proportion to fitness and is augmented by rare mutations. High-performing morphologies are observed, but experimental repeats do not re-evolve the same shapes. Adaptation rates also differ if the selective pressure is reversed from suspension to sedimentation. Our data (50,086 experiments) reveal several physical sources of indeterminism in the simulated natural selection process, including fluid flow variability and morphological entropy. This provides experimental support for the idea that the lack of convergence in insect wing shape may partly reflect the competition between fitness and entropy, making it nearly impossible to achieve unique optimal forms.","Natural selection drives the evolution of form and function of living organisms to fit their environment constrained by cost [1]. Unveiling the sources of predictability, or the lack thereof, in evolution is thus a fundamental biophysical problem. Sometimes, populations can respond as expected to ecological changes or challenges in a process known as convergent evolution [2]. Other times, emerging traits appear to be non-deterministic, but physically well-defined examples of this are rare. Insect wing morphology may serve as a basic example of evolutionary variability, where distinct wing geometries can be observed in extant species occupying similar environments [3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8]. A specific example is the case of porous (bristled) and solid (membranous) wings in small flying insects (Fig 1A) [5, 9, 7]. Most insect wings are solid and impermeable to air [10]. During flight, fluid flows around the cuticular membrane strengthened by longitudinal and transverse veins. In contrast, some air can leak through bristled wings, comprising rake-like appendages attached to a slender rod [5, 4, 11]. However, the quantitative reason why bristled and membraneous insect wings co-exist remains unclear. Recent work (see e.g., Lee and Kim [12]) has demonstrated that the leakiness of bristled wings reduces its aerodynamic performance compared to the solid wing [12]. However, the bristled wing is also lighter. Per unit mass, permeable wings can, therefore, sometimes yield an evolutionary advantage [8, 6, 7, 5, 13, 4, 5, 12, 9]. To our knowledge, however, the precise balance between performance and shape, has not been explored in an evolutionary and statistical context. This letter positions morphology and performance in a synthetic evolutionary framework. Artificial wings settling under gravity provide a model of parachuting flight [14], while evolution is mimicked by a genetic algorithm [15, 16, 17, 15]. We introduce polyomino wings to avoid the limitations associated with pre-defined morphologies [6, 12, 11]. We begin by introducing the experimental methodology. Subsequent sections lay out the results. Finally, the the implications for shape evolution are discussed. Figure 1: Lattice animals and experimental setup.

The pre-reconnection and the post-reconnection prefactors of this scaling law are different, a property related to irreversibility and to energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms. In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and post-reconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behaviour independent of the small-scale regularising dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.","Introduction.— Reconnections are the fundamental events that change the topology of the field lines in fluids and plasmas during their time evolution. Reconnections thus determine important physical properties, such as mixing and inter-scale energy transfer in fluids [1], or solar flares and tokamak instabilities in plasmas [2]. The nature of reconnections is more clearly studied if the field lines are concentrated in well-separated filamentary structures: vortices in fluids and magnetic flux tubes in plasmas. In superfluid helium this concentration is extreme, providing an ideal context: superfluid vorticity is confined to vortex lines of atomic thickness (approximately a_{0}\approx 10^{-10}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm m); a further simplification is that, unlike what happens in ordinary fluids, the circulation of a superfluid vortex is constrained to the quantized value \kappa=h/m=9.97\times 10^{-8}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm m^{2}/s, where m is the mass of one helium atom and h is Planck’s constant. It was in this superfluid context that it was theoretically and experimentally recognized [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] that reconnections share a universal property irrespective of the initial condition: the minimum distance between reconnecting vortices, \delta^{\pm}, scales with time, t, according to the form \delta^{\pm}(t)=A^{\pm}(\kappa|t-t_{0}|)^{1/2}, (1) where t_{0} is the reconnection time, and the dimensionless prefactors A^{-} and A^{+} refer respectively to before (t<t_{0}) and after (t>t_{0}) the reconnection. The same scaling law was then found for reconnections in ordinary viscous fluids [9]. In the case of a pure superfluid at temperature T=0\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm K, theoretical work based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) has shown that A^{+}>A^{-}, that is, after the reconnection, vortex lines move away from each others faster than in the initial approach; this result has been related to irreversibility [10, 11]. Indeed, a geometrical constraint imposes [11] that a piece of vortex length needs to be “deleted” during the reconnection process. In the GP model, this loss is possible by the emission of a rarefaction pulse created immediately after the reconnection [12, 6] which removes some of the kinetic energy and momentum of the vortex configuration. This vortex energy loss depends on the ratio A^{+}/A^{-}, which in turns defines the approaching angle of collision between the vortices, together with other several geometrical quantities [7, 11]. The temporal asymmetry A^{+}>A^{-} can be thus interpreted as a non-trivial manifestation of irreversibility, as it originates from an ideal hydrodynamic process independent of the small-scale regularisation mechanism of the fluid. Indeed, in classical fluid vortex reconnections, although the definition of A^{+} is more delicate as circulation is not necessarily conserved, the same asymmetry A^{+}>A^{-} was reported [9]. Instead of the generation of rarefaction pulses, like in the case of T=0 superfluids, close to the reconnection, the classical fluid creates a series of thin secondary structures that can be then efficiently dissipated by viscous dissipation. The case of superfluid helium at non-zero temperatures is more intriguing. Most experiments are performed at T>1\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm K, a regime in which in addition to quantum vortices, thermal excitations constitute a viscous liquid called the normal fluid. The normal fluid can steal energy from filaments and dissipate it by viscous effects, opening in that way more routes towards irreversibility. Modern visualisation techniques rely on hydrogen/deuterium tracer particles to decorate superfluid vortices [13, 4, 14, 15]. Numerous studies have provided insight into the post-reconnection dynamics and the prefactor A^{+}, but much less is known about A^{-} from experiments due to the challenges of visualising vortices approaching a reconnection. The aim of this Letter is to investigate the role played by the normal fluid in the reconnection dynamics. In particular, given the temperature dependence of the normal fluid’s properties, we study experimentally and numerically the temperature dependence of the prefactors A^{+} and A^{-} and numerically investigate the energy injected in the normal fluid. To achieve this aim we need a more powerful model than the GPE to account not only for the dynamics of the superfluid vortices, but also for the dynamics of the normal fluid. We show that at non-zero temperatures Eq. (1) and the relation A^{+}>A^{-} hold true, in agreement with experiments, revealing, for the first time, a temperature dependence of A^{+}/A^{-}. In addition, we show that a vortex reconnection represents an unusual kind of punctuated energy injection into the normal fluid which acts alongside the well-known (continual) friction. When applied to superfluid turbulence, this last result implies that, if the vortex line density (hence the frequency of reconnections) is large enough, vortex reconnections can maintain the normal fluid in a perturbed state."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08788v1,"Recovering head and flux distributions at the sediment-water interface for arbitrary, transient bedforms by inversion of photographic time series","Existing works that predict bedform-induced hyporheic exchange flux (HEF) typically either assume a simplified streambed shape and corresponding sinusoidal head distribution or rely on costly computational fluid dynamics simulations. Experimental data have been lacking for the formulation of a priori prediction rules for hydraulic head and flux distributions induced by spatiotemporally heterogeneous natural bedforms because it has not previously been feasible to determine these in the laboratory. We address this problem, presenting a noninvasive technique for regularized inversion of photographic time series of dye front propagation in the hyporheic zone, compatible with arbitrarily-shaped, generally transient bedforms. We employ the technique to analyze three bench-scale flume experiments performed under different flow regimes, presenting a new data set of digitized bed profiles, corresponding head distributions, and dye fronts. To our knowledge, this is the first such data set collated for naturally-formed sand bedforms.","In the study of streambeds, the sediment-water interface (SWI) is of great importance to both geology and hydrology. In flowing systems with fine sediments (0.1-10 mm), the bed arranges itself in characteristic structures known as bedforms (Ashley, 1990; Kennedy, 1969). Interaction between surface water flow and bedforms result in a spatially varying pressure distribution along the sediment-water interface (SWI), which drives Darcy flow in the subsurface, beneath the SWI (Harvey et al., 1996; Stonedahl et al., 2010; Winter et al., 1998). The exchange between surface and subsurface water is referred to as hyporheic exchange flux (HEF), and the region of the sediment where HEF occurs is called the hyporheic zone (HZ) (Boano et al., 2014). An early discussion of the flow of stream water in and out of gravel streambeds was given by Vaux (1968), who proposed that a bedform’s geometry induced its pressure distribution and also that bedform head was linearly related to elevation, a concept that has been refined by more recent authors. Bedform-induced HEF was first observed experimentally in 1987 by Thibodeaux and Boyle (1987) and simulated numerically by Savant et al. (1987). By this time, the forces at play between the surface water and the SWI had already been the focus of study by the sediment transport community for several decades (Bennett and Best, 1995). Several key studies since Vaux (1968) have directly considered the relationship between bedform shape and head or pressure distribution (Table 1). For example, Raudkivi (1963) carried out flume experiments to formulate a physical explanation for the formation of ripples in a sandy streambed. In this course of this study, he used pressure taps to measure pressure along a sheet-metal replica of a naturally-formed bedform. However, no formula for the spatial distribution of pressure over the bedform was given. Vanoni and Hwang (1967) investigated the head gradient across naturally-formed sand bedforms in flume experiments. This was accomplished by spraying the naturally-formed bedforms with an adhesive spray and then installing pressure taps flush with the bedform surface. They formulated a logarithmic expression for form drag across a bedform as a function of bedform shape parameters. Vittal et al. (1977) carried out flume experiments over bedforms constructed out of plywood and coated with sand having d_{50} = 0.6mm. Skin shear was measured using Preston tubes, and pressure was measured using an inclined manometer. This work disproved the prevailing assumption at the time that skin shear is constant along the face of the bedform. In the process, Vittal et al. (1977) also measured and formulated a relation for pressure exerted along the bedform by the surface water flow. van Mierlo and de Ruiter (1988) measured flow velocities and pressure over sand-coated concrete bedforms in a flume. Their measurements of pressure induced along the bedform are similar to those found by other works, with a local maximum approximately halfway along the stoss face of the bedform, and local minima in the vicinity of the bedform crest. Fehlman (1985) was the first to experimentally confirm the conjecture that the total force exerted by the surface flow on 2D bedforms is the sum of the form drag (pressure differential across the bedform) and the skin shear along the bedform surface. This was accomplished by measuring all three quantities independently using a force balance, surface pressure taps, and a shear probe mounted around plastic bedforms. Additionally, this work generalized the relation for pressure exerted by the flow along the face of the bedform reported by Vittal et al. (1977). In some runs, the bedforms were smooth, while in others they were coated with 1.75 mm (median grain diameter) sand to simulate streambed roughness. While previous studies had largely focused on geomorphology as the driving force behind HEF, Sawyer et al. (2011) showed using experiments and modeling that in-stream woody debris also creates a head gradient which drives HEF. They conducted flume experiments in which they represented channel-spanning logs by mounting PVC pipes over a flat sand bed (median grain diameter 2.4 mm). Pressure sensors were installed near and below the SWI. pore water flow was visualized with dye tracer tests, and salt tracer tests were used to measure HEF. This work showed that debris generates HEF at levels comparable to bedforms at the reach scale. Similar results were attained by Huang and Yang (2023) for porous logjams in flume experiments with hydrogel-bead sediment and porous logs represented by piled acrylic cylinders. Prior to Savant et al. (1987), HEF had been modeled by the Transient Storage model (TSM) (Bencala and Walters, 1983). The TSM is a 1D model of downstream solute transport which ascribes solute retardation to flux in and out of a stream-adjacent, black-box storage zone. Elliott and Brooks (1997a) adapted the observations of Fehlman (1985) to a 2D analytical model describing pore water flow paths with a sinusoidal boundary condition like that of Toth (1963), while corroborating the model with experimental results of their own (Elliott and Brooks, 1997b). They used sand bedforms and measured flux via tracer tests, but they did not measure head gradients along the SWI. Cardenas and Wilson (2007) computed the pressure distribution over bedforms using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) method. This pressure distribution was then used as the top boundary condition to solve the groundwater flow equation within the pore water. Janssen et al. (2012) corroborated the CFD-calculated pressure boundary condition against results from flume experiments that they conducted. They shaped a sediment bed consisting of 0.174 mm (mean grain diameter) sand into triangular bedforms. Head at the SWI was measured by pressure sensors installed flush with the sediment surface along the flume midline. Surface flow was measured by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). pore water flow was assessed by injecting and measuring fluorescent tracer in the sediment bed. More recently, Li et al. (2020) implemented a numerical model featuring full coupling between surface and subsurface flow. Other works have addressed the relationship between hydraulic head and more complex streambed formations. Marion et al. (2002) showed using salt tracer experiments over naturally-formed bedforms in a flume that the model developed by Elliott and Brooks (1997a) is less accurate for bedforms that protrude significantly above the mean bed elevation and have a large height relative to flow depth. Jin et al. (2022) used simulations to show that for a given set of bedform dimensions, a wavelike bedform shape induces greater HEF than a triangular one. Several works used numerical simulations to show that in-stream cobbles and vegetation also drive HEF (Lee et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2021; Lv et al., 2022). Marzadri et al. (2010) and Huang and Chui (2022) used experiments and modeling to show that alternate bars in streams also contribute to HEF, and simulations by Cardenas (2009) showed that streambed sinuosity does as well. Cardenas (2008) and Lee et al. (2020) used numerical simulations to examine HEF under landscapes containing multiple scales of features, from superimposed ripples to the watershed. These works found that each scale of feature has its own significant effect on pore water flow and residence times. Additionally, Chen et al. (2015, 2018) used simulations of flow over 3D bedforms to show that using 2D bed profiles alone does not capture the full extent of HEF in the streambed. In addition to the aforementioned CFD-based approaches, some hybrid spectral approaches have been proposed (Wörman et al., 2006, 2007; Stonedahl et al., 2010) which superpose Elliott and Brooks’s sinusoidal solutions for irregular morphologies. To our knowledge, these spectral approaches have been corroborated (Stonedahl et al., 2010) only in a global sense by matching uptake from salt tracer tests. In general, the sinusoidal approach of Elliott and Brooks (1997a) remains state-of-the art for a priori prediction of bedform head distributions in the absence of CFD. Predicting head distributions for general, spatially-heterogeneous bedforms, such as those observed in nature, is an important open problem, for which relevant experimental data is needed. In the experimental works above, moving and even naturally-formed bedforms are significantly under-represented (Table 1). All of the experimental studies of force exerted by the stream water on the SWI used static, regularly shaped bedforms, and all but Janssen et al. (2012) used bedforms that were made of artifical materials such as metal, plaster, stabilized sand, or wood. Additionally, almost all of the spatial models of HEF listed above used a static bed with a simplifed domain shape. Teitelbaum et al. (2022) used a model whose domain is translated horizontally in connection with bedform motion, but the translated domain shape was regular and periodic, and its motion was constant. Stonedahl etl al. (2010) and Wörman et al. (2006) used an irregular domain shape, but the results in that work were verified only at a global and not a local level. Cardenas (2008) and Lee et al. (2020) simulated irregular domain shapes with no experimental verification. In this work we recover the hydraulic head distributions induced by surface water flow over and through naturally- and manually-formed sand bedforms in an ensemble of flume experiments performed using a range of flow velocities. To our knowledge, no dataset has previously been reported for dynamically evolving, generally non-stationary natural sand bedforms at the higher flow rates we considered. This recovery was enabled by non-intrusive optical velocimetry employing time lapse photographs of dye tracer propagation in a glass-sided flume, using gradient-descent inversion on a physically regularized objective function. The inverse computational method we used to attain these results is also a substantial contribution of this work, as it does not involve physical instrumentation of the bed, and thus can be used for temporally evolving real sand bedforms. The rest of this work is divided as follows. In Section 2 we outline a set of dye tracer flume experiments. In section 3 we outline the theory that allows for recovery of head and flux distributions from dye front dynamics in the experiments. In Section 4, we discuss the details of computer implementation, including numerical discretization, validation, and practical considerations for dealing with imperfect data. In Section 5 we outline our results. We summarize our experimental data set and present recovered head distributions recovered for three separate experiments. Finally, in Sections 6 and 7, we discuss insights to be drawn from the results, limitations of the current approach, and promising directions for future research.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08769v1,Mathematical Analysis of Axisymmetrization and Enhanced Inviscid Damping in 2D Linearized Euler Flow,"This paper extends the mathematical theory of axisymmetrization and vorticity depletion within the 2D Euler equations, with an emphasis on the dynamics of radially symmetric, monotonic vorticity profiles. By analyzing inviscid damping, we establish new optimal decay rates for radial and angular velocity components in weighted Sobolev spaces, showing that vorticity depletion enhances damping effects beyond those observed in passive scalar dynamics. Our methodology involves the construction of advanced Green’s functions and the use of spectral techniques to achieve precise asymptotic expansions, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing long-term stability. These results mark the first rigorous confirmation of enhanced inviscid damping rates in axisymmetric vortices, substantially advancing the theoretical understanding of coherent vortex structures in high Reynolds number flows. This work has potential applications in fluid stability theory, turbulence modeling, and other fields that involve the study of inviscid flows.","The stability and long-term behavior of vortices in 2D turbulent flows have been pivotal topics in fluid dynamics, particularly for understanding high Reynolds number regimes. Early foundational work by Kelvin [1] introduced the concept of vortex motion and examined the stability of inviscid, or idealized, vortex structures, laying the groundwork for later studies of hydrodynamic stability. Following Kelvin’s insights, Orr [2] investigated the stability of steady motions in inviscid fluids, formulating what is now known as Orr’s mechanism, which describes how initial perturbations in shear flows tend to decay or amplify under linear dynamics. Subsequent advances in the mid-20th century expanded the study of inviscid damping in more complex settings. Kelly [3] developed the theory of stability for shear flows by introducing a spectral approach, identifying conditions under which perturbations decay without dissipative effects. This work paved the way for modern studies in linear inviscid damping, particularly in planar shear flows. More recently, Zillinger [4] established rigorous decay rates for monotonic shear flows, extending previous results on Couette flow and proving that specific stability conditions lead to inviscid damping in Sobolev spaces. Interest in inviscid damping further evolved with studies focusing on the behavior of vortices in 2D Euler flows. Bedrossian, Coti Zelati, and Vicol [5] rigorously analyzed vortex axisymmetrization, inviscid damping, and the novel phenomenon of vorticity depletion in the linearized 2D Euler equations. They showed that under radial symmetry, angular Fourier modes in the vorticity are progressively depleted over time, leading to axisymmetric stabilization—a result that has implications for the observed coherence of vortices in turbulent flows. Building on these findings, Wei, Zhang, and Zhao [6] extended inviscid damping theory to Kolmogorov flow, examining enhanced dissipation mechanisms that accelerate the decay of perturbations beyond those predicted by passive scalar dynamics. Their work highlighted the connection between nonlinear effects and damping rates, suggesting that vorticity depletion could produce enhanced damping in the presence of coherent structures. In this paper, the author continues this line of research by analyzing inviscid damping and vorticity depletion in 2D Euler dynamics, with a particular focus on radially symmetric and monotonic vorticity profiles. New optimal decay rates for radial and angular velocity components in weighted Sobolev spaces were established, confirming that vorticity depletion enhances damping effects in a way that surpasses passive scalar dynamics. By introducing advanced Green’s functions and spectral techniques, the axisymmetry process was rigorously characterized, providing further insights into the stability of coherent vortex structures at high Reynolds numbers."

Equilibrium theory breaks down in the nonequilibrium IBL, which may extend O(10) km for natural atmospheric flows. Here, we find that the IBL possesses a characteristic time-scale associated with the IBL height, \delta_{i}. We show that \delta_{i} and the edge velocity set the scales of the mean and defect velocity profiles within the IBL, for simulation and experimental data covering a multitude of roughness transition types. We present a nontrivial extension of equilibrium theory to the dynamically adjusting IBL, which can be useful for modeling a range of environmental and industrial flows.","References Nikuradse [1933] J.

Particularly, in the context of incompressible flows, recent efforts have been deployed for improving the accuracy, robustness or consistency of standard transient incompressible OpenFOAM solvers: pimpleFoam or pisoFoam (based on PISO loop Issa [1986]). pimpleFoam is the iterative version of pisoFoam where momentum flux, turbulence and explicit source terms are iterated over outer correctors.Vuorinen et al. [2014] have developed rk4projectionFoam, a solver using explicit fourth order Runge-Kutta (ERK) with Chorin fractional step method, Chorin [1968]. The solver has been tested for DNS channel flow with speed improvement in comparison to pisoFoam. rk4projectionFoam has also been used successfully for LES simulation over the Bolund hill in Denmark, Vuorinen et al. [2015]. Inspection of the source code shows that after each Runge Kutta stage, the flux used in momentum equation is calculated by interpolating the velocity from cell center to cell face. This choice is arguable because, computed in this manner, the flux does not verify the continuity equation. Regarding the Rhie & Chow interpolation, Rhie and Chow [1983], old time face velocity are calculated by linear interpolation of cell centered velocity. This approach is known to be non consistent and lead to time step dependent solutions and pressure-velocity decoupling for small time steps Shen et al. [2001]. Kazemi-Kamyab et al. [2015] have implemented in OpenFOAM Explicit first-stage Singly Diagonally Implicit Runge–Kutta schemes (ESDIRK) with PIMPLE loop. They have shown that the interpolation of residual vector must be done carefully for preserving the temporal accuracy. Their algorithm uses conservative flux and consistent Rhie & Chow interpolation as proposed by Yu et al. [2002]. A 2nd order non-iterative PISO solver has been proposed in Željko Tuković et al. [2018] with extension to moving grids. The solver follows the approach of Cubero and Fueyo [2007] for the consistent momentum interpolation and employs a 2nd order extrapolation for flux, velocity and pressure to maintain the 2nd order accuracy. Lee [2017] also showed that the 2nd order extrapolation improve the temporal accuracy with PISO loop. In the context of fluid structure interaction, Gillebaart et al. [2016] implemented BDF integration schemes up to order 3 with consistent momentum interpolation and under-relaxation. An other attempt to improve the incompressible OpenFOAM solvers has been initiated by D’Alessandro et al. [2018]. In their work they have implemented ERK and Singly Diagonally Implicit Runge–Kutta (SDIRK) with PISO loop and extension to heat transfer flows. The source code is partially released and only the third order DIRK solver is available, dirk3Foam . Inspection of the source code also shows the same arguable approach as in Vuorinen et al. [2014] with non-conservative momentum flux and non-consistent Rhie & Chow interpolation. In Komen et al. [2020] different momentum interpolation methods are compared for DIRK and ERK schemes in term of energy dissipation for the Taylor-Green vortex case. It is found that the consistent Yu et al. [2002] or Cubero and Fueyo [2007] and OpenFOAM momentum interpolations are the most dissipative approaches. This results is in agreement with the observation of Bartholomew et al. [2018]. In contrast, the original approach of Rhie & Chow interpolation, Rhie and Chow [1983] better preserves the energy (but lead to time and relaxation factor dependent solutions). Komen et al. [2020] have also shown that the consistent momentum interpolation is the only method that preserves the formal temporal accuracy order, irrespective to the mesh size. An interesting approach is later developed in Komen et al. [2021] with a new PIMPLE based solver RKSymFoam where the symmetry is preserved by hard coding symmetric discretization schemes (midPoint interpolation, uncorrected Laplacian and surface normal gradient). Two forms of the pressure equation are studied (referred as Chorin, Chorin [1968] and Van Kan, van Kan [1986] forms). It shows that the Van Kan form is practically dissipation free and preserves second-order temporal convergence. However, in RKSymFoam, beside hard coded spatial schemes, relaxations are not implemented and the PIMPLE algorithm is also hard coded without the tolerance error convergence making the solver likely less suitable for industrial applications and complex meshes. Finally, Kim et al. [2022] have extended SDIRK method for incompressible two-phase flows using the OpenFOAM approach for momentum interpolation. The previously mentioned solver developments are summarized in Table 1. To conclude, based on the available literature, an incompressible solver providing a general framework for BDF and (E)SDIRK integration methods, with a consistent Rhie & Chow interpolation free of relaxation and time step dependencies and with the source code been released is missing. In this context, a new solver incompressibleFoam has been implemented with two momentum interpolations (MI) and two pressure Poisson equation formulations. The solver benefits of the PIMPLE algorithms of OpenFOAM with tolerance error based convergence. In the later text we refer to PISO as the algorithm proposed by Issa [1986] and PIMPLE the iterative version of PISO with relaxation handling (a merge between PISO and SIMPLE algorithms, Patankar and Spalding [1972]).

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08633v1,Quasi-two-dimensional Turbulence,"Many fluid-dynamical systems met in nature are quasi-two-dimensional: they are constrained to evolve in approximately two dimensions with little or no variation along the third direction. This has a drastic effect in the flow evolution because the properties of three dimensional turbulence are fundamentally different from those of two dimensional turbulence. In three-dimensions energy is transferred on average towards small scales, while in two dimensions energy is transferred towards large scales. Quasi-two-dimensional flows thus stand in a crossroad, with two-dimensional motions attempting to self-organize and generate large scales while three dimensional perturbations cause disorder, disrupting any large scale organization. Where is energy transferred in such systems? It has been realised recently that in fact the two behaviors can coexist with a simultaneous transfer of energy both to large and to small scales. How the cascade properties change as the variations along the third direction are suppressed has lead to discovery of different regimes or phases of turbulence of unexpected richness in behavior. Here, recent discoveries on such systems are reviewed. It is described how the transition from three-dimensional to two-dimensional flows takes place, the different phases of turbulence met and the nature of the transitions from one phase to the other. Finally, the implications these new discoveries have on different physical systems are discussed. .This work is published in:Reviews of Modern Plasma Physics 7.1 (2023): 31.DOI: 10.1007/s41614-023-00134-3","We live in a world of (at least) three spatial dimensions. However, for some physical systems a two dimensional description appears to provide a suitable approximation for the dynamics involved. This happens when one dimension is highly compactified like in thin films or due to some other physical mechanisms, like rotation or strong magnetic fields, that prevents variations along one dimension. In fluid dynamics such a dimension-reduction is met in a variety of systems from molecular to astrophysical scales. At the smallest scales, such a reduction is met in the dynamics of electrons in ultra-pure materials such as graphene that display two dimensional hydrodynamic behavior [77, 3, 10]. In an equally exotic case, two-dimensional flows are met in fluids of light [1, 36]. Two dimensional flows have also been observed in Bose-Einstein condensates in liquid Helium [93, 46, 52]. Furthermore, two-dimensional dynamics are shown to be a good approximation for the motion of bacteria in films or thin layers [104, 62, 122, 121] and for the flow in soap films [72, 91, 120, 54]. Increasing in scale, plasma flows in the presence of strong magnetic fields, such as in Tokamak devices are also known to display close to two-dimensional dynamics [125, 41]. Finally, at the planetary scale, flows are very often constrained to two dimensional motions due to the presence of rotation, stratification and geometrical constraints [129, 21, 56, 100]. In the systems above, despite being close to two-dimensional, variations along the third direction can not always be disregarded, and some times play an important role in the energy balance relation. This is in particular true for the turbulent case where the dynamics of the flow drastically differ in two and in three dimensions. Turbulence is realised both in three and in two dimensions when the Reynolds number Re (the ratio of the viscous time scale to the to eddy turn-over time) attains large values. In three dimensional turbulence, the self-interaction between eddies generates smaller and smaller eddies transferring energy towards the smallest scales where it is dissipated effectively by viscosity, independently of how small it is. In two dimensions, the opposite behavior is observed. Eddies self-organize to generate larger eddies and thus transfer energy to larger scales. Unlike the three-dimensional case, in two dimensions, because energy is transferred upscale, viscosity is not efficient at dissipating it and energy piles up at the largest scale of the system. The dynamics of flows in three and in two dimensions are thus fundamentally different. This brings out the question: what happens when a flow is only approximately two-dimensional and the flow lies between the two extreme situations? On the one hand, if two dimensional motions dominate energetically one can expect that flow dynamics will not be far from those of two dimensions and the transfer of energy will be towards the large scales. On the other hand, the inverse transfer of energy can be proved only if enstrophy (the mean square of vorticity) is conserved exactly, which is only true in two dimensional flows. Three dimensional perturbations, even if subdominant, will break enstrophy conservation and the upscale transfer of energy is questioned. This question for the behavior of quasi-two dimensional flows has been around for a long time [25]. What has been revealed in the last years is that a hybrid state of turbulence exists where transfer to larger and to smaller scales coexist, building what is referred to as a bidirectional or split cascade. This review deals with when, how and in what sense can a flow transition from three dimensional to two dimensional behavior as a control parameter is varied. We will give a phenomenological description of the different phases of turbulence that are observed and describe their behavior close to the critical points where phase transitions are observed. The richness of behaviors observed in quasi-two-dimensional turbulence surpassed all expectations leading to the discovery in the last years of new phenomena that challenge our mathematical and physical understanding of fluid turbulence. These new discoveries are reviewed and categorized in order to give direction to future research. Furthermore, the appearance of quasi-two-dimensional turbulence in a variety of different systems is also reviewed by mentioning key works in the different systems. Finally, an attempt is made to note the many questions that are open in the field, stressing the need for further studies. Throughout the text, the mathematical formalism is made as light as possible in favor of readability and give references for more formal descriptions. The rest of this review is structured as follows. In section 2, three and two dimensional turbulence are briefly reviewed. Then in section 3, thin layer turbulence is discussed and a detailed description of the transition from three-dimensional (3D) to two-dimensional (2D) dynamics is given. In section 4, some recent results in other quasi-2D systems like rotating and magneto-hydrodynamic flows are given. In section 5 conclusions are drawn and open questions in the field are presented."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08556v1,D-shaped body wake control through flexible filaments,"In this study, we investigate the flow around a canonical blunt body, specifically a D-shaped body of width D, in a closed water channel. Our goal is to explore near-wake flow modifications when a series of rigid and flexible plates (l=1.8D) divided into filaments (h=0.2D) are added. We focus on assessing the interaction between the flexible filaments and the wake dynamics, with the aim of reducing the recirculation bubble and decreasing the velocity deficit in the wake. To achieve this, we conduct a comparative study varying the stiffness and position of the filaments at different flow velocities. The study combines Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements in the wake behind the body with recordings of the deformation of the flexible filaments. Our observations show that the flexible filaments can passively reconfigure in a two-dimensional fashion, with a mean tip deflection angle that increases with the incoming flow velocity. Deflection angles up to approximately \sim 9^{\circ} and vibration tip amplitude of around \sim 4^{\circ} are achieved for flow velocities U^{*}\simeq f_{n}D/u_{\infty}\geq 1.77, where f_{n} is the natural frequency of the flexible filaments. This reconfiguration results in a reduction of the recirculation bubble and a decrease in the velocity deficit in the wake compared to the reference and rigid cases. In addition, curved filaments with a prescribed rigid deformation exhibit very similar behavior to that of flexible filaments, indicating that the vibration of flexible filaments does not significantly disturb the wake. The obtained results highlight the interest of testing flexible appendages in the wake of blunt bodies for designing effective flow control devices.","The study of the flow around two-dimensional blunt bodies is a significant research field, as this configuration is common in many engineering and environmental applications, including civil structures such as bridges and buildings, as well as offshore structures like deep-water risers. In particular, flow separation at the rear of these bodies can generate vortex shedding, caused by Bénard-von Karman instability (BvK), leading to the formation of a low-pressure region. Research in this area is typically driven by practical goals such as reducing drag on the blunt body [1], suppressing flow-induced vibrations (FIVs) [2, 3, 4], or modifying heat transfer around a body immersed in a given flow [5]. In the study of two-dimensional bluff bodies, D-shaped geometries have been extensively analyzed, particularly due to their characteristic fixed separation point at the trailing edge [6, 7, 8]. For these geometries, the mean base pressure coefficient remains nearly constant along the third direction, with values around -0.6. This constancy emphasizes the wake’s significant impact on overall drag, which ranges between 0.8 and 1 for the tested Reynolds numbers. The Reynolds number, defined as Re=u_{\infty}D/\nu, depends on the free-stream velocity (u_{\infty}) the body diameter (D) and the fluid’s kinematic viscosity (\nu). In this configuration, vortex shedding occurs at a specific frequency, f, or equivalently, at a fixed Strouhal number St=fD/u_{\infty}, as for instance, St=0.25 at Re=40.000. The shedding process produces strong velocity fluctuations in the wake downstream of the body [7] that impact the body aerodynamics. Various devices and strategies aim to actively or passively control the wake behind blunt bodies to reduce the averaged or fluctuating drag or lift force coefficients. Active control devices include pulsed jets [9, 10], plasma actuators [11], or suction/blowing strategies [12, 13]. Examples of closed-loop flow control include sinusoidal zero-net-flux actuation through spanwise slots [14, 8] and actuated flaps in 3D wakes [15]. However, implementing active flow control systems in real-world applications often requires significant power input or sophisticated systems, limiting their practicality and efficiency. This makes passive control systems more attractive due to their simplicity. Among passive strategies, initial studies by [16] examined the effect of including plates at the body base, while other more recent studies introduced trailing edge modifications such as small tabs [7], base cavities [17, 18, 19] and boat-tailed after-bodies [20, 21, 22]. Rear cavity devices can be further refined with multi-cavity arrangements [23] or optimized geometries focused on reducing drag [24]. The efficiency of rear cavities in terms of drag reduction is linked to their depth, as they move the wake formation away from the body base, generating a dead flow region that effectively increases base pressure. However, their aerodynamic efficiency may be reduced under different flow conditions, such as accelerated flows from rest [25] or yawed orientations [26]. An interesting approach that can adapt to different flow conditions involves using bio-inspired flexible devices, modifying the rear part of the body into a more aerodynamic shape through passive reconfiguration [27, 28, 29]. This process is commonly observed in nature, where the reconfiguration of flexible parts [30, 31], such as leaves in trees, reduces aerodynamic resistance and effective area [32] under different wind conditions, (see [33], for a review). The passive reconfiguration of flexible systems to modify the wake behind bluff bodies has been only scarcely investigated [34]. Recent studies [28, 29] propose using rotary and flexible flaps to configure a self-adaptive cavity, achieving drag reductions of up to 18\% by reducing the wake bluffness and streamlining rear separation. Despite these advantages, the practical implementation of these devices may face challenges, such as ensuring uniform mechanical properties in movable parts with large length-to-thickness ratios and managing significant loads and potential torsional deformations. As an alternative, we propose using a modular system based on an array of small filaments that can function as a single flexible flap with much lower mechanical loads. In the case of rigid arrays of filaments, [35] examined the use of porous rear cavities in 3D blunt bodies, finding similar results for modular cavities with small spacing between elements and fully solid rear cavities. Additionally, the device studied here incorporates the degrees of freedom associated with the flexibility of the filaments, allowing the elements to adapt their shape to the eventual three-dimensional features of the flow around the D-shaped body. In this work, we aim to study the effect of modular arrays of filaments resembling a cavity to manipulate and control the wake behind a D-shaped body. The tested devices comprise an array of flexible filaments that interact with the incoming flow, adapting their shape to different conditions. We will experimentally assess the interaction between the filaments and the wake by measuring filament motion and wake features. The experimental details are presented in Sect. II, followed by the main results in Sect.III. There, Sect. III.1 describes the flexible filaments motion, Sect. III.2 covers the temporal synchronization between filaments and vortex shedding, and Sect. III.3 presents the wake features for the four tested configurations. The main conclusions are drawn in Sect. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08505v1,LES-FGM modelling of non-premixed auto-igniting turbulent hydrogen flames including preferential diffusion,"Tabulated chemistry methods are a well-known strategy to efficiently store the flows thermochemical properties. In particular, the Flamelet-Generated Manifold (FGM) is a widely used technique that generates the database with a small number of control variables. In order to build such a manifold, these coordinates must be monotonic in space and time. However, the high diffusivity of hydrogen can prevent such requisite. There have been many studies that successfully included non-unity Lewis effects in FGM, but mostly in the context of premixed flames. The problem of accounting for differential diffusion in purely non-premixed auto-igniting hydrogen flames still has to be investigated thoroughly. To avoid the non-monotonicity of control variables (the progress variable, in particular), one practical workaround is to perform the tabulation on zero-dimensional (0D) reactors rather than on one-dimensional (1D) flamelets. Various works already implemented and tested such 0D-based manifold, but mainly in the context of spray engines, where most of the composition is lean and information past the flammability limit is not relevant. The present work aims at investigating, for the first time, the applicability of a tabulation based on homogeneous reactors to study auto-igniting turbulent hydrogen jets.Three different techniques to extrapolate the data beyond the flammability limit are evaluated in 1D simulations and assessed against detailed chemistry results. It is shown that a combined use of homogeneous reactors at the lean side and an extrapolation with 1D flamelets on the richer side is required to capture both chemistry and diffusive effects accurately in pure hydrogen flames. Then, this manifold is coupled to Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of three-dimensional turbulent mixing layers and evaluated against direct numerical simulation with detailed chemistry. Good agreement is found, in terms of both ignition delay and the following steady-state burning process. Further analyses are carried out on statistics and modelling. In particular, the sensitivity of the LES solution to filter width, turbulence-chemistry interaction and multidimensional flame effects is investigated to provide new relevant insights on modelling non-premixed auto-igniting turbulent hydrogen flames.Keywords: Hydrogen; Large-eddy simulation; Auto-ignition; Preferential diffusion.","The importance of hydrogen in achieving carbon neutrality is widely known, and the development of hydrogen combustion technology is progressing further and further [1]. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is, in such perspective, a fundamental tool to optimise development time and save costs. In order to accurately estimate the combustion of such a fuel, it is necessary to use a detailed chemical reaction mechanism. However, the associated computational cost is often too demanding. It is therefore crucial to develop reduced-order models able to correctly describe the combustion process with a high computational efficiency. In particular, among the tabulated chemistry methods, the Flamelet Progress Variable (FPV) [2] and the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) [3, 4] methods are well-known strategies to efficiently store the flow thermochemical properties. Instead of solving many species and an energy equation, transport equations are solved for a few reduced variables only, using them as coordinates to retrieve all the other relevant properties which are tabulated based on one-dimensional (1D) flamelet solutions. The 1D flamelet solutions are to be parametrised as function of a handful of control variables. Typically, for non-premixed flames, the choice comes down to the mixture fraction Z and the progress variable \mathcal{Y}. The key to a correct FGM generation is ensuring that the control variables are monotonic. For each flamelet, all the dependent thermochemical variables are stored on a structured mesh, using a multi-dimensional linear interpolation for retrieval. When solving the transport equations for the control variables, the values computed at a certain time-step are used to look-up all the other properties in the table. The high diffusivity of hydrogen, whose Lewis number is about 0.3, prevents the progress variable, typically a linear combination of species mass fractions, to be monotonic. This problem is often avoided, especially in turbulent combustion, where it is a common practice to assume unity Lewis number [5], as the molecular differential diffusion is assumed negligible with respect to the transport phenomena. However, in hydrogen-enriched fuels, this leads to inaccurate results [6]. There have been many successful efforts over the last decades to include more realistic preferential diffusion effects in FGM (recent examples can be found in [7, 8]). Nevertheless, these studies focused on premixed hydrogen flames. There are few works that used FGM to address non-premixed hydrogen/air systems (e.g. [9, 10]) but did not model any igniting phenomena. Hence, the problem of differential diffusion in non-premixed auto-igniting hydrogen flames with tabulated chemistry has still to be investigated thoroughly. In particular, we want to extend the work of Abtahizadeh et al. [6], that encompasses numerical investigations of preferential diffusion effects in Large Eddy Simulation of \ceCH4-\ceH2 lifted flames, to pure hydrogen jets. As mentioned, the common generation of the manifold can be troublesome, as the low Lewis number of hydrogen (and \ceH radicals) complicates the definition of a monotonic progress variable, at least in some parts of the mixture fraction space. A practical workaround is to build the manifold using homogeneous reactors rather than one-dimensional flamelets. The table then comprises properties not affected by diffusion-advection, allowing an easier choice of the progress variable. These missing convective and diffusive effects are then accounted for when transporting Z and \mathcal{Y} in the CFD code. Tabulation methods based on such zero-dimensional (0D) models have already been explored in the past [11, 12, 13, 14] but not for hydrogen. These reactors do not ignite beyond a certain equivalence ratio, due to both low temperature and rich composition, so a great part of the table does not include any evolution from the starting mixing line. Consequently, the problem of extrapolating the data beyond such equivalence ratio must be solved, and is not trivial. A similar study is presented in literature by Ketelheun et al. [15]. However, their study is based on premixed flamelets and unity Lewis numbers, far from the real behaviour of pure hydrogen. The novelty of the present work is to conduct a similar study in non-premixed auto-igniting hydrogen flames, including preferential diffusion. For the first time, the paper at hand illustrates the ability of a tabulated chemistry based on homogeneous reactors to solve the problem of non-monotonicity of the progress variable in the standard flamelet approach. First, the procedures to construct the tables are discussed. Then, the manifolds are assessed in 1D flames against corresponding detailed chemistry results. It is shown that an extrapolation past the reactors’ flammability limit is required to retain both the chemistry and the diffusivity of the richer compositions. Such method is finally coupled to Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) to investigate a three-dimensional (3D) reacting turbulent mixing layer of hydrogen and validate against Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) computations. Further analysis are conducted to provide new relevant insights on statistics and modelling of turbulent auto-igniting hydrogen combustion. This work will serve as a basis to incorporating combustion modelling by means of tabulated chemistry in high-pressure hydrogen injections for internal combustion engines (e.g. [16])."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08277v1,"Data-Driven Discovery of a New Ginzburg-Landau 
Reduced-Order Model for Vortex Shedding","Vortex shedding is an important physical phenomenon observed across many spatial and temporal scales in fluids. Previous experimental and theoretical studies have established a hierarchy of local and global reduced-order models for vortex shedding based on the Stuart-Landau and Ginzburg-Landau equations. In this work, we employ data-driven methods to discover a new Landau variable for the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) for periodic two-dimensional vortex shedding past a cylinder. We first coarse grain vorticity field data from direct numerical simulations of the fluid by integrating over the vertical spatial dimension, and then time-delay embed this new variable to obtain phase information necessary for CGLE analysis. Finally, we use the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to learn an interpretable system of coupled real partial differential equations that balance model complexity and prediction error. We develop local homogeneous models in key regions of the wake, as well as global heterogeneous models that are parameterized by the streamwise coordinate across the entire wake. After computing the normal-form parameters from the discovered equations, we classify the different models and determine behavior and stability in the different regions of the wake, demonstrating the validity of these models across a range of spatiotemporal subdomains. Different dynamics are found to dominate at different stations within the wake. In addition to introducing a novel Landau variable for vortex shedding, this work may also help characterize other vortex shedding systems and inform the design of control schemes.","Vortices are generally shed behind solid bodies moving through a fluid as a result of the Bénard-von Karman instability [1, 2]. Vortex shedding produces low-dimensional patterns of activity that are important in engineering applications, as the low-pressure vortices result in oscillating forces on the immersed bodies. These forces can, for example, excite instabilities in flexible structures like towers and bridges, leading to undesirable behavior, fatigue, and potentially failure [1, 3, 4, 5]. Consequently, many control strategies have been proposed to suppress vortex formation, including modifications to the bluff body [6, 7, 8], placement of a secondary control cylinder close to the main body [9], and rotation of the main body [10]. The mathematical modeling of vortex shedding begins with the Navier-Stokes equations, which are a set of coupled, nonlinear, partial differential equations. The onset of vortex shedding represents a transition from steady to oscillatory flow; this presents a case where the Navier-Stokes equations undergo a Hopf bifurcation, leading to a study of bifurcation theory and stability analysis [11, 12, 13, 14]. For such modeling and control purposes, the Stuart-Landau equation (SLE) and complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) often serve as important reduced-order models (ROMs). These ROMs help determine, for example, the frequency and growth or decay rate of vortices [15, 16] and the optimal sensor and actuator placements for measurement, reconstruction, and control [17, 18, 19]. The SLE and CGLE derive from universal oscillatory instabilities in general complex and pattern-forming systems, and they serve as ROMs for other fluid instabilities, including Rayleigh-Benard convection and Taylor-Couette flow, as well as phenomena from fields as diverse as biology, chemistry, solid-state physics, and optics [20, 21, 22, 23]. Reduced-order models extract the dominant features of the original system while dramatically reducing the computational cost, enabling downstream tasks such as design, optimization, and control. ROMs are particularly important in fluid dynamics, which involves complex, multiscale, and nonlinear behaviors that require significant computational resources to properly resolve [24, 25, 26]. For example, the Landau equations [11, 13] capture the temporal evolution of the vortex shedding instability with a simpler differential equation in a reduced number of dimensions. Many ROMs have been classically derived from the governing equations [27, 28], and § 2 will discuss the asymptotic analysis and derivation of the SLE and CGLE from the Navier-Stokes equations in the case of vortex shedding past a cylinder. In contrast, data-driven methods and machine learning encompass a broad range of techniques that leverage data to develop ROMs [29, 24, 30]. One common data-driven method to study dynamics is proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), a projection method which reveals the energy associated with each mode of the data [30, 31]. The distribution of energy among modes reveals which flow structures dominate the overall system behavior. POD was originally developed by Lumley to study turbulence [32], and POD lends itself well to other fluid dynamic data particularly where the behavior is periodic, such as vortex shedding past a cylinder [27] or a mixing layer [29]. POD is also a starting point for the development of more sophisticated data-driven methods, including dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which identifies spatial modes and their corresponding time dynamics, and Koopman operator theory, which provides a linear framework to study nonlinear systems [24, 25, 30, 31]. Specific methods for particular classes of models have been developed, such as the operator inference method for models with complex non-polynomial nonlinearities [31, 33]. Finally, machine learning techniques such as auto-encoders and neural networks have been more recently developed for building data-driven ROMs of fluid dynamics systems [34, 35]. Across all domains, interpretable ROMs are desired. POD modes are interpretable as maximizing energy content; however, other data-driven methods may provide accurate predictions but less interpretable models [30]. Neural networks, for example, depend on the many hidden variables of the inner layers, which may have limited physical meaning. In this work, we employ the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) [36, 37], which learns sparse and interpretable nonlinear ROMs directly from data. Loiseau et al. [38] and Callaham et al. [17] both use SINDy to learn models capable of flowfield reconstruction and prediction from limited flowfield measurements. SINDy has also been used in turbulence modeling, for example to develop Reynolds-stress models for turbulent RANS closure [39, 40] and for eddy behavior and unresolved turbulent processes in ocean dynamics [41]. Prior to using SINDy, important data post-processing steps must be taken; in this work, we post-process our data by coarse-graining [42, 43, 44] and time-delay embedding [45, 46]. Coarse-graining includes a variety of methods from different fields, including mean-flow analysis in fluid dynamics [43], large-eddy simulation (LES) in computational fluid dynamics [47, 48], methods in molecular dynamics and other particle methods [42, 44], and methods in computational biology and chemistry [49, 50]. In these applications, coarse-graining is achieved by, for example, averaging across time or samples [42, 43], averaging across, simplifying, or removing a dimension or area [44, 47, 48], or reducing resolution at smaller scales [44, 49, 50]. Once the data is coarse-grained, a lower-dimensional, real-valued signal may be used for model learning. However, to model the complex phase behavior in CGLE, we must augment the coarse-grained signal via time-delay embedding. Time-delay embedding allows us to reconstruct the underlying phase space of a system from only a single time-series measurement x(t) [45]. With an appropriate choice \tau of how much to lag the time-series measurement, we may generate one or more additional vectors of delayed observations [x(t+\tau),x(t+2\tau)...], embedding a one-dimensional time series into a higher-dimensional space. Originally developed to analyze turbulence, time-delay embedding has been used in a wide range of topics such as health, ecology, finance, and other physical and mathematical systems [46, 51, 52, 53, 54]. Our method will be demonstrated by finding a novel Landau equation for the canonical vortex shedding past a cylinder. The SLE and CGLE have been widely used as ROMs for cylinder vortex shedding, in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional domains [11, 12, 13, 14, 27]. Previous work has only linked the one-dimensional CGLE to three-dimensional vortex shedding past a cylinder, using the spanwise z-coordinate as the spatial coordinate of the CLGE [13, 14, 55]. There have been limited previous attempts at incorporating the streamwise x-coordinate into a model for vortex shedding, mainly through spatial variation of the model coefficients [56, 57]. In this work, we present a modern analysis of a classic problem by developing a data-driven one-dimensional CGLE model for two-dimensional vortex shedding. After coarse-graining and time-delay embedding our flowfield data, we use SINDy to find coefficients of a Ginzburg-Landau model that best captures the observed dynamics. We first develop an inhomogeneous CGLE in a near-wake subdomain, aiming to characterize the local dynamics in the wavemaker region [19, 58]. We then investigate the spatial dependence of the generated model to determine how the local models vary downstream of the cylinder. In so doing, we show for the first time a link between two-dimensional vortex shedding flow and the one-dimensional CGLE through the streamwise coordinate. This method can easily be extended to more sophisticated problems, elucidating more complex bifurcations in systems such as a rotating cylinder [59] or the fluidic pinball [60]. This paper is organized as follows: In § 2, we will further discuss the various analytic, numerical, and experimental work on cylinder vortex shedding, including its relationship to the SLE and CGLE. In § 3, we detail the data and methods used in our work, including the fluid dynamic simulations of vortex shedding and our methods of coarse-graining, time delay-embedding, and model discovery. In § 4, we show that this method generates a pair of sparse, interpretable PDEs in the form of the CGLE. By tuning the spatial domain over which we develop our model, we highlight differences in the behavior of local models for the near-, mid-, and far-wakes. We find that the stability properties of the local models vary smoothly downstream, with a variety of transitions between behaviors before dissipative dynamics ultimately dominate the behavior. In \S~{}5 we offer concluding remarks about our CGLE models and the vortex shedding phenomenon."

An approach to follow the complete evolution","A new model to follow the complete evolution of a drop in Leidenfrost state is presented in this work. The main ingredients of the phenomenon were considered, including: 1) the shape and weight of a sessile drop, according to its size, compared to the capillary length, using the Young-Laplace equation; 2) the evaporation at the entire surface of the drop, due to the heat transfer across the vapor film, to the proximitiy of a hot plate and to the diffusion in air; 3) the velocity, pressure and temperature fields at the vapor film, between the drop and the hot plate, which are recovered by means of a Hankel transform method, being valid for any size of drops and any thickness of vapor films (below the vapor film stability threshold); 4) an estimation of the thermo-capillary Marangoni convection flow, without simulating numerically the flow within the drop. The aforementioned features were addressed and calculated, in order to include their effect within a single non-linear ODE, describing the temporal evolution of the size of the drop, through the Bond number. Three dimensionless parameters, relating the thermophysical properties of the drop fluid and the surrounding air, control the development of the phenomenon. All those properties were calculated according to the ideal gas approximation and to widely used empirical correlations, without any fitting parameter. The model predictions were compared against experimental results, using different organic and inorganic compounds, for which a good agreement has been found, when no bounce or rotation of the drop spontaneously occurs","The first observations of a liquid drop levitating over a hot plate, due to the generation of a vapor cushion beneath the drop, were made more than 250 years ago [1]. Nowadays, a very large number of documents addressing different phenomena related to the Leidenfrost effect on drops can be found in the literature [2, 3, 4]. Self-propulsion [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], jumping [12, 13, 14, 15], shape oscillation [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], and multi-component interaction [21, 22, 23] are a few examples of the topics that had been derived from the study of single drops in the Leidenfrost state. In the past two decades, several attempts had been performed to predict the complete dynamics of Leidenfrost drops, considering direct numerical simulations [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] and analytic models [30, 31, 32, 33]. Numerical simulations solve for the motion and temperature distribution both within the vapor and the internal liquid, by means of multiphase techniques, phase change models and by possibly taking into account more complex effects such as Marangoni convection. They are particularly challenging to perform, and imply significant computation power and time, due to the multiscale nature of the problem, since the vapor film between the drop and the hot plate can be several orders of magnitude smaller than the drop. Therefore, extremely fine spatial grids are required in the film region, as well as the use of very small time steps to capture the drop dynamics, for stability purpose of the numerical method. Thus, functionality of such numerical simulations depends as much on the mesh density, within the vapor domain and at the liquid-vapor interface, as on the reliability of the numerical methods to capture a two-phase flow with jump conditions at the interface, related to phase change. However, accurate numerical simulations are highly valuable to evaluate the relative importance of different phenomena in the dynamics of the levitating droplets, through comparisons with experimental data. For instance, recent numerical simulations from Mialhe et al. [29] have revealed that thermo-capillary effects are important for setting the film thickness between the drop and the substrate: the Marangoni convection, induced by temperature gradients along the interface, induces a significant internal circulation in the droplet, which favors the drainage rate of the film, making it to be thinner when this effect is accounted for, consistently with experimental results [12]. Such comparisons, to validate the impact of different phenomena, can also be performed between experiments and simplified theoretical models that describe the shape of the drop and the motion of the vapor, which are also highly interesting due to the wide range of thermophysical mechanisms that are involved in the phenomenon. In this way, some theoretical studies focus on the geometry, as well as the stability of the vapor film [34, 35, 36], considering a snapshot of the drop at a given time during its evaporation. A precise instantaneous description of the liquid-vapor system is obtained by simultaneously solving the Young-Laplace equation and the lubrication approximation, while considering a constant evaporation flux. For instance, good agreement is observed on the geometrical characteristics of the vapor layer between prediction, from the theoretical approach of Sobac et al. [35], and experimental measurements, by interferometry of the bottom of water drops by Burton et al. [37]. Additionally, a main result of these kind of works is the maximum size, a radial extent of around 3.95 times the capillary length, before the vapor layer becomes unstable and vapor chimneys disturb the shape of the drop [34]. Other studies are directed towards the dynamics of Leidenfrost drops, considering the different heat transfer mechanisms that are involved. Based on a quasi-static approach, time-dependent scaling laws for the radius of the drops and the thickness of the vapor films were developed for the first time by Biance et al. [30]. The drop radius r_{\text{max}} and the vapor film thickness h evolve with time t, respectively as: \displaystyle r_{\text{max}}(t) \displaystyle=r_{\text{max},0}\left(1-\dfrac{t}{\mathcal{T}}\right)^{n}\ , (1a) \displaystyle h(t) \displaystyle=h_{0}\left(1-\dfrac{t}{\mathcal{T}}\right)^{m}\ , (1b) where \mathcal{T} is the lifetime of the drop and h_{0} is the initial film thickness, both related to the initial drop radius r_{\text{max},0}, the hot plate temperature T_{\text{p}} and the thermophysical properties of the fluid. For puddles, which are drops with an extent above the capillary length, the exponents take the values n=2 and m=n/2, whereas for marbles, which are quasi-spherical drops with a radius below the capillary length, n=1/2 and m=4n/3. It is also important to denote that \mathcal{T} and h_{0} have different definitions, according to the size of the drop, for instance \mathcal{T}\sim r_{\text{max},0}^{1/n}. In the aforementioned study, the evaporation and phase change at the base of the drops was considered for all the drop sizes, whereas the evaporation from the entire drop surface was only considered for marble drops. This characterization with decoupled regimes avoids following the complete dynamics of an above-millimeter-sized drop, from its deposition on the hot plate till its full evaporation, with a continuous transition between the dynamics of a puddle and a marble. Two recent works address the phenomenon based on simple arguments and ideas, for large drops with extents above the capillary length, both pointing towards power laws with the same description given by eqs. (1b). The first is a theoretical analysis with strong simplifications on the drop shape [38], considering a hemispherical geometry, which leads to different values of the exponents, i.e. n=4/5 and m=n/4, also with \mathcal{T}\sim r_{\text{max},0}^{1/n} and additional fitting results that are in the range n\in\left(0.9,1.5\right). Unfortunately, this model leads to estimates of the vapor thermal conductivity that are at least 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the values found in the literature. The second is an experimental analysis that, based on the observations and a linear fitting of the drop mass in terms of the area projected over the hot plate [39], leads to n=1 and \mathcal{T}\sim r_{\text{max},0}^{1/n} as well. Besides the dependence on several fitting parameters, this model yields an overall heat transfer coefficient that varies with the size of the drop and, as a consequence, with time. It is worth noting that both studies take into account the evaporation at the bottom of the drop, and the consequent generation of the vapor cushion, but neglect the evaporation from the top of the drop towards the surrounding air. However, it has been shown that evaporation takes place over the entire surface, and not only in the film, when the drop is small and quasi-spherical [40], even if the contribution from the vapor film is largely dominant in the case of puddles. Both phenomena should therefore be taken into account to develop a dynamic model of the evaporation of a drop in the Leidenfrost state. Another two works attempt to follow the complete drop dynamics, through models that consider a quasi-static evolution of the drops [31, 33]. The first employs the lubrication approximation and pure heat conduction at the vapor layer, which is considered to have a uniform thickness. Relatively large drops are considered in this work, starting from initial radii of around 3.95 times the capillary length. Two fitting parameters are employed, i.e. a substrate-to-vapor heat transfer coefficient and an evaporation rate [31]. The second also includes the lubrication approximation, and incorporates heat conduction and radiation at the vapor layer, which is considered to have a thickness that varies with the radial position, as a previous quasi-static study [35]. Additionally, mass diffusion is considered for the top region of the drops, but considering a spherical drop approach and the gas around the upper part of the drop as a pure vapor phase [33], which may not be the case in experiments. Besides, despite the completeness of this work, it is limited by reduced extents of the drops, which requires initial radii either around or below the capillary length. Evidently, in all the aforementioned studies [38, 39, 31, 33], there is partial agreement between the experimental results and the developed models, either because of the reduced range of application (small or large drops) or the employment of fitting parameters. To date, different power laws had been presented, and several models and procedures that work on limited ranges had been developed, but still a common basis for the complete evolution of Leidenfrost drops, with relatively large initial radii (up to 3.5 times the capillary length), has not been established yet. Among other outcomes of the phenomenon, the dependence of the lifetime of the drops on the different physical parameters, such as initial drop size and plate temperature, remains empirical. In a recent study [40], considering pure conduction at the air surrounding the drop, the drop lifetime \mathcal{T} has been overestimated with respect to experimental data. Simultaneously, the authors propose an empiric power law for \mathcal{T}: \displaystyle\mathcal{T} \displaystyle=aV_{0}^{n}\ , (2) where V_{0} is the initial volume, while a and n are fitting parameters. According to experimental results and a fitting procedure, a is strongly dependent on the temperature of the plate T_{\text{p}}, whereas n remains nearly constant. For instance a\approx 8.9\times 10^{4} s\cdotm-3n for T_{\text{p}}=470\,^{\circ}\text{C}, while a\approx 1.6\times 10^{5} s\cdotm-3n for T_{\text{p}}=300\,^{\circ}\text{C}, whereas n\approx 0.4 throughout the same temperature range. In another work from the same authors, the following power law is proposed to assess the dependence of the drop lifetime on the temperature difference [36]: \displaystyle\mathcal{T} \displaystyle=A\left(T_{\text{p}}-T_{\text{l}}\right)^{-3/4}\ , (3) where T_{\text{l}} is the drop temperature and A\approx 4.6\times 10^{4} s\cdot^{\circ}C3/4 is a fitting parameter for the same initial volume V_{0}\approx 1.5\times 10^{-4} m3. This relation shows a very good agreement with experimental data when increased gravity conditions are implemented and the puddle regime is observed for small volume drops, but, once more, overestimates the experimental lifetime of drops at normal gravity conditions. An estimation of the drop evolution and lifetime is essential for many applications, including friction reduction [41, 42], microfluidics [43, 44, 45, 46], and cooling techniques [47, 48], among other possible usages that are still unveiled. Therefore, further research is required to provide a complete description of the dynamics of Leidenfrost drops. In this study, we revisit the Leidenfrost effect, with the aim of developing a simple but effective strategy to estimate outputs, for instance the drop size dependence on time and its lifetime, in terms of the input parameters, such as the hot plate temperature and the thermophysical properties of the fluid. Considering that the flow and heat transfer at the vapor film occurs at a much shorter time scale than the size reduction of the drop due to the evaporation, a quasi-static approximation is employed to develop a complete dynamic model. For an axisymmetric configuration the following procedure is performed: 1) the Young-Laplace equation is solved to find the shape of the drop for a given volume; 2) a Stokes flow is obtained for the vapor film, that is generated from the evaporation at the bottom of the drop and is expelled radially due to the weight of the drop; 3) the temperature distribution at the vapor film is obtained from heat conduction; 4) the evaporation rate is deduced from the Stefan condition at the bottom of the drop, from the heat transfer at the lateral region of the lower hemisphere, and from the Stefan convective evaporation flow at the top hemisphere of the drop; 5) a mass balance is applied to follow the evolution of the drop. Compared to previous modelling approaches of the phenomena [31, 33], there is no lubrication assumption for the flow in the vapor film, the analytical model being thus valid without any limiting value of the film thickness compared to the drop radius, which allows to deal continuously with both puddles and quasi-spherical drops. Besides, different contributions for evaporation are systematically considered in the model (within the vapor film, in the upper part of the drop and at its lateral region), without assuming a pure vapor for the ambient gas in the neighboring of the northern drop hemisphere. This approach allows us to study the dynamics of a drop in Leidenfrost state, from its initial size and shape (above or below the capillary threshold) until it disappears due to its full evaporation. Experiments were carried out using seven fluids, to serve as a basis for assessing the relevance of the analytical model that is proposed. The latter is written in dimensionless form and can be easily extended, if further contributions need to be included such as radiation or natural convection effects, which have not been taken into account in the range of temperature explored in this investigation. It is important to mention that no fitting parameters are employed in the proposed methodology."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08122v1,"Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Complementary Soft and Hard
Constraints for Solving Complex Boundary Navier-Stokes Equations","Soft- and hard-constrained Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have achieved great success in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, these methods still face great challenges when solving the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) with complex boundary conditions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel complementary scheme combining soft and hard constraint PINN methods. The soft-constrained part is thus formulated to obtain the preliminary results with a lighter training burden, upon which refined results are then achieved using a more sophisticated hard-constrained mechanism with a primary network and a distance metric network. Specifically, the soft-constrained part focuses on boundary points, while the primary network emphasizes inner domain points, primarily through PDE loss. Additionally, the novel distance metric network is proposed to predict the power function of the distance from a point to the boundaries, which serves as the weighting factor for the first two components. This approach ensures accurate predictions for both boundary and inner domain areas. The effectiveness of the proposed method on the NSEs problem with complex boundary conditions is demonstrated by solving a 2D cylinder wake problem and a 2D blocked cavity flow with a segmented inlet problem, achieving significantly higher accuracy compared to traditional soft- and hard-constrained PINN approaches. Given PINN’s inherent advantages in solving the inverse and the large-scale problems, which are challenging for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, this approach holds promise for the inverse design of required flow fields by specifically-designed boundary conditions and the reconstruction of large-scale flow fields by adding a limited number of training input points.The code for our approach will be made publicly available.","Fluid mechanics is an important field in science and engineering that deals with the study of the motion of liquids and gases. The Navier-Stokes equations are the basic partial differential equations that describe the dynamic behavior of viscous fluids, which are highly nonlinear partial differential equations and are widely used in aerodynamics, meteorology, oceanography, and industrial process simulations (Munson et al. 2006). In most cases, its high degree of nonlinearity and complexity makes it difficult to obtain analytical solutions to equations, so almost study is based numerical solutions. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite difference methods (FDM), finite element methods (FEM), and finite volume methods (FVM), have made significant progress in solving the Navier-Stokes equations, commonly referred to as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods (McLay 1996). However, these techniques need the sufficient initial and boundary conditions while they are often difficult to obtain in practice(Abdel-Rahman 2011). Even if accurate mathematical systems of NSEs are obtained, they still often encounter challenges with grid generation for the high-dimensional and the complex boundary condition problems, which require substantial computational resources and time, and may lead to issues of numerical instability and loss of accuracy (McLay 1996). Deep learning (DL) (LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015) methods have achieved great success in computer science, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs), which possess a universal function approximation property that renders them promising as CFD surrogate models. The main achievements of deep learning methods have been in the area of image recognition, which relies on being trained on large datasets (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2017; He et al. 2016). In contrast, data from fluid systems are often sparse and noisy when obtained experimentally. Consequently, approaches that rely solely on data for learning, as in image recognition, are not viable for fluid models (Eivazi, Wang, and Vinuesa 2024; Sharma et al. 2023). Physical Information Neural Network (PINNs) is a type of deep learning approach that incorporates physical constraints by embedding physical equations and boundary conditions into the loss function of a neural network. PINNs were first proposed by Raissi et al. in 2019 (Raissi, Perdikaris, and Karniadakis 2019) for solving one-dimensional partial differential equation problems, such as the Burgers equation, as well as inverse problems for two-dimensional and three-dimensional partial differential equations with a certain amount of labeled data (Raissi, Perdikaris, and Karniadakis 2019; Raissi, Yazdani, and Karniadakis 2020; Karniadakis et al. 2021; Go, Lim, and Lee 2023). PINN offer significantly higher accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional CFD solvers when limited scattered partial spatio-temporal data are available for the flow problem under study. The structure of PINNs is inherently flexible, allowing the same formulation to be used for both forward and inverse problems. This eliminates the need for costly data assimilation techniques, which have historically slowed progress, especially in optimization and design tasks related to fluid dynamics (Cai et al. 2021). Furthermore, PINN offer a unified approach to handling flow problems that exhibit phenomena across different scales (Leung, Lin, and Zhang 2022), for which traditional CFD methods often require different models. However, for fluid models with complex boundary conditions, conventional PINN methods often struggle to accurately approximate both the boundary conditions and the partial differential equations (Hsieh and Huang 2024). Thus, the execution of boundary conditions is of paramount importance, and current methods for execute them in PINNs can be categorized into soft and hard constraints (Barschkis 2023; Lu et al. 2021). Conventional PINNs typically adopt a soft-constraint approach (Raissi, Perdikaris, and Karniadakis 2019; Lai et al. 2023), where boundary conditions and initial conditions are explicitly embedded into the loss function, which is trained simultaneously with the PDE loss. By introducing the laws of physics into the loss function, the stability of the training process can be improved, and the network can avoid learning solutions that violate the laws of physics, especially when data is scarce. This can help models generalize better to unseen data, particularly when they need to extrapolate beyond the range of the training data. However, this method often fails to guarantee the satisfaction of both the PDE and the boundary conditions, resulting in lower accuracy of the outcomes (Cuomo et al. 2022; Bai et al. 2022; Bischof and Kraus 2021). Hard-constraint methods (Lu et al. 2021) enforce boundary conditions by constructing a solution and a distance function that correspond to the boundary conditions, such that the network enforces the conditions during training by simply optimizing the partial differential equation loss, thereby avoiding the issue of tuning the weights of different parts of the loss function (Lan et al. 2023). But the hard-constrained PINN approach encounters certain limitations. The solutions it devises for boundary conditions are often contingent upon a DNN with a limited number of hidden layers, which can hinder their ability to accurately solve complex boundary conditions. During training, this DNN solely uses coordinate points at the boundaries as input to ensure that boundary conditions are met. However, when boundary conditions are complex, the output of the DNN can become highly disordered, leading to extremely slow or non-convergent loss during the training of partial differential equations. Ultimately, this may prevent the model from producing accurate variable outputs. This limitation reduces the network’s generative capabilities, especially in scenarios requiring higher flexibility or when dealing with intricate boundary conditions (Barschkis 2023; Deng et al. 2023). This paper constructs the solution of boundary conditions and the distance function specifically combine the soft- and the hard-constraint methods, enabling their application to various complex-boundary fluid dynamics problems. Its feasibility is demonstrated through testing on two fluid models under different boundary condition scenarios and comparing the results with those from CFD methods and traditional soft and hard constraint approaches. In summary, our work makes the following contributions: 1. We propose a physics-informed neural network approach that combines soft and hard constraints to solve flow fields in regions with irregular obstructing structures. 2. A power function is proposed to redefine the distance metric in the hard-constrained approach for handling complex boundary conditions, thereby improving prediction accuracy. 3. The proposed method is thoroughly validated through extensive experimentation on complex-boundary Navier-Stokes equations, such as the 2D cylinder wake problem and the 2D blocked cavity flow problem with a segmented inlet."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08071v1,Improved Greedy Identification of Latent Dynamics with Application to Fluid Flows,"Model reduction is a key technology for large-scale physical systems in science and engineering, as it brings behavior expressed in many degrees of freedom to a more manageable size that subsequently allows control, optimization, and analysis with multi-query algorithms. We introduce an enhanced regression technique tailored to uncover quadratic parametric reduced-order dynamical systems from data. Our method, termed Improved Greedy Identification of Latent Dynamics (I-GILD), refines the learning phase of the original GILD approach proposed in [1]. This refinement is achieved by reorganizing the quadratic model coefficients, allowing the minimum-residual problem to be reformulated using the Frobenius norm. Consequently, the optimality conditions lead to a generalized Sylvester equation, which is efficiently solved using the conjugate gradient method. Analysis of the convergence shows that I-GILD achieves superior convergence for quadratic model coefficients compared to GILD’s steepest gradient descent, reducing both computational complexity and iteration count. Additionally, we derive an error bound for the model predictions, offering insights into error growth in time and ensuring controlled accuracy as long as the magnitudes of initial error is small and learning residuals are well minimized. The efficacy of I-GILD is demonstrated through its application to numerical and experimental tests, specifically the flow past Ahmed body with a variable rear slant angle, and the lid-driven cylindrical cavity problem with variable Reynolds numbers, utilizing particle-image velocimetry (PIV) data. These tests confirm I-GILD’s ability to treat real-world dynamical system challenges and produce effective reduced-order models.","Model reduction techniques have become essential in fields where solving high-dimensional systems or handling large datasets poses computational challenges. These techniques reduce computational costs by preserving the core features and dynamics of complex systems in a lower-dimensional representation, enabling applications in flow control, design optimization, uncertainty quantification, and multi-query algorithms, such as Monte Carlo simulations. A core aspect of model reduction involves data compression techniques, which create low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) [2] is a widely used linear method for this purpose, identifying orthogonal modes that capture dominant structures and significant variations within the data. For more complex, nonlinear systems, methods like auto-encoder neural networks provide effective nonlinear data compression by mapping data into a low-dimensional latent space [3]. Additionally, parsimonious diffusion maps reveal intrinsic low-dimensional manifolds in fluid flows, offering an alternative data-driven reduction approach [4]. Polynomial manifold constructions have also been employed for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, which preserves underlying data geometry while remaining interpretable across various parameters [5]. In this paper, we rely on the POD technique for its balance of computational simplicity and robustness. Beyond compression, predicting the dynamics of latent variables within this reduced space is critical for understanding the evolution of complex systems. Techniques such as Galerkin projection are frequently used, projecting governing equations (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations) onto a reduced basis. However, Galerkin methods require complete knowledge of governing equations, limiting their application in black-box simulations or experimental data with sparse spatial coverage. As a result, non-intrusive, data-driven approaches have gained traction, allowing for reduced-order models to be built directly from data without requiring explicit equations. Methods such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) [6] and its variants [7] effectively capture coherent spatio-temporal structures in flow data, while Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) [8] uses sparse regression to identify underlying equations from a dictionary of given functions. Spectral submanifold methods go further by enabling predictive modeling within a reduced phase space [9]. Recent studies have introduced machine learning and stochastic approaches for latent dynamics learning. Generative learning techniques, such as those in [10, 11], forecast high-dimensional complex system dynamics. In parallel, stochastic modeling techniques address model-form uncertainties within latent space dynamics [12], while physics-based nonlinear manifolds enhance the robustness and fidelity of reduced-order models [13]. Physics-informed approaches, including the gLaSDI framework, incorporate physics-based constraints within the reduced-order dynamics, supporting more generalizable and robust modeling in latent spaces [14]. Further advancements in machine learning, such as self-attention mechanisms [15], capture long-range dependencies and enhance sequence predictions in fluid dynamics, especially when integrated with auto-encoder frameworks [3]. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) [16] embed governing equations directly within neural networks, preserving conservation laws and reducing data requirements [17]. Moreover, frameworks like Latent Dynamics Networks have pushed the modeling of intrinsic dynamics in spatio-temporal systems forward by capturing nuanced latent representations from high-dimensional data [11]. Polynomial-based approaches in latent space dynamics, similar to the multivariate quadratic formulation, align with the Greedy Identification of Latent Dynamics (GILD) method [1]. GILD, introduced for data-driven modeling in reduced-order frameworks, uses nested POD stages inspired by reduced Navier-Stokes equations. It models latent dynamics using a quadratic polynomial structure and minimizes residuals with a steepest-descent algorithm, although it suffers from high computational costs in large-scale applications. To address these issues, we propose the Improved Greedy Identification of Latent Dynamics (I-GILD) method. By reorganizing the quadratic model coefficients, we reformulate the minimization problem using the Frobenius norm, resulting in a generalized Sylvester equation that is solved efficiently via the conjugate gradient (CG) method [18, 19, 20]. I-GILD achieves faster convergence compared to GILD’s steepest-descent approach, with reduced computational complexity and iteration counts. Additionally, we derive an error bound for GILD, providing insight into error growth and ensuring controlled accuracy in short term provided the magnitudes of initial error is small and the learning residuals are well minimized. I-GILD’s robustness is validated through applications in Ahmed body flow and lid-driven cylindrical cavity problems, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications in complex dynamical systems. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the original GILD method [1]. Section 3 introduces the I-GILD method and discusses its convergence, computational cost, and derived error bound. Section 4 includes numerical experiments, such as applications to Ahmed body flow with varying rear slant angles and lid-driven cylindrical cavity problems with variable Reynolds numbers. Section 5 concludes with a summary of contributions and potential future research directions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08064v1,Energy and entropy conserving compatible finite elements with upwinding for the thermal shallow water equations,"In this work, we develop a new compatible finite element formulation of the thermal shallow water equations that conserves energy and mathematical entropies given by buoyancy–related quadratic tracer variances. Our approach relies on restating the governing equations to enable discontinuous approximations of thermodynamic variables and a variational continuous time integration. A key novelty is the inclusion of centred and upwinded fluxes. The proposed semi-discrete system conserves discrete entropy for centred fluxes, monotonically damps entropy for upwinded fluxes, and conserves energy. The fully discrete scheme reflects entropy conservation at the continuous level. The ability of a new linearised Jacobian, which accounts for both centred and upwinded fluxes, to capture large variations in buoyancy and simulate thermally unstable flows for long periods of time is demonstrated for two different transient case studies. The first involves a thermogeostrophic instability where including upwinded fluxes is shown to suppress spurious oscillations while successfully conserving energy and monotonically damping entropy. The second is a double vortex where a constrained fully discrete formulation is shown to achieve exact entropy conservation in time.","Mathematical entropies, or entropy, are convex functionals arising from a positive definite Hessian [Fisher2013, Leveque1992, Chapter 3] that correspond to quadratic buoyancy–related tracer invariants for the thermal shallow water equations [Ricardo2023, Ricardo2024-dg]. The thermal shallow water equations are a useful stepping stone from simpler atmospheric systems, like the rotating shallow water equations, to the full three-dimensional compressible Euler equations typically used to describe atmospheric dynamics in operational weather models [Maynard2020, Adams2019, Lee2021]. The thermal shallow equations are analogous to the compressible Euler equations with an identical Poisson bracket and entropy, and include a thermodynamic scalar quantity reflective of temperature [Eldred2019, Ricardo2023, Ricardo2024-dg]. Such thermodynamic quantities are not included in the rotating shallow water equations [Cotter2014, BauerCotter2018, Mcrae2013, Wimmer2020], meaning these other models do not capture the effect of thermodynamic transport on the horizontal pressure gradient [Kurganov2021]. In this study, we develop a novel finite element approximation of the thermal shallow water equations that provably conserves energy and entropy at the semi-discrete level. Large scale simulations show the resulting scheme is conservative, captures turbulent dynamics, and can stably simulate non-linear flow over long time scales where a mature turbulent state is reached. The desired properties of state-of-the-art numerical solvers for atmospheric models, discussed by \citetStaniforth2012, emphasise conserving system invariants over long time scales [Gibson2019, Thuburn2008]. Energy is a key invariant that can be conserved by exploiting the non-canonical Hamiltonian form of the governing equations at the semi-discrete level [Shepherd1990, Salmon1998]. Discrete entropy conservation improves model stability of hyperbolic systems that involve thermodynamic quantities by bounding unstable growth associated with grid scale variance [Ricardo2023, Ricardo2024-dg]. Recent studies achieve semi-discrete entropy conservation by rewriting the equations of motion to allow for discontinuous approximations of thermodynamic variables [Ricardo2023, Ricardo2024-dg]. In this study, we take a similar approach and restate the thermal shallow water equations to obtain semi-discrete entropy conservation under continuous time integration. Entropy conservation requires preserving certain conformity requirements in space and time that may not be inherited by the numerical approximations. A previous entropy conserving study uses a mixed finite element method in conjunction with Galerkin projections to enforce the necessary regularity of buoyancy fluxes [Ricardo2023]. Such continuity requirements are achieved in a different study via a discontinuous Galerkin method [Ricardo2024-dg]. In the current study, we consider a compatible finite element method that includes internal element boundary fluxes, cast in either a centred or upwinded form. The centred fluxes conserve energy and entropy, while the upwinded fluxes are proven to conserve energy and monotonically damp entropy. Care is taken to derive buoyancy terms that ensure entropy exchanges are balanced in both space and time for all forcing terms. In doing so, we ensure the only source of entropy conservation error is from temporal derivatives. The semi-discrete formulation also conserves total mass, buoyancy, vorticity, and supports compatible advection of buoyancy, thus satisfying the criteria of a compatible finite element discretisation for the thermal shallow water equations [Eldred2019, Ricardo2024-dg]. Constructing Poisson time integrators for non-canonical Hamiltonian systems often requires exploiting specific structures of the model problem [Hairer2006, Chapter VII.4]. The Poisson time integrator proposed by \citetCohen2011 conserves energy through exact temporal integration of the variational derivatives of the Hamiltonian [Eldred2019, BauerCotter2018, Lee2021, Lee2022, Wimmer2020, Cotter2014]. Quadratic invariants are also temporally preserved via the Poisson integrator [Cohen2011], while cubic invariants, which represent mathematical entropies in the form of tracer variances, are generally not. Previous studies [Ricardo2023, Ricardo2024-dg] regarding entropy conservation consider strong stability preserving time integrators [Shu1988, Durran2010] for which entropy is not conserved exactly in time and energy variance is damped. In this work, we take a different approach and use a Poisson integrator [Cohen2011] to construct a fully discrete scheme that conserves energy. Discrete buoyancy is represented as a linear polynomial in time such that discrete entropy is a cubic polynomial in time, which is not temporally conserved point-wise by the chosen Poisson integrator [Cohen2011]. We prove the loss in exact entropy conservation depends on the accuracy of the temporal approximation, and consequently propose a constrained formulation using Lagrange multipliers for which entropy is exactly conserved in time. This article is structured as follows: in Section 2 we reformulate the thermal shallow water equations at the continuous level and analyse the regularity requirements for continuous entropy conservation. Finite element approximations are derived in Sections 3 and 4, where conservation at the semi- and fully discrete levels is evaluated. In Section 5, convergence of the new scheme under h-p refinement is demonstrated using a steady thermogeostrophic balance test case [Eldred2019]. By considering small perturbations from the solution at progressive time levels instead of the usual mean flow state [Eldred2019, Lee2022], we propose a new linearised Jacobian and quasi-Newton approach that shows robust convergence in the presence of large variations in buoyancy for both centred and upwinded fluxes. Thus, we stably simulate thermally unstable flows to well evolved turbulent states, as demonstrated for transient case studies involving a thermogeostrophic instability [Eldred2019, Gouzien2017, Kurganov2021, Zeitlin2018] and a double vortex [Giorgetta2009, Eldred2019]. Conservation of invariants over long time scales is assessed, and Lagrange multipliers are used to correct small temporal losses in entropy conservation for centred numerical fluxes. The inclusion of upwinded numerical fluxes is shown to suppress spurious oscillations while conserving energy and monotonically damping entropy."

revealed by a cluster-based network model 
of experimental data","Modelling fluid turbulence using a ‘skeleton’ of coherent structures has traditionally progressed by focusing on a few canonical laboratory experiments such as pipe flow and Taylor-Couette flow. We here consider the stratified inclined duct, a sustained shear flow whose density stratification allows for the exploration of a wealth of new coherent and intermittent states at significantly higher Reynolds numbers than in unstratified flows. We automatically identify the underlying turbulent skeleton of this experiment with a data-driven method combining dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering of shadowgraph visualisations. We demonstrate the existence of multiple types of turbulence across parameter space and intermittent cycling between them, revealing distinct transition pathways. With a cluster-based network model of intermittency we uncover patterns in the transition probabilities and residence times under increasing levels of turbulent dissipation. Our method and results pave the way for new reduced-order models of multi-physics turbulence.","References [1] \NameHopf E. \REVIEWComm. Pure Appl. Math.11948303. [2] \NameRuelle D.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08764v1,Flow reconstruction in time-varying geometries using graph neural networks,"The paper presents a Graph Attention Convolutional Network (GACN) for flow reconstruction from very sparse data in time-varying geometries. The model incorporates a feature propagation algorithm as a preprocessing step to handle extremely sparse inputs, leveraging information from neighboring nodes to initialize missing features. In addition, a binary indicator is introduced as a validity mask to distinguish between the original and propagated data points, enabling more effective learning from sparse inputs. Trained on a unique data set of Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a motored engine at a technically relevant operating condition, the GACN shows robust performance across different resolutions and domain sizes and can effectively handle unstructured data and variable input sizes. The model is tested on previously unseen DNS data as well as on an experimental data set from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements that were not considered during training. A comparative analysis shows that the GACN consistently outperforms both a conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and cubic interpolation methods on the DNS and PIV test sets by achieving lower reconstruction errors and better capturing fine-scale turbulent structures. In particular, the GACN effectively reconstructs flow fields from domains up to 14 times larger than those observed during training, with the performance advantage increasing for larger domains.","The reconstruction of spatial fields from sparse and limited data is a major challenge in the analysis, estimation and control of complex physical systems. In various fields such as atmospheric research (Tello Alonso et al., 2010; Mishra et al., 2014), autonomous aerial navigation (Achermann et al., 2019, 2024) and fluid dynamics (Fukami et al., 2019), conventional linear methods such as linear stochastic estimation (Adrian and Moin, 1988), Delaunay triangulation (Saini et al., 2016) and proper orthogonal decomposition (Bui-Thanh et al., 2004; Druault et al., 2005) face challenges in accurately reconstructing extensive spatial patterns. This is especially true when dealing with very sparse data and problems such as system nonlinearity and boundary effects. Neural Networks (NN) have emerged as a promising nonlinear alternative that has proven to be effective in efficiently reconstructing chaotic data from sparse information. Building on this foundation, Machine Learning (ML) has achieved remarkable success in generating flow fields using data from experimental observations and numerical simulations (e.g. Kissas et al. (2020); Shengnan et al. (2019); Cai et al. (2019)). Recent work has demonstrated the power of ML approaches in fluid dynamics applications. Morimoto et al. (2021) used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze artificial Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) data, and propose a novel approach for reconstructing flow fields from snapshots containing regions with missing data. Kochkov et al. (2021) employed an end-to-end CNN-based model to improve approximations inside Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) domains for modeling two-dimensional (2D) turbulent flows. Manickathan et al. (2022) proposed CNN as an alternative to the image cross-correlation methods commonly used in processing PIV data to reconstruct the fluid velocity field, and it was shown to outperform conventional methods in terms of robustness to data noise and providing reconstructed velocity fields with significantly higher spatial resolution. Super-Resolution (SR) methods have also been used to reconstruct high-resolution flow fields from low-resolution data. Fukami et al. (2019) utilized a CNN and a hybrid downsampled skip-connection/multi-scale (DSC/MS) CNN model, for the SR analysis of turbulent flow fields from very coarse data. Kim et al. (2021) used the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to reconstruct flow fields from low-resolution DNS and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) data. Bode et al. (2021, 2023) developed a physics-based super-resolution generative adversarial network (PIESRGAN) for subfilter-scale turbulence reconstruction that uses a loss function based on the continuity equation residue. Even though only homogeneous isotropic data was used to train the model, it was able to make better predictions of scalar mixing in a reacting jet. The aforementioned models rely on convolutional layers and can therefore be applied to unstructured data only to a limited extent. Since conventional ML methods require a feature matrix with a specific size and order of input samples, they cannot be readily applied to unstructured data. However, flow field data can be highly unstructured due to irregular meshes in curved or complex geometries. Several approaches have been developed to address the limitations of CNN when handling unstructured data in fluid dynamics. Heaney et al. (2024) proposed using space-filling curves to transform multi-dimensional solutions on unstructured meshes into a one-dimensional (1D) representation, allowing for the application of 1D convolutional layers. Xu et al. (2021b) developed an unstructured CNN that aggregates and exploits features from neighboring nodes through a weight function, enabling convolutions on irregular grids. Kashefi et al. (2021); Kashefi and Mukerji (2022) explored point cloud deep learning frameworks where CFD grid vertices are treated as point clouds and used as inputs to neural networks. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have also emerged as a powerful tool for unstructured data. He et al. (2022) introduced the flow completion network (FCN) that employs a GCN to deduce fluid dynamics from sparse data sets. Duthé et al. (2023) also used a GCN to predict the flow field and far-field boundary conditions based on the pressure distribution at the surface of airfoils. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in applying ML techniques to fluid dynamics problems. One significant limitation is the difficulty in handling extremely sparse data, where traditional interpolation methods often fail to capture complex flow features. Additionally, time-varying geometries pose a unique challenge, as most current ML models are designed for static configurations and struggle to adapt to dynamic changes in the flow domain. Another critical issue is the generalization of ML models across different types of data sets, from high-fidelity numerical simulations to experimental measurements. The discrepancies in data quality, resolution, and underlying physics between these sources can lead to poor accuracy when models trained on one type of data are applied to another. In this paper, we introduce a Graph Attention Convolutional Network (GACN) trained on a unique data set of three-dimensional (3D) Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) modeling the compression-expansion stroke of a single-cylinder Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) under practically relevant operating conditions. The DNS data presents specific challenges for conventional ML applications due to its unstructured grid that dynamically changes during compression, leading to variations in resolution. GACN effectively addresses both aspects: the unstructured nature of the data is captured by the position of the graph nodes, while the changing resolution is accounted for by the distance features of the edges between nodes. Furthermore, we present a method to handle extremely sparse data, which performs remarkably well even when 99% of the data is missing. This is achieved by incorporating a Feature Propagation (FP) algorithm as a preprocessing step and adding a Binary Indicator (BI) as an extra feature. The FP algorithm initializes absent features with values that are both reasonable and physically consistent, leveraging data from neighboring nodes. The BI serves as a validity mask, providing crucial information to the network about which data points are original and which are propagated, enabling a more effective learning from sparse inputs without the limitations of using default values for missing data. Notably, we demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the approach by successfully applying the model trained on DNS data to experimental PIV measurements, achieving promising results despite the inherent differences between numerical and experimental data sources. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the DNS and PIV data sets used for training and evaluating the model. In Sec. 3, we provide a detailed description of the GACN model, as well as the alternative models used for comparison, specifically a CNN and classical cubic interpolation. Section 4 presents a comprehensive analysis of the model predictive accuracy using both numerical data derived from DNS simulations and experimental data from PIV measurements which was not used during training. We compare the performance of the GACN model to a CNN architecture for which data was interpolated onto a uniform mesh and classical cubic interpolation. The main conclusions and future research directions are outlined in Sec. 5."

Since these instabilities manifest as acoustic oscillations during combustion, a mathematical model has been developed to calculate the chamber modes, providing an accurate method for predicting the acoustic behaviour of the combustion chamber. A novel method for discretising the Laplacian operator is introduced, which allows the calculation of the acoustic modes of complex chamber geometries. This approach uses an efficient numerical algorithm designed for unstructured mesh configurations. Several computational examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the model to complex geometries typical of solid rocket motors. In addition, an analytical procedure is developed in these examples to aid the design process, providing engineers with critical data to optimise the stability and performance of propulsion systems. This research provides valuable insights into the analysis of combustion instabilities, with broad implications for the design and optimisation of propulsion systems in aerospace engineering.",Nomenclature Symbols A Transfer function coefficient A_{b} Area of the burning surface [m^{2}] A_{g} Area of the nozzle throat [m^{2}] a Speed of sound [m/s] B Transfer function coefficient c^{*} Characteristic velocity [m/s] E_{n} Modal space norm f Inhomogeneous boundary term h Inhomogeneous term K_{g} Klemmung k Complex wave number [1/s] k^{*} Characteristic wave number [1/m] L^{*} Characteristic chamber length [m] \Delta l Mesh contour M Mach number \dot{m} Mass flow rate [kg/s] n_{s} Pyrolysis constant \hat{n} Normal vector p_{c} Chamber pressure [N/m^{2}] R Gas constant of mixture [\frac{J}{kgK}] R_{g} Nozzle transfer function R_{p} Burning surface transfer function \dot{r}_{b} Regression rate [m/s] T_{c} Chamber temperature [K] u Fluid velocity [m/s] Greek symbols \alpha Growth rate [1/s] \gamma Relation specific heat capacities \varepsilon_{c} Convergent area relation \vartheta_{c} Volume of the cavity [m^{3}] \kappa Small amplitude \lambda Complex root \rho Density of the mixture [\frac{kg}{m^{3}}] \psi_{N} Unperturbed mode \psi_{n} Eigenfunction \Omega Dimensionless frequency \omega Angular frequency [rad/s] Sub-indexes (\ )_{b} Burning surface (\ )_{l} Convergent region (\ )_{p} Propellant (\ )_{t} Throat (\ )_{w} Wall
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08613v1,Electrohydrodynamic flow about a colloidal particle suspended in a non-polar fluid,"Nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena, where electrically driven fluid flows depend nonlinearly on the applied voltage, are commonly encountered in aqueous suspensions of colloidal particles. A prime example is the induced-charge electro-osmosis, driven by an electric field acting on diffuse charge induced near a polarizable surface. Nonlinear electrohydrodynamic flows also occur in non-polar fluids, driven by the electric field acting on space charge induced by conductivity gradients. Here, we analyze the flows about a charge-neutral spherical solid particle in an applied uniform electric field that arise from conductivity dependence on local field intensity. The flow pattern varies with particle conductivity: while the flow about a conducting particle has a quadrupolar pattern similar to induced-charge electro-osmosis albeit with opposite direction, the flow about an insulating particle has a more complex structure. We find that this flow induces a force on a particle near an electrode that varies non-trivially with particle conductivity: while it is repulsive for perfectly insulating particle and particles more conductive than the suspending medium, there exists a range of particle conductivities where the force is attractive. The force decays as inverse square of the distance to the electrode and thus can dominate the dielectrophoretic attraction due to the image dipole, which falls off with the fourth power with the distance. This electrohydrodynamic lift opens new possibilities for colloidal manipulation and driven assembly by electric fields.","The interaction of colloids and electric fields is widely used for directed assembly and particle manipulation (Prieve et al., 2010; Velev & Bhatt, 2006; van Blaaderen et al., 2013; Edwards & Bevan, 2014; Bharti & Velev, 2015; Harraq et al., 2022). In recent years, motile colloids energized by an applied electric field have become a popular model for self-propelled “active” particles (Yan et al., 2016; Han et al., 2018; Driscoll & Delmotte, 2019; Diwakar et al., 2022; Boymelgreen et al., 2022). One propulsion mechanism exploits the induced charge electrophoresis of colloids suspended in aqueous electrolyte solutions (Squires & Bazant, 2004, 2006; Gangwal et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2015; Nishiguchi & Sano, 2015). Another propulsion strategy is particle rolling on an electrode surface due to the Quincke rotation (a symmetry-breaking instability which gives rise to a torque on the particle in an applied uniform electric field) (Bricard et al., 2013, 2015; Snezhko, 2016; Karani et al., 2019; Pradillo et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021a). The threshold for the Quincke rotation is very sensitive to the solvent conductivity and experimentally accessible only in non-polar solvents, still at electric fields with magnitude in the order of MV/m. At such strong electric fields, electric conduction may be no longer be in the Ohmic regime due to fluid conductivity becoming dependent on electric field intensity (Onsager, 1934; Castellanos, 1998). Field-enhanced conductivity arises from the electric field effect on the dissociation-recombination equilibrium between ion pairs and free ions (termed Onsager effect). In a non-polar fluid, the electrolyte added to control conduction exists mostly in the form of neutral ion pairs (Prieve et al., 2017). The application of a strong electric field increases the rate of the ion pair dissociation thereby increasing the number of charge carriers and, accordingly, the electrical conductivity (Castellanos, 1998). This effect is suggested to underlie the flow observed about colloids suspended in oil (Ryu et al., 2010), whose pattern resembles the induced charge osmotic flow about an ideally-polarizable particle in aqueous solutions, and the oscillatory motion of Quincke rollers (Zhang et al., 2021b). Recent experiments have also reported that a charge-free, dielectric particle lifts off from the electrode (Pradillo et al., 2019) despite the attraction by the image dipole, which may involve electrohydrodynamic flow. Motivated by the potential impact of electrohydrodynamic flows on Quincke colloid “activity” and collective dynamics, here we examine the possibility of a flow driven by conductivity gradients set by nonuniformities in the applied electric field. While the electric field driven flows about colloids near electrodes in aqueous electrolyte solutions have been subject to a great interest (Ristenpart et al., 2004, 2007; Hashemi et al., 2018; Bazant et al., 2009; Prieve et al., 2010; Khair, 2022; Katzmeier et al., 2022; Fernández-Mateo et al., 2022), colloidal electrohydrodynamics in non-polar fluids is far less explored. In this paper, we predict that an electrohydrodynamic flow driven by the Onsager effect arises about a spherical particle in an applied uniform electric field. We develop an asymptotic solution in the case of fluid conductivity linearly varying with the electric field intensity. We analyze the flow effect on the particle interaction with the electrode. The force on the particle due to the electrohydrodynamic flow is calculated using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem and found to be repulsive for insulating particles."
https://arxiv.org/html/2410.22410v1,Quantum Turbulence in a Three-Dimensional Holographic Superfluid,"We report real-time simulations of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of a holographic superfluid in three dimensions. The holographic duality maps a strongly coupled superfluid to a weakly coupled theory with gravity in a higher-dimensional curved space which we study numerically. Starting from configurations of dense tangles of quantized vortex lines, the superfluid exhibits turbulent behavior during its evolution towards thermal equilibrium. Specifically, we observe two subsequent universal regimes of quasi-stationary scaling in the occupation number spectrum, the first of which is Kolmogorov-like. Indications for the strongly dissipative nature of vortex dynamics in the three-dimensional holographic superfluid are found in the rapid shrinking and annihilation of small vortex rings that emerge from frequent reconnections of vortex lines during the evolution.","References [1] C.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07891v1,"Stabilization of the Rayleigh-Bénard system
by injection of thermal inertial particles and bubbles","The effects of a dispersed particulate phase on the onset of Rayleigh-Bénard (RB) convection in a fluid layer is studied theoretically by means of a two-fluid Eulerian modelization. The particles are non-Brownian, spherical, with inertia and heat capacity, and are assumed to interact with the surrounding fluid mechanically and thermally. We study both the cases of particles denser and lighter than the fluid that are injected uniformly at the system’s horizontal boundaries with their settling terminal velocity and prescribed temperatures. The performed linear stability analysis shows that the onset of thermal convection is stationary, i.e., the system undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation as in the classical single-phase RB problem. Remarkably, the mechanical coupling due to the particle motion always stabilizes the system, increasing the critical Rayleigh number (Ra_{c}) of the convective onset. Furthermore, the particle to fluid heat capacity ratio provides an additional stabilizing mechanism, that we explore in full by addressing both the asymptotic limits of negligible and overwhelming particle thermal inertia. The overall resulting stabilization effect on Ra_{c} is significant: for a particulate volume fraction of 0.1\% it reaches up to a factor 30 for the case of the lightest particle density (i.e. bubbles) and 60 for the heaviest one. The present work extends the analysis performed by Prakhar & Prosperetti (Physical Review Fluids 6, 083901, 2021) where the thermo-mechanical stabilization effect has been first demonstrated for highly dense particles. Here, by including the effect of the added-mass force in the model system, we succeed in exploring the full range of particle densities. Finally, we critically discuss the role of the particle injection boundary conditions which are adopted in this study and how their modification may lead to different dynamics, that deserve to be explored in the future.","Virtually all fluids present in the natural environment contain dispersed matter, i.e., matter of a different composition from the one of the surrounding environment. This occurs in the form of solid particles, liquid drops or gaseous bubbles. Examples include phenomena as diverse as sand and pollens in the near ground air, rain drops and ice crystals in clouds, air bubbles entrained at the sea-air interface, volatile elements springing up in solidifying magma and planktonic microorganisms dispersed in the ocean[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Such particle laden fluids are often set into motion by thermal differences present in the environment. However, while most of the time the role played by the dispersed phase is negligible for the overall dynamics of the fluid - think e.g. to the passive role of the grains of dust brought in suspension by a storm - there are situations where the mechanical agitation and/or the thermal coupling produced by the dispersed phase are relevant for the resulting flow dynamics (one of such examples is bioconvection [10]). Fluid-particle coupling phenomena are also of interest for industrial applications such as for optimization of mixing in bubble column reactors or for the design of particle based solar collectors [11, 12, 13, 14]. The widespread relevance of this topic has spurred extensive researches aimed at understanding the complex interplays governing the dynamics of particle-laden fluid flows [15, 16, 17]. To gain insight into particle-fluid systems, several approaches are possible, each corresponding to different physical conditions of the problem at hand but also to distinct levels of abstraction in their description. At the most refined level we find the “particle resolved” approach that treat the complete fluid-dynamical and thermal fluid-solid body interaction problem. This is the only sound modelization when the characteristic scales of the particulate phase are large as compared to the ones of the fluid. However, the major drawback of this approach is the complexity of its mathematical treatment even with state-of-the-art numerical methods, due to the high numbers of degrees of freedom involved [18]. When the particle sizes are of the same order or smaller than the typical spatial scales of the flow and of the heat transfer process, the particle description can be approximated by material points (dubbed “point particles”). Their coupling to the fluid can be described by localized forces or source terms that satisfy global conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy. It falls in this case the so called Eulerian-Lagrangian modelization of particulate laden flows, where the fluid variables are treated as continuous fields evolving in the Eulerian frame, while the particles are described as individual entities in the Lagrangian frame. A further level of abstraction is represented by the two-fluid or Eulerian-Eulerian methods where both phases are described in terms of conservation equations for continuous and differentiable fields. The particulate state variables are typically their mass concentration, velocity and local temperature but additional degrees of freedom can be introduced (e.g. the local particle orientation, in case of non spherical particles) [19, 20]. The latter approach has even a more restrictive domain of applications as it requires the particles not only to be tiny in size but also to be sufficiently numerous in order to be able to define continuous state variables in space and time. One appealing aspect of fully Eulerian models is the relative simplicity of their governing equations, which are expressed in the form of partial differential equations that closely resemble the local conservation laws of fluids and transported scalar fields. This also implies that analytical approaches, as for instance the ones of hydrodynamic stability [21] or fluctuating hydrodynamics [22] can be straightforwardly adapted to this type of modelling. In the present work we aim at understanding how settling and rising thermal inertial particles affect the hydrodynamic stability of an immobile thermally stratified fluid layer. This will be achieved by adopting a fully Eulerian modelization and by performing a fluid dynamics linear stability analysis of the system’s governing equations. The system we study in this article builds on the classical model of natural convection, known as Rayleigh-Bénard (RB) model system, which is a layer of fluid between two horizontal planes kept at different constant temperatures, the above one being colder so that the fluid layer is slightly denser on top with respect to the bottom [23]. If the system does not contain a pure fluid but rather a suspension of material particles, it goes under the name of particulate Rayleigh-Bénard (pRB) system [24]. The research questions of interest in the pRB context are multiple. On one hand it is interesting to understand how the fluid flow affects the particle dynamics. In particular how it impacts on the particle spatial distribution and clusters formation, or how it affects the settling speeds, the resulting sedimentation patterns forming at the walls and the possibility of particle resuspension and entrainement by the flow. On the other hand it is pertinent to tackle how the feedback of the particulate phase can in turn influence the spatial structure and the temporal evolution of the flow, affecting its thermal stability, modulating the heat transfer across the system or disrupting the coherent flow structures that characterize the single phase RB flow. Many of these questions have been addressed in former studies and a comprehensive overview of them goes beyond the scope of this brief introduction. It is worth mentioning here the pioneering experimental studies by Solomatov et al. [25] and Lavorel et al. [26] focused on the settling dynamics of solid particles and to their resuspension in vigorously convective fluids, the more recent experiments on vapour droplets dynamics in a supersaturated RB cell (cloud chamber) [27], the studies on the dynamics of large non-isotropic particles in RB [28, 29]. More frequent are the numerical studies that have attempted a characterization of the one-way coupled dynamics of particles in RB [30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. When the so called two-way coupling is considered, i.e. the particle feedback on the fluid flow, the dynamics and the parameter space of the problem becomes much wider. Oresta et al. [35, 36, 37] showed that the presence of vapor bubbles or suspended particles in a cylindrical convective cell significantly influence flow and heat transfer. Studies with a similar Eulerian-Lagrangian point-particle numerical approach where conducted by Park et al. [24] and in [38, 39, 40, 41]. This line of research goes even beyond the RB setting and extend to general convective turbulent flows, see e.g. [42]. Numerical studies adopting particle resolved approach, where both mechanical and thermal couplings between dispersed phase and the fluid are included, are on the other hand quite recent, with limitations in the number of particles [43, 44, 45]. This constraint however will become likely less severe in the forthcoming future as more computational power will be available. In this work, we build upon the recent key findings of the work by Prakhar & Prosperetti [46], which demonstrated theoretically by means of a two-fluid modelization that the introduction of particles, whose density is much larger than the fluid one, has a sensible stabilizing effect on the onset of convection in the Rayleigh-Bénard system. This stabilizing influence becomes increasingly pronounced with rising the particle concentration and the mass density and is primarily attributed to the mechanical interactions between the particles and the fluid. Furthermore, these authors find that the thermal inertia of the particles acts as an additional stabilization factor, and this regardless of the temperatures of the injected particles. One might argue that the physical origin of this mostly mechanical stabilization effect comes from the fact that collectively the falling particles acts as a widespread negative buoyancy force, and that the effect might be reversed for particles that are lighter than the fluid. Indeed it is well known that a rising bubble front can destabilize a quiescent fluid layer [47], and that bubbles are very effective to enhance mixing [48]. On the other hand, the stabilization might be due to the enhanced dissipation produced by the dispersed phase, that would reduce the effective Rayleigh number (as the latter can be seen as a ratio between buoyant and dissipative forces), similarly to what occurs for the RB instability in superdiffusive media[49]. According to the latter argument the particulate phase would lead to the fluid layer stabilization independently of its mass density and settling direction. This open question represents the primary motivation of the present study. Our work extends the model adopted in [46] by considering particles of arbitrary mass density with respect to the fluid in order to encompass the cases of stone-like to bubble-like particles. This amount to take into account the role of the added mass hydrodynamic force. Remarkably, we find that the mechanical stabilization effect persists even for particles which are lighter than the flow, although the effect tends to vanish when the particle mass density becomes negligible with respect to the fluid one (such as for the case of bubbles). In this study we also further explore the influence of the combined thermo-mechanical coupling. The linear stability threshold for the onset of convection depends upon factors such as particle diameter and the specific heat capacity ratio of the particle and fluid phases. A thermal/kinetic energy budget analysis is used to validate the stability results and to reveal the thermal and mechanical coupling contributions to system stabilization. Finally we critically discuss the role of the key assumption taken in this study for the particle injection modelization and how their variation could lead to different dynamics, that deserve to be explored in the future. Figure 1: Sketch of the particulate Rayleigh-Bénard model system, for the case of heavy (a) and light particles (b). The fluid domain has a height H and is infinitely extended in the horizontal direction. From the stability point of view only one lateral dimension is important , hence the system can be though and represented as two-dimensional. The horizontal boundaries are isothermal, with the bottom being warmer of \Delta T>0, and no-slip for the fluid velocity. The particles are injected either from top (for heavier than the fluid particles) or from the bottom walls (for light particles) at their terminal velocity with a prescribed volume flow rate. The overall set of parameters specifying the fluid and particle properties are in indicated in panel (c). They are for the fluid: \nu kinematic viscosity, \kappa thermal diffusivity, \rho mass density, \beta_{T} thermal expansion coefficient,c the specific heat capacity at constant pressure. For the particle: d_{p} the diameter,c_{p} the specific heat capacity. \rho_{p} the mass density."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07704v1,A low-dissipation numerical method based on boundary variation diminishing principle for compressible gas-liquid two-phase flows with phase change on unstructured grid,"A low-dissipation numerical method for compressible gas-liquid two-phase flow with phase change on unstructured grids is proposed. The governing equations adopt the six-equation model. The non-conservative terms included in the volume fraction and total energy equations of the six-equation model are defined on cell boundaries using second-order accurate approximations and calculated without interpolating the spatial derivatives. To capture discontinuities such as contact discontinuities and gas-liquid interfaces with low dissipation, the MUSCL-THINC/QQ-BVD scheme, which combines the Monotone Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) method and the THINC method with quadratic surface representation and Gaussian quadrature (THINC/QQ) method, is employed. The MUSCL method is one of the mainstream numerical solvers for compressible flows, achieving second-order accuracy for smooth solutions, but it introduces excessive numerical dissipation errors near discontinuous solutions. The THINC/QQ method uses a reconstruction function developed for interface capturing on unstructured grids, making use of a sigmoidal function with a quadratic surface. By combining these reconstruction functions according to the Boundary Variation Diminishing (BVD) principle, the MUSCL method is selected for smooth solutions, while the THINC/QQ method is chosen for discontinuous solutions, preserving the solution structure accurately. Several benchmark tests are solved, demonstrating that the MUSCL-THINC/QQ-BVD scheme not only captures contact discontinuities with low dissipation but also resolves dynamically generated gas-liquid interfaces due to phase changes clearly.","I First-level heading: The line break was forced via \\ This sample document demonstrates proper use of REVTeX 4.1 (and LaTeX 2ε) in manuscripts prepared for submission to AIP journals. Further information can be found in the documentation included in the distribution or available at http://authors.aip.org and in the documentation for REVTeX 4.1 itself. When commands are referred to in this example file, they are always shown with their required arguments, using normal TeX format. In this format, #1, #2, etc. stand for required author-supplied arguments to commands. For example, in \section{#1} the #1 stands for the title text of the author’s section heading, and in \title{#1} the #1 stands for the title text of the paper. Line breaks in section headings at all levels can be introduced using \\. A blank input line tells TeX that the paragraph has ended. I.1 Second-level heading: Formatting This file may be formatted in both the preprint (the default) and reprint styles; the latter format may be used to mimic final journal output. Either format may be used for submission purposes; however, for peer review and production, AIP will format the article using the preprint class option. Hence, it is essential that authors check that their manuscripts format acceptably under preprint. Manuscripts submitted to AIP that do not format correctly under the preprint option may be delayed in both the editorial and production processes. The widetext environment will make the text the width of the full page, as on page 9. (Note the use the \pageref{#1} to get the page number right automatically.) The width-changing commands only take effect in twocolumn formatting. It has no effect if preprint formatting is chosen instead. I.1.1 Third-level heading: Citations and Footnotes Citations in text refer to entries in the Bibliography; they use the commands \cite{#1} or \onlinecite{#1}. Because REVTeX uses the natbib package of Patrick Daly, its entire repertoire of commands are available in your document; see the natbib documentation for further details. The argument of \cite is a comma-separated list of keys; a key may consist of letters and numerals. By default, citations are numerical; feyn54 author-year citations are an option. To give a textual citation, use \onlinecite{#1}: (Refs. witten2001; epr; Bire82). REVTeX “collapses” lists of consecutive numerical citations when appropriate. REVTeX provides the ability to properly punctuate textual citations in author-year style; this facility works correctly with numerical citations only with natbib’s compress option turned off.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07669v1,DIFFERENTIALLY HEATED TURBULENT CHANNEL FLOW TWO-POINT CORRELATIONS,This study analyzes the behavior of a differentially heated channel flow by means of a direct numerical simulations (DNS) with variable thermophysical properties under low-speed conditions focusing on the impact of the temperature gradient on the turbulence structures near the channel walls. The simulations were conducted at a mean friction Reynolds number of Re_{\tau m}=400 with a temperature ratio between the walls of T_{hot}/T_{cold}=2. Results show significant differences between the hot and cold walls that lead to an increased heat transfer at the hot wall and a higher turbulent production in the cold wall.,"1 INTRODUCTION Channel flow numerical simulations have been used to study the behavior of wall-bounded flows both in engineering applications and research. The complexity of these flows increases when the channel is heated, especially if its thermophysical properties (density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity) are assumed to be variable and a temperature gradient is added between the walls. Early studies added the temperature as a passive scalar to an incompressible flow [1, 2, 3] to analyze the effects of the flow at different friction Reynolds numbers, different Prandtl numbers, and different heat flux conditions at the wall. The friction Reynolds number is defined as Re_{\tau}=\rho_{w}\delta u_{\tau}/\mu_{w}, where u_{\tau}=\sqrt{\tau_{w}/\rho_{w}} is the friction velocity, \delta is the channel half-height, \tau_{w} is the wall shear stress, \rho_{w} and \mu_{w} are the density and the dynamic viscosity at the wall, respectively. The Prandtl number, defined as Pr=\mu c_{p}/\lambda where c_{p} is the specific heat and \lambda is the thermal conductivity, is set as a constant. Few studies have been carried out on channels with an imposed temperature at the walls and with variable thermophysical properties and most of them focused on high-speed flows. Huang et al. [4] analyze the different models and scalings at high-speed flows. Furthermore, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of compressible channel flows were conducted by Modesti and Pirozzoli [5] to study the flow structures at different friction Reynolds numbers and bulk Mach numbers (between 1.5 and 3), focusing on compressibility effects and turbulence structure variations. In low-speed flows, the research is mainly about differentially heated walls. Some large-eddy simulations (LES) have been performed reaching a temperature ratio between the walls up to T_{cold}/T_{hot}=9 but for low mean friction Reynolds number Re_{\tau m}=0.5(Re_{\tau cold}+Re_{\tau hot})=180 [6]. Other studies have conducted LES at higher friction Reynolds number, Re_{\tau}=395, but at low-temperature ratios and using the low-Mach approximation, therefore neglecting the possible compressible effects due to thermo-dependant properties [7]. Additionally, Patel et al. [8] investigated the impact of a low-temperature gradient between the walls using different constitutive relations for the thermophysical properties at low Reynolds, focusing on the effect on the velocity streaks and the turbulent structures. This type of study has increased in recent years due to the interest in transcritical and supercritical fluids. For example, Doehring and Adams [9] conducted LES of transcritical channel flow with real gases, with a temperature ratio of 2.2 and a friction Reynolds number of 400. Toutant and Bataille [10] performed DNS of a low-Mach channel flow with variable thermophysical properties at mean friction Reynolds number Re_{\tau m}=400 and temperature ratio T_{hot}/T_{cold}=2 between the walls. They studied the flow with different scalings for the velocity and temperature profiles. However, the effect of the asymmetrical heat on the turbulent structures was not discussed. The present work aims to go beyond and study the behavior of these differentially heated channel flows focusing on the turbulent structures of the walls through the two-point velocity correlations. A direct numerical simulation with variable thermophysical properties and at low speed has been conducted at mean friction Reynolds number of Re_{\tau m}=400 and at temperature ratio difference between the walls, T_{hot}/T_{cold}, of 2."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07562v2,Thermodynamic consistency and structure-preservation in summation by parts methods for the moist compressible Euler equations,"Moist thermodynamics is a fundamental driver of atmospheric dynamics across all scales, making accurate modeling of these processes essential for reliable weather forecasts and climate change projections. However, atmospheric models often make a variety of inconsistent approximations in representing moist thermodynamics. These inconsistencies can introduce spurious sources and sinks of energy, potentially compromising the integrity of the models.Here, we present a thermodynamically consistent and structure preserving formulation of the moist compressible Euler equations. When discretised with a summation by parts method, our spatial discretisation conserves: mass, water, entropy, and energy. These properties are achieved by discretising a skew symmetric form of the moist compressible Euler equations, using entropy as a prognostic variable, and the summation-by-parts property of discrete derivative operators. Additionally, we derive a discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method with energy and tracer variance stable numerical fluxes, and experimentally verify our theoretical results through numerical simulations.","Atmospheric models typically utilise multiple different, and often inconsistent, thermodynamic approximations throughout a single code. These thermodynamic inconsistencies introduce resolution independent spurious sources and sinks of energy and hence violate the first law of thermodynamics. For climate models these energy errors can be significant, and are believed to adversely affect the integrity of long-time climate simulations Lauritzen et al. (2018); Eldred et al. (2022). To improve the energy budgets of global climate models, recent studies have explored the application of thermodynamic potentials to ensure thermodynamic consistency Thuburn (2017); Staniforth and White (2019); Eldred et al. (2022). This approach focuses on approximating a single thermodynamic quantity—known as the thermodynamic potential—and deriving all other relevant quantities from it. The most commonly employed potentials in this context are internal energy and the Gibbs function. For a comprehensive overview of thermodynamic potentials we refer the reader to Staniforth and White (2019) and Eldred et al. (2022). The thermodynamic potential approach was first proposed in Thuburn (2017), which introduces a thermodynamically consistent semi-Lagrangian model for a two-phase liquid-vapor system utilizing the Gibbs potential as a function of its natural variables: pressure and temperature. However, extending this method to include a third ice phase poses challenges, as the Gibbs potential does not uniquely define an equilibrium state at the triple point. To address this issue, Bowen and Thuburn (2022a, b) explore an alternative approach that employs internal energy as the potential in a semi-Lagrangian discretization of the three-phase moist compressible Euler equations, effectively sidestepping the triple point ambiguity associated with the Gibbs potential. Similarly, Guba et al. (2024) presents a thermodynamically consistent method that also uses internal energy as the potential, implemented within a horizontally semi-Lagrangian and vertically spectral element discretization. While these methods ensure thermodynamic consistency and therefore discretize an energy-conserving set of equations, it is important to note that the discretizations themselves may not guarantee energy conservation or stability. To the best of their knowledge, the authors are not aware of any mimetic or structure-preserving spatial discretizations for the moist compressible Euler equations, however it is noteworthy that significant progress has been made in developing such methods for the dry compressible Euler equations, as well as for related shallow water and thermal shallow water equations McRae and Cotter (2014); Lee et al. (2018); Lee and Palha (2020); Taylor and Fournier (2010); Eldred et al. (2019); Natale et al. (2016); Cotter (2023). These advancements encompass a variety of approaches, including mixed finite element, continuous Galerkin, and discontinuous Galerkin methods. Although the specifics differ among these techniques and equations, they all maintain structure preservation by discretising the equations in a vector-invariant skew-symmetric form and utilizing summation-by-parts (SBP) operators. Structure preservation may reduce model biases and more accurately represent physical processes, but it does not guarantee numerical stability for compressible flows with active tracers, such as the dry and moist compressible Euler equations and the thermal shallow water equations. We hypothesize that this limitation arises because energy is not a mathematical entropy for these equations. In this context, mathematical entropy refers to any conserved quantity that is a convex function of the prognostic variables; for instance, energy in the shallow water equations and physical entropy in the conservative dry Euler equations. Numerous studies Waruszewski et al. (2022); Ranocha (2020); Ducros et al. (2000); Morinishi (2010); Sjögreen and Yee (2019); Gassner et al. (2016); Hennemann et al. (2021); Pirozzoli (2010) have demonstrated that discrete mathematical entropy stability is both necessary and often sufficient for ensuring numerical stability. These methods often utilize the conservative form of the equations and aim to conserve the physical entropy by employing techniques such as splitting derivative operators, SBP, and entropy stable numerical fluxes. In Ricardo et al. (2024a, b), the authors introduce numerical methods for the thermal shallow water and dry compressible Euler equations that are both mimetic and mathematical entropy stable. These studies identify tracer variance as a form of mathematical entropy and propose a split-form, skew-symmetric formulation of the equations. The resulting formulations are discretized using SBP operators, ensuring both entropy and energy stability. In this work, we extend this structure-preserving and mathematical entropy-stable approach to the moist compressible Euler equations. The result is a thermodynamically consistent skew-symmetric formulation that, when discretized using a carefully designed SBP scheme, maintains both structure preservation and mathematical entropy stability. We then develop a novel energy and mathematical entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DG-SEM) for these equations. The rest of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we derive an operator-split skew-symmetric formulation of the moist compressible Euler equations. We demonstrate that energy and mathematical entropy conservation can be proved using only integration by parts, and therefore any SBP discretisation of these equations will inherit discrete analogues of these conservation properties. In section 3 we outline the thermodynamic approximation we use in our numerical method. The discrete conservation and stability results are independent of the particular thermodyanmic approximation used but we include this for completeness. In section 4 we introduce DG-SEM and detail our novel DG-SEM discretisation. Following this, in section 5 we prove that our discrete method: conserves mass, water, and entropy; and is semi-discretely energy and (mathematical) entropy stable. These theoretical results are then verified via numerical experiments in section 6. Finally, our conclusions from this study are presented in section 7."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06563v1,New Higher-Order Super-Compact Finite Difference Scheme to Study Three-Dimensional Natural Convection and Entropy Generation in Non-Newtonian Fluids,"This work introduces a new higher-order super-compact (HOSC) implicit finite difference scheme for analyzing three-dimensional (3D) natural convection and entropy generation in non-Newtonian fluids. The proposed scheme achieves fourth-order accuracy in space and second-order accuracy in time while utilizing only seven directly adjacent grid points of the compact stencils at the (n+1) time level, making it highly efficient and super compact. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first higher-order accurate finite difference scheme proposed to study 3D natural convection and entropy generation in non-Newtonian fluids. A time-marching technique is applied, where pressure corrections are addressed using a modified artificial compressibility method. The scheme is applied to the power-law model of non-Newtonian fluids, investigating both shear-thinning and shear-thickening effects on natural convection and entropy generation within a 3D cubic cavity. In the numerical simulations, the Prandtl number remains constant at Pr=1.0, while various Rayleigh numbers (Ra=10^{2}, 10^{3}, 10^{4}, 10^{5}) and power-law indices (n=0.75, 1.0, 1.25) are considered. Results are presented in terms of isotherms, streamlines, Nusselt numbers, Bejan numbers, and local entropy generation rates. The validation of the proposed scheme demonstrates excellent agreement with existing benchmark results. The numerical study reveals that the n and Ra have significant impacts on flow dynamics, heat transfer, and entropy generation. As Ra increases, the maximum value of average Nusselt number (Nu_{\text{avg}}) also increases, whereas an opposite trend is observed with n values. Shear-thinning fluids demonstrate the highest convection efficiency compared to Newtonian and shear-thickening fluids at any specific Ra.","Non-Newtonian fluids, characterized by their variable viscosity that changes with the shear rate, have drawn significant attention in both fundamental research and practical applications. Unlike Newtonian fluids, which maintain a constant viscosity under different shear conditions, non-Newtonian fluids exhibit more complex flow behavior. Fluids inside a cavity are often assumed to be Newtonian, meaning they have constant viscosity. However, in many natural and industrial systems, fluids actually behave as non-Newtonian, making the Newtonian assumption less accurate for real-world cases. Fluids such as molten polymers, food products, paints, organic materials, inks, and adhesives frequently exhibit strong non-Newtonian properties, making them important in various engineering applications. Natural convection, a major mechanism of heat transfer, is widely used in engineering systems. Studying natural convection in non-Newtonian fluids within cavities is essential due to its broad range of applications. Examples include polymer manufacturing, nuclear reactors, food processing, oil drilling, geophysical systems, and electronic cooling systems, where non-Newtonian natural convection plays a key role [1]. Despite its wide range of applications, limited studies have explored their natural convection behavior in 2D and 3D enclosures, mainly because of the complexities associated with shear rate-dependent viscosity fluctuations. To the best of the author’s knowledge, Ozoe and Churchill [2] conducted the first study on natural convection of non-Newtonian fluids within an enclosure. They investigated 2D natural convection in two types of non-Newtonian fluids, specifically Ostwald-de Waele (power law model) and Ellis fluids, within a shallow horizontal cavity heated from below and cooled from above. The results are found to be independent of the initial conditions, and it is also observed that the critical Rayleigh number increases with the flow behavior index. Kim et al. [3] used the finite volume approach to investigate transient buoyant convection in a 2D square enclosure filled with an incompressible non-Newtonian power-law fluid. They considered the horizontal wall to be insulated, the left vertical wall to be cold, and the right vertical wall to be maintained at a constant temperature. They found that a drop in the power-law index (n) results in more convective activity and improved total heat transfer for high Ra and moderate Prandtl numbers (Pr). Lamsaadi et al. [4] used both analytical and numerical simulations to study transient natural convection of non-Newtonian power-law fluids in a shallow 2D cavity. To solve the governing equations, they used a uniform mesh size, second-order central finite difference approach. Their cavity featured long, insulated horizontal walls and short vertical walls, where the vertical walls are subjected to constant heat flux for heating and cooling. Their results show that the non-Newtonian power-law behavior significantly affects the properties of heat transmission and fluid flow. In comparison to Newtonian fluids (where n=1), shear-thinning behavior (with 0<n<1) enhances fluid circulation and convective heat transfer, whereas shear-thickening behavior (with n>1) results in the opposite effect. Lamsaadi et al. [5] also conducted a numerical study on steady natural convection in non-Newtonian power-law fluids within a tilted two-dimensional rectangular slit. The two-dimensional governing equations are solved using the simple central-difference finite difference method. This investigation is carried out in the following ranges: -180^{\circ}\leq\Phi\leq 180^{\circ}, 0.6\leq n\leq 1.4 for the power-law index, and 10\leq\text{Ra}\leq 10^{5} for the Rayleigh number. They found that the characteristics of fluid flow and heat transfer rate are found to be independent of any increase in the aspect ratio (A) and the generalized Prandtl number (Pr) when these parameters are sufficiently large (A\geq 12 and \text{Pr}\geq 100). Additionally, the cavity’s rotation has a major impact on the rate of heat transmission for a given Ra. The influence of cavity rotation grew as the value of n dropped, and the maximum rate of heat transfer is achieved when the cavity is heated from the bottom. 2D steady-state simulations of laminar natural convection in square enclosures with differentially heated sides under constant wall temperatures is carried out by Tarun et al. [6]. They employed the power-law fluid model and the ANSYS FLUENT commercial package to simulate the behavior of the fluids. They found that for both Newtonian and power-law fluids, the mean Nusselt number Nu increases as Ra values increase. Notably, the Nu values for power-law fluids with n<1 (indicating shear-thinning behavior) exceed those of Newtonian fluids at the same nominal Rayleigh number Ra, while the Nu values for power-law fluids with n>1 (indicating shear-thickening behavior) are lower. This difference is attributed to the enhanced (for n<1) or diminished (for n>1) convective transport. Ternik and Rudolf [7] explored the natural convection of a non-Newtonian nanofluid in a 2D square cavity with isothermal sidewalls and adiabatic horizontal walls. They solved the governing differential equations using the standard finite volume method, with the hydrodynamic and thermal fields coupled through the Boussinesq approximation. They found that for a given set of solid volume fraction values \phi, an increase in the nanofluid Rayleigh number (Ra_{nf}) leads to a strengthening of buoyancy forces relative to viscous forces. Later, Ternik and Buchmeister [8] carried out a numerical investigation on laminar natural convection in a 2D square enclosure that was filled with a non-Newtonian fluid. The governing equations are solved using the conventional finite volume approach, and the viscous behavior of the non-Newtonian fluids is described by power-law model. Vinogradov et al. [9] conducted a numerical study on 2D steady natural convection of non-Newtonian shear thickening power-law liquids in an inclined 2D cavity. The finite volume approach is used to solve the governing equations. They discovered that in the horizontal position, the heat transfer rate for square-shaped cavities (\text{AR}=1) is much lower than in the vertical 90° position, where the vertical walls are conducting. Additionally, they noted that the thermal behavior of rectangular cavities (\text{AR}>1) becomes more complex due to the formation of Bénard cells. Loenko et al. [10] studied the natural convection of a non-Newtonian power-law fluid in a 2D square cavity containing a heat-generating element. They employed the dimensionless stream function-vorticity formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations, which are solved using the finite difference method. Their findings revealed that as the power-law index n increases, the flow and heat transfer in the cavity slows down. Consequently, for pseudoplastic fluids, heat is removed more efficiently from the energy source. Additionally, it is noted that for larger values of n, the system reaches a steady state more quickly. Laminar unsteady natural convection in a 2D square cavity with an interior circular cylinder filled with a non-Newtonian fluid is investigated by Pandey et al. [11]. For various Rayleigh number (Ra) values, they examined how the inside circular cylinder’s vertical movement affected the flow and heat transfer processes. Kim and Reddy [12] formulated a mixed least-squares finite element model using spectral/hp approximations to examine 3D natural convection in a non-Newtonian fluid governed by the Carreau–Yasuda model. The study explored how varying the Carreau–Yasuda model parameters affected flow behavior. Their results demonstrated that as the power-law index n decreases, the heat transfer rate at the surfaces significantly increases. Loenko et al. [13] investigated the unsteady natural convection of a non-Newtonian fluid within a 2D enclosure subjected to sinusoidal wall temperature variations over time. The time derivatives are approximated using a first-order finite difference method, while the spatial partial derivatives are discretized using second-order finite differences. The thermal properties of a power-law fluid in a lid-driven 2D enclosure with discrete heating are examined by Roy et al. [14]. They utilized the finite element method to solve the governing Navier-Stokes and energy equations. Their research indicates that the highest heat transfer performance occurs in the natural convection scenario of the pseudo-plastic fluid, while the lowest heat transfer is observed when the fluid is dilatant. Hasan et al. [15] investigated the natural convection of power-law fluids in a differentially heated 3D cubic cavity using a mesoscopic multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) accelerated by a graphics processing unit (GPU). Different Ra and power-law indices (n) are incorporated to investigate heat transfer and entropy generation. Their results indicate that the temperature distribution is more prominent near the heated wall, especially for power-law indices n=0.7 and n=1.0, while having a less pronounced effect at n=1.4. Ahmed et al. [16] investigated natural convection and entropy generation in a non-Newtonian flow inside an irregularly shaped 2D cavity filled with molten polymer, using a method based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). They found that as the Rayleigh number (Ra) increased, heat transfer enhanced. In contrast to dilatant fluids, heat transfer in pseudo-plastic fluids increased as the power-law index (n) decreased from n=1 to n=0.5. Additionally, the Bejan number (Be) showed substantial growth across all wall ratios (WRs) with increasing n index. Fard et al. [17] studied free convection heat transfer for non-Newtonian power-law fluids using the meshless local Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG) method. Their enhanced approach applies a unity weighting function and expresses the governing equations in the form of the vorticity-stream function. They displayed the temperature distributions, average Nusselt number, and vertical velocity for various Pr and Ra, and compared the findings with those from mesh-based techniques. Based on the comparisons, the graphs are found to be in good agreement with the results of traditional mesh-based approaches. Keddar et al. [18] focused on a numerical investigation of natural convection of a non-Newtonian viscoplastic fluid within a 3D cubic enclosure. The viscoplastic behavior are characterized using the Bingham model, and the 3D steady governing equations are solved using commercial CFD software FLUENT. Their results indicate that as the Bingham number increases, the flow velocity decreases, ultimately causing the flow to stop completely. Over the years, significant attention has been given to the study of natural convection in non-Newtonian fluids using various numerical techniques, including finite element and finite volume methods. However, there remains a scarcity of higher-order finite difference schemes applied to such problems, particularly in three dimensions. Traditional lower-order schemes often lack the accuracy required to resolve complex flow patterns and thermal gradients in non-Newtonian fluids. This limitation leaves a notable research gap that needs to be further investigated. Also, A review of the literature reveals that most of the studies are confined to 2D analysis, mainly due to the high complexity involved in extending such investigations to three dimensions. However, real fluid flow phenomena are inherently three-dimensional in nature, and simplifying the problem to 2D often overlooks critical aspects of the flow behavior. To address these challenges, we propose a new 3D higher-order super-compact (HOSC) implicit finite difference scheme, designed to achieve high spatial and temporal accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Higher-order compact (HOC) finite difference schemes are already well-established as one of the leading methods for capturing complex 2D fluid flow dynamics [19, 20, 21]. For the three-dimensional case, Kalita [22] first introduced the higher-order super-compact scheme to study the Newtonian fluids and found its second-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space. Recently, Punia and Ray [23] expanded this approach to examine the natural convection of Newtonian fluids within a 3D cubic cavity. They found that this scheme effectively captures 3D heat transfer and fluid dynamics with high accuracy. They also extended this scheme to study power-law fluids in the lid-driven 3D cubic cavity without incorporating the energy/heat equation [24]. Their results show excellent agreement with existing literature, confirming the remarkable accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the scheme in capturing the complex non-Newtonian fluid behavior. To date, no advanced finite difference technique has been explicitly designed for analyzing the 3D heat transport and natural convection in non-Newtonian power-law fluids. Thus, the novelty of this work lies in the development of new Higher-Order Super-Compact (HOSC) scheme specifically designed to investigate the 3D natural convection and heat transfer of non-Newtonian fluids. This newly developed HOSC scheme is fourth-order accurate in space and second-order accurate in time, utilizing only seven directly adjacent grid points of the compact stencils at the (n+1) time level, making it not only highly accurate but also optimizes computational efficiency. The power-law model of non-Newtonian fluids is employed in this study, which allows for the examination of both shear-thinning and shear-thickening effects. The impact of the power-law index and the Rayleigh number on flow patterns, heat transfer, and entropy generation inside the cubic cavity is thoroughly investigated. Due to the ineffectiveness of conventional iterative solvers such as Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) and Gauss-Seidel methods for this highly non-linear system of equations, especially when the coefficient matrix is not diagonally dominant, we utilize an advanced iterative solver—the hybrid Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilised (BiCGSTAB) method. Pressure is calculated with a pressure-correction approach based on the modified artificial compressibility technique. This approach provides efficiency, simplicity, and ease of implementation. Entropy generation is a critical parameter in thermodynamic optimization and irreversibility analysis, as it provides insight into the efficiency of energy transfer processes within the fluid. By incorporating entropy generation analysis, this study not only advances the understanding of fluid flow and heat transfer in non-Newtonian fluids but also contributes to the field of thermodynamic analysis. The significance of this research is its capacity to accurately capture the natural convection of non-Newtonian shear-thickening and shear-thinning fluids, which are commonly seen in various industrial applications, including polymer processing, food manufacturing, and biomedical engineering."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06415v1,"Effects of confinement, impinging shock deflection angle, and Mach number on the flow field of a supersonic open cavity","Cavities exhibit inherent self-sustaining oscillations driven by the coupling between their hydrodynamic and acoustic properties. In practical applications, cavities are often placed within confinements that introduce compression waves, significantly influencing their primary flow characteristics. The oscillations in cavities have widespread applications, such as in fuel-air mixing, heat exchangers, and landing gears However, when resonance occurs, these oscillations can lead to structural failures. Therefore, understanding cavity oscillations under diverse geometrical configurations and flow conditions is essential. The present study examines the impact of top wall confinement on an open cavity with a length-to-depth ratio (L/D) ratio of 3 at Mach 1.71, along with the effects of varying deflection angles on flow characteristics and the influence of an increased Mach number on configurations with the highest and lowest oscillation frequencies. A three-dimensional numerical investigation is carried out, employing large eddy simulations within the OpenFOAM framework. We analyze the flow fields through the spatial variation of density over time. Fast Fourier Transformation and Wavelet Transformation reveal the frequency content from unsteady pressure signals and illustrate its evolution over time under different conditions. Additionally, reduced-order modeling provides a better understanding of the relationship between frequencies and flow structures of the cavity. Results from these analyses demonstrate that top wall confinement increases oscillation frequency, while greater deflection angles introduce Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the flow field, reducing the frequency. An increase in the Mach number to 2, further intensifies instability, substantially affecting oscillations.","Cavities have been the subject of extensive research for decades, driven by their broad applications and the complex physics they encompass. In the aerospace industry, cavities are utilized for various purposes, including weapon bays, fuel tanks, and resonator-type nozzles sahoo2005film; emmert2009numerical; johnson2010instability; chakravarthy2018analytical; devaraj2020experimental; saravanan2020isolator; sekar2020unsteady; krishnamurty1955acoustic. Their intrinsic oscillations are crucial for mixing air with fuel in propulsion systems like scramjet combustors and are vital for thermal management in spacecraft and aircraft charwat1961investigation; emery1969recompression. Cavities also play a significant role in enhancing heat transfer by increasing surface area in heat exchangers, improving cooling in electronics and cryogenic systems, and efficiently capturing solar radiation in solar energy applications swift2017thermoacoustics; choi1995enhancing; zalba2003review. Additionally, they act as thermal barriers in building insulation and enable efficient coolant flow in nuclear reactors. The flow characteristics of cavities largely determine their applications, with the length-to-depth ratio (L/D) playing a critical role in defining the flow type. Stallings stallings1987experimental classified supersonic cavities with an L/D ratio of less than 10 as deep cavities, while those with an L/D ratio greater than 13 are categorized as shallow cavities. Deep cavities exhibit an open flow type, in which the shear layer flows over the cavity due to the high pressure ahead of the rear face venting into the low-pressure area downstream of the front face. Shallow cavities display a closed flow type in which the shear layer expands over the leading edge, impinges on the cavity floor, and exits ahead of the trailing edge, similar to the flows over forward and backward-facing steps.The cavity transits from open to closed flow when the L/D ratio ranges between 10 and 13. In this transitional flow type, the shear layer strikes the cavity floor downstream of the front edge, turns, and exits through the trailing edge, with the exit shock and impinging waves coalescing into a single wave. These flow classifications, particularly in supersonic and transonic regimes, depend on the Mach number and the cavity’s depth-to-height ratio plentovich1993experimental; tracy1992measurements. The features of open and closed cavities change significantly from one another due to variations in their flow. There are no acoustic tones in closed cavities, according to Lawson and Barakos lawson2011review.On the other hand, open cavities have a unique acoustic signature that is defined by the following characteristics: • Low-energy broadband noise produced by turbulent fluctuations, shear layer, and freestream. • Discrete tones, often referred to as Rossiter modes rossiter1964wind, are generated by interactions such as shear-wall, shock shear layer, vortex-vortex, vortex-wall, or vortex-shear layer. Researchers like Heller heller1971flow; heller1975physical; heller1996cavity and Krishnamurthy krishnamurty1955acoustic briefly studied open supersonic cavities. Their studies indicate that in these cavities, the incoming shear layer separates from the leading edge and spans across the cavity. Periodic waves of expansion and compression at the trailing edge scavenge mass into and out of the cavity. A pressure wave is created close to the region in the cavity floor, where the mass flows as it enters the cavity through the aft wall. This pressure wave travels upstream, intensifies along the way, and perturbs the separating shear layer at the leading edge. This results in disturbances in the shear layer, which are convected downstream to impinge the trailing edge. A feedback loop is, thus, produced by this hydrodynamics and acoustics coupling. Figure 1: Schematic Diagram of the cavity in the X-Y plane at the mid-section of the Z-axis a) without b) with top wall confinement along with the boundary conditions for the simulations. The origin is at the leading edge of the cavity. . Figure 2: Probe locations in the computational domain and walls of the cavity. These probes are placed in the mid-section of the z-axis. Supersonic flow over an open supersonic cavity is highly unsteady due to the inherent self-sustaining cavity oscillations rockwell1978self; woolley1974role. Shear-layer instability, disturbance feedback, resonant wave conditions, and structural elasticity influence these oscillations either individually or in combination. These oscillations are categorized as fluid dynamic, fluid resonant, or fluid elastic oscillations, based on their origin. Fluid dynamic oscillations magnify unstable disturbances in the cavity shear layer, especially when the cavity length-to-acoustic wavelength ratio is minimal. Jet-edge oscillations caused by a free jet impingement on an edge resemble these oscillations. On the other hand, fluid-resonant cavity oscillations occur at frequencies where the acoustic wave wavelength is comparable to or lower than the cavity’s characteristic length (L or W), and they strongly couple with resonant wave effects within the cavity. These oscillations may show transverse waves in deep cavities or longitudinal standing waves in shallow cavities, depending on the cavity’s length-to-width ratio (L/W). Fluid-elastic oscillations occur when the cavity walls displace sufficiently to exert feedback control over shear-layer perturbations. These self-sustaining oscillations in cavities can damage the structures in which they are stationed rockwell1978self; rowley2006dynamics. Developing oscillation control techniques for their efficient usage in a variety of applications requires an understanding of cavity flow characteristics. Extensive research has focused on the primary flow characteristics of cavities and introduced both active and passive control mechanisms to reduce oscillationsalam2007new; malhotra2016aft; lad2018experimental; jain2021aero; jain2023effects; panigrahi2019effects; lee2008passive. These studies are mostly conducted in cavities without any top wall confinements. Confined cavities like those used in scramjet combustors sitaraman2021adaptive, display numerous incidents and reflected shock waves, which are the result of multiple reflections between the confinement walls and the shear layer. The incident shock wave impinges the separating shear layer as it convects the disturbances downstream, significantly changing the flow field both within and above the cavity. Therefore, we must consider shock impingement on the shear layer to conduct a detailed study of cavity oscillations from the perspective of practical applications. Karthick karthick2021shock examined the effects of impingement of shock of varying strength on the shear layer by simulating unsteady flow past a confined supersonic cavity with an L/D ratio of 2. He conducted his study at a fixed Mach number of 1.71, utilizing Detached Eddy Simulations (DES) on a 2D geometry. The results highlighted the variation in wall pressure and oscillation frequency in the cavity due to changes in shock strengths interacting with the shear layer. Flow control techniques were developed, achieving a 58% reduction in jet-column instability by using a confined supersonic wall-jet, where periodic large-scale structures significantly enhanced flow stability. The authors of the present article bhaduri2024flow investigated passive control mechanisms for cavity oscillations in a 2D cavity with an L/D ratio of 3 at a Mach number of 1.71. The cavity was confined by a top wall with a deflection angle of 3.6^{0}. Using Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations, they observed a notable suppression of cavity oscillations by placing sub-cavities at the front and aft walls. Oscillations are a defining feature of open cavities, crucial for their application across various fields. An accurate understanding of these dynamics necessitates three-dimensional simulations, which capture turbulence more effectively through mechanisms like vorticity stretching and complex interactions. The Mach number also significantly influences cavity flow characteristics, making it a critical parameter for comprehensive analysis. The aforementioned studies did not consider variations in Mach numbers or the three-dimensional effects in cavity flow fields. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of spanwise fluctuations on cavity flow by performing numerical simulations on an open cavity with an L/D ratio of 3, with specific focus on the following objectives: • First, understanding the differences in the flow features and the frequency content of the cavity in the presence and absence of top wall confinement at a Mach number of 1.71. • Examining the effects of varying the shock’s strength, impinging the separating shear layer, on the flow and oscillations of the cavity at Mach number 1.71. • Finally, assess how increasing the Mach number to 2 affects the flow characteristics of cavity configurations with the highest and lowest frequency content, as determined from the above investigations. We conduct these unsteady simulations on the compressible flow using Large Eddy Simulations within the OpenFOAM framework. Spectral analysis and numerical flow-field visualization provide in-depth insights into the configurations, while reduced-order modeling helps elucidate the dominant events in the flow fields. The remainder of the article is organized as follows: Section II covers the geometrical configuration, numerical methods, boundary conditions, grid independence study, and validation against experiments. Section III presents the results and their physical explanation, detailing the variation in the flow field and frequency content with and without confinement, as well as impinging shock at Mach 1.71. This section further examines the effect of Mach number on the cavity dynamics with and without shock impingement. Section IV summarizes the key outcomes of this numerical investigation."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06388v1,A conservative degree adaptive HDG method for transient incompressible flows,"Purpose: This study aims to assess the accuracy of degree adaptive strategies in the context of incompressible Navier-Stokes flows using the high order hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method.Design/methodology/approach: The work presents a series of numerical examples to show the inability of standard degree adaptive processes to accurate capture aerodynamic quantities of interest, in particular the drag. A new conservative projection is proposed and the results between a standard degree adaptive procedure and the adaptive process enhanced with this correction are compared. The examples involve two transient problems where flow vortices or a gust needs to be accurately propagated over long distances.Findings: The lack of robustness and accuracy of a standard degree adaptive processes is linked to the violation of the free-divergence condition when projecting a solution from a space of polynomials of a given degree to a space of polynomials with a lower degree. Due to the coupling of velocity-pressure in incompressible flows, the violation of the incompressibility constraint leads to inaccurate pressure fields in the wake that have a sizeable effect on the drag. The new conservative projection proposed is found to remove all the numerical artefacts shown by the standard adaptive process.Originality/value: This work proposes a new conservative projection for the degree adaptive process. The projection does not introduce a significant overhead because it requires to solve an element-by-element problem and only for those elements where the adaptive process lowers the degree of approximation. Numerical results show that with the proposed projection non-physical oscillations in the drag disappear and the results are in good agreement with reference solutions.Keywords: degree adaptivity; hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin; incompressible flows; Navier-Stokes; high-order","The accurate simulation of transient incompressible fluid flows is a central challenge in many computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications, including areas such as civil, aerospace, chemical and biomedical engineering. From a numerical point of view, several difficulties arise when solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations due to their non-linear nature and the intricate coupling between velocity and pressure fields [1]. When unsteady phenomena are of interest an extra difficulty is to accurate propagate vortices over long distances. High-order methods are attractive for the simulation of transient flows due to the lower dissipation and dispersion errors, when compared to low order methods [2, 3, 4]. Continuous and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods have their own advantages and disadvantages and have both been successfully applied to a variety of problems in CFD [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Two properties that make DG a preferred option in some cases is the ability to easily handle a variable degree of approximation and the easier definition of the required stabilisation for convection dominated flows [14, 15, 16]. The main disadvantage of DG methods is commonly attributed to the duplication of degrees of freedom [17, 18], which in turns is the property that facilitates the implementation of variable degree of approximation. The hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, originally proposed by Cockburn and co-workers [19, 20] employs hybridisation to reduce the number of coupled degrees of freedom and has become popular for CFD applications. With HDG, it is possible to use approximations of equal order for both velocity and pressure, circumventing the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuška-Brezzi (LBB) condition. From a computational perspective, the size of the global problem only involves the mean value of the pressure in each element even for high-order approximations, reducing even further the size of the global system of equations to be solved. Furthermore, an important advantage of HDG is the ability to build a super-convergent velocity field [21]. The development and application of HDG methods to incompressible flows include the solution of Stokes flows [22, 23, 24, 21, 25] and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations [26, 27, 28, 29]. To accurately and efficiently capture transient flow phenomena, mesh adaptation techniques are traditionally employed in a low order context. For high-order methods the use of degree adaptivity offers a new alternative to provide the required accuracy only in the regions of the domain where is needed, minimising the computational overhead of high-order approximations and circumventing the need to modify the mesh topology. In the context of HDG, the use of mesh and degree adaptivity has been considered for a variety of problems, including incompressible flows [27, 30]. In HDG methods, the ability to build a super-convergent solution can be used to devise a cheap error indicator to drive the adaptivity. This strategy was first exploited in [31] for wave propagation problems. This work considers the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a degree adaptive HDG method. First, it is shown that a degree adaptive process can lead to unphysical oscillations in aerodynamic quantities of interest, especially the drag, if the adaptive process reduces the degree of approximation during the time marching process. This phenomenon is linked to the violation of the free-divergence condition during the projection of the solution from a space of polynomials of degree r to a space of polynomials of degree s, with s<r. Second, this work proposes a conservative projection to guarantee mass conservation during the projection stage. The proposed projection does not introduce a significant overhead because it induces the solution of an element-by-element problem and only for those elements where the adaptive process lowers the degree of approximation. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the benefits of the proposed conservative projection using two dimensional examples. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 briefly summarises the numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes using the HDG method. In Section 3 the degree adaptive strategy proposed in this work is outlined, including the proposed conservative projection to guarantee mass conservation. Section 4 present numerical examples to illustrate the effect of using a standard adaptive process that violates the free-divergence condition during the projection stage and the benefits of the proposed conservative projection. Finally, the conclusions of the work are presented in Section 5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06279v1,Influence of three-dimensionality on wake synchronization of oscillatory cylinder,"We investigate the effect of three-dimensionality on the synchronization characteristics of the wake behind an oscillating circular cylinder at \mbox{{Re}}=300. Cylinder oscillations in rotation, transverse translation, and streamwise translation are considered. We utilize phase-reduction analysis, which quantifies the phase-sensitivity function of periodic flows, to examine the synchronization properties. Here, we present an ensemble-based framework for phase-reduction analysis to handle three-dimensional wakes that are not perfectly time-periodic. Based on the phase-sensitivity functions, synchronizability to three types of cylinder oscillations is evaluated. In spite of similar trends, we find that phase-sensitivity functions involving three-dimensional wakes are lower in magnitude compared to those of two-dimensional wakes, which leads to narrower conditions for synchronization to weak cylinder oscillations. We unveil that the difference between the phase-sensitivity functions of two- and three-dimensional flows is strongly correlated to the amplitude variation of the three-dimensional flow by the cylinder motions. This finding reveals that the cylinder motion modifies the three-dimensionality of the wake as well as the phase of vortex shedding, which leads to reduced phase modulation. The synchronization conditions of three-dimensional wakes, predicted by phase-reduction analysis, agree with the identification by parametric studies using direct numerical simulations for forced oscillations with small amplitudes. This study presents the potential capability of phase-reduction to study synchronization characteristics of complex flows.","Synchronization of the wake behind a bluff body to its structural vibration is of interest for various engineering applications. Such synchronization can cause detrimental effects, such as structural fatigue and resonance induced by vortex-induced vibrations (Sarpkaya, 2004; Williamson and Govardhan, 2004). Alternatively, promoting synchronization can enhance the performance in other engineering systems, such as the molecular mixing rate in chemical reactors (Celik and Beskok, 2009), the heat transfer rate of heat exchangers (Gau et al., 2001), and the efficiency of energy-harvesting systems (Wang et al., 2020). The importance of accurately predicting synchronization conditions in engineering systems cannot be emphasized enough (Bearman, 1984; Naudascher and Rockwell, 2005). Previous studies have investigated the synchronization between the vortex shedding frequency from a bluff body, mainly for a circular cylinder, and its oscillatory motion. For various types of oscillation motions and Reynolds numbers, synchronization regimes and vortex patterns have been identified and classified in both experimental and numerical studies (Olinger and Sreenivasan, 1988; Woo, 1999; Ponta and Aref, 2005; Perdikaris et al., 2009; Leontini et al., 2011; Williamson and Roshko, 1988; Ongoren and Rockwell, 1988; Jacono et al., 2010). These studies are based on time-consuming sweeps of the parametric space in the amplitude-frequency domain using forced motion of a bluff body. Moreover, the synchronization boundaries are identified differently depending on the identification criteria used (Kumar et al., 2016) and the wake measurement location (Kumar et al., 2013). These subtle difficulties in the identification of precise synchronization conditions, as well as a lack of understanding the underlying physics, highlight some weaknesses of previous experimental and numerical approaches. Therefore, a theoretical approach to investigate synchronization is desirable. The theoretical approach we consider is phase-reduction analysis, which describes the dynamics of high-dimensional periodic flows in terms of a single scalar variable “phase.” Phase-reduction analysis has been applied to nonlinear oscillators in a wide range of studies, including those on biological rhythms (Winfree, 1967; Shiogai et al., 2010) and chemical oscillators (Kuramoto, 2003; Pietras and Daffertshofer, 2019). This technique enables us to examine synchronization without extensive parametric sweeps by identifying the phase-response of flows to external perturbations (Taira and Nakao, 2018; Khodkar and Taira, 2020; Khodkar et al., 2021; Loe et al., 2021). Furthermore, phase-reduction analysis has been used to guide flow control of periodic flows (Nair et al., 2021; Godavarthi et al., 2023; Loe et al., 2023; Fukami et al., 2024). However, all previous applications of phase-reduction analysis were focused on two-dimensional periodic flows, even though synchronization in real engineering systems often involves three-dimensional flows. The three-dimensionality of a flow creates added richness compared to its two-dimensional counterpart, which influences the synchronization properties. Hence, it is important to identify the influence of three-dimensionality on synchronization. However, the implementation of phase-reduction analysis is not straightforward for three-dimensional wakes since, generally, they are not perfectly periodic. In this study, we examine the effect of three-dimensionality on the synchronization of a cylinder’s wake to the motion of the cylinder. We consider rotational, crossflow translational and streamwise translational oscillations, which are the bases of in-plane cylinder oscillation. We extend the phase reduction analysis to characterize the perturbation dynamics of three-dimensional flows. Since the underlying three-dimensionality adds fluctuations to the limit cycle, we leverage an ensemble-averaging technique to obtain mean responses of the three-dimensional wake. This paper is organized as follows. Physical characteristics of three-dimensional wakes are presented in §2. Fundamentals of phase-reduction analysis for periodic flows are introduced in §3 with a new technique to measure the phase-response of three-dimensional flows. The results of the present phase-reduction analysis are provided in §4, revealing the influence of three-dimensionality within the flow on the synchronization. Conclusions are offered in §5."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05929v1,How vortices enhance heat transfer from an oscillating plate,"Oscillations of a heated solid surface in an oncoming fluid flow can increase heat transfer from the solid to the fluid. Previous studies have investigated the resulting heat transfer enhancement for the case of a circular cylinder undergoing translational or rotational motions. Another common geometry, the flat plate, has not been studied as thoroughly. The flat plate sheds larger and stronger vortices that are sensitive to the plate’s direction of oscillation. To study the effect of these vortices on heat transfer enhancement, we compute the heat transfer from a flat plate with different orientations and oscillation directions in an oncoming flow with Reynolds number 100. We consider plates with fixed temperature and fixed heat flux, and find large heat transfer enhancement in both cases. We investigate the effects of the plate orientation angle and the plate oscillation direction, velocity, amplitude, and frequency, and find that the plate oscillation velocity and direction have the strongest effects on global heat transfer. The other parameters mainly affect the local heat transfer distributions through shed vorticity distributions. We also discuss the input power needed for the oscillating plate system and the resulting Pareto optimal cases.","Many studies have considered how oscillations of a heated solid surface in an oncoming fluid flow can increase heat transfer from the solid to the fluid. Motions of the boundary alter the flow patterns from the scale of the viscous boundary layer to the larger scale of the outer flow. Previous experimental and computational studies have quantified the resulting heat transfer enhancement for the case of a circular cylinder undergoing translational or rotational oscillations in a two-dimensional crossflow (Saxena and Laird, 1978; Fu and Tong, 2002; Mittal and Al-Mdallal, 2018). After the circular cylinder, perhaps the next most common geometry is the flat plate. When a flat plate is held fixed in a flow, the flow transitions from steady flow to von Kármán vortex shedding at a lower Reynolds number (Re) than a circular cylinder (Thompson et al., 2014), and undergoes a more complex series of wake transitions as Re increases. The flat plate also sheds stronger and larger vortices into the wake. For an oscillating body, one may anticipate similarly significant differences in the flow patterns and heat transfer. Heat transfer by oscillating thin plates has important applications in the biological world. Elephants’ ears are thin surfaces that hold large networks of blood vessels, and ear flapping was speculated to make a large contribution to thermoregulation (Sikes, 1971). Koffi et al. (2014, 2017) studied the enhancement of heat transfer due to oscillations in computational and experimental models of elephant ears, characterized vortical flow structures, and noted an additional heat transfer enhancement in a flexible model relative to a rigid one. Bats vary the blood flow to their wings for thermoregulation, and the constraints of this process affect bats’ survival in cold climates (Rubalcaba et al., 2022; Reeder and Cowles, 1951). Heat transfer may have also played a role in the evolution of insect wings (Kingsolver and Koehl, 1985; Douglas, 1981). Heat stress is a major factor in plant survival and reproductive success (Jagadish et al., 2021). Many studies have considered the effect of wind-induced oscillations on the cooling of plant leaves, both with and without water evaporation at the leaf surface (Murphy and Knoerr, 1977; Roden and Pearcy, 1993; Vogel, 2009; Schuepp, 1972). In this work we focus on heat transfer under prescribed oscillations, but there is also a large body of work on heat transfer when the body motion results from fluid-structure interaction; Mittal and Bhardwaj (2022) reviewed the application of immersed boundary methods in this area. Recently, Rahman and Tafti (2020) studied the heat transfer enhancement due to sinusoidal oscillations of a heated flat plate in an oncoming flow. The plate was aligned with the oncoming flow direction and oscillated transversely, with a fixed Reynolds number of 100 based on the oncoming flow speed. They varied the plate oscillation amplitude and frequency and computed the Nusselt number averaged over a time interval [T, 2T], where T ranged from 8 to 16 oscillation periods. They identified the “plunge velocity,” i.e. the product of dimensionless amplitude and frequency of the oscillation, as a key parameter for controlling the average Nusselt number. The average Nusselt number increased monotonically with the plunge velocity as it varied from 1/2\pi, close to the limit of no oscillation (a static plate), to 8/\pi, a rapid oscillation. When the oscillation amplitude and frequency were varied simultaneously while keeping their product (the plunge velocity) fixed, there was a smaller variation in the average Nusselt number. In this paper we study the same system as Rahman and Tafti (2020) but we now consider the full range of plate orientations and oscillation directions relative to the oncoming flow velocity (see figure 1), instead of just a streamwise orientation and transverse oscillation direction. Like Rahman and Tafti (2020), we find that the global (i.e. time- and space-averaged) heat transfer is strongly influenced by the “oscillation velocity” (a generalization of the plunge velocity). The next most important parameter is the plate oscillation direction \alpha. The global and local heat transfer typically improves as we move from in-plane to transverse oscillations, i.e. as \alpha increases from 0^{\circ} to 90^{\circ}. The oncoming flow direction \gamma and the oscillatory frequency (assuming fixed oscillation velocity) have noticeable but generally weaker effects on the global heat transfer. They strongly alter the flows and spatial distributions of heat transfer quantities, but when taking an average over the plate, these variations are reduced to a surprising extent. The structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we present the governing equations and numerical method. Section 3 presents the flow fields and the local heat transfer distributions in the benchmark cases of non-oscillating plates. Section 4 shows the effect of vorticity patterns on global and local heat transfer for oscillating plates with different orientations and oscillation directions. In section 5 we discuss the input power for this system, including the power to oscillate the plates and to drive the oncoming flow. Section 6 presents the conclusions."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05926v1,The Footprint of Laminar Separation on a Wall-Bounded Wing Section at Transitional Reynolds Numbers,"When a chordwise Reynolds number (Re) falls below about 10^{5} the performance of wings and aerodynamic sections become sensitive to viscous phenomena, including boundary layer separation and possible reattachment. Here, detailed measurements of the flow inside the boundary layer on the suction surface are shown for an aspect ratio 3 wing with wall boundaries. The separation lines and recirculation zones are shown on the wing and on the wall junction as Re and angle of incidence, (\alpha) are varied. There is good agreement on the lowest Re case which has also been computed in direct numerical simulation. Though the flow at midspan may sometimes be described as two-dimensional, at \alpha\leq 6^{\circ} it is unrepresentative of the remainder of the wing, and the influence of the wall is seen in strong spanwise flows aft of the separation line. The geometry of the NACA 65(1)-412 section, used here, promotes a substantial chord length for the development of the recirculating regions behind separation making it apt for their study. However, the phenomena themselves are likely to be found over a wide range of wings with moderate thickness at moderate \alpha.","I.1 Complex flows at Transitional Reynolds number In the Reynolds numbers range Re =10^{4}-10^{5} (the chordwise Reynolds number, Re =Uc/\nu, where U is the freestream velocity, c is the chord length and \nu is the kinematic viscosity) the flow on and around an airfoil section or wing is especially complex as the initially laminar boundary layer can separate, transition to turbulence in the detached shear layer and then in the time-averaged sense, reattach, all within one chord length [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Separation at these Reynolds numbers is caused by the interaction of the relatively non-robust laminar boundary layer with an adverse pressure gradient created by the curvature of streamlines over the lifting surface. For a given geometry and Re, increasing the angle of attack, \alpha, increases the magnitude of the adverse pressure gradient and increases the percentage of chordwise length/area it occupies on the suction surface. The laminar separation point moves towards the leading edge and depending on flow conditions and separation point location, the flow may transition to turbulence and reattach. Laminar separation and time-averaged reattachment is known as the laminar separation bubble (LSB) [6]. Typically four distinct flow states occur for airfoils at Re =10^{4}-10^{5} and 0^{\circ}\leq\alpha\leq 15^{\circ}: (1) trailing edge laminar separation, (2) a long LSB, (3) a short LSB, and (4) turbulent separation, commonly referred to as stall. The classification of long and short LSB was proposed by [7] where long LSBs typically have chordwise length l\geq 10^{3}\delta_{s} and short LSBs l\geq 10^{2}\delta_{s}, where \delta_{s} is the boundary layer thickness at separation. Figure 1 shows a schematic of these different flow states. Figure 1: Some conventional two dimensional flow states as angle of attack is increased for airfoils at within Re =10^{4}-10^{5} regime. (1) trailing edge laminar separation, (2) long laminar separation bubble, (3) short laminar separation bubble, and (4) Turbulent separation (stall) The flow at transitional chordwise Reynolds numbers does not immediately transition after separation, owing to the stabilizing effects of viscosity. The result is the creation of a shear layer with an initial two dimensional instability, similar to a Kelvin Helmholtz instability with a lower boundary. The two dimensional instability, which may itself be seeded by Tollmein-Schlichting modes [8, 9] is easily destabilized into a three dimensional flow and is sensitive to small perturbations. Studies focused on acoustic [10, 11, 12, 13], surface [14, 15] and velocity [16, 17, 18] perturbations have shown the possibility of suppressing or promoting transition, and in turn modifying airfoil performance. In complement to these experiments, numerical studies [19, 20, 8, 21, 22] have been conducted to examine the complex flow fields produced by laminar separation and identify the instabilities responsible for transient energy growth within the separated region. These instabilities cause the flow to transition into the turbulent regime which in turn promotes reattachment of the turbulent boundary layer. The dynamics of laminar separation and turbulent reattachment strongly affect the performance of airfoils [1] and are highly sensitive to \alpha, Re, and the flow environment. I.2 Influence of Junction Many studies of airfoils at Re =10^{4}-10^{5} invoke two dimensional simplifications, with either periodic boundary conditions in computation or with wall-bounded, spanwise uniform wings in wind tunnel studies. The addition of end walls introduces junction flow phenomena with horseshoe [23] vortices forming near the leading edge of the airfoil and wrapping around the airfoil creating the possibility of corner separation [24, 25] near the trailing edge and on the wall. Experimental studies [1, 26, 27] have found that end wall effects for wings with low aspect ratio (AR\leq 3) extend considerably into the flow domain. Since wings and turbine blades must be attached to fuselages and rotors in practice, it becomes important to understand the influence of three-dimensional effects and of wall/boundary layer interactions. I.3 Thesis The purpose of this paper is to experimentally examine the flow topology in the transitional Reynolds number regime of a wall bounded NACA 65(1)412 airfoil. In particular the flow topology of the shearing surfaces will be examined for a wing with AR=3. Over a range of chordwise Reynolds numbers 10^{4}\leq\textrm{Re}\leq 10^{5} the initially laminar boundary layer always separates and the complex flow structures that emerge after the separation line then appear in a time-averaged sense as an array of laminar separation bubbles of various kinds, depending sensitively on \alpha [28, 1]. Sweeps of Re and \alpha will be conducted to study the separation evolution. Comparisons with direct numerical simulations of the flow will be made, with the objective of identifying whether agreement is acceptable for both experiment and simulation to inform control strategies."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05840v1,ConvNet-Based Prediction of Droplet Collision Dynamics in Microchannels,"The dynamics of droplet collisions in microchannels are inherently complex, governed by multiple interdependent physical and geometric factors. Understanding and predicting the outcomes of these collisions—whether coalescence, reverse-back, or pass-over- pose significant challenges, particularly due to the deformability of droplets and the influence of key parameters such as viscosity ratios, density ratios, confinement, and initial offset of droplets. Traditional methods for analyzing these collisions, including computational simulations and experimental techniques, are time-consuming and resource-intensive, limiting their scalability for real-time applications. In this work, we explore a novel data-driven approach to predict droplet collision outcomes using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN-based approach presents a significant advantage over traditional methods, offering faster, scalable solutions for analyzing large datasets with varying physical parameters. Using a lattice Boltzmann method based on Cahn-Hilliard diffuse interface theory for binary immiscible fluids, we numerically generated droplet collision data under confined shear flow. This data, represented as droplet shapes, serves as input to the CNN model, which automatically learns hierarchical features from the images, allowing for accurate and efficient collision outcome predictions based on deformation and orientation. The model achieves a prediction accuracy of 0.972, even on test datasets with varied density and viscosity ratios not included in training. Our findings suggest that the CNN-based models offer improved accuracy in predicting collision outcomes while drastically reducing computational and time constraints. This work highlights the potential of machine learning to advance droplet dynamics studies, providing a valuable tool for researchers in fluid dynamics and soft matter.","The study of droplet dynamics, particularly in multiphase flows, has attracted considerable attention in both academic research and industrial applications due to its broad relevance in fields such as targeted drug delivery [1, 2, 3, 4], enhanced oil recovery (EOR) [5, 6, 7, 8], microfluidics [9, 10, 11, 12], cosmetics [13, 14, 15], emulsification [16, 17, 18], materials processing [19, 20], chemical reactions [21, 22], biology engineering [23, 24, 25] and many more. Droplet collisions, as a subtopic of this field, present an especially complex challenge due to the intricate interactions between droplets and the surrounding fluid. These interactions are governed by numerous physical and geometric parameters that affect droplet deformation, coalescence, and breakup, making accurate predictions of collision outcomes a difficult task. The complexity is further compounded in microfluidic systems, where confinement plays a critical role in altering the behavior of droplets during collisions. Our research focuses on predicting the outcome of droplet pair collisions in confined microchannel flow, using convolutional neural networks (CNN) by analyzing the shape of droplets during the collision process. The motivation for this study stems from the need to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches in predicting droplet collision outcomes. In soft matter systems, such as emulsions, droplets are suspended in a continuous fluid and frequently undergo collisions. These collisions result in a range of outcomes—coalescence, reverse-back, or pass-over depending on the interplay of several parameters such as droplet size, velocity, viscosity ratio, density ratio, confinement, and initial offset. A deeper understanding of these collision outcomes is essential for optimizing processes in industries. However, predicting these outcomes is a non-trivial task due to the nonlinear nature of the governing factors and the sensitivity of collision behavior to small variations in system parameters. The traditional methods for predicting droplet collision outcomes typically involve either phenomenological models or direct numerical simulations (DNS). Phenomenological models are often derived from simplified physical principles, where key parameters such as Weber number, Reynolds number, and Ohnesorge number are used to define collision regimes. One of the earliest models in this area was proposed by Ashgriz and Poo [26], who classified droplet collisions into different modes (e.g., bouncing, coalescence, and reflexive or stretching breakup) based on a set of dimensionless numbers. Subsequent models by Jiang et al. [27] and Qian and Law [28] further refined these classifications, developing “collision maps” to predict outcomes based on experimental data. However, these models have limited applicability because they often require calibration with experimental data and cannot generalize to new parameter spaces. They also tend to break down when additional complexities like surface tension variations, viscosity contrasts, or confinement effects are introduced. In another study, Agarwal et al. [29] investigated the collisions in fuel spray systems and used phenomenological models to predict the outcomes of binary droplet collisions. Their model achieved a prediction accuracy of around 64%, highlighting the limitations of using such approaches for complex multiphase systems. Sommerfeld and Kuschel [30] extended this work by incorporating additional data points, including different fluid viscosities and droplet velocities, but observed a drop in accuracy to about 43% when these variables were included. This suggests that traditional empirical correlations struggle to capture the complex physics involved, especially when dealing with highly deformable droplets in confined geometries. The use of simplified governing equations makes it difficult for these models to account for the full range of physical phenomena that occur during droplet collisions. On the other hand, direct numerical simulations (DNS) have been used to model droplet collisions with higher accuracy, as they solve the full Navier-Stokes equations without relying on simplifying assumptions. Studies by Bianchi et al. [31] and Liu et al. [32] have shown that DNS can predict collision outcomes with a high degree of accuracy. However, DNS is computationally expensive, particularly when simulating large systems or conducting parametric studies involving multiple variables. This makes DNS impractical for real-time applications or for generating large datasets required for building comprehensive collision maps. Moreover, even high-fidelity simulations may struggle to capture the effects of local geometry and deformation in microfluidic systems where confinement becomes a dominant factor. Given the limitations of both phenomenological models and DNS, there is a clear need for alternative approaches that can provide accurate predictions without the computational burden of full-scale simulations. The advent of machine learning (ML) and, more specifically, deep learning techniques, offers a promising solution to this problem. In recent years, ML has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex fluid dynamics phenomena. ML techniques are capable of identifying patterns in large datasets and developing predictive models that generalize well to new data. One of the key advantages of ML in fluid dynamics is its ability to model nonlinear relationships between variables, which is particularly useful when dealing with phenomena like turbulence, multiphase flows, or droplet collisions. Numerous studies have demonstrated the potential of ML in areas such as turbulence modeling, where traditional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or Large Eddy Simulations are computationally expensive and often inaccurate in complex flows. For example, Duraisamy et al. [33] applied ML to develop closure models for turbulence, achieving better accuracy than traditional RANS models. Similarly, Ling et al. [34] used deep learning to predict turbulence quantities from sparse data, showing that ML can improve both accuracy and efficiency in fluid flow predictions. On the other hand, reduced order modeling (ROM) technique plays a pivotal role in advancing fluid flow analysis and control [35, 36, 37]. ROM aims to simplify complex, high-dimensional fluid flow problems by creating low-dimensional models that retain essential dynamics. In fluid flow applications, data-driven sparse reconstruction also plays useful role when dealing with limited sensor data [38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. For instances, in aerodynamic design, climate modeling, and industrial fluid processes, sparse reconstruction can provide detailed insights into the flow behavior around complex geometries using minimal measurements. These successes in data-driven modeling have inspired researchers to apply ML to other areas of fluid dynamics such as wall-impact breakage modeling in particle-laden flows [43]. The ability of ML algorithms to automatically learn hierarchical features from data makes them particularly well-suited for problems where visual information, such as droplet deformation, plays a key role in determining the outcome. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a subset of deep learning, have been widely applied in computer vision tasks due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies of features from images. In the context of fluid dynamics, CNNs have been used to extract features from flow fields and predict outcomes such as vortex formation or separation in aerodynamic flows. For example, Guo et al. [44] employed CNNs to predict flow fields around airfoils based on input geometric parameters, achieving high accuracy in their predictions. The success of CNNs in identifying patterns in visual data has opened up new possibilities for their application in multiphase flow problems, where the shape and deformation of objects like droplets are critical in determining behavior. While CNNs have been extensively used in object recognition and image classification tasks in computer vision [45, 46, 47], their application to droplet collision modeling is relatively new. The ability of CNNs to recognize and classify complex shapes makes them ideal for studying droplet interactions, where the deformation of the droplet can reveal key information about the forces acting on it during a collision. For instance, Jian et al. [48] utilized a convolutional autoencoder model to classify droplet break-up moving through a constriction, highlighting the potential of CNNs in fluid dynamics applications. In the case of droplet collisions, the shape of the droplets during the interaction reflects the balance of forces acting on them, including surface tension, viscous forces, and inertia. By using CNNs to analyze these shapes, we can predict the outcome of the collision whether the droplets will coalesce, reverse back, or pass over each other. This approach offers a significant advantage over traditional methods, as it allows for real-time predictions without the need for expensive simulations or experiments. In this study, we propose a novel approach for predicting droplet collision outcomes using CNNs to analyze the shape of droplets during their interaction in confined microchannel flow. By training the CNN on a reasonably large dataset of simulated droplet collisions, we aim to develop a model that can accurately predict whether two droplets will coalesce, reverse back, or pass over each other based on their shape at the moment of collision. This approach leverages the ability of CNNs to extract hierarchical features from image data, capturing the subtle deformations that are indicative of different collision outcomes. Unlike traditional methods, our approach does not rely on pre-defined empirical correlations or simplifying assumptions about the governing equations. Instead, it uses the raw image data to learn the complex relationships between droplet shape, orientation, and collision outcome. This allows our model to generalize across a wide range of parameters, including varying fluid viscosities, densities, droplet sizes, initial offset, and confinement geometries. Moreover, the use of CNNs allows for real-time predictions, making this approach suitable for applications where rapid decision-making is critical, such as in microfluidic device design or process control in industrial applications. As is the case, the prediction of droplet collision outcomes in microfluidic systems presents a significant challenge due to the complexity of the interactions and the multitude of influencing parameters. Traditional methods, such as phenomenological models and DNS, face limitations in terms of accuracy, scalability, and computational cost. ML, and specifically CNNs, offers a promising alternative by leveraging the power of data-driven modeling to predict collision outcomes based on droplet shape. This study aims to contribute to the growing body of literature on ML in fluid dynamics by demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs in predicting droplet collision outcomes in confined flows. First, simulations are performed under varied input parameters using a free-energy-based lattice Boltzmann method. The dataset of collision dynamics between droplet pairs is then collected and preprocessed to train a CNN-based predictive model capable of accurately classifying droplet collision outcomes based on shape analysis. The performance of the CNN model is assessed using a broader range of simulation conditions beyond the training and validation datasets to evaluate its applicability and reliability in real-world scenarios. These conditions, in the context of droplet collision prediction, include variations in the density and viscosity of immiscible fluids, the initial offset distance between the two droplets, and the confined geometry of microchannels. By using shape-based analysis, we provide a new pathway for understanding and controlling droplet behavior in multiphase systems."
