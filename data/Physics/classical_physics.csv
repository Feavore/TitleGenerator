https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08600v1,Optimal damping adapted to a set of initial conditions,"Vibrating systems can respond to an infinite number of initial conditions and the overall dynamics of the system can be strongly affected by them. Therefore, it is of practical importance to have methods by which we can determine the damping that is in some sense optimal for all initial conditions, or for a given set of initial conditions. For a single and multi degree of freedom systems, we determine the optimal damping coefficients adapted to different sets of initial conditions using the known method of minimizing the (zero to infinity) time integral of the energy of the system, averaged over a set of initial conditions, and using two new methods that we introduce. One method is based on determining the damping for which the energy of the system, averaged over a set of initial conditions, drops the fastest to a given threshold value. The other method is based on determining the damping that gives minimal average settling time of the system, where we take that the system settled when its energy dropped to a given threshold value. We show that the two new methods give results for optimal damping that are in excellent agreement with each other, but are significantly different from the results given by the minimization of the average energy integral. More precisely, for considered multi degree of freedom systems and sets of initial conditions, the two new methods give optimal damping coefficients that converge to the critical damping of the first mode as the target energy threshold decreases. On the other hand, for these same systems and sets of initial conditions, the method of minimizing the average energy integral gives optimal damping coefficients which are deep in the overdamped regime with respect to the first mode.","In most methods for determining the optimal damping of multi-degree of freedom (MDOF) linear vibrating systems initial conditions are either completely ignored or zero initial conditions are assumed [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The reason for this is that these methods are primarily designed for the analysis of systems with continuous excitation and finding the optimal steady state response, and are not intended for the analysis of free vibrations with non-zero initial conditions. In some cases it make sense to study the free vibrations of the system with nonzero initial conditions. A prominent example is the vibration control in buildings exposed to seismic excitations [6, 7]. Indeed, depending on the initial conditions, MDOF systems can exhibit oscillatory or non-oscillatory response [8], so it is clear that initial conditions can play an important role in the overall dynamics of the system. Implicitly, dependence of the behavior of system on initial conditions has been investigated in the context of time-optimal vibrations reduction [9] and transient response [10] in terms of computationally efficient methods for the calculation of the system response. In [11], optimal damping of free vibrations was determined by minimization of the (zero to infinity) time integral of the energy of the system, averaged over all possible initial conditions corresponding to the same initial energy. This method was investigated widely, mostly by mathematicians, in the last two decades, more details can be found, e.g., in references [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Due to the averaging over all initial conditions, it was not clear how well the optimal damping obtained in this way works for a specific choice of initial conditions, e.g., for free vibrations with initial conditions such that the initial energy consists only of potential energy, or only of kinetic energy, etc. This issue was recently addressed in [17], where a systematic investigation of the role of initial conditions in the context of optimal damping problems was initiated. Namely, optimal damping of free vibrations with specific initial conditions is determined simply by minimization of the energy integral corresponding to that particular initial conditions, i.e. without averaging, and it is found that optimal damping obtained this way strongly depends on initial conditions. In particular, for a single degree of freedom (SDOF) system, averaging over all initial conditions gives the critical damping as optimal [11, 13], and by considering the minimization of the energy integral without averaging, damping coefficients approximately 30\% less than critical to infinite value are obtained as optimal, depending on the initial conditions [17]. Similar behavior is found in MDOF systems with mass proportional damping (MPD). More precisely, for MDOF systems with MPD, minimization of the energy integral gives the lowest values of the optimal damping coefficients for initial conditions with purely potential initial energy, and infinite values of optimal damping coefficients for initial conditions with purely kinetic initial energy, while all values in between are possible for initial conditions with initial energy that is a combination of potential and kinetic energy. Furthermore, the optimal damping coefficients obtained in this way do not depend on the signs of the initial conditions, and the energy dissipation rate can strongly depend on them [17]. Along with the aforementioned analysis of optimal damping obtained by the minimization of energy integral for specific initial conditions, a new method for determining the optimal damping of MDOF systems was also introduced in [17]. The method is based on the determination of the damping coefficients for which the energy of the system drops the fastest to some threshold that corresponds, e.g., to the energy resolution of the measuring device with which we observe the system, or to an acceptable level of energy that no longer poses a problem. This fastest energy drop method gives finite optimal damping coefficients even for initial conditions with purely kinetic initial energy, and it is sensitive to the signs of initial conditions as well. This method was introduced for the first time in [18], but only in the context of the SDOF systems, where it was also experimentally verified (for one type of initial conditions) by measuring the optimal damping of free oscillations of the RLC circuit, i.e. measurements where consistent with theoretical predictions. Vibrating systems can respond to infinitely many different initial conditions in operating conditions. It begs the question, is it possible to adjust the damping to all initial conditions, or to some expected set of initial conditions? The method of minimizing the energy integral, averaged over initial conditions, is one way to determine the optimal damping adapted to all initial conditions, or some given set of initial conditions, the difference is only in the set over which we calculate the average. We will refer to this method as the minimization of the average energy integral. The aim of this paper is to show that the fastest energy drop method, introduced in [17], can be adapted for this purpose as well. We consider the energy averaged over a set of initial conditions and take as optimal the damping for which this average energy drops to a given threshold the fastest. We will refer to this method as the fastest drop of the average energy. For SDOF systems, and MDOF systems with MPD, we calculate and compare the optimal damping coefficients provided by those two methods for several sets of initial conditions. We find that these two methods give significantly different results when applied to the same set of initial conditions. Here we will highlight only a part of the results that perhaps most clearly indicate the differences between the two methods. For the set of all initial conditions with the same initial energy, we show that the fastest drop of the average energy gives optimal damping coefficients that converge to critical damping in case of SDOF, and to critical damping of the first modes in case of 2-DOF and 3-DOF systems, if we consider the energy drop to ever lower thresholds. For the same set of initial conditions, we show that the minimization of the average energy integral gives critical damping as optimal in the SDOF case, and it gives optimal damping coefficients that are significantly overdamped with the respect to the first modes in case of 2-DOF and 3-DOF systems. We argue that these differences in values of optimal damping coefficients given by two methods further increase with the increase of number of degrees of freedom. If we would like to check which of the two methods gives more relevant results for real-world application, it would be best to do an experiment. Since this is a theoretical paper, we will only describe what kind of experiment could be useful for the selection of a ""better"" method. Let’s imagine that we have an MDOF system and possibility to excite free vibrations of that system, so that each time some initial condition from a given finite discrete set of initial conditions (which correspond to the excitations to which the system will be exposed in operating conditions) is realized, and that each new free vibration starts after the previous one has ended. Also, let’s imagine that we can adjust the damping in that system. In that case, we could set the damping to the value given by one method and, at least in principle, measure the duration of free vibrations corresponding to each initial condition from the given set. In this way, we could determine the total time of free vibrations of all initial conditions from the set, and calculate the average settling time of the system per initial condition. We could repeat the experiment with the optimal damping given by the other method, and calculate corresponding average settling time. We could then take the damping that gives a smaller average settling time of the system as relevant to the operating conditions. This motivates us to introduce yet another method, the method of minimal average settling time. We define the settling time of the system, corresponding to some specific initial condition, as a time needed for energy of the system to drop from initial value to some threshold value, and using the settling times corresponding to each initial condition in a given set we calculate the average settling time of the system with respect to a given set of initial conditions. We repeat this procedure for a range of damping coefficients and search for the optimal damping coefficient for which the average settling time is minimal. We find that the results of this method are in excellent agreement with the results given by the fastest drop of the average energy. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is devoted to SDOF systems, systematization of initial conditions and the sets of initial conditions that we consider in this paper, and precise definition and analysis of minimization of the average energy integral and fastest drop of the average energy methods in the SDOF case. In Section 3, we analyze MDOF systems with MPD. In Section 4, we define and analyze average settling time of SDOF and MDOF systems with MPD. In Section 5, we discuss and summarize the important findings of the paper."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08283v1,The surprising subtlety of electrostatic field lines,"Electric fields are commonly visualized with field line diagrams, which only unambiguously specify the field’s direction. We consider two simple questions. First, can one deduce if an electric field is conservative, as required e.g. in electrostatics, from its field lines alone? Second, are there conservative electric fields with straight field lines, besides the familiar textbook examples with spherical, cylindrical, or planar symmetry? We give a self-contained introduction to the differential geometry required to answer these questions, assuming only vector calculus background.","In electromagnetism, the electric and magnetic fields are the fundamental quantities, and field lines give only incomplete information about the fields. However, field lines remain a useful source of visual intuition. For example, the directions of electric and magnetic forces can be seen from field line diagrams [1], using Faraday’s idea that field lines carry a tension along them and an outward pressure perpendicular to them. Radiation from a kicked charge is readily visualized in terms of kinked electric field lines [2], and magnetic field lines in plasmas can be thought of as “moving” with the medium [3, 4, 5]. Field line diagrams are almost universally used in introductory physics courses, and it is well-known that they can lead to common student misconceptions [6, 7, 8, 9]. However, there are also legitimate questions that students may ask about them, which have surprisingly subtle answers. In this work, we consider two such questions. First, electric field lines are often used to depict electrostatic fields, which are conservative. But given a set of field lines, how can one tell if they can correspond to a conservative field? Second, introductory courses usually illustrate Gauss’s law by applying it to electrostatic fields with spherical, cylindrical, or planar symmetry, as these simple cases have only straight field lines. Are there any other electrostatic fields with only straight field lines? As we will discuss in Sec. II, these questions are nontrivial because the field’s magnitude is not determined by the field lines. We answer the first question in Sec. III. It turns out to require the geometric notion of Frobenius integrability, which is not commonly taught in undergraduate physics courses, but can be introduced with only vector calculus background. The second question is most simply answered by considering the Gaussian and mean curvatures of equipotential surfaces. We give a self-contained introduction to these concepts in Sec. IV, answer the question in Sec. V, and conclude in Sec. VI. These puzzles may be of interest to instructors, and their resolutions may expand the horizons of ambitious upper-division students. For more about the underlying geometrical ideas, we direct the reader to Refs. [10, 11, 12, 13]."

(See Figure 3.)","In [1], A. Stanovnik discusses the oscillation of a pendulum with an ideal elastic string on a rotating Earth. The ideally elastic string is a Hook’s spring that has zero length at relaxation. In this case, the transversal and longitudinal frequencies of the pendulum are the same. In this article we vary the stiffness of the spring and observe the oscillations depending on latitude. Our observations focus on the precession of the projection of the pendulum’s motion in the plane tangential to Earth at a specific point. Initially, the primary goal of the study was to observe the transition between the 24-hour precession period of a pendulum with an ideal elastic string and the \color[rgb]{0.1015625,0.234375,0.64453125}\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{% rgb}{0.1015625,0.234375,0.64453125}24/\sin\lambda-hour period of Foucault’s pendulum, which has an ideally rigid (inextensible) string, depending on the latitude and string stiffness. The transition between one regime and the other is gradual; the oscillations in general are not periodic. If we look at the oscillation of a pendulum with an ideally flexible string we notice that the direction of oscillation remains unchanged relative to the stellar background. On the \color[rgb]{0.1015625,0.234375,0.64453125}\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{% rgb}{0.1015625,0.234375,0.64453125}45^{\circ} parallel the oscillation of a pendulum swinging in the north-south direction will gradually change from a transversal to a longitudinal oscillation over 12 hours. In longitudinal oscillation, the precession phase of the oscillation plane is lost. Figure 1. Coordinates system Precession phase loss is well defined, so we focus on observing the loss of precession phase at different geographic latitudes for different spring stiffness. On a given geographical latitude, the pendulum swings in the north-south direction changing the stiffness of the spring until at some point the projection of the pendulum motion becomes circular. At latitude of \color[rgb]{0.1015625,0.234375,0.64453125}\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{% rgb}{0.1015625,0.234375,0.64453125}45^{\circ}, the stiffness at that point must be zero, and the pendulum oscillates only in the longitudinal direction (the projection of the motion is a point). At latitudes different from \color[rgb]{0.1015625,0.234375,0.64453125}\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{% rgb}{0.1015625,0.234375,0.64453125}45^{\circ}, the initial trajectory of the pendulum bob in space is a stretched ellipse, which then gradually opens and the eccentricity decreases until, at a certain stiffness and latitude, the projection of the trajectory becomes circular. Under the same initial conditions, the diameter of the circle depends on the latitude. In addition to stiffness, we are also interested in the time required at a given latitude for the projection motion of the pendulum to become circular. We will call the stiffness at which the projection of the pendulum forms a circle the critical stiffness for a given latitude. The stiffness will be measured by the relative difference between the longitudinal and transversal angular frequencies of the pendulum’s oscillation, relative to the frequency of Earth’s rotation. It turns out that for stiffness defined in this way, critical stiffness of a pendulum is characteristic for a given latitude, regardless of the length of the pendulum, gravitational acceleration, and period of rotation of the planet, as long as we can ignore the centrifugal reaction force acceleration. Therefore, there is no need to restrict to Earth anymore, and we will from now on refer to a planet to emphasize this independence. As previously stated, the motion of a pendulum with critical stiffness of the string is generally not periodic. Our main interest lies in identifying those latitudes at which the pendulum oscillation becomes periodic at critical stiffness. The search for such resonant latitudes will be the focus of our study in what follows."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08694v1,Intensity landscapes in elliptical and oval billiards with a circular absorbing region,"Billiard models of single particles moving freely in two-dimensional regions enclosed by hard walls, have long provided ideal toy models for the investigation of dynamical systems and chaos. Recently, billiards with (semi-)permeable walls and internal holes have been used to study open systems. Here we introduce a billiard model containing an internal region with partial absorption. The absorption does not change the trajectories, but instead reduces an intensity variable associated with each trajectory. The value of the intensity can be tracked as a function of the initial configuration and the number of reflections from the wall and depicted in intensity landscapes over the Poincaré phase space. This is similar in spirit to escape time diagrams that are often considered in dynamical systems with holes. We analyse the resulting intensity landscapes for three different geometries; a circular, elliptic, and oval billiard, respectively, all with a centrally placed circular absorbing region. The intensity landscapes feature increasingly more complex structures, organised around the sets of points that are a particular number of iteration away from the absorbing region, and enriched by effects arising from multiple absorption events for a given trajectory.","Billiard models play a prominent role in our understanding of chaos and dynamical systems. In their simplest form they consist of two-dimensional regions with hard walls at the boundary, where free particles or rays may traverse without friction and reflect from the hard walls. While the corresponding phase space is four-dimensional, the simple behaviour of the trajectories between reflections from the walls, and the scaling invariance with respect to the total momentum of a trajectory, allows for the analysis of the dynamical behaviour on a two-dimensional Poincaré section \Omega=S\times p, spanned by Poincaré-Birkhoff coordinates (S,p), characterising the points of reflection. The billiard dynamics can thus be described in the form of a symplectic map T:(S_{n},p_{n})\to(S_{n+1},p_{n+1}) on the Poincaré section, the dynamical behaviour of which is determined by the shape of the billiard boundary [1, 2, 3]. Integrable (regular) dynamics can be studied through e.g., circular and elliptical boundaries; and globally chaotic dynamics through e.g. a stadium boundary or Sinai geometries. The generic case of mixed dynamics arises in many perturbations of these shapes, such as in ovals or in billiards with an internal boundary/scatterer such as annulus or iris billiards [4, 5]. In particular the investigation of mixed and chaotic billiards and their classical maps, has played an important role in the development of the theory of quantum and wave chaos, where quantum counterparts of these systems provide important theoretical examples [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Experimentally these systems can be implemented for example as quasi-two-dimensional cavities for microwaves [11, 12] or for light [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Recently there has also been intense interest in relativistic billiards [18, 19, 20, 21]. While classical dissipative chaos is a well developed field, the study of wave chaos in the presence of loss is still in the early stages and many phenomena such as multifractal distributions of eigenstates and the fractal Weyl law are still only partially understood [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. This has motivated various studies of modified classical billiard dynamics, which include a loss mechanism. In particular, leaking billiards - billiards with partial or total escape through a region in the boundary - have been studied in some detail [33, 34, 35, 36]. A hole placed at the boundary corresponds to escape through a simple rectangular area in the Poincaré section, and does not affect the mapping T, but stops the iteration of the map when the hole is first encountered. The study of escape time diagrams, where initial points on the Poincaré section are colour-coded in correspondence with the number of iterations by which they are separated from the hole, has uncovered rich dynamical structures and provided a new tool for understanding the corresponding wave systems [30]. In [37] leaking billiards with a hole in the inside of the billiard, rather than on its boundary, were studied. The dynamics again terminate on first encounter of a trajectory with the hole, and escape time diagrams and average escape times can be studied. In contrast to a hole in the boundary a hole in the interior is not connected to a static area in the Poincaré section. The behaviour of the escape times was found to depend crucially on the dynamical nature of the billiard, with characteristic features associated to chaotic versus regular cases. The concept of a partial leak, on the other hand does not terminate trajectories on encounter with the leaking region, but can be described by a loss of intensity - an additional coordinate attached to the trajectories that changes due to the leak [33, 34, 38, 31, 39]. Hitherto partial leaks have only been investigated on the boundary of the system, corresponding to losses from a static region in the Poincaré phase space. In the present paper we consider a loss region in the interior of the billiard. The loss region itself is considered spatially homogeneous and does not change the dynamics encoded in T. However, due to the finite size of the loss region, different trajectories spend different amounts of time within the loss region between iterations, leading to a nontrivial change in intensity that cannot be connected to a static area of loss in the two-dimensional Poincaré phase space. The intensity dynamics can be visualised as false colour plots on the Poincaré phase space, displaying the value of the intensity after a given number of iterations in dependence of the initial phase-space point. The resulting intensity landscapes have been found to unravel classical structures underlying quantum systems with decay in simpler model systems [31, 39]. Here we investigate billiards with elliptic and oval boundaries, (corresponding to regular and mixed chaotic-regular maps T) with a partial leak from a central circular region within the billiard. We observe that the intensity landscapes over time develop characteristics of the Poincaré section for the closed billiard, and the interplay with the absorbing region. We show that the intensity landscapes are organised around a union of sets related to the infinite absorption limit (i.e. the limit in which the absorbing region acts as a hole), and are modulated with intricate intensity variations arising from a finite absorption strength. The paper is organised as follows. We begin with a brief summary of the background and notation of the billiard dynamics expressed as a symplectic map in Poincaré-Birkhoff coordinates and introduce the concept of the intensity landscape in section II. Then we discuss the intensity landscapes in detail for three examples (circle, ellipse, and oval) in sections III, IV, and V. We finish with a short summary and outlook in section VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07897v1,MODIFIED LANDAUER PRINCIPLE ACCORDING TO TSALLIS ENTROPY,"The Landauer principle establishes a lower bound in the amount of energy that should be dissipated in the erasure of one bit of information. The specific value of this dissipated energy is tightly related to the definition of entropy. In this article, we present a generalization of the Landauer principle based on the Tsallis entropy. Some consequences resulting from such a generalization are discussed. These consequences include the modification to the mass ascribed to one bit of information, the generalization of the Landauer principle to the case when the system is embedded in a gravitational field, and the number of bits radiated in the emission of gravitational waves.","The Landauer principle Ref. [1], which is a cornerstone in the theory of information, states that the erasure of one bit of information stored in a system implies the dissipation of energy, whose value cannot be smaller than \bigtriangleup E=kT\ln 2, (1) where k is the Boltzmann constant and T denotes the temperature of the environment. The important point to keep in mind here is that even though the value of dissipated energy depends on the erasure procedure, it cannot be lower that Equation (1). At this point, some remarks are needed, as follows: • It has been argued in the past (see for example Ref. [2]) ) that the main idea stated in the Landauer principle appears already in some Brillouin works Ref. [3]. We shall skip this controversy and shall adopt the notation used by most of researchers, and we shall refer to it as the Landauer principle. • In spite of some arguments put forward in the past questioning the relevance of the Landauer principle (see Ref. [4] and references therein), the important point to retain here is that on the one hand it allows an “informational” reformulation of thermodynamics, as stressed in Ref. [4], and on the other hand brings out a link between information theory and different branches of science Refs. [5, 6, 7]. This allows us to approach some physical problems from the point of view of information theory. • The expression Equation (1) for the dissipated energy heavily relies on the concept of entropy. More specifically, such an expression was found using the Gibbs entropy. Therefore, we should expect different expressions for alternative definitions of entropy."
