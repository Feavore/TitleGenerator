In our experiments, injecting dye between a source and a sink in a Hele-Shaw cell filled with a yield-stress fluid reveals an abrupt transition in morphologies as a function of injection rate. Slow injection leads to a direct path connecting the source to the sink, while fast injection leads to a rapid branching morphology that eventually converges to the sink. This shift from an exploitative (direct) to an exploratory (branched) strategy resembles search strategies in living systems; however, here it emerges in a simple physical system from a combination of global constraints (fluid conservation) and a switch-like local material response. We show that the amount of fluid needed to achieve breakthrough is minimal at the transition, and that there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy in these arborization patterns. Altogether, our study provides an embodied paradigm for fluidic computation driven by a combination of local material response (body) and global boundary conditions (environment).","References Saffman and Taylor [1958] P.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10382v1,Geometric dependence of curvature-induced rigidity,"Bending the edge of a thin elastic material promotes rigidity far from its clamped boundary. However, this curvature-induced rigidity can be overwhelmed by gravity or other external loading, resulting in elastic buckling and large deformations. We consider the role of body geometry on this competition using experiments, numerical simulations, and reduced-order models. Finite element simulations are performed using a model nonlinear hyperelastic material, and a theoretical framework is proposed that incorporates small lateral curvatures, large longitudinal rotations, and a varying cross-sectional width. A particular focus is on the comparison between rectangular and triangular sheets, and trapezoidal sheets in between. Sheet geometry affects downward tip deflection by changing the relative importance of the sheet’s weight and the rigidity provided by curvature, often in subtle ways. In extreme cases, non-monotonic deflection is observed with increasing sheet length, and a region of hysteretic bistability emerges, becoming more pronounced with rectangular sheets and large imposed curvatures. These findings demonstrate the profound impact of geometry on the competition between curvature-induced rigidity and gravity-induced deformation in thin elastic materials.","Experiments To explore the role of shape on curvature-induced rigidity, thin sheets were cut from commercially available Shore 30A silicone rubber of density \rho=$1250\text{\,}\mathrm{k}\mathrm{g}\mathrm{/}\mathrm{m}^{3}$, thickness h=$1.5875\text{\,}\mathrm{mm}$, base width a=$5\text{\,}\mathrm{cm}$, tip widths ranging from b=a (rectangles) to b=0 (triangles), and lengths ranging from L=$3\text{\,}\mathrm{cm}14\text{\,}\mathrm{cm}$. These were then clamped at their base upon rigid arcs of curvature ranging from 1/R=0 to 1\text{\,}{\mathrm{cm}}^{-1}, and left free to deform under gravity until the material was fully relaxed (see Fig. 1). Figure 1: Curvature-induced rigidity appears in nature in such disparate systems as: (a) fish fins [reproduced with permission from Ref. [7]]; (b) tulip leaves; and (c) in the human foot (the transverse and longitudinal arches are shown as solid and dashed curves, respectively). Right: Experimental setup. Silicone sheets of thickness h, length L, base width a, and tip width b were clamped at their base upon rigid arcs of radius R. The signed tip deflection, d, measures the vertical distance between the lowest points of the clamped and free edges. The most apparent measurable quantity is the vertical tip displacement, or deflection, d, defined as the signed vertical distance from the lowest point of the clamped edge to that of the free edge. Figure 2 shows the tip displacement as a function of the relative length, L/a, for rectangular sheets (b/a=1, top panel) and triangular sheets (b/a=0, bottom panel). A range of clamping curvatures were considered. For zero clamping curvature (a/R=0), the tip dropped steadily with increasing sheet length, as expected for a classical cantilever [58, 59]. Increasing the clamping curvature monotonically decreased the tip deflection for all lengths considered. For large clamping curvatures but small sheet lengths, the tip was observed to deflect upwards against gravity (d<0), consistent with previous studies [2]: the tip is elevated to a position closer to the vertical center of mass, which reduces stretching along the sheet edges. Also observed in cases with substantial clamping curvatures (a/R\gtrsim 1), at least for rectangular sheets, were regions of bistability, L_{0}^{*}\leq L\leq L_{1}^{*}, where the sheet has two distinct displacement modes. In these ranges, applying a temporary gentle force could change the configuration from one apparently stable state to the other. Figure 3(a-c) shows photographs of the two modes for clamping curvature R/a=2.5 and length L/a=1.3. The first mode shows a relaxation of the transverse curvature near the base, beyond which the sheet appears flat as it dips downward due to gravity. The second mode exhibits curvature throughout the length, and no significant tip displacement is observed. Distinct regions of curvature-dominated, gravity-dominated, and commensurate deformations in rectangular sheets were studied by Taffetani et al. [2], who also noted anecdotally the presence of bistability. Figure 2: The downward tip deflection d as a function of the ratio of sheet length L to base width a from experimental measurements (symbols) and the results of finite element simulations (curves). Different symbols/colors correspond to different clamped curvatures. Curvature-dominated and gravity-dominated configurations, and bistability, are observed for rectangular sheets (a). Triangular sheets (b) can deflect more or less than rectangular sheets depending on their length, and do not appear to be bistable."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10044v1,Comprehensive creep compliance characterization of orthotropic materials using a cost-effective automated system,"Determining the creep compliances of orthotropic composite materials requires experiments in at least three different uniaxial and biaxial loading directions. Up to date, data respecting multiple climates and all anatomical directions are sparse for hygro-responsive materials like Norway spruce. Consequently, simulation models of wood frequently over-simplify creep, e.g., by proportionally scaling missing components or neglecting climatic influences. To overcome such simplifications, an automated computer-controlled climatized creep rack was developed, that experimentally assesses moisture-dependent viscoelasticity and mechanosorption in all anatomical directions. The device simultaneously measures the creep strains of three dogbone tension samples, three flat compression samples, and six Arcan shear samples via Digital Image Correlation. This allows for ascertaining the complete orthotropic compliance tensors while accounting for loading direction asymmetries. This paper explains the creep rack's structure and demonstrates its use by determining all nine independent creep compliance components of Norway spruce at 65% relative humidity. The data shows that loading asymmetry effects amount up to 16%. Furthermore, the found creep compliance tensor is not proportional to the elastic compliance tensor. By clustering the compliance components, we identify four necessary components to represent the full orthotropy of the compliance tensor, obtainable from not less than two experiments.","Predicting the rheological behavior of a wood species necessitates accurate simulation models founded on comprehensible experimental data. This data usually depends on the moisture content, anatomical direction, and loading direction (Niemz et al., 2023; Kollmann and Cote, 1968). While elasticity and plasticity are well-researched (e.g., Neuhaus, 1981; Schmidt and Kaliske, 2006; Hering et al., 2012), knowledge for moisture-dependent viscoelastic and mechanosorptive creep is sparse. Many publications investigated distinct creep properties, but rarely all nine independent components of the creep compliance tensor. Gressel (1983) and Tong et al. (2020) review studies on viscoelastic creep data in distinct anatomical directions. These studies provide creep data for tension or compression parallel and perpendicular to the grain, bending, and torsion. Further studies, like Schniewind and Barrett (1972), Hayashi et al. (1993), Taniguchi et al. (2010), and Jiang et al. (2016), investigate the relationships of axial to lateral strains. They conclude that Poisson's ratios are not constant during creep, but their observations do not consistently show whether they increase or decrease over time. Hilton (2001) argues from mechanical considerations that Poisson's ratios must not be constant. Yet, he recommends directly describing creep by the axial and transverse compliances because small errors in Poisson's ratios could lead to severe distortion of the creep compliance matrix. The studies of Schniewind and Barrett (1972), Cariou (1987), Taniguchi et al. (2010), and Ozyhar et al. (2013) determine the relative axial creep for multiple anatomical directions. They indicate more pronounced creep in the tangential and radial directions compared to the longitudinal direction. Moreover, comparative experiments (Gressel, 1983; Ozyhar et al., 2013) show that compression samples creep more than tensile samples. The loading degree additionally influences the creep response. The threshold for linear creep ranges from 30% to 84%, depending on the literature source, moisture content, and anatomical direction (Schniewind, 1968; Gressel, 1983; Liu, 1993; Morlier, 1994). Numerous studies also investigated shear creep. Schniewind and Barrett (1972) utilized plate shear tests, while Hayashi et al. (1993), Bengtsson et al. (2023), Ando et al. (2023), and Shimazaki and Ando (2024) employed off-axis tests. While off-axis tests have been valuable in various contexts, they have inherent limitations because they do not yield a uniform shear and normal stress state (Ho et al., 1993; Pierron and Vautrin, 1996; Xavier et al., 2004). Akter et al. (2023) determined the rolling shear in one shear plane for five different relative humidities. The mentioned publications show that creep depends on the anatomical direction, loading type, moisture content, and loading degree. However, the data obtained from these studies is inconsistent. They mostly originate from one climate, different species, different loading cases, or limited anatomical directions. Furthermore, most studies' experimental runtime was below 24 hours, thus neglecting long-term effects. Except for Cariou (1987), who investigated Maritime pine, studies determining all nine creep compliance components are rare. For mechanosorptive creep, the data is similarly fragmented, and similar effects can be observed (Ranta-Maunus, 1975; Toratti, 1992; Toratti and Svensson, 2000; Huč et al., 2018; Niemz et al., 2023). The incomplete data forces developers of computational simulation models to scale available compliances between anatomical directions, trees, humidities, and wood species (Hanhijärvi and Mackenzie-Helnwein, 2003; Fortino et al., 2009; Hassani et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2022). The scaling ultimately leads to severe inaccuracies in model responses. Experimental parameters for every component of the moisture-dependent viscoelastic and mechanosorptive creep compliance tensor could resolve such inaccuracies – if the parameters originate from one tree of one species. However, such a task is challenging for experimental scientists. It requires repeated time-intensive experiments in at least three uniaxial and shear directions for various climates, ideally respecting asymmetries between compression and tension and the different shear planes. We developed a fully automatized creep rack to reduce the time expenditure of such an experimental campaign. The rack measures moisture-dependent creep deformations of three compression, three tension, and six shear samples in parallel. It includes a climate chamber, allowing for recording viscoelastic and mechanosorptive creep strains under controlled humidity conditions. This setup enables the direct determination of each component of the creep compliance tensor from one set of experimental data. Compared to commercial systems, e.g., the Zwick Kappa-Multistation (ZwickRoell, 2023), our system features lower costs (< 13.000Ėuro material costs), a higher number of testing axes, high adaptability of the components, more flexibility in the arrangement of sample shapes, and an optimization on wood testing. In this paper, we describe the automatized creep rack and its sample design. The paper contains structural details for load application, climate control, and strain recording. As an application study of the creep rack, we determine Norway spruce's axial, lateral, and shear creep strains to assemble the full viscoelastic creep tensor at 65% relative humidity (RH). The study additionally analyzes asymmetries and proportionalities between the individual creep compliance components. By clustering these components into coincident groups, we can recommend the minimum number of experiments required to represent sufficiently the orthotropic relations in the creep compliance tensor."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09665v1,"Inter-Species Interactions in Dual, Fibrous Gel Enable Control
of Gel
Structure and Rheology","Natural and synthetic multi-component gels display emergent properties, which implies that they are more than just the sum of their components. This warrants the investigation of the role played by inter-species interactions in shaping gel architecture and rheology. Here, using computer simulations, we investigate the effect of changing the strength of the interaction between two species forming a fibrous double network. Simply changing the strength of inter-species lateral association, we generate two types of gels: one in which the two components demix, and another one in which the two species wrap around each other. We show that demixed gels have structure and rheology that are largely unaffected by the strength of attraction between the components. In contrast, architecture and material properties of intertwined gels strongly depend on inter-species “stickiness” and volume exclusion. These results can be used as the basis of a design principle for double networks which are made to emphasize either stability to perturbations or responsiveness to stimuli. Similar ideas could be used to interpret naturally occurring multi-component gels.","Results In our model systems, each of the two components occupies the same volume fraction \phi\approx 0.05. The intra-species interactions are identical, and are given by a two-body radially symmetric term that enforces volume exclusion via a repulsion term that dominates at short distances, and a short-ranged attractive term that drives self-assembly. While the effect of this kind of interaction on bicontinuous assembly of multi-component gels has already been explored in previous computational studies [27, 37], we include in our model a second term that allows us instead to account for more complex interactions, such as those controlled by functional surface groups and surface heterogeneities in nanoparticle systems [38]. This strategy allows us to focus on self-assembled gels with fibrous structures, as many gels, especially in the biological context, are made of spanning and fibrillar structures. This second term in the energy function is modeled as a solely repulsive three-body term which favors the formation of filamentous structures that get connected into a spanning network even at low particle volume fractions [39, 40, 38]. This approach has been shown to lead to network structures that well recapitulate behaviors typical of a broad range of single-network colloidal gels, or composites made of a spanning network and small aggregates, in terms of their structural, dynamical, mechanical, and rheological characteristics [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]. Here, we use it to explore instead the self-assembly of two identical network-forming colloidal species into a range of different dual morphologies, depending on their inter-species interactions. The strength of the inter-species interaction is given in terms of two parameters, \chi_{2} and \chi_{3} for two-body and three-body interactions respectively (see Eq. 1 and Eq. 2), whose meaning is pictorially described in Fig. 1. The parameter \chi_{2} controls the strength of inter-species two-body attraction. Drawing a connection with mean-field theories of phase separation (i.e. Bragg-Williams or Flory-Huggins [48]), \chi_{2} corresponds to half of the relative change in energy of the system when a pair of intra-species bonds is broken and replaced by two inter-species bonds. If \chi_{2}=0, there is no difference between inter- or intra-species pairwise attraction (see Fig. 1). A positive value of \chi_{2} means that inter-species bonds are less stable than intra-species ones, and hence creating them costs some energy. The \chi_{2} parameter is normalized so that if there is no inter-species interaction at all then \chi_{2}=1. In other words, 1-\chi_{2} is a measure of inter-species stickiness, which is absent for \chi_{2}=1 and maximum (i.e. equivalent to intra-species interaction strength) if \chi_{2}=0. It should be noted that increasing \chi_{2} also slightly reduces volume exclusion (see Fig. S1). The parameter \chi_{3}, instead, which is again obtained using a three-body repulsive term (see Methods), quantifies the tendency of fibrils of different species to laterally associate and bundle (see Fig. 1). When \chi_{3}=0, fibrils of different species cannot bundle, whereas a decrease in \chi_{3} indicates a decrease in the repulsion that prevents lateral association of fibrils of different species, and for \chi_{3}=-1 there is no penalty for bundling. In the following, we focus on: (i) networks generated for 0\leq\chi_{2}<1 at \chi_{3}=0, in which the two-body inter-species attraction is varied while the lateral association of the fibers of different species is disfavored, and (ii) gels made with \chi_{3}=-1 and 0\leq\chi_{2}<1, in which instead the fibers of distinct species can lay side-by-side or wrap around each other owing to an attractive energy regulated by \chi_{2}. As we show, the first energy function (i) gives rise to double networks in which the two components occupy distinct compartments, and therefore we term these “demixed networks”. The second energy function (ii) produces gels in which there are instances of fibers of the two components wrapped around each other, and thus we define them “intertwined networks”. Besides presenting different morphologies, demixed and intertwined gels display a strikingly different dependence on \chi_{2} of their response to mechanical perturbation and to changes in the parameters of inter-species interactions after the gel is set. Figure 3: Rheology of demixing gels (\chi_{3}=0). (a-b) Linear oscillatory rheology. Panel (a) displays the elastic moduli, the loss moduli are shown in panel (b). In both panels, data are shown as empty symbols of different shapes and colors representing different \chi_{2} values (see legend where the values are rounded to the second significant digits, the exact values are 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 0.875, 0.9375, and 0.96875). For clarity, we show only a subset of data points. The dashed lines show the fit of the low-frequency domain of the spectrum to G_{0}+K\omega^{\alpha}, where G_{0}, K, and \alpha are fitting parameters. (c) Elastic modulus obtained from the fit in panel (a) as a function of \chi_{2}. (d) Non-linear rheology, start-up shear. The colors and symbols indicate the value of \chi_{2} and are reported in the legend in panel (a). (e) Yield strain (black circles, left axis) and stress (red squares, right axes) as a function of \chi_{2}, obtained from the maximum of the load curves. (f) Toughness of the gel, \Theta, defined as the integral of the stress as a function of strain up to the yielding point. (g) Load curve after perturbation of the inter-species interaction parameters. The reference is always \chi_{2}\approx 0.97 and \chi_{3}=0, the new parameters are shown in the legend after an arrow. (h) Change in the load curve after the perturbation. The value of \delta indicates the change in the load curve between before and after the perturbation, relative to the unperturbed load curve. Changes in \chi_{3} are shown in the x-axis, the legend indicates changes in \chi_{2}. Demixed Networks: \chi_{3}=0 Structure of the Network: Figures 2a-b display structures produced in our simulations using various values of \chi_{2}. In the nearly two-dimensional slices of the three-dimensional (3D) system (Fig. 2a) as well as in the 3D snapshot (Fig. 2b), one species is shown in red and the other one in blue. In the first slice of Fig. 2a both \chi_{2}=0 and \chi_{3}=0, therefore the distinction between the two species is only formal, all the particles are identical, and thus the gel is a single-network of volume fraction \phi\approx 0.10 with red and blue particles completely interspersed. Instead, it is clear that increasing \chi_{2} in Figs. 2a leads to the partial compartmentalization of the two components. The first question to ask is: are these double networks, in which each component has independently percolated, or is this a two-component single-network, where only the whole system is spanning? For \chi_{2}<0.2, only the cluster made by both species is space-spanning, and thus we consider such systems as single networks; instead, for \chi_{2}\geq 0.2 each species percolates on its own, giving rise to a double network. Second, we wish to quantify the visual observation that the two networks are compartmentalized. In order to do so, we compute the demixing order parameter for a N-particle system, \Psi, which monitors the spatial fluctuations of particle number density from the average computed in 10^{3} cubic subdivisions of the simulation box (see Supporting Information). For a homogeneous system \Psi\approx 0, whereas if only half of the cells are populated \Psi\approx 1. Figure 2c shows the demixing parameter as a function of \chi_{2} computed either accounting for all colloidal units regardless of the species (black circles) and for one species at a time (red squares). When all colloidal units are considered, \Psi is small and nearly completely independent of \chi_{2}. This suggests that globally the volume is spanned uniformly by demixed fibril-forming networks, regardless of inter-species “stickiness” (1-\chi_{2}). Similarly, Fig. 2d shows that the average pore size between all colloidal particles is nearly independent on \chi_{2}. Focusing on one of the two species at a time, both the demixing order parameter (Fig. 2c, red squares) and the average pore size (Fig. 2d, red squares) increase with \chi_{2}, suggesting the increase in spatial segregation between the two species which saturates for \chi_{2}\geq 0.5. This suggests that the inter-species interactions become negligible as \chi_{2} increases. Indeed, while the total number of contacts (Fig. 2e, black circles) and the intra-species contacts (red squares) are nearly independent on the strength of inter-species “stickiness” (1-\chi_{2}), the number of inter-species contacts at \chi_{2}=0.5 is three orders of magnitude lower than it is for \chi_{2}=0, and for \chi_{2}>0.5 the two components are completely segregated. Overall, Fig. 2e suggests that the saturation of demixing and average pore size correlate with the disappearance of inter-species contacts. Linear Oscillatory Rheology: Using the Optimally Windowed Chirp (OWCh) method [49, 50], we extracted the storage (G^{\prime}) and loss (G^{\prime\prime}) moduli for all of the networks (see Fig. 3a,b, Fig. S2a,b, and details in the SI). While the loss moduli are nearly independent on the strength of two-body interactions, the storage moduli at low frequency suggest that the shear modulus [G_{0}=G^{\prime}(\omega=0)] depends on \chi_{2}. To extract G_{0}, we fit the low-frequency region of the storage modulus to G_{0}+K\omega^{\alpha}, where the exponent \alpha is also a parameter of the fit (this equation is the low-frequency limit of the expression provided by Bouzid et al [50]). The shear modulus saturates for \chi_{2}\gtrapprox 0.3 (Fig. 3c), suggesting that weakening the inter-species interactions below a threshold has little to no impact on the linear rheology of the gel. Figure 4: Structure of intertwined gels (\chi_{3}=-1). (a) Sections of the gels of thickness 5d. Particles (spheres) and bonds (for pairs within 1.1d from each other, close to the minimum of the pairwise potential) are shown in blue or red to identify the two species. Going from left to right (see arrow) the \chi_{2} parameter for each slice is 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 0.875. (b) Three-dimensional representation of the gel obtained using \chi_{2}=31/32\approx 0.97. (c) Demixing order parameter for all colloidal units (black circles) or for one components at the time (red squares). (d) Average pore size in the network – colors and symbols are the same as in panel (e). (e) Number of contacts (distance <1.5d, after which the pairwise potential is effectively negligible) between all units (black circles), between units of the same species (red squares), and between units of different species (blue diamonds) Start-Up Shear: Figure 3d shows the calculation of the load curves for all the gels belonging to the demixing class (\chi_{3}=0). The stress is calculated using a start-up shear protocol [41] (see SI for details). The curves display a common shape and display robust strain stiffening with onset depending on the strength of the two-body interaction up to \chi_{2}\approx 0.5, after which the load curves become independent on \chi_{2} (Fig. 3d). Similarly, the strain and stress at which the network yields, \gamma_{\mathrm{yield}} and \sigma_{\mathrm{yield}}, which we define from the maximum of the load curve (see SI for details), change and then saturate as \chi_{2} grows (Fig. 3e). The toughness, \Theta, defined as the integral of the load curve up to the yield point (\Theta=\int_{0}^{\gamma_{\mathrm{yield}}}d\gamma\sigma, see SI for details), is larger than for a single network (\chi_{2}=0) but essentially constant for 0.5\leq\chi_{2}<1 (Fig. 3f, black circles). Post-Gelation Modifications: Given that the load curve becomes independent of \chi_{2}, we hypothesize that the network should be robust to changes of the parameters even after gelation. To test this conjecture, we perturb a self-assembled multi-component gel through the following procedure: (i) we select some initial parameters \chi_{2} and \chi_{3} and produce a gel as done so far; (ii) we change the strength of inter-species interaction to \chi_{2}^{\prime} and \chi_{3}^{\prime}; (iii) we allow the network to adjust to these new parameters, and (iv) we monitor the load curve of the modified double gel. As a measure of the changes in the load curve, we define \delta as the relative error between the stress computed for the perturbed (\sigma_{\mathrm{pert}}) and un-perturbed (\sigma_{\mathrm{unpert}}) networks averaged over all the strains (\delta=1/N\sum_{i=1}^{N}|\sigma_{\mathrm{pert}}(\gamma_{i})-\sigma_{\mathrm{% unpert}}(\gamma_{i})|/|\sigma_{\mathrm{unpert}}(\gamma_{i})|). As initial parameters we set \chi_{2}\approx 0.97 and \chi_{3}=0. As it is clear from Fig. 3g, there is no significant change in the load curve unless inter-species fibril bundling is allowed (\chi_{3}=-1, \Delta\chi_{3}=-1) and the inter-species attraction is restored to the inter-species value, i.e. \chi_{2}=0 and \Delta\chi_{2}\approx-0.97. The results are summarized and quantified in Fig. 3h, where it is clear that demixed networks display robustness to the strength of inter-species interaction. In sum, gels formed with \chi_{3}=0 give rise to double networks only if attractive inter-species interactions are sufficiently weak (\chi_{2}\geq 0.2). For these double networks (i) morphology, characterized by the demixing order parameter and the average pore size, and (ii) rheology, defined by the elastic modulus, yielding and toughness, are only weakly if at all dependent on the strength of inter-species interaction. Finally, (iii) demixed networks display robustness to post-gelation perturbation of the interactions. Intertwined Networks: \chi_{3}=-1 Structure of the Network: The absence of three-body inter-species repulsion (\chi_{3}=-1) enables bundling between colloidal fibers of different species (see Fig. 1). This is indeed what we observe in our simulations: the structures in Figs. 4a,b show that red and blue units are well interspersed, in striking difference with the structures obtained when \chi_{3}=0. Interestingly, for all the \chi_{2} values considered here the gels are double networks, i.e. each species forms a percolating, spanning network. For \chi_{2}=0 (first slice from the left in Fig. 4a), homogeneous filaments of different species form semi-crystalline, nearly two-dimensional sheets, leaving large holes between the planes. For \chi_{2}=0.5 (second slice from the left in Fig. 4a), the planar arrangement is replaced by intertwined, twisted branches made of units of both components; visually, the architecture leaves plenty of holes between the branches. We note that increasing \chi_{2} locally induces a small decrease of the inter-species excluded volume (Fig. S1), which may affect the local packing but does not explain the general trends. As \chi_{2} increases, pairs of filaments emerge that are less tightly laterally associated, but are still intertwined and at times are wrapped around each other, in an arrangement that fills the space more uniformly (Fig. 4a,b). These observations are substantiated by the demixing order parameter (Fig. 4c) and the average pore size (Fig. 4d) as a function of \chi_{2}. Indeed, if the demixing order parameter and the average pore size decrease as \chi_{2} is increased, then the strength of inter-species interaction controls the porosity of the network, which is nearly the same if one species (red squares) or both species (black circles) are considered, again reinforcing the idea that the two networks are closely intertwined. Furthermore, neither the demixing order parameter nor the average pore size saturate with \chi_{2}. This suggests that even though the inter-species interaction is very weak, the packing and therefore contacts between the two species play an important role in regulating network architecture. To confirm this, we monitor the contacts between colloidal units (Fig. 4e). The reduction of total contacts as \chi_{2} increases (black dots in Fig. 4e) is consistent with the increasingly more homogeneous occupation of space suggested by the demixing order parameter and average pore size. As the number of intra-species contacts remains nearly identical at all \chi_{2} values (red squares in Fig. 4e), these changes are driven by the reduction of inter-species contacts (blue diamonds in Fig. 4e) as the strength of two-body attraction between the two components is decreased. Notably, not only the number of contacts between the two species is still large even at \chi_{2}\approx 0.97, but more importantly it has not yet saturated, which confirms that the network architecture is still sensitive to the attraction strength between the two species even though it is now only about 3\% of the intra-species attraction strength. Linear Oscillatory Rheology The response to linear oscillatory tests performed using the OWCh protocol shows that as the strength of two-body inter-species interaction is reduced, both the storage (Fig. 5a) and loss (Fig. 5b) moduli of the gel decrease, indicating that for these systems \chi_{2} tunes both the elasticity and the energy dissipation. As shown in Fig. 5c, the shear modulus extracted from the fit to the elastic modulus is sensitive to the inter-species attraction at least up to \chi_{2}\approx 0.97. Start-up Shear: As \chi_{2} increases, the stress vs strain curves display qualitatively different behaviors (Fig. 5d). When the inter-species interactions are strong, the curves show no appreciable strain-stiffening before the yielding point is reached. As \chi_{2} increases, so does the onset of strain stiffening. Similarly, while the yield stress remains nearly constant, the yield strain increases with \chi_{2} without showing signs of saturation (Fig. 5e). Accordingly, the double networks becomes tougher as \chi_{2} increases, again showing no sign of saturation up to \chi_{2}\approx 0.97 (Fig. 5f). The gel obtained with \chi_{2}=0.97 is nearly three times tougher than the single gel and about twice as tough as the demixed gels (Fig. 3f). Post-Gelation Modifications: Given the sensitivity of the networks to the inter-species interaction set before gelation, we hypothesizes that changing the parameters after gelation but before rheological tests would have a strong impact on the load curve. Indeed, a small increase of interspecies attraction (reduction of \chi_{2}, so \Delta\chi_{2}<0, see red circles in Fig. 5g) or slight reduction of inter-species bundling propensity (higher \chi_{3}, \Delta\chi_{3}>0, blue squares in Fig. 5f) engenders a noticeable change of the stress-strain curve. As summarized in Fig. 4h, which shows the change between the load curves before and after perturbation relative to the unperturbed stress-strain curve, even small changes of \chi_{2} or \chi_{3} give rise to sizable changes in the load curves, i.e. \delta\approx 1. In sum, gels formed with \chi_{3}=-1 always produce double networks, regardless of \chi_{2}. The inter-species two-body interaction regulates (i) the spatial organization of the two components, (ii) network porosity, (iii) elastic and loss moduli, (iv) the shape of the load curve, and (v) toughness even for large values of \chi_{2}. Moreover, (vi) the gels are sensitive to post-gelation modifications of the inter-species interaction strength. Figure 5: Rheology of the intertwined gels (\chi_{3}=-1).

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09615v1,Noise-driven odd elastic waves in living chiral active matter,"Chiral active matter is predicted to exhibit odd elasticity, with nontraditional elastic response arising from a combination of chirality, being out of equilibrium, and the presence of nonreciprocal interactions. One of the resulting phenomena is the possible occurrence of odd elastic waves in overdamped systems, although its experimental realization still remains elusive. Here we show that in overdamped active systems, noise is required to generate persistent elastic waves. In the chiral crystalline phase of active matter, such as that found recently in populations of swimming starfish embryos, the noise arises from self-driving of active particles and their mutual collisions, a key factor that has been missing in previous studies. We identify the criterion for the occurrence of noise-driven odd elastic waves, and postulate the corresponding phase diagram for the general chiral active crystals. Our results can be used to predict the experimental conditions for achieving a transition to self-sustained elastic waves in overdamped active systems.","References Toner et al. [2005] J. Toner, Y.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09588v1,Tailoring interactions between active nematic defects with reinforcement learning,"Active nematics, formed from a liquid crystalline suspension of active force dipoles, are a paradigmatic active matter system whose study provides insights into how chemical driving produces the cellular mechanical forces essential for life. Recent advances in optogenetic control over molecular motors and cell-signaling pathways now allow experimenters to mimic the spatiotemporal regulation of activity necessary to drive biologically relevant active nematic flows in vivo. However, engineering effective activity protocols remains challenging due to the system’s complex dynamics. Here, we explore a model-free approach for controlling active nematic fields using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we demonstrate how local activity fields can induce interactions between pairs of nematic defects, enabling them to follow designer dynamical laws such as those of overdamped springs with varying stiffnesses. Reinforcement learning bypasses the need for accurate parameterization and model representation of the nematic system, and could thus transfer straightforwardly to experimental implementation. Moreover, the sufficiency of our low-dimensional system observables and actions suggests that coarse projections of the active nematic field can be used for precise feedback control, making the biological implementation of such feedback loops plausible.","To produce physiologically useful forces, the cytoskeletal machinery of cells must be tightly regulated and controlled fletcher2010cell ; banerjee2020actin ; levine2023physics . For example, to execute cell division the cytoskeleton must localize to the midplane of cells and pinch in a highly coordinated event barr2007cytokinesis . During morphogenesis the control of mechanical forces must be coordinated at the tissue level, across many different cells. It has recently been shown that during this process defects in the nematic ordering of cytoskeletal filaments in epithelial cells of developing Hydra are precisely positioned at key global organizing centers, such as the future mouth maroudas2021topological . Related research indicates that the positioning of nematic defects plays a crucial role in organizing the stress and velocity fields of the system, driving large-scale coherent motions of the tissue layer guillamat2022integer ; serra2023defect ; shankar2022topological . Although the control of cytoskeletal machinery is known to involve factors like cell signaling, mechanical interactions with the environment, chemical activation of cytoskeletal proteins, and mechanochemical feedback loops, how these various factors coordinate to produce coherent and functional cytoskeletal forces which sculpt tissue layers remains unclear levine2023physics ; bruckner2024tissue ; mitchell2022visceral . One approach to addressing this question is to map biochemical interactions among known molecular players to identify potential control loops. For example, recent works have shed light on the origins of contractile oscillations during cytokinesis in C. elegans and used mechanochemical feedback loops to explain polarity establishment during morphogenesis werner2024mechanical ; maxian2024minimal . An alternative strategy is to work from the top down: without detailed biochemical knowledge, we can explore control protocols that dynamically adjust downstream cytoskeletal inputs to achieve specific system motions, offering insights to guide the search for underlying molecular mechanisms. This approach has been used in recent work on active nematics by directly controlling spatiotemporally dynamic activity fields \alpha(\mathbf{r},t), viewed as a downstream outcome of unresolved biochemical circuits. Experimental advances in spatiotemporal motor control using light fields provide an additional and practical reason for studying activity fields as externally controlled functions linsmeier2016disordered ; schindler2014engineering ; nakamura2014remote ; zhang2021spatiotemporal ; lemma2023spatio ; chandrasekar2023shining . In simulations, optimal activity field trajectories \alpha(\mathbf{r},t) can be derived using knowledge of the nematohydrodynamic equations of motion to guide nematic and polar defects along desired paths norton2020optimal ; ghosh2024spatiotemporal ; ghosh2024achieving . Other techniques allow targeted modulation of nematic channel flow and design of localized ""topological tweezers"" for precise defect manipulation wagner2022exact ; shankar2024design ; irvine2013dislocation . A key challenge in implementing the above mentioned control methods is their reliance on accurate system models and parameterization. Here, we explore controlling active nematics through a model-free machine learning technique called reinforcement learning (RL) sutton2018reinforcement ; bechhoefer2021control . This approach allows a program to develop a closed-loop control policy for a dynamical system purely through trial and error, without relying on precise model specifications. To our knowledge RL has not yet been applied to control active nematics, although previous studies have used it to control other active matter systems such as active flockers, active crystallization, and branched actin networks falk2021learning ; chennakesavalu2021probing ; chennakesavalu2024adaptive . These studies focus on design tasks that aim to achieve a specific static property of the system, such as target net flocking motion or average crystal size. In contrast, we study control tasks that guide active nematic defects to follow prescribed virtual interactions with one another (see Figure 1) khadka2018active ; bauerle2018self . Our goal is to learn activity field protocols that can effectively override the natural defect dynamics (such as passive Coulomb-like attraction) to impose a user-specified interaction law, a more general design objective termed ‘cyberphysics’ in Ref. 26. Additionally, we constrain the program to learn imperfect, yet efficient, protocols by only allowing it to view a coarse projection of the full nematic field configuration for its feedback control. This approach suggests that techniques for controlling cytoskeletal materials can be effective using simple and approximate feedback loops, which has implications for refining experimental control over active nematics using light-controlled motors. Relatedly, in previous work we demonstrated that dynamic activity fields can be iteratively constructed without RL and without knowledge of the active nematic dynamics using physically motivated yet imperfect local feedback rules floyd2024learning . The sufficiency of these imperfect feedback control techniques can provide insights into the components necessary for mechanochemical feedback loops to regulate cytoskeletal machinery in cells. Figure 1: Schematic overview of the closed-loop control over active nematic defect dynamics enabled by a trained RL policy. One step of the feedback loop is depicted (see Figure 3)."

The free energy entering the Rayleighian corresponds to the Poisson-Boltzmann theory augmented by the charge-regulation mechanism. The dynamical equations obtained by minimizing the Rayleighian include the classical Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations, the Debye-Falkenhagen equation, and their modifications in the presence of charge regulation. By analyzing the steady state, we show that the charge regulation has an important impact on the non-equilibrium macro-ion spatial distribution and their effective charge, deviating significantly from their equilibrium values. Our model, based on Onsager’s variational principle offers a unified approach to the diffusive dynamics of electrolytes containing components that undergo various charge association/dissociation processes.","References [1] Lund, M.; Jönsson, B.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09288v1,Island formation in heteroepitaxial growth,"Island formation in strain–free heteroepitaxial deposition of thin films is analyzed using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of two minimal lattice models and scaling approaches. The transition from layer-by-layer (LBL) to island (ISL) growth is driven by a weaker binding strength of the substrate which, in the kinetic model, is equivalent to an increased diffusivity of particles on the substrate compared to particles on the film. The LBL-ISL transition region is characterized by particle fluxes between layers 1 and 2 significantly exceeding the net flux between them, which sets a quasi-equilibrium condition. Deposition on top of monolayer islands weakly contributes to second layer nucleation, in contrast with the homoepitaxial growth case. A thermodynamic approach for compact islands with one or two layers predicts the minimum size in which the second layer is stable. When this is linked to scaling expressions for submonolayer island deposition, the dependence of the ISL–LBL transition point on the kinetic parameters qualitatively matches the simulation results, with quantitative agreement in some parameter ranges. The transition occurs in the equilibrium regime of partial wetting and the convergence of the transition point upon reducing the deposition rate is very slow and practically unattainable in experiments.","The integration of different nanostructured materials is essential for the fabrication of novel devices for electronics, energy storage, and clean energy production, among others [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. These materials are frequently built as thin solid films whose morphologies must be tailored to fit the desired applications [6, 7, 8]. The required film thicknesses may decrease to a few nanometers, but the coverage requirements of comparably much larger lengths, rapid growth, and temperature control remain. For this reason, the knowledge of the nonequilibrium growth conditions that lead to initial layer–by–layer (LBL) growth (Frank–van der Merwe mode) or to island (ISL) formation (Vollmer–Weber mode) is essential [9]. In the last two decades, this knowledge acquired increasing importance for the improvement of thermal vapor deposition of organic films on amorphous substrates such as \text{SiO}_{x} [10, 11, 12]. For instance, ISL growth is observed in films of \text{C}_{60} [13, 14, 15], but LBL followed by ISL growth (termed Stranski–Krastanov mode [9]) occurs in pentacene (PEN) [16] and diindenoperylene (DIP) [17, 18] films. ISL formation is observed both in homoepitaxial and heteroepitaxial film growth, but its origin may be very different. In homoepitaxial growth the substrate is of the same material as the growing film and usually there is an initial layer–by–layer (LBL) or Frank–van der Merwe growth, followed by roughening or mound formation [19, 20, 21]. This type of roughening is often related to the so–called Ehrlich–Schwöbel (ES) barrier, which is a potential barrier for step–edge (interlayer) diffusion [22, 23]. In heteroepitaxial growth, the substrate may differ from the growing material both in terms of the underlying lattice parameters (a mismatch if substrate and film are crystalline) and in the binding energies (the one–body potential of a flat substrate and a flat film exerted on a film atom/molecule are different). In the former case, the lattice parameters of the growing film may initially fit those of the substrate, but internal or residual stresses are released when thicker films adopt their equilibrium structures [24]. However, this mechanism is expected to be absent if the substrate is amorphous and may be negligible in other systems with weak substrate/film interactions [10, 11, 12, 25]. Thus, the different binding energies of substrate/film and film/film particles must play the main role. In this context, ISL formation is very often pictured as a quasi–equilibrium process where islands are droplets of film material on a partially wetting substrate [19, 26]. For partial wetting, the surface tensions between substrate and vacuum/gas (above the film) and between flat film and vacuum/gas are unequal due to the different binding energies. In this quasi–equilibrium picture, the transition from ISL to LBL growth would correspond to the equilibrium wetting transition for which temperature (experimentally easily accessible) and the binding energy difference (theoretically well suited) are control parameters. Additional complications may arise in the extension to the nonequilibrium conditions of heteroepitaxial deposition. Plentiful theoretical insight into homoepitaxial thin film deposition has has been gained through scaling considerations and rate equation approaches [24, 20, 21, 27], many of them checked and validated by kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations of particle–based models with restricted sets of particle moves between lattice sites [28, 21]. Previous work on ISL formation was concentrated on the second layer nucleation on top of the first layer, in which one of the most important elements is the ES reduced step–edge motion downwards [29, 30, 31, 32]. The interplay with the necessarily corresponding step–edge moves upwards did not play a major role and in many cases was simply neglected in the modeling. Instead, heteroepitaxial growth changes the substrate/film particle binding energies, which will directly influence the step–edge moves upwards from the substrate to the film and which may be a major driving force for ISL formation (independently of ES barriers). The importance of this mechanism was recently demonstrated in KMC simulations that qualitatively describe the initial stages of deposition of CdTe films [33, 34], of several organic films [35, 36], and of silver films [37, 38] on a variety of substrates. However, a conceptual explanation of the LBL–ISL transition is still lacking. This paper addresses that transition in the initial stages of heteroepitaxial growth by a combination of three approaches: (i) KMC simulations of two atomistic models of thin film deposition with negligible ES barriers; (ii) an equilibrium model that accounts for the dominant role of hops from the substrate to the film surface (which is supported by the KMC data); (iii) previous numerical and analytical results on nonequilibrium submonolayer growth [39, 40, 41, 42]. The atomistic models have been recently introduced and some phenomenology of ISL growth has been established [33, 35]. Both models have essentially one additional parameter to characterize the heteroepitaxy when compared to their homoepitaxy counterparts, namely a diffusion coefficient on the substrate [33] or a substrate/film energy [35]. With an appropriate connection between the parameters of these models, they provide similar descriptions of the LBL–ISL transition with transition points (“dynamic wetting” points) that may be far from those of equilibrium wetting. The KMC simulations and scaling arguments for compact island formation show that second–layer atoms mainly originate from step moves from the substrate and not from deposition. This allows us to assume local equilibration of the height of single islands during submonolayer growth in the theoretical approach that predicts when the LBL–ISL transition takes place before those islands merge. The approach is consistent with the simulation data and shows that the equilibrium wetting limit is reached very slowly with increasing diffusion-to-deposition ratio, rationalizing the findings on the dynamic wetting transition."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08988v1,Single-File Diffusion of Active Brownian Particles,"Single-file diffusion (SFD) is a key mechanism underlying transport phenomena in confined physical and biological systems. In a typical SFD process, microscopic particles are restricted to moving in a narrow channel where they cannot pass one another, resulting in constrained motion and anomalous diffusion at long times. In this study, we use Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical theory to investigate the SFD of active Brownian particles (ABPs) – a minimal model of active colloids. Using a combination of scaling relations and heuristic arguments, we derive an accurate analytical expression for a tagged ABP’s mean square displacement (MSD). We find the MSD exhibits ballistic behavior at short times, which can quantitatively be related to the reduced kinetic temperature of the single-file ABP system. We also find that while the characteristic subdiffusive scaling of SFD [\langle(\Delta x)^{2}\rangle\sim t^{1/2}] is preserved at long times, self-propulsion introduces significant modifications to the 1D-mobility, which can be directly related to the constant Péclet (Pe) compressibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized 1D-mobility, initially proposed by Kollmann for equilibrium systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 180602 (2003)], can be extended to active systems with minimal modification. These findings have important implications for tuning particle transport at the microscale and provide a basis for understanding active matter in geometries with highly restricted motion.","For over half a century, single-file diffusion (SFD) has captivated researchers across the physical and biological sciences, finding broad applications in quantifying transport at the microscale [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. In a typical SFD process, microscopic particles are confined to move within a narrow channel where they cannot pass one another (See Fig. 1 for a schematic illustration of SFD). This form of confinement leads to subdiffusive behavior at long times, making SFD one of the simplest examples of anomalous diffusion [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. As a result, SFD provides a fundamental framework for understanding transport in highly confined systems, with far-reaching implications for both theoretical studies and practical applications. Most studies of SFD have focused on equilibrium Brownian particles (i.e., passive particles), where it is nearly universally observed that, at long times, the mean square displacement (MSD) of a tagged particle scales as \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}\langle(\Delta x)^{2}\rangle=2Ft^{1/2}\,, (1) where F is a proportionality constant known as the 1D-mobility. This characteristic subdiffusive scaling of SFD has been thoroughly explored computationally and experimentally in various systems, including colloidal particles in microchannels [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33] and molecular transport in zeolites and carbon nanotubes [34, 35, 36, 37]. In addition to experimental studies, several theoretical approaches have been developed to describe the SFD of passive Brownian systems, including fluctuating hydrodynamics [38, 39, 40], fractional Langevin formalisms [41, 42, 43], and asymptotic methods [44, 45, 46]. We refer the reader to Refs [25, 47, 48, 49], for a more comprehensive discussion on passive SFD. The central theoretical challenge in SFD is to capture the many-body effects that give rise to subdiffusive behavior at long times and to quantitatively predict the 1D mobility. In one of the earliest studies of SFD, Harris [20] derived the fundamental result for the 1D-mobility of passive hard particles F_{HR}=\frac{1-\phi}{\rho}\sqrt{\frac{D}{\pi}}=\lambda\sqrt{\frac{D}{\pi}}\,, (2) where D is the free diffusion coefficient of the particle, \phi=\rho\sigma_{p} is the packing fraction, \sigma_{p} is the particle diameter, and \rho is the particle line density. The mean free path \lambda, which represents the average distance a particle can move before encountering its neighbor, can be calculated analytically for single-file passive hard particles and is given by \lambda=(1-\phi)/\rho [50]. In Harris’s derivation of the 1D-mobility, the mean free path is a fundamental quantity that provides a measure of the confinement experienced by a tagged particle and can be introduced to further simplify Eq. (2). We also find the mean free path plays a similar pivotal role in the SFD of active colloids. More recently, using an asymptotic approach, Kollmann generalized the 1D-mobility for passive particles to systems with arbitrary finite-range interactions [10]. In such systems, the 1D-mobility is expressed as F=\frac{1}{\rho}\sqrt{\frac{D\mathcal{X}}{\pi}}\,, (3) where \mathcal{X} is the reduced isothermal compressibility, defined as the ratio between the compressibility of an interacting system to that of an ideal system. We should note that for more complicated interparticle interactions, the quantity \sqrt{\mathcal{X}}/\rho plays a similar role to the mean free path introduced in Eq. (2). This generalized result has been verified across various systems, including attractive particles, mixtures, and particles with long-ranged interactions [29, 32, 51]. Interestingly, the work of Kollmann and others illustrates a peculiar feature of single-file systems: the 1D-mobility, a single-particle transport property, can be related to a thermodynamic response function of the system (i.e., the isothermal compressibility). Figure 1: Schematic of SF-ABP system. Each purely repulsive active particle moves at a constant speed of U_{a}\cos\theta while undergoing rotational Brownian motion with a reorientation time of \tau_{R}. Much of the prior work on SFD has focused on passive particles, motivating the natural question: how is single-file diffusion altered when particle dynamics deviate from passive Brownian motion? To answer this question, we focus on active colloids capable of self-propulsion at the microscale. Interestingly, this novel class of colloids exhibits persistent directed motion at short times and undergoes diffusive motion at long times. The self-driven nature of active colloids has spurred extensive investigations into their phenomenology and use in potential applications ranging from transport, self-assembly, and fluid mixing at the microscale [52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]. This includes several studies that have explored different aspects of single-file active matter systems [68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76]. However, there has been no systematic attempt to quantify the role of activity in single-file systems and how it influences observables such as the 1D-mobility. Understanding the SFD of active colloids is critical, as many proposed applications operate in environments where such conditions are likely. In this work, we investigate the single-file diffusion (SFD) of active colloids within the context of the active Brownian particle (ABP) model. Here, we analyze the long- and short-time behavior of the mean square displacement (MSD), focusing on how self-propulsion modifies both the ballistic motion at short times and the subdiffusive scaling at long times. Our results demonstrate that Kollmann’s generalized 1D-mobility expression for passive systems [Eq. (3)] can be extended to active systems with minimal modification. This work provides new insights into the behavior of confined active matter informing the design of microfluidic systems and targeted transport technologies, where precise control of particle dynamics is essential. I.1 Model In this study, we consider a periodic single-file active Brownian particle (SF-ABP) model [77], where N purely-repulsive active Brownian disks are confined to move along a narrow channel of length L, as depicted in Fig. 1. The channel is sufficiently narrow to prevent particles from passing one another, enforcing a single-file condition that restricts their motion to one spatial dimension. Each particle experiences a self-propelling force F_{a}=\gamma U_{a}\cos{\theta}, where \theta is the angle between the particle’s orientation vector and the positive x-axis, \gamma is the translational drag coefficient, and U_{a} is the constant self-propelling speed. The orientation of each particle undergoes rotational Brownian motion with a characteristic reorientation time \tau_{R}. The following overdamped equations describe the motion of a tagged particle: v=\dot{x}=U_{a}\cos(\theta)+\gamma^{-1}F_{c}\ , (4a) \dot{\theta}=\xi(t)\ , (4b) where F_{c} represents the interparticle forces, and \xi(t) is the stochastic rotational noise with properties \langle\xi(t)\rangle=0 and {\langle\xi(t)\xi(t^{\prime})\rangle=(2/\tau_{R})\delta(t-t^{\prime})}. For simplicity, we assume translational Brownian motion and hydrodynamic interactions are negligible. The interparticle forces F_{c} are implemented using a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson (WCA) potential, characterized by a potential strength \varepsilon and Lennard-Jones diameter \sigma [78]. We choose the potential strength to be sufficiently large (i.e., \varepsilon/(F_{a}\sigma)=100) to effectively mimic hard-particle behavior endowing particles with an effective hard diameter of \sigma_{p}=2^{1/6}\sigma. For the initial configuration, particles are randomly placed in the channel without overlaps, and the initial angles for the orientation vectors are uniformly distributed. Simulations were performed using HOOMD-blue [79] with N = 1000 particles for a minimum of 1.5\text{\times}{10}^{10} timesteps, and a timestep size \delta t=10^{-5} time units. Figure 2: Brownian dynamics simulation results (points) for the reduced (a) kinetic temperature, (b) pressure, and (c) constant Pe compressibility for different active Péclet numbers. The dashed colored lines in (a)-(c) correspond to the analytical expressions for these various quantities [Eqs. (6)-(8)]. While, the solid line in panels (b) and (c) corresponds to the analytical expression for the reduced pressure and isothermal compressibility for the 1D passive hard particle system (Tonks gas), respectively. The state of the SF-ABP system is characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the packing fraction \phi=\rho\sigma_{p}, where \rho=N/L is the particle line density, and the active Péclet number \text{Pe}=\ell_{0}/\sigma, where \ell_{0}=U_{a}\tau_{R} is the intrinsic run length of a particle. The active Péclet number quantifies the persistence of a particle’s motion relative to its diameter. In the limit \text{Pe}\rightarrow 0, particles undergo nearly Brownian dynamics and we recover the mechanical, structural, and transport properties of the single-file hard particle system often referred to as the Tonks gas [80]. As Pe increases, large dynamic clusters begin to form [74, 81, 82]. A detailed analysis of clustering behavior in the SF-ABP system is provided in Ref. [83, 74, 84, 77]. Interestingly, despite significant clustering, the SF-ABP system does not exhibit a motility-induced phase transition at finite Péclet numbers [85, 74, 81, 86]. Here, we briefly summarize the concepts of kinetic temperature, pressure, and compressibility for the SF-ABP system, which are essential quantities for characterizing the MSD of a tagged particle [77]. The reduced kinetic temperature \mathcal{T}_{k}=2\langle v^{2}\rangle/U_{a}^{2}, which represents the ratio of the mean square velocity in the interacting system to that of an ideal SF-ABP system, is expressed as: \mathcal{T}_{k}=1-\frac{2\langle F_{c}^{2}\rangle}{(\gamma U_{a})^{2}}\,, (5) where \mathcal{T}_{k} quantifies the reduction in the mean square velocity due to interparticle collisions. In Fig. 2(a), we show simulation results (points) for the reduced kinetic temperature of the SF-ABP system. As \phi\rightarrow 0, \mathcal{T}_{k}\rightarrow 1, and as \phi\rightarrow 1, \mathcal{T}_{k}\rightarrow 0. Using scaling arguments based on collision timescales, we previously derived the following accurate expression for the reduced kinetic temperature [dashed lines in Fig. 2(a)]: \mathcal{T}_{k}=\frac{1}{9b^{2}}\left[2\cos\left(\frac{1}{3}\arccos\left(\frac% {27}{2}b^{2}-1\right)\right)-1\right]^{2}\ , (6) where b=\alpha\text{Pe}\phi/(1-\phi) and \alpha=c/(1+\text{Pe})^{d} with c=1.1 and d=0.05. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the reduced kinetic temperature is equivalent to the reduced swim pressure, \mathcal{T}_{k}=P_{s}/P_{0}, and derived an analytical expression for the reduced total pressure of the SF-ABP system: \mathcal{P}=\frac{P}{P_{0}}=\mathcal{T}_{k}\left[\frac{1}{1-\phi}\,\right]\ , (7) where P_{0}=\rho\gamma U_{a}^{2}/2 is the ideal gas pressure. In the limit of small Pe, \mathcal{T}_{k}\rightarrow 1 and Eq. (7) reduces to the well-known equilibrium result for the Tonks gas \mathcal{P}=1/(1-\phi) [80]. Fig. 2(b) shows a comparison between the reduced pressure for the SF-ABP system and Eq. (7). The reduced constant Péclet compressibility, \mathcal{X}, [plotted in Fig. 2(c)] serves as a thermodynamic-like response function, analogous to the reduced isothermal compressibility in passive systems [87, 77]. This response function measures clustering and local density fluctuations, and as we show, is an important quantity in characterizing the MSD of a tagged particle. It can be calculated directly from Eq. (7), yielding \mathcal{X}=\frac{\chi_{a}}{\chi_{0}}=\left[\frac{\mathcal{T}_{k}}{(1-\phi)^{2% }}+\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{T}_{k}}{\partial\phi}\right% )\right]^{-1}, (8) where \chi_{a}=(\partial\ln\rho/\partial P)_{\text{Pe}} and \chi_{0}=1/P_{0} are the compressibilities of the interacting and ideal systems, respectively. As \text{Pe}\rightarrow 0, the SF-ABP system recovers the passive result, \mathcal{X}=(1-\phi)^{2}, and as \phi\rightarrow 0, \mathcal{X}\rightarrow 1. Figure 3: (a) Mean square displacement (MSD) of a tagged particle in the SF-ABP system. (b) The state diagram for the SF-ABP system, with data points corresponding to the MSD curves in (a). The black line represents the condition \ell_{0}/\lambda_{ABP}=1, separating two different dynamical regimes as discussed in the text. (c) Simulation results for the 1D-mobility across different values of Pe and \phi. The solid black line represents the analytical result for the 1D-mobility of passive hard particles [Eq. (2)]. (d) Normalized velocity autocorrelation function for the representative values of Pe and \phi. The solid black line represents the analytical result for ideal ABPs. The inset shows the power-law decay of the normalized velocity autocorrelation function, demonstrating the characteristic -t^{-3/2} behavior. Before presenting the results of this study, we briefly review the mean square displacement (MSD) of an ideal suspension of SF-ABPs. A useful form of the MSD is \langle(\Delta x)^{2}\rangle=2\langle v^{2}\rangle t\left[\int_{0}^{t}\left(1-% \frac{\tau}{t}\right)\mathcal{V}(\tau)d\tau\right]\,, (9) where \mathcal{V}(\tau)=\langle v(0)v(\tau)\rangle/\langle v^{2}\rangle is the normalized velocity autocorrelation function and \langle v^{2}\rangle is the mean square velocity of the particle [88]. In the ideal SF-ABP system, where there are no interparticle forces (F_{c}=0), it is straightforward to show that \langle v^{2}\rangle=\frac{1}{2}U_{a}^{2} and \mathcal{V}(\tau)=e^{-\tau/\tau_{R}}. Substituting these two expressions into Eq. (9), we obtain the well-known result for ideal ABPs [89]: \langle(\Delta x)^{2}\rangle=2D_{0}\left[t+\tau_{R}\left(e^{-t/\tau_{R}}-1% \right)\right], (10) where D_{0}=\frac{1}{2}U_{a}^{2}\tau_{R} is the free diffusion coefficient of an ABP. The MSD of an ideal ABP exhibits two distinct scaling regimes. At short times, the motion is ballistic, scaling as \langle(\Delta x)^{2}\rangle\sim\frac{1}{2}U_{a}^{2}t^{2}. At long times, the motion becomes diffusive, scaling as \langle(\Delta x)^{2}\rangle\sim 2D_{0}t. The crossover between the ballistic and diffusive regimes occurs around t\approx\tau_{R}, corresponding to the timescale over which the particle’s orientation undergoes significant reorientation due to rotational diffusion."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09631v1,NEP-MB-pol: A unified machine-learned framework for fast and accurate prediction of water’s thermodynamic and transport properties,"Water’s unique hydrogen-bonding network and anomalous properties present significant challenges for accurately modeling its structural, thermodynamic, and transport behavior across varied conditions. Although machine-learned potentials have advanced the prediction of individual properties, a unified computational framework capable of simultaneously capturing water’s complex and subtle properties with high accuracy has remained elusive. Here, we address this challenge by introducing NEP-MB-pol, a highly accurate and efficient neuroevolution potential trained on extensive MB-pol reference data with coupled-cluster-level accuracy, combined with path-integral molecular dynamics and quantum-correction techniques to incorporate nuclear quantum effects. This NEP-MB-pol framework reproduces experimentally measured structural, thermodynamic, and transport properties of water across a broad temperature range, achieving simultaneous, fast, and accurate prediction of self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Our approach provides a unified and robust tool for exploring thermodynamic and transport properties of water under diverse conditions, with significant potential for broader applications across research fields.","I Methods The NEP model. In the NEP approach, the site energy U_{i} of atom i can be written as U_{i}=\sum_{\mu=1}^{N_{\mathrm{neu}}}w^{(1)}_{\mu}\tanh\left(\sum_{\nu=1}^{N_{% \mathrm{des}}}w^{(0)}_{\mu\nu}q^{i}_{\nu}-b^{(0)}_{\mu}\right)-b^{(1)}, (1) where \tanh(x) is the activation function, \mathbf{w}^{(0)}, \mathbf{w}^{(1)}, \mathbf{b}^{(0)}, and b^{(1)} are the weight and bias parameters. The descriptor q_{i}^{\nu} is an abstract vector whose components group into radial and angular parts. The radial descriptor components q_{n}^{i} (0\leq{n}\leq n_{\rm max}^{\rm R}) are defined as q_{n}^{i}=\sum_{j\neq{i}}g_{n}(r_{ij}), (2) where r_{ij} is the distance between atoms i and j and g_{n}(r_{ij}) are a set of radial functions, each of which is formed by a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials. The angular components include n-body (n=3,4,5) correlations. For the 3-body part, the descriptor components are defined as (0\leq{n}\leq n_{\rm max}^{\rm A}, 1\leq{l}\leq l_{\rm max}^{\rm 3body}) q_{nl}^{i}=\sum_{m}(-1)^{m}A_{nlm}^{i}A_{nl(-m)}^{i}; (3) A_{nlm}^{i}=\sum_{j\neq i}g_{n}(r_{ij})Y_{lm}(\hat{\bm{r}}_{ij}). (4) Here, Y_{lm} are the spherical harmonics and \hat{\bm{r}}_{ij} is the unit vector of \bm{r}_{ij}. Note that the radial functions g_{n}(r_{ij}) for the radial and angular descriptor components can have different cutoff radii, which are denoted as r_{\rm c}^{\rm R} and r_{\rm c}^{\rm A}, respectively. These and other hyperparameters used in our NEP-MB-pol and NEP-SCAN models are presented in Supplementary Notes 1. Density-functional theory. The SCAN dataset is generated using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP, version 6.3.0)[68] to calculate energy, force, and virial. The SCAN energy functional is employed to model the exchange-correlation energy. To account for the non-spherical contributions to the gradient correction within the PAW sphere, the flag LASPH is set to TRUE. A kinetic energy cutoff of 1500 eV is applied for the plane waves, with a reciprocal space sampling grid spacing of 0.5 Å-1. The self-consistent field (SCF) iterations are considered converged when the difference in total energy and band structure is below 10-6 eV. Molecular dynamics. For all the MD simulations for computing the physical properties presented in the main text, the simulation system is a periodic cubic box with 24\,567 atoms, which has a dimension of about 6.2 nm in each direction. The time step for integration is set to 0.5 fs for both classical and path-integral MD simulations. To calculate the density of water at each temperature, the system is equilibrated for 50 ps in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. The pressure of the system is set to 1 bar, and the temperature is varied from 280 K to 370 K with an interval of 10 K. Isobaric heat capacity. The isobaric heat capacity Cp is defined as the rate of change of enthalpy H with respect to temperature under constant pressure conditions: C_{p}=(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T})_{P} (5) where, H=U+PV, and U,T,P,V represent the internal energy, temperature, pressure, and volume, respectively. Substituting this expression into the above formula, we obtain the following convenient relation for calculating isobaric heat capacity in molecular dynamics simulations C_{p}=\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}+P\frac{\partial V}{\partial T} (6) To compute Cp, the value of H is calculated at a series of temperature points with the same pressure P. A quadratic function is then fitted to the relationship between H and T, and its first derivative provides the Cp as a function of T. Self-diffusion coefficient. The running SDC for water is calculated using the following Green-Kubo relation: D(t)=\frac{1}{3}\int_{\tau=0}^{t}C_{vv}(\tau)\rm{d}\tau (7) where the velocity auto-correlation function is defined as C_{vv}(\tau)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^{N}\langle\mathbf{v}_{i}(0)\cdot\mathbf{v}_{i% }(\tau)\rangle.. Here, N is the number of atoms in the systems, and \mathbf{v}_{i} is the velocity of atom i. Shear viscosity. The shear viscosity is defined as \eta=\frac{1}{3}\left(\eta_{xy}+\eta_{xz}+\eta_{yz}\right), where the running integral of \eta_{\alpha\beta} is calculated using the following Green-Kubo relation: \eta_{\alpha\beta}(t)=\frac{V}{k_{\rm B}T}\int_{0}^{t}C_{PP}(\tau)\rm{d}\tau. (8) Here, C_{PP}(\tau)=\langle(P_{\alpha\beta}(0)-\langle P_{\alpha\beta}\rangle)(P_{% \alpha\beta}(\tau)-\langle P_{\alpha\beta}\rangle)\rangle is the pressure auto-correlation function, V is the volume, k_{\rm B} is Boltzmann’s constant, T is temperature, and P_{\alpha\beta} is the pressure tensor. Thermal conductivity. Similarly, we can use a Green–Kubo relation to calculate thermal conductivity: \kappa(t)=\frac{1}{k_{\rm B}T^{2}V}\int_{0}^{t}dt^{\prime}\langle\mathbf{J}(t^% {\prime})\cdot\mathbf{J}(0)\rangle, (9) where \mathbf{J}(t) is the heat current and \langle\mathbf{J}(t^{\prime})\cdot\mathbf{J}(0)\rangle is the heat current auto-correlation function. For liquid system, the heat current has two contributions, \mathbf{J}=\mathbf{J}^{\rm k}+\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}. The kinetic term is \mathbf{J}^{\rm k}=\sum_{i}{\mathbf{v}_{i}E_{i}}, where, E_{i} and \mathbf{v}_{i} are the total energy and velocity of atom i, respectively. The potential term for many-body potentials is [69] \mathbf{J}^{\rm p}=\sum_{i}\mathbf{W}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{v}_{i}, where \mathbf{W}_{i}=\sum_{j\neq i}\mathbf{r}_{ij}\otimes\frac{\partial U_{j}}{% \partial\mathbf{r}_{ji}} is the virial tensor of aotm i and \mathbf{r}_{ij}=\mathbf{r}_{j}-\mathbf{r}_{i}, \mathbf{r}_{i} being thee position of atom i. According to the decomposition of the heat current, the thermal conductivity can be decomposed into three terms: \kappa(t)=\kappa^{\rm pp}(t)+\kappa^{\rm kk}(t)+\kappa^{\rm pk}(t), where the potential-potential term \kappa^{\rm pp}, the kinetic-kinetic term \kappa^{\rm kk}, and the cross term \kappa^{\rm pk} correspond to the following heat current auto-correlation functions: \langle\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}(t)\cdot\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}(0)\rangle, \langle\mathbf{J}^{\rm k}(t)\cdot\mathbf{J}^{\rm k}(0)\rangle, and \langle\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}(t)\cdot\mathbf{J}^{\rm k}(0)\rangle+\langle\mathbf{J% }^{\rm k}(t)\cdot\mathbf{J}^{\rm p}(0)\rangle. Besides, we use the homogeneous nonequilibrium MD method [64] to calculate the thermal conductivity of water. In this method, an external driving force \mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{ext}}=E_{i}\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{e}}+\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm% {e}}\cdot\mathbf{W}_{i} is exerted on each atom i, driving the system out of equilibrium. Here, \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{e}} is the driving force parameter with the dimension of inverse length. In this work, the magnitude of F_{\mathrm{e}} was chosen as 0.001 Å-1, which has been tested to be small enough to keep the system within the linear response regime. The driving force will induce an ensemble-averaged steady-state non-equilibrium heat current \mathbf{J}, which is related to the thermal conductivity tensor \kappa^{\alpha\beta}: \frac{\left\langle J^{\alpha}\right\rangle}{TV}=\sum_{\beta}\kappa^{\alpha% \beta}F_{\mathrm{e}}^{\beta}.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09563v1,Numerical prediction of the steady-state distribution under stochastic resetting from measurements,"A common and effective method for calculating the steady-state distribution of a process under stochastic resetting is the renewal approach that requires only the knowledge of the reset-free propagator of the underlying process and the resetting time distribution. The renewal approach is widely used for simple model systems such as a freely diffusing particle with exponentially distributed resetting times. However, in many real-world physical systems, the propagator, the resetting time distribution, or both are not always known beforehand. In this study, we develop a numerical renewal method to determine the steady-state probability distribution of particle positions based on the measured system propagator in the absence of resetting combined with the known or measured resetting time distribution. We apply and validate our method in two distinct systems: one involving interacting particles and the other featuring strong environmental memory. Thus, the renewal approach can be used to predict the steady state under stochastic resetting of any system, provided that the free propagator can be measured and that it undergoes complete resetting.","Stochastic resetting (SR) refers to the abrupt random interruption of a dynamical process, followed by its immediate re-initiation [1, 2]. Repeated resettings of a diffusive process drive it to a nontrivial, out-of-equilibrium, steady state, which is characterized by a stationary density profile [1, 2, 3]. Stochastic resetting has been widely applied to model various physical and natural phenomena [2, 4, 5], including the height distribution of fluctuating interfaces [6, 7] and the thermodynamics governing cell division [8]. When resetting occurs at a constant rate with exponentially distributed times, the resulting steady-state density exhibits a Laplacian form determined by the ratio of the resetting rate to the diffusion coefficient [1]. The shape of the steady state position distributions depends on the resetting time distribution [9], on the resetting protocol, e.g. partial resetting, where resetting is done only part of the way to the origin [10, 11, 12, 13], and on the underlying process, e.g. processes with memory or ballistic motion [14, 15]. One method commonly used to calculate the steady-state position distribution function (PDF) under resetting is solving the renewal equation [1], \rho(x|x_{0})=r\int_{0}^{\infty}\Psi(t)C(x,t|x_{0})dt. (1) Here, x_{0} is the initial position, \Psi(t)=\int_{t}^{\infty}p(t)dt is the probability of a process to survive without resetting until time t, under a resetting time distribution p(t) with a constant mean resetting rate r, and C(x,t|x_{0}) is the conditional reset-free propagator which satisfies the initial condition C(x,t=0)=\delta(x-x_{0}). For example, the propagator of a Brownian particle is given by, C(x,t|x_{0})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi Dt}}e^{-\frac{(x-x_{0})^{2}}{4Dt}}. (2) where D is the diffusion coefficient. Under stochastic resetting, with instantaneous returns and exponentially distributed resetting times we obtain for t\geq 0, \rho(x|x_{0})=\sqrt{\frac{r}{4D}}e^{(-\sqrt{\frac{r}{D}}|x-x_{0}|)}, (3) where r is the mean resetting rate [1]. Importantly, the renewal equation indicates that the steady-state distribution of the system can be determined solely from the reset-free propagator and the resetting time distribution without the need for direct measurement. This has significant ramifications for the design of resetting protocols and for the analysis of systems in which the resetting appears naturally. Specifically, in applications such as accelerating state-to-state transitions [16] and search processes [2], the efficiency depends on the resetting rate [17]. Having the ability to evaluate the steady-state distribution at any resetting rate, based only on the knowledge of the free propagator, is highly desirable and is expected to reduce the characterization time significantly. However, in realistic and complex systems, the free propagator and the resetting time distributions are not always known in advance. For example, in many-body interacting systems, the free propagator is not readily calculated. The resetting time distribution in natural processes may be governed by the internal properties of the systems and can not be prescribed externally or known a-priory. In this paper, we tackle this issue by developing a numerical approach to solve the renewal equation based on measurements. Specifically, we measure the free propagator and, if needed, the resetting time distribution in cases where either the free propagator, the resetting time distribution, or both are unknown. We first validate our method by applying it to a single diffusing colloidal particle for which analytical results are known (Eq. 2 and Eq 3). We then apply our method to two different experimental systems. The first is a many-body system consisting of six colloidal particles undergoing stochastic resetting with holographic optical tweezers (HOT)[18], with exponentially distributed resetting times. We will refer to this system as the Colloidal system. The second system is a self-propelled particle moving through an array of mobile obstacles, which it can push aside as it moves. The particle is reset conditionally, either when it reaches the boundaries of the arena or, if it survived, after 20 seconds [19]. We will refer to this system as the Bug system."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09388v1,A survey of probabilistic generative frameworks for molecular simulations,"Generative artificial intelligence is now a widely used tool in molecular science. Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: Neural Spline Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) Neural Spline Flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) Conditional Flow Matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models appears the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib9 peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.","In recent years, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to produce convincing images, text, audio, and videoRombach et al. (2022a); Achiam et al. (2023); Ho et al. (2022). The domain of applicability of generative AI has recently extended to the molecular sciences Tiwary et al. (2024), where generative AI has demonstrated the ability to predict protein tertiary structure from amino acid sequence Zheng et al. (2024); Jumper et al. (2021); Abramson et al. (2024); Krishna et al. (2024), protein-ligand complex tertiary structure from chemical identity Qiao et al. (2024); Corso et al. (2022) and the temperature dependence of the equilibrium distribution of solvated molecular systems Noé et al. (2018); Wang et al. (2022); Herron et al. (2023). While these methods differ in many aspects, all generative models share the common goal of sampling from an unknown underlying probability distribution based on an empirical dataset. While there are many classes of generative models, recently, probabilistic generative models have seen widespread usage. These models represent a framework that broadly encompasses flow-based Dinh et al. (2016); Tong et al. (2023a) and diffusion modelsSong et al. (2021). The probabilistic generative framework explicitly seeks to directly model the data distribution through a series of invertible transformations (in flow-based models) or by iteratively refining noisy samples back into data space (in diffusion models), providing a flexible method for generating new data points that obey the underlying distribution of the observed data. There is now a range of probabilistic generative models for use in different domains. Arguably, the most popular ones include Neural spline FlowsDurkan et al. (2019) (NS) models, Conditional Flow MatchingLipman et al. (2022a) (CFM) models, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic ModelsHo et al. (2020) (DDPM). All of these have already been used for exciting and novel applications, including sound field reconstruction Karakonstantis et al. (2024) (NS), zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis Kim et al. (2023) (CFM), and medical image segmentation Guo et al. (2023) (DDPM), demonstrating the utility of probabilistic generative models across different modalities. We describe these methods in Section III. However, the scientific literature in this field lacks a systematic comparison of these methods for benchmark problems with tunable complexities that could establish the conditions under which one particular framework out of NS, CFM, and DDPM might be advantageous. This is particularly true for applications to molecular systems. In this work, we address this gap by carefully applying NS, CFM, and DDPM to different benchmark systems. We realize that the field is moving extremely quickly, with new variants of flow and diffusion methods appearing regularly. In this vein, we expect that the datasets used here will serve as useful benchmarks for these new methods. Our systems include a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and an explicit water molecular dynamics trajectory for the Aib9 peptide Mehdi et al. (2022); Botan et al. (2007), where we collect information on the \{\Phi,\Psi\}_{i} dihedral angles for all 9 residues. For the Gaussian mixture model dataset, we are interested in how generative model accuracy scales with data dimensionality and with training dataset size and which model best estimates probability density differences between asymmetric modes in the training dataset. We also measure sample generation speed and model network size as data dimensionality varies. For Aib9, we are interested in model performance on molecular dynamics data at varying levels of complexity, which we tune by looking at different residues within the peptide. We also examine model accuracy in the low training data limit for the Aib9 dataset. Overall, our findings are: • NS exhibits superior performance estimating probability density differences. However, NS accuracy decreases for high-dimensional data. • CFM displays the highest accuracy at high dimensionality but diminished performance in the presence of complex, multiple modes. • DDPM most accurately models the complex, multimodal Aib9 dihedral angle distribution. However, DDPM is less accurate than other methods at high data dimensionality."

We address this problem analytically for both hard-core and soft-core interactions, using minimal yet paradigmatic models in d spatial dimensions. In both cases, we derive analytical expressions for the spatial correlation profiles in the reference frame of the tracer. We reveal unexpected universal features in their large-distance behavior, characterized by power-law tails with exponents that depend solely on the spatial dimensionality of the system. Beyond these simple models, we demonstrate the robustness of our results across different regimes using particle-based numerical simulations.","References Squires and Mason [2010] T. M.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09172v1,Coarsening and universality on a growing surface,"We introduce a model in which particles belonging to two species proliferate with volume exclusion on an expanding surface. If the surface expands uniformly, we show that the domains formed by the two species present a critical behavior. We compute the critical exponents characterizing the decay of interfaces and the size distribution of domains using a mean-field theory. These mean-field exponents agree very accurately with those fitted in numerical simulations, suggesting that the theory is exact.","Many biological systems are composed of dense proliferating cells [1]. Due to proliferation, these systems often grow [2, 3], or alternatively, occupy a tissue undergoing its own expansion [4, 5]. From a theoretical perspective, the way a domain grows can profoundly affect dynamical processes taking place on it. For example, the formation of Turing patterns can be controlled by domain growth [6, 7, 8]. The case of uniform stretch, besides being the simplest, has revealed peculiar properties, akin to those of critical systems, in morphogen gradient dynamics [9] and in disordered packing [10]. More generally, domain growth can generate long-term temporal correlations in dynamics. Examples include genetic drift at the growing perimeter of a bacteria colonies and tumors [11, 12, 13], and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang dynamics in liquid crystals [14]. Complex behavior due to expansion emerges in discrete (lattice) models as well, where surface growth can control competition outcomes by affecting spatial correlations [15, 16]. In this work, we present a model in which two neutral species proliferate on an expanding surface with volume exclusion. We call the model the “growing voter model”, in analogy with the traditional voter model in non-equilibrium statistical physics. We demonstrate that coarsening in the growing voter model becomes critical for uniform growth. We calculate the critical exponents associated with the decay of interfaces and the cluster size distribution by a mean-field approach. Simulation results are consistent with the mean-field exponents to a high degree of accuracy, suggesting that the mean-field solution is exact."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08743v1,Adhesive contact mechanics of bio-inspired pillars: exploring hysteresis and detachment modes,"Engineering technologies frequently draw inspiration from nature, as exemplified in bio-inspired adhesive surfaces. These surfaces present textures adorned by pillars, mimicking the topography found on the pads of certain animals renowned for their exceptional adhesive capabilities. The adhesive response is strongly influenced by the morphology of these pillars. In typical existing models, perfect bonding conditions are assumed between the pillar and the countersurface, and solely the detachment process of the pillar from the countersurface is investigated.The proposed model, based on the assumption that interactions at the interface are governed by van der Waals forces modeled by the Lennard-Jones potential law, enables the examination of the entire approach and retraction cycle, tracking the movement of the pillar towards and away from the countersurface.Our findings reveal that adhesive contact mechanics is primarily influenced by the geometry of the pillar and the potential presence of interfacial ’defects’, which in turn affect the distribution of contact pressure. Furthermore, we show that the detachment process may simultaneously involve various modes of separation, such as crack propagation from outer edge, crack propagation from inner defects, and uniform decohesion. This suggests that existing theoretical models alone cannot fully elucidate the complexity of detachment phenomena. Additionally, we anticipate the occurrence of hysteretic losses during the approach-retraction cycle, attributed to pull-in and pull-off contact jumps. Adhesive hysteresis is a phenomenon consistently observed in experiments but frequently overlooked in existing models.","Bio-inspired adhesives are engineered to replicate the skills found in specific animal species [1, 2, 3], whose remarkable adhesive performance can be attributed to two primary mechanisms. In the gecko’s pad, for example, adhesion is guaranteed by its fibrillar hierarchical structure [4]. Other species, like some beetles, achieve climbing capacity through the distinctive microstructures on their pads [5]. In both cases, we are dealing with ”dry” adhesion, which is solely attributed to the van der Waals forces operating at the contact interface [6, 7]. Artificial adhesives are frequently produced with soft polymers and present a surface texture covered with micropillars, similar to those found on beetle pads [8, 9, 10]. The typical shapes of these pillars include the cylindrical one and the mushroom-shaped geometry. Both experimental evidence and theoretical studies [5, 11] have established that the incorporation of a cap extending the punch diameter in mushroom-shaped pillars significantly enhances adhesive performance. Figure 1: Detachment modes for a) cylindrical pillars and b) mushroom-shaped pillars. In the last years, several studies have been conducted on the influence of pillars geometry [12, 13, 14, 15], aspect ratio [16, 17, 18], material properties [5, 19, 20], and surfaces roughness of the countersurface [21, 22, 23] on the adhesive performance of microstructured adhesives. Carbone et al. [24] performed a theoretical study on the detachment of a soft elastic pillar from a rigid flat surface, highlighting that the debonding mechanisms are affected by the specific contact geometry. Also, they classified the potential debonding modes as sketched in Fig. 1. In the case of cylindrical pillars, adhesive bond rupture occurs due to crack propagation starting from the external perimeter and advancing toward the inner region. The presence of the cap in mushroom-shaped pillars, inhibits crack formation at the plate’s edge. Zhang et al. [25] performed experiments and Finite Element (FE) analyses to study the detachment of an isolated mushroom-shaped pillar. They observed that the geometry of the mushroom cap strongly affects the interfacial crack behavior and the pull-off stress, finding the existence of an optimum cap thickness that maximizes the adhesion force in agreement with results reported in Carbone and Pierro [26]. The above cited works demonstrate that the detachment mode depends on the pressure distribution at the contact interface. However, the examination of the pressure distribution is challenging when relying solely on analytical models and presents obvious difficulties in terms of direct observation through experiments. Numerical models are a valuable tool for tracking the pressures at the interface, providing insights into their relationship with the detachment mode [25]. Several numerical approaches have been proposed to study adhesive phenomena between an elastic body and a rigid indenter [27, 28, 29, 30]. However, many of these studies, such as those based on the Boundary Element Method (BEM), are limited by the assumption that the deformable body is of infinite size, like an elastic half-space or an infinitely long elastic layer. This assumption holds true only when the contact area is small compared to the overall size of the bodies in contact. In contrast, the versatility of the Finite Element Method (FEM) allows assigning deformable properties to finite-sized bodies with complex geometries, such as mushroom-shaped pillars. Therefore, the model originally developed in Refs. [31, 32] is refined here to investigate the mechanism of detachment of soft cylindrical and mushroom-shaped pillars from a rigid flat countersurface. This refinement allows for a more precise analysis of the interaction mechanics, considering the finite size and geometry of the pillars, which are crucial for accurately predicting adhesion behavior in practical applications. The present approach models van der Waals interactions at the interface using the Lennard-Jones potential law. The implementation of a finite potential is a much more realistic condition compared to the assumption of infinitely short-range adhesion, which is typical of models based on energetic approaches [13, 24]. Furthermore, while theoretical models can predict detachment modes based on energetic equilibrium [15], our model provides the complete pressure distribution at the contact interface. This detailed information accurately reveals the exact detachment mechanisms that occur, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction dynamics. In contrast to prior theoretical and numerical models [13, 14, 25], our approach does not require the assumption of initial bonded conditions between the pillar and the countersurface. Instead, it allows for comprehensive modeling of both the approach and retraction processes, facilitating investigation of the non-conservative behavior associated with adhesive hysteresis, a phenomenon typically observed in experimental studies [25]. Results show that the detachment mode is governed by the interfacial pressure distribution, which can be adjusted by i) changing the contact geometry of the pillar and/or ii) inserting an interfacial defect [24]. In real applications, the presence of a defect at the interface can be accidental, as, for example, due to the deposition of dust particles, interfacial air entrapment, or geometrical imperfections of the pillar [33]. On the other hand, the presence of a ”defect” can be designed by changing the mechanical and adhesive properties of portions of the pillar [34]. Our findings reveal that the detachment process may involve multiple modes of separation, and hysteretic losses originate from pull-in and pull-off contact jumps occurring during the loading and unloading phases, respectively."

A Likelihood Approach for Second Order Langevin Models","The inherent complexity of biological agents often leads to motility behavior that appears to have random components. Robust stochastic inference methods are therefore required to understand and predict the motion patterns from time discrete trajectory data provided by experiments. In many cases second order Langevin models are needed to adequately capture the motility. Additionally, population heterogeneity needs to be taken into account when analyzing data from several individual organisms. In this work, we describe a maximum likelihood approach to infer dynamical, stochastic models and, simultaneously, estimate the heterogeneity in a population of motile active particles from discretely sampled, stochastic trajectories. To this end we propose a new method to approximate the likelihood for non-linear second order Langevin models. We show that this maximum likelihood ansatz outperforms alternative approaches especially for short trajectories. Additionally, we demonstrate how a measure of uncertainty for the heterogeneity estimate can be derived. We thereby pave the way for the systematic, data-driven inference of dynamical models for actively driven entities based on trajectory data, deciphering temporal fluctuations and inter-particle variability.","One of the drivers of active matter research has been the goal to understand and describe the motility behavior of biological agents which span orders of magnitude from microorganisms and cancer cells to flocks of sheep and birds [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The inherent complexity of even single-cellular organisms and the plethora of unobserved internal degrees of freedom leads to motility patterns which appear to have random components. For this reason, stochastic models and, more specifically, stochastic differential equations (SDEs) or Langevin equations, have emerged as an important model class to describe the motility of macroscopic [6, 7, 8, 9] as well as microscopic biological agents [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Motility data from active particles takes the form of discretely sampled trajectories. Experimental setups often have a limited field of view and do not allow to follow a single individual for an extended time. Instead of a few long trajectories, only short trajectories from many different individuals are available in these situations. This poses a challenge especially if the observed population is not homogeneous, i. e. there is inter-individual variability. While individuality of macroscopic animals might be intuitive, even populations of genetically identical microscopic organisms display heterogeneity [15, 16, 17, 18]. This population heterogeneity can manifest itself in the motility behavior of the organisms [19, 20]. Even if the motility of all particles is captured by the same type of motility model, the parameters of this model will differ from individual to individual in heterogeneous populations. Population heterogeneity can lead to unusual behavior of statistical quantities like non-Gaussian displacement distributions [21, 22]. Ignorance about the heterogeneity can therefore result in wrong conclusions about the model. So far, heterogeneity inference for populations of motile microorganisms has mostly been limited to splitting the whole population into several subpopulations according to properties of the individual trajectories [11, 23]. Other approaches to infer population heterogeneity in biological systems include parameter fitting for each individual particle [22] and using forward simulations of the system to optimize a superposition of ansatz functions [24, 25]. Recently, it has also been suggested to use forward simulations to determine the parameter spread within a population from trajectory data [26]. A general approach that allows inference of arbitrarily parametrized continuous distributions and that utilizes the available trajectory information in an optimal way through likelihood based methods is still missing. Similar challenges have emerged in biomedical research in general and in the subfield of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in particular [27]. The metabolism of medical drugs can be described by SDEs, but the parameters of these SDEs may vary significantly between individual patients. In this community such SDEs with heterogeneity of the parameters are known as stochastic differential mixed effects models (SDMEMs). A number of methods and algorithms have been proposed to solve this inference problem. They range from analytical approximations [28] over stochastic approximations [29] to Bayesian inference using sophisticated particle methods [30, 31]. We point to Ref. [32] for an extensive list of references. There are also a number of contributions about theoretical properties of estimators in such systems [33]. However, there are some peculiarities about motility data that call for specialized methods. The positional dynamics of active particles will often require a second order description. In macroscopic inertial systems like flocks of birds, second order dynamics arise naturally through the Newtonian equations of motion [6]. But also for microorganisms whose motion is usually governed by low Reynolds numbers and is therefore overdamped, a first order description might not be sufficient—if the complex propulsion mechanism generates a force with fluctuations that are best described by a first order Langevin equation, the positional dynamics become second order [12, 34]. This makes the observed positional process non-Markovian and does not allow for inference through transition density estimation. Recently, new inference methods for homogeneous second order motility models have been introduced [35, 36]. However, these studies focus on the calculation of single point estimates for the motility parameters of each individual. In order to estimate the population heterogeneity from the available data in an optimal way, the full likelihood of the motility parameters is required. This is especially important if the measured trajectories have a short duration limiting the available information per trajectory. In the context of discrete time processes instead of continuous SDEs, motility inference based on likelihoods was discussed in Ref. [37]—the parameters inferred by this method will, however, depend on the sampling interval. While individual trajectories may be very short, many experimental settings allow, however, for high sampling rates. This means that the relevant limit in this case is short measurement intervals \tau while the total duration of the trajectories T remains constant. An inference method for motility data needs to be able to deal with potentially many data points per trajectory while converging to the true likelihood in the small \tau limit. In this work, we address the challenges summarized above by presenting a maximum likelihood based framework to infer distributions of motility parameters in heterogeneous ensembles of active particles. Maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) are known to have favorable theoretical properties like consistency, equivariance and efficiency. To this end, we introduce a new way to approximate the likelihood of the parameters of the motility model with respect to single trajectories in second order settings. This method yields an analytical approximation to the likelihood with a concise functional form. The derivation has some parallels with the approach taken in Ref. [36]. In contrast to this previous work which considers a drift comprised of a linear velocity-dependent term and a non-linear position-dependent term, here, we focus on models independent of position but with non-linear drift terms. We then plug this approximation into an expectation maximization (EM) scheme to obtain an MLE for the heterogeneity. Furthermore, we show how to obtain robust error estimates for the estimator. A methodologically different approximation of the likelihood in second order settings can be obtained using extended Kalman Filters [29, 38]. This provides a general approximation for partially observed systems by sequentially integrating out the unobserved parts of the system. This sequential algorithm, however, does not provide a closed-form expression for the likelihood and cannot provide intuitions about its parameter dependence. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section II we introduce the model and details of the maximum likelihood approach. In Section III we demonstrate how naive approaches can fail for second order Langevin models and derive an approximate likelihood expression of the motility parameters. In Section IV we show how this approximation can be used to calculate a heterogeneity estimator together with its uncertainty. Finally, Section V presents the results of numerical experiments, before we end with some final remarks in Section VI."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08613v1,Electrohydrodynamic flow about a colloidal particle suspended in a non-polar fluid,"Nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena, where electrically driven fluid flows depend nonlinearly on the applied voltage, are commonly encountered in aqueous suspensions of colloidal particles. A prime example is the induced-charge electro-osmosis, driven by an electric field acting on diffuse charge induced near a polarizable surface. Nonlinear electrohydrodynamic flows also occur in non-polar fluids, driven by the electric field acting on space charge induced by conductivity gradients. Here, we analyze the flows about a charge-neutral spherical solid particle in an applied uniform electric field that arise from conductivity dependence on local field intensity. The flow pattern varies with particle conductivity: while the flow about a conducting particle has a quadrupolar pattern similar to induced-charge electro-osmosis albeit with opposite direction, the flow about an insulating particle has a more complex structure. We find that this flow induces a force on a particle near an electrode that varies non-trivially with particle conductivity: while it is repulsive for perfectly insulating particle and particles more conductive than the suspending medium, there exists a range of particle conductivities where the force is attractive. The force decays as inverse square of the distance to the electrode and thus can dominate the dielectrophoretic attraction due to the image dipole, which falls off with the fourth power with the distance. This electrohydrodynamic lift opens new possibilities for colloidal manipulation and driven assembly by electric fields.","The interaction of colloids and electric fields is widely used for directed assembly and particle manipulation (Prieve et al., 2010; Velev & Bhatt, 2006; van Blaaderen et al., 2013; Edwards & Bevan, 2014; Bharti & Velev, 2015; Harraq et al., 2022). In recent years, motile colloids energized by an applied electric field have become a popular model for self-propelled “active” particles (Yan et al., 2016; Han et al., 2018; Driscoll & Delmotte, 2019; Diwakar et al., 2022; Boymelgreen et al., 2022). One propulsion mechanism exploits the induced charge electrophoresis of colloids suspended in aqueous electrolyte solutions (Squires & Bazant, 2004, 2006; Gangwal et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2015; Nishiguchi & Sano, 2015). Another propulsion strategy is particle rolling on an electrode surface due to the Quincke rotation (a symmetry-breaking instability which gives rise to a torque on the particle in an applied uniform electric field) (Bricard et al., 2013, 2015; Snezhko, 2016; Karani et al., 2019; Pradillo et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021a). The threshold for the Quincke rotation is very sensitive to the solvent conductivity and experimentally accessible only in non-polar solvents, still at electric fields with magnitude in the order of MV/m. At such strong electric fields, electric conduction may be no longer be in the Ohmic regime due to fluid conductivity becoming dependent on electric field intensity (Onsager, 1934; Castellanos, 1998). Field-enhanced conductivity arises from the electric field effect on the dissociation-recombination equilibrium between ion pairs and free ions (termed Onsager effect). In a non-polar fluid, the electrolyte added to control conduction exists mostly in the form of neutral ion pairs (Prieve et al., 2017). The application of a strong electric field increases the rate of the ion pair dissociation thereby increasing the number of charge carriers and, accordingly, the electrical conductivity (Castellanos, 1998). This effect is suggested to underlie the flow observed about colloids suspended in oil (Ryu et al., 2010), whose pattern resembles the induced charge osmotic flow about an ideally-polarizable particle in aqueous solutions, and the oscillatory motion of Quincke rollers (Zhang et al., 2021b). Recent experiments have also reported that a charge-free, dielectric particle lifts off from the electrode (Pradillo et al., 2019) despite the attraction by the image dipole, which may involve electrohydrodynamic flow. Motivated by the potential impact of electrohydrodynamic flows on Quincke colloid “activity” and collective dynamics, here we examine the possibility of a flow driven by conductivity gradients set by nonuniformities in the applied electric field. While the electric field driven flows about colloids near electrodes in aqueous electrolyte solutions have been subject to a great interest (Ristenpart et al., 2004, 2007; Hashemi et al., 2018; Bazant et al., 2009; Prieve et al., 2010; Khair, 2022; Katzmeier et al., 2022; Fernández-Mateo et al., 2022), colloidal electrohydrodynamics in non-polar fluids is far less explored. In this paper, we predict that an electrohydrodynamic flow driven by the Onsager effect arises about a spherical particle in an applied uniform electric field. We develop an asymptotic solution in the case of fluid conductivity linearly varying with the electric field intensity. We analyze the flow effect on the particle interaction with the electrode. The force on the particle due to the electrohydrodynamic flow is calculated using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem and found to be repulsive for insulating particles."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08298v1,Two-molecule theory of polyethylene liquids,"Two-molecule theory refers to a class of microscopic, self-consistent field theories for the radial distribution function in classical molecular liquids. The version examined here can be considered as one of the very few formally derived closures to the reference interaction site model (RISM) equation. The theory is applied to polyethylene liquids, computing their equilibrium structural and thermodynamic properties at melt densities. The equation for the radial distribution function, which is represented as an average over the accessible states of two molecules in an external field that mimics the effects of the other molecules in the liquid, is computed by Monte Carlo simulation along with the intramolecular structure function. An improved direct sampling algorithm is utilized to speed the equilibration. Polyethylene chains of 24 and 66 united atom \rm CH_{2} units are studied. Results are compared with full, many-chain molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and self-consistent polymer-RISM (PRISM) theory with the atomic Percus-Yevick (PY) closure under the same conditions. It is shown that the two-molecule theory produces results that are close to those of MD, and is thus able to overcome defects of PRISM-PY theory and predict more accurate liquid structure at both short and long range. Predictions for the equation of state are also discussed.","Theoretical methods developed in liquid-state physics[1] have proven to be powerful tools to understand and predict the properties of polymer liquids.[2] An example is the polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) theory, which allows one to compute the pair correlation functions and thermodynamic properties of amorphous polymer liquids from knowledge of the polymer architecture. PRISM theory is an extension to polymers by Curro and Schweizer[3, 4] of the reference interaction site model (RISM) theory developed by Chandler and Andersen[5, 6] for small molecule liquids. The theory can be applied to atomistic polymer models by computing the chain structure self-consistently by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.[7] When implemented in this manner, the theory is exact for intramolecular correlations at low density. Comparisons of theoretical intermolecular radial distribution functions and structure factors with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the full, many-chain system[8, 9] have shown that PRISM theory gives a good qualitative, and sometimes semi-quantitative, description of the structure of flexible, bead-spring polymer liquids with strong repulsive interactions. Unfortunately, similar comparisons[10, 9] on more realistic polymer models reveal that the theory becomes less quantitative as fixed rotational angles, torsional potentials, overlapping interaction sites, and softer potentials are incorporated into the models. This trend was clearly seen in a study[10] comparing self-consistent PRISM theory with simulations on polyethylene (PE) melts. The inaccuracy of PRISM theory can be traced to the approximations inherent in the use of the atomic Percus-Yevick (PY) closure,[1, 2] which is currently considered the most accurate for liquids at melt densities with structure dominated by short-ranged repulsive interactions. A computationally more demanding theory for molecular liquids was suggested by Laria, Wu and Chandler[11] and later derived by Donley, Curro, and McCoy (DCM)[12] using the classical density functional theory (DFT) of Chandler, McCoy, and Singer.[13] In the theory, the expression for the radial distribution function consists of an average over the configurations of two molecules in a self-consistently determined field, i.e., a solvation potential. Thus the many-chain polymer liquid problem reduces to the much simpler one of two polymer chains. The derived solvation potential has a hypernetted-chain (HNC) form, and so this “two-molecule” equation can also be considered a closure to the RISM equation. This two-molecule theory was shown[12] to give more accurate predictions than RISM-PY theory for the pair correlations and equation of state of hard-core dimer liquids over a range of densities and bond lengths. Subsequently, Yethiraj, Fynewever, and Shew[14] within a two-molecule theory derived a different expression for the solvation potential. This derivation employed a weighted DFT, which requires the equation of state of the liquid as an input.[15] They solved the two-molecule equation via MC simulation for a liquid of freely-jointed, and freely rotating, tangent sphere chains. They also found very good agreement for liquid structure between their theory and a full many-chain simulation. While requiring the equation of state to compute the properties of a homogeneous liquid lessens the predictive power of this weighted DFT theory, the good agreement does show the promising potential of two-molecule theories in general. A thread two-molecule theory, which fits within the framework of polymer self-consistent field theory, has recently also been developed.[16] The purpose of the present investigation is to implement the version of two-molecule theory with an HNC-like solvation potential,[11, 12] hereinafter referred to as TM theory, to study PE liquids. A realistic chain model, commonly employed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, is utilized. The focus is to examine the accuracy of TM theory for the liquid structure and equation of state, particularly in comparison to state-of-the-art, self-consistent PRISM theory. The remainder of this paper begins with definitions of the system and correlation functions of interest. Then the theory for computing intramolecular correlations self-consistently within RISM and PRISM theory is discussed. Then the intermolecular portion of TM theory is described. This is followed by a description of the algorithm used to solve the theory numerically, though the discussion of the sampling methods employed in the one- and two-molecule MC simulations is deferred to the appendix. Then, results for PE liquids are presented and compared with PRISM-PY theory, and MD simulation data of full, many-chain liquids."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08163v1,Emergent functional dynamics of link-bots,"Synthetic active collectives, composed of many nonliving individuals capable of cooperative changes in group shape and dynamics, hold promise for practical applications and for the elucidation of guiding principles of natural collectives. However, the design of collective robotic systems that operate effectively without intelligence or complex control at either the individual or group level is challenging. We investigate how simple steric interaction constraints between active individuals produce a versatile active system with promising functionality. Here we introduce the link-bot: a V-shape-based, single-stranded chain composed of active bots whose dynamics are defined by its geometric link constraints, allowing it to possess scale- and processing-free programmable collective behaviors. A variety of emergent properties arise from this dynamic system, including locomotion, navigation, transportation, and competitive or cooperative interactions. Through the control of a few link parameters, link-bots show rich usefulness by performing a variety of divergent tasks, including traversing or obstructing narrow spaces, passing by or enclosing objects, and propelling loads in both forward and backward directions. The reconfigurable nature of the link-bot suggests that our approach may significantly contribute to the development of programmable soft robotic systems with minimal information and materials at any scale.","I Link-bot structure Individual bots are 3D printed, consisting of a cylindrical body (diameter, d=1.5 cm) on seven circumferentially equidistant legs, pictured in Fig. 1A(i). The legs are tilted, allowing the bot to self-propel in a preferred direction when placed on a vibrating surface. A circular flat arena of diameter 45 cm is vertically vibrated at a frequency of \approx 80 Hz and an amplitude of 70 \upmum, causing a single bot to move at an average speed of 8 \mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{s}. The arena vibration properties are kept constant in all experiments. Fig. 1A shows an example trajectory (ii) and speed profile (iii) of a single bot moving freely for 20 s. The corresponding plot of the translational mean squared displacement with respect to time lag is given in Fig. 1A(iv), which shows ballistic motion (\sim t^{2}) over short time scales and diffusive motion (\sim t) over large time scales, typical of active Brownian motion. Bringing multiple bristle-bots into a collective provides rich and interesting behavior [3, 29]. Previous work on bristle-bots that are connected to form an active chain focuses on elasto-active systems [20, 30, 31] and the mechanical coupling of connected active chains [32, 31]. In this work, we focus on systems of bots that are connected by rigid links with rotational constraints: link-bots. The link-bot is created by connecting N bots with N-1 links in a V-shaped arrangement, inspired by the formations observed in troops and migrating birds [33]. An example where N=7 is pictured in Fig. 1B. Each bot has a cuboidal crest on its top surface, which allows it to fit into the ribbon-shaped notches on both ends of the links. These links serve to maintain constant interbot distances between neighbors, transmit the motion of each bot to its neighbors and constrain each bot’s rotation. Links are characterized by three parameters: length between notches L, notch angle \theta, and spread angle \alpha. The center bot and its neighbors are connected using two center links (pictured in green in Fig. 1B(i)), while all other bots are connected with side links (pictured in blue). The center and side links always have the same length L=1.6 cm, although their angles may differ and will be reported using subscripts c and s for the center and side, respectively. To produce a V-shaped arrangement, the links on one side of the center bot are reversed in relation to the links on the other side. This symmetry effectively suppresses undesired random deformations, such as crumpling and curling, which are often observed in active filaments [34]. Two notable features of the link-bot in comparison to previous connected bristle-bot systems are the broken asymmetry introduced by the V-shape and the threshold constraints imposed by the link notch angles. These features allow for a rich variety of collective behaviors to emerge from its characteristic active chain dynamics to provide a multi-functional soft robotic system."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08012v1,Non-equilibrium phase transitions in hybrid Voronoi models of cell colonies,"Eukaryotic cells are characterized by a stiff nucleus whose effect in modeling the collective behavior of cell aggregates is usually underestimated. However, increasing experimental evidence links nuclear modifications with phenotypic transition, like the one between epithelial and mesenchymal states. In this work, we explore the effect of short-range repulsive forces in the non-equilibrium dynamics of the self-propelled Voronoi model. We show that the competition between steric repulsions (representing nuclear/cellular compressibility) and Vertex interactions (mimicking cell-cell adhesion/interaction and cytoskeleton organization) generate a variety of non-equilibrium phase transitions from Motility-Induced Phase Separation to mesenchymal-like phases up to disordered confluent configurations. Notably, we found that tuning the nucleus’s effective size/compressibility provides an additional way to cross the boundary between the different possible phases in line with experimental observations.","Biological tissues are collections of cells at high packing fractions. Each cell is a complex non-equilibrium machine; on top of that, cells are also deformable objects whose shape can fluctuate because of the interaction with the surrounding environment. Various models incorporate some of those minimal ingredients for capturing the collective behavior of cells in confluent monolayers alert2020physical ; trepat2018mesoscale ; camley2017physical ; barton2017active . Depending on the biological situation of interest, different coarse-graining descriptions of cells might be very effective.

This is important for understanding biological processes during morphogenesis Miotto2023 or cancer invasion sunyer2016collective ; Friedl17 ; Miotto2021 . In its complexity, a single cell is characterized by different structures that are hierarchically arranged: in the spirit of coarse-graining only the leading degrees of freedom are necessary for describing cell collectives, most of the attempts in modeling the single cell neglect such a complexity. For instance, within phase fields and Voronoi-like models, cell shape fluctuations can be included as a leading ingredient necessary for modeling the cell aggregate more realistically. Such fluctuations have been found to act as a driving force for jamming/unjamming transition Park15 ; Arora2024 . In particular, elongated cells characterized by a high shape factor, i.e., the ratio between the typical cell perimeter divided by the square root of the cell area, tend to aggregate into a liquid phase where cells continuously rearrange bi2015density . Highly symmetric cells, characterized by a smaller shape factor, undergo a rigidity transition similar to the jamming phase or, in some cases, a glass-like transition Bi2016 ; Sadhukhan2024 . Many experimental studies provide evidence for the importance of non-equilibrium glass-like or jamming-like transition in confluent monolayers Park15 ; Malinverno17 ; kang2021novel ; Arora2024 . Indeed, development, wound repair, and cancer metastasis are fundamental biological processes in which epithelial cells, typically non-migratory, can become highly mobile and rearrange over time and length scales much larger than the typical time and length scales of the single cell. From a biological point of view, the transition from a sedentary to a migratory state in epithelial layers was thought to rely on EMT or partial EMT (pEMT) in many contexts. During EMT/pEMT, cells lose their apicobasal polarity and epithelial markers, while acquiring front-to-back polarity and mesenchymal markers, allowing them to detach from neighboring cells and the surrounding matrix, adopting a migratory behavior. The unjamming transition has been identified as a distinct migratory mechanism where collective epithelial migration may take place without EMT Mitchel2020 . While cells can change their shape, allowing for adapting to growth in different conditions and moving across barriers Saito2024 , the presence of a stiff nucleus poses limits to their degree of deformability. In this framework, arises the question of what the effect of such stiff nucleus on cell collective behavior is (see for instance the reviews CaleroCuenca2018 ; Boutillon2024 ). Registering migration speed and cell/nucleus shapes, Wolf et al. Wolf2013 , identified deformability of the nucleus as one of the first-order rate-limiting physicochemical determinants of cell migration. Grosser et al. Grosser2021 compared spheroids of cancerous and noncancerous cell lines via bulk experiments and/or single live-cell tracking, finding that cancerous cells populations are fluidized by active cells moving through the tissue with the degree of tissue fluidity correlating with elongated cell and nucleus shapes. They speculate that individual cell and nucleus shape may serve as a marker for metastatic potential. Despite increasing evidence of the mechanical importance of the cell nucleus, models explicitly accounting for its effect are still rare Chojowski2024 . What is the effect of combining a stiff nucleus with a deformable shape in collective cell behaviors remains an open question. Here, we introduce a hybrid Voronoi model that takes into account short-range excluded volume forces mimicking the presence of the stiff cell nucleus. Our hybrid Voronoi model allows us to describe cells in both mesenchymal and epithelial phases. Indeed, by varying the relative strength between Vertex and excluded volume forces we interpolate from a pure particle-based model to a confluent model. Note that our approach counts a few control parameters for controlling different ingredients as typical shape elongation, cell motility, and nuclei stiffness. In contrast, other approaches require the fine-tuning of many parameters and is quite expensive from the numerical point of view alert2020physical . In the following, after introducing the model, we show that the system undergoes several non-equilibrium phase transitions from the so-called Motility-Induced Phase Separation (MIPS) Tailleur08 , to standard active liquid, to Voronoi (confluent) liquid, and disordered solid by tuning the strength of the Vertex interaction. Next, we change the packing fraction of the system showing that this brings a reach phase diagram where cells can arrange in Gas-like or Phase-separates without attractive forces at low packing fraction (as in the case of Mesenchymal cells). By increasing the strength of Voronoi the system becomes confluent. However, the structural property of the monolayer changes dramatically with the pacing fraction.

Phys. Chem. B 127, 2837 (2023)]. For instance, at a given state point the radial distribution function and the mean-square displacement as a function of time are virtually unaffected by energy polydispersity, which is in contrast to what happens when size polydispersity is introduced. We here argue – and validate by simulations of up to 30% polydispersity – that this invariance reflects an approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy hypersurface. NVU dynamics is defined as geodesic motion at constant potential energy; because this dynamics is equivalent to Newtonian dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy hypersurface implies virtually the same structure and dynamics of energy polydisperse LJ systems as for the single-component version. In contrast, the constant-potential-energy hypersurface is shown to be significantly affected by the introduction of size polydispersity.","The term polydispersity is typically used for models characterized by a continuous distribution of parameters in the interaction potentials. This is relevant for describing the jamming of granular media, e.g., sand, which can be modeled by introducing a distribution of particle sizes Dickinson (1978); Salacuse and Stell (1982); Frenkel et al. (1986); Evans (1999); Weeks et al. (2000); Fasolo and Sollich (2003); Abraham et al. (2008); Ballesta et al. (2008); Nguyen et al. (2014); Ingebrigtsen and Tanaka (2015). Polydispersity is also relevant in the modeling of glass-forming liquids by allowing for fast equilibration via swap dynamics Ninarello et al. (2017). Size polydispersity is typically introduced via a distribution of the size parameter of the pair potential. If the “size” of particle i is \sigma_{i}, the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rule states that the interaction with particle j involves the length parameter (\sigma_{i}+\sigma_{j})/2 Allen and Tildesley (1987). While size polydispersity is most commonly studied Dickinson (1978); Salacuse and Stell (1982); Gualtieri et al. (1982); Kofke and Glandt (1986); Evans (1999); Auer and Frenkel (2001); Fasolo and Sollich (2003); Wilding and Sollich (2005); Abraham et al. (2008); Ballesta et al. (2008); Jacobs and Frenkel (2013); Sarkar et al. (2013); Nguyen et al. (2014), a few publications have investigated the effects of energy polydispersity Shagolsem and Rabin (2016a); Ingebrigtsen and Tanaka (2016); Shagolsem and Rabin (2016b); Ingebrigtsen and Dyre (2023). Using the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rule for energies Allen and Tildesley (1987), Refs. Shagolsem and Rabin, 2016a and Shagolsem and Rabin, 2016b studied energy-polydisperse Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids in 2d and found only very small differences at a given thermodynamic state point between the average properties of polydisperse systems and those of the single-component LJ fluid with the same average interaction energy. This was recently confirmed in a study of 3d energy-polydisperse LJ mixtures, demonstrating virtually invariant structure and dynamics when varying the degree of polydispersity Ingebrigtsen and Dyre (2023). Energy-polydispersity invariance is robust; thus Ref. Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, 2023 demonstrated that, except for the case of extreme energy polydispersity, the invariance property is maintained when varying the state point, the mixing rule, the energy probability distribution, or the pair potential. The question we address in this paper is: Why does the introduction of energy polydispersity not affect the structure and dynamics to any significant degree? Before proceeding we note that the above-mentioned findings are consistent with the prediction of the so-called conformal solution theory Gubbins (2013) based on the idea that a mixture may be represented by a single-component liquid Mansoori (1993); Shell et al. (2006). This does not work well for size polydispersity, however Pond et al. (2011). According to the van der Waals mixing rule of conformal solution theory, the energy parameter of the one-component fluid representing the mixture is the average of the ij particle interaction energies \langle\varepsilon_{ij}\rangle. For the box distribution of particle energies \varepsilon_{i} studied in Ref. Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, 2023 this results in an average close to that obtained from the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rule (and identical if one uses a linear energy-mixing rule, which also leads to invariant physics Ingebrigtsen and Dyre (2023)). In order to throw light on the energy-polydispersity invariance of structure and dynamics this paper adopts an NVU point of view. NVU dynamics replaces Newton’s second law by Newton’s first law – the law of inertia – by considering geodesic motion on the constant-potential-energy hypersurface in 3N dimensions where N is the number of particles Ingebrigtsen et al. (2011a, b). In the thermodynamic limit (N\to\infty) this gives rise to a time evolution that result in the same structure and dynamics as standard Newtonian dynamics Ingebrigtsen et al. (2011a, b). In fact, when NVU dynamics is discretized for numerical implementation, this leads to the leap-frog algorithm with a varying time step the relative fluctuations of which go to zero for N\to\infty Ingebrigtsen et al. (2011b). The conjecture investigated in this paper is that energy-polydisperse LJ mixtures have approximately the same constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces as those of the single-component LJ system. If validated, this would explain the observed invariance of structure and dynamics upon the introduction of energy polydispersity. Figure 1: Average structure and dynamics of LJ systems of different energy polydispersity at the state point \left(\rho,T\right)=(0.85,0.70), which is close to the triple point of the single-component LJ system. (a) shows the average radial distribution function (RDF), g(r), for polydispersities up to 40%. (b) shows the average incoherent intermediate scattering function, F_{s}(q,t), where the solid lines represent data for the wave vector of the first peak of the static structure factor of the monodisperse system (q=7.2) while the dashed lines represent data for the wave vector corresponding to the box length (q=0.19). For both structure and dynamics we find results that are virtually independent of the degree of polydispersity. These findings confirm those of Ref. Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, 2023."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07811v1,Rate- and temperature-dependent strain hardening in glassy polymers: Micromechanisms and constitutive modeling based on molecular dynamics simulations,"We perform molecular dynamics simulations under uniaxial tension to investigate the micromechanisms underlying strain hardening in glassy polymers. By decomposing the stress into virial components associated with pair, bond, and angle interactions, we identify the primary contributors to strain hardening as the stretching of polymer bonds. Interestingly, rather than the average bond stretch, we find that the key contributions to stress response come from a subset of bonds at the upper tail of the stretch distribution. Our results demonstrate that the stress in the hardening region can be correlated with the average stretch of the most extended bonds in each polymer chain, independent of temperatures and strain rates. These bonds, which we denote as load-bearing bonds, allow us to define a local load-bearing deformation gradient in continuum mechanics that captures their contribution to the hardening stress tensor. Building on this insight, we incorporate the load-bearing mechanism into a constitutive framework with orientation-induced back stress, developing a model that accurately reproduces the stress response of the molecular systems over a wide range of temperatures and strain rates in their glassy state.","Glassy polymers are essentially amorphous polymers at temperatures below their glass transition temperature T_{\mathrm{g}}, exhibiting solid-like mechanical behavior due to restricted atomic mobility from neighboring interactions. The polymer molecules, typically with chain-like structures, can undergo strain hardening at large deformations, effectively increasing the toughness of the materials. Accurately modeling the mechanical response in the hardening region is essential for studying the failure mechanisms of glassy polymers. Unlike rubbers, which are amorphous polymers above T_{\mathrm{g}}, the strain hardening behavior of glassy polymers is sensitive to strain rate and temperature as evident in various experiments [1, 2, 3] and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [4, 5]. However, the mechanisms underlying the rate- and temperature-dependence of strain hardening remain not fully understood. For decades, the hardening mechanism in glassy polymers has often been interpreted through entropic elasticity theory developed for rubbers [6, 7], which attributes stress increases to the reduction of entropy during the elongation of polymer chains. While this theory applies well to rubbers, various experiments [8, 9] and MD simulations [4] reveal inconsistencies when applied to glassy polymers. This discrepancy probably arises from a core assumption in entropic elasticity theory that polymer segments are free to adjust their conformations to accommodate deformation. However, in glassy polymers, atomic mobility is restricted, preventing such free adjustment. Consequently, the relaxation time associated with the evolution of polymer segments becomes non-negligible, leading to rate-dependent behavior in the hardening region of glassy polymers. This limited mobility also introduces temperature sensitivity, as relaxation times are typically temperature-dependent. Thus, understanding strain hardening in glassy polymers involves addressing two key questions: (i) which structures primarily contribute to the stress response, and (ii) the relaxation of which structures most significantly affects stress behavior? To address the first question, various assumptions have been tested via constitutive modeling, given that experimental observation of the microscopic structure during deformation is challenging. Although the precise origin of hardening stress remains unclear, most constitutive models adopt the Lee-Kröner decomposition \bm{F}=\bm{F}^{\mathrm{e}}\bm{F}^{\mathrm{p}} [10, 11] of the deformation gradient \bm{F}, where \bm{F}^{\mathrm{e}} and \bm{F}^{\mathrm{p}} represent the elastic and viscoplastic components of \bm{F}, respectively. In this framework, \bm{F}^{\mathrm{e}} is assumed to contribute to the stress, which drives the evolution of \bm{F}^{\mathrm{p}}, characterized by the viscosity \eta. To capture strain hardening, Arruda et al. [12] introduced a back stress term to account for chain orientation effects. Anand et al. [13, 14] generalized this formulation by incorporating a unimodular orientation tensor \bm{A} as an internal variable of the free energy density for orientation and proposed that the evolution of \bm{A} is subjected to a dynamic recovery term driven by the back stress. Additional approaches have also been proposed, including models with deformation-dependent viscosity [1, 3], a viscous model that uses strain rate as an external variable to capture steady-state mechanical behavior [15], and models that represent orientation through shear transformation zones (STZs) [16, 17, 18]. While these models successfully replicate the stress response of glassy polymers in the hardening region under various conditions, they remain largely phenomenological, each grounded in different assumptions about the origin of hardening stress. A deeper understanding of the underlying micromechanisms is needed to further elucidate the nature of strain hardening in glassy polymers. In addressing the second question, it is critical to determine whether the primary relaxation mechanism influencing strain hardening occurs at the scale of polymer chains, such as disentanglement, or at the scale of local segments, like bond rotations. MD simulations have been used to study the mechanisms of disentanglement by tracking the evolution of the entanglement lengths N_{\mathrm{e}} during deformation [4, 19, 17]. Hoy and Robbins [4] observed that hardening increases with decreasing N_{\mathrm{e}} only when N_{\mathrm{e}} is relatively small; beyond a critical value N^{\mathrm{cr}}_{\mathrm{e}}, hardening saturates with N_{\mathrm{e}}. This suggests that disentanglement is relevant primarily at smaller N_{\mathrm{e}}. This finding may help to reconcile the conflicting results reported in [19] and [17], where N_{\mathrm{e}} remains constant in [19] but evolves in [17] during deformation. Furthermore, the critical value N^{\mathrm{cr}}_{\mathrm{e}} is likely temperature-dependent, as increased temperatures accelerate polymer chain relaxation. This implies that disentanglement only occurs at sufficiently high temperatures for glassy polymers, while at low temperatures, the dominant relaxation mode is likely limited to local segmental rotations. These include backbone chain rotations (\alpha-relaxation) or side group rotations (\beta-relaxation) for certain glassy polymers [20, 21, 22]. Experimental studies on the time-temperature superposition of glassy polymers at large strains [23, 24, 25] support this assumption. These studies demonstrate that the stress-strain curves of glassy polymers at specific temperatures and strain rates can coincide in the hardening region, with derived shift factors matching those from small strains. This suggests that similar relaxation mechanisms are active across both small and large strain regimes in these materials. Since disentanglement is not the primary relaxation mechanism at small strains before yielding, it is likely not the dominant mechanism at large strains in the hardening region either, based on these experimental results. Using identical shift factors for both small and large strains, Xiao and Tian [26] employed the back stress model [14] to successfully predict pre-deformation effects in the strain hardening region of glassy polymers. This paper aims to investigate the microscopic mechanisms underlying strain hardening in glassy polymers using MD simulations, with a focus on capturing its rate- and temperature-dependent behavior. To achieve this, we first decompose the virial stress components into contributions from pair, bond, and angle interactions, identifying bond and angle stresses as the primary contributors to strain hardening. Subsequently, we examine the microscopic quantities that can be correlated with these bond and angle stresses within the hardening region. Our key finding is that these stress terms are correlated with the averaged values of the largest bond stretch in each polymer chain, independent of temperature and strain rate. We denote these bonds as load-bearing bonds and represent this microscopic quantity through a deformation gradient, capturing the macroscopic local load-bearing deformation, denoted as \bm{F}^{\mathrm{l}}. Building on this result, we propose a decomposition of the total deformation gradient, \bm{F}=\bm{F}^{\mathrm{l}}\bm{F}^{\mathrm{r}}, where \bm{F}^{\mathrm{r}} represents the resisting component of the deformation gradient. Finally, we develop a constitutive model within the framework established by [14], incorporating orientation-induced back stress. Compared to the model proposed by [14] and various other hardening models [26, 1, 3, 16, 17, 18, 15], the improvement presented in this paper lies in providing a clear physical basis for the stress response in the hardening region, as well as a well-defined interpretation of the deformation gradient decomposition \bm{F}=\bm{F}^{\mathrm{l}}\bm{F}^{\mathrm{r}}, where the contribution of \bm{F}^{\mathrm{l}} to the stress can be directly extracted from MD simulations. The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the MD systems used in this study. Section 3 presents the analysis of the microscopic mechanisms underlying strain hardening, followed by a discussion on the decomposition \bm{F}=\bm{F}^{\mathrm{l}}\bm{F}^{\mathrm{r}} in Section 4 based on the findings from this analysis. Section 5 derives the constitutive model, including parameter identification and the validation. Finally, Section 6 concludes this study."

Investigating the structural and property characteristics of composite hydrogels is crucial in tailoring their performance for specific applications. This study focuses on investigating the correlation between the structural arrangement and properties of a composite hydrogel of thermoresponsive polymer, gelatin, and light-responsive antimicrobial porous gold nanorods,PAuNR. The rheo-mechanical properties of the composite hydrogels are correlated with their nanoscale structural characteristics, investigated using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Analysis of SANS data reveals a decrease in the fractal dimension of PAuNRs incorporated hydrogel matrix, as compared to pure gelatin. Incorporating PAuNRs results in formation of softer composite hydrogel as evident from decrease in viscoelastic moduli, critical yield strain, denaturation temperature and swelling ratio. Our results demonstrates that the structural modulation at the nanoscale can be precisely controlled through adjusting PAuNRs concentration and temperature providing an fabrication mechanism for hydrogels with desired elastic properties. The reduced elasticity of the composite hydrogel and light sensitive/antimicrobial property of the PAuNRs makes this system suitable for specific biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, device fabrication and stimuli based controlled drug delivery devices respectively.","I INTRODUCTION Hydrogels, network of hydrophillic polymer chains cross-linked together, with their exceptional absorbency and flexibility, are particularly valuable in biomedical applications, printing, and wearable devices García-Astrain et al. (2015); Gubaidullin et al. (2022); Barrett-Catton, Ross, and Asuri (2021). Gelatin, a natural polymer obtained from denatured collagen Wang et al. (2021), has become a prominent choice in biomedical applications due to its excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability properties Liu et al. (2020); Bode et al. (2013a); Berts et al. (2013); Panda et al. (2024). Gelatin-based hydrogel exhibits mechanical and biochemical properties similar to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the body, making it the most popular choice for application in tissue engineering, cell differentiation, bio-printing, and so on Ma et al. (2021); Wang et al. (2022). The interesting thermo-responsive properties of gelatin arise due to a combination of interatomic interactions, including hydrogen bonding (H-bonding), hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces Van Den Bulcke et al. (2000); Wisotzki et al. (2017). This unique property makes them a versatile material in various biomedical and environmental applications. The physical properties of the gelatin hydrogel can be modified by incorporation of polymers, cross-linkers, nanoparticles, etc. By modifying hydrogels through cross-linking processes or by incorporating specific entities such as ions or nanoparticles into the hydrogel matrix, the structure and properties of the hydrogel can be precisely tailored to meet the requirements of specific applications Ma et al. (2021); Wang et al. (2022). Incorporating different ions and nanoparticles into gelatin hydrogels is a widely used strategy to tailor their properties and have shown significant development Qiao et al. (2021); Wu et al. (2018). The trend in hydrogel research is moving away from ion-based materials and towards nanoparticle-based ones. This shift is motivated by the enhanced capabilities that nanoparticles provide, including better control of drug release, stronger mechanical properties, and the ability to perform multiple functions. Nanocomposites allow for more precise, responsive, and versatile applications, making them better suited for advanced biomedical and technological uses. It has been shown that the young modulus of gelatin hydrogel is enhanced by 2.9 times after photocrosslinking of CTAB coated AuNRs (1mg/ml) with gelatin methacrylate. Electrostatic interaction between CTAB-AuNR and gelatin methacrylate responsible not only for higher gel strength but also smaller pore size of the composite hydrogelNavaei et al. (2016). Synergistic chemical and physical interactions between porous silica nanoparticles and a matrix of gelatin/aldehyde-modified xanthan lead to a tougher hydrogel structure Aghajanzadeh et al. (2024). Gelatin hydrogel matrix embedded with 30 wt \% of spindle-like hydroxyapatite (HA) exhibits a compressive modulus 30.6 lower than pure gelatin hydrogel. These electrostatic interactions between calcium and carboxylate groups limit the sites for cross-linking between polymer chains within the hydrogel network resulting in reduction of gel strength Raucci et al. (2018). There are several parameters that effect the macroscopic response of the nanoparticle composite gels. To understand how these gels work at a larger scale, we need to know what happens at a smaller, atomic level. Specifically, understanding the internal structure of particle-embedded gelatin hydrogels using techniques sensitive to nanoscale structure as such small angle neutron scattering which can reveal the internal structure of these gels at a very small scale and correlating the structure to bulk properties is desirable. Porous nanoparticle-based hydrogel composites have gained significant attention due to their ability to offer controlled and stimuli-responsive applications Rocha-García et al. (2016). These materials combine the unique properties of hydrogels (absorbency, biocompatibility) with the enhanced functionalities of nanoparticles such as antibacterial properties, electrical conductivity, or magnetic responsiveness Li et al. (2022); Myrovali (2022). In this study, we incorporate the freshly synthesized PAuNRs samples into gelation hydrogel matrix for formation of gelation-PAuNRs hydrogel composite. Gelatin composite hydrogel is synthesized by incorporation of Cysteamine-coated porous gold nanorods (PAuNRs) along with a fixed amount of tannic acid as cross-linkers. Tannic acid as a physical cross-linker is employed to enhance the mechanical, thermal, and antimicrobial properties of gelatin hydrogel Leite et al. (2021); Panda et al. (2024). Cysteamine-coated PAuNRs were chosen due to their inherent properties, including porosity, near-infrared (NIR) absorption, conductivity, and antibacterial activity. These properties endow the gelatin composite hydrogel with functionalities suitable for diverse applications, including drug delivery, photoacoustic imaging, computed tomography imaging, and even photothermal therapy Cai et al. (2018). This research investigated how the incorporation of PAuNRs with different concentrations and variations in temperature influence the architecture of gelatin composite hydrogels. We then explored the connection between these structural changes with its rheo-mechanical and thermal properties of the hydrogels. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) was performed on both pure gelatin and composite hydrogels at different temperatures to understand the resulting structural modulations. Additionally, rheo-mechanical testing, temperature sweep tests, and DSC measurements were employed to analyze the rheo-mechanical and thermal properties of the hydrogels. Understanding the effect of PAuNRs concentration and temperature on structural modulation of hydrogels, and how these structural changes impact macroscopic properties, is crucial for designing hydrogels with suitable characteristics for specific applications."

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07344v1,"Wetting, Algebraic Curves and Conformal Invariance","Recent studies of wetting in a two-component square-gradient model of interfaces in a fluid mixture, showing three-phase bulk coexistence, have revealed some highly surprising features. Numerical results show that the density profile paths, which form a tricuspid shape in the density plane, have curious geometric properties, while conjectures for the analytical form of the surface tensions imply that nonwetting may persist up to the critical end points, contrary to the usual expectation of critical point wetting. Here, we solve the model exactly and show that the profile paths are conformally invariant quartic algebraic curves that change genus at the wetting transition. Being harmonic, the profile paths can be represented by an analytic function in the complex plane which then conformally maps the paths onto straight lines. Using this, we derive the conjectured form of the surface tensions and explain the geometrical properties of the tricuspid and its relation to the Neumann triangle for the contact angles. The exact solution confirms that critical point wetting is absent in this square-gradient model.","References Sullivan and Telo da Gama (1986) D. E. Sullivan and M. M.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07124v1,Azurin-Based Peptide p28 Arrests the p53-HDM2 Interactions: A Novel Anti-Cancer Pathway,"Azurin and its derived peptides, particularly p28, have shown strong anticancer effects, primarily due to their capacity to stabilize the p53 tumor suppressor protein and prevent its degradation. Previous studies have demonstrated that p28 interacts with the DNA-binding domain of p53, protecting it from degradation mechanisms. Building on these insights, our research explored whether the p28 peptide influences other cancer-related pathways beyond just p53 stabilization. Specifically, we focused on the interactions between the p28 peptide and Human Double Minute 2 (HDM2), a protein known to negatively regulate p53’s tumor-suppressive activity.HDM2 plays a critical role in downregulating p53 by binding to its transactivation domain (TAD), leading to a reduction in p53’s ability to perform its tumor-suppressive functions. Our study aimed to determine if p28 disrupts the interaction between HDM2 and p53, and if so, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind this effect. Using HADDOCK docking combined with molecular dynamics simulations, we identified three stable conformations of the HDM2-p28 complex. These conformations effectively occupy HDM2’s hydrophobic pocket, allowing for sustained inter-chain interactions and exhibiting favorable binding energies. Through further analysis, we pinpointed the essential residues involved in these interactions and calculated their interaction energies using the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) method.Our findings reveal that by blocking HDM2’s binding sites, the p28 peptide can help maintain p53’s transcriptional activity, thereby enhancing its tumor-suppressive roles, including the induction of apoptosis and the arrest of the cell cycle in cancer cells. This study significantly advances our understanding of azurin-derived peptides’ anticancer mechanisms, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of p28 as a promising peptide-based agent for cancer treatment. Furthermore, these findings may open doors to designing additional peptide-based therapies targeting HDM2 and other pathways critical for cancer progression, offering a new avenue in the development of effective anticancer therapeutics.","Human double minute 2 (HDM2), the human homologue of the originally identified mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), is a 491-amino acid phosphoprotein that plays a critical role in regulating the p53 tumor suppressor protein.1 The p53 tumor suppressor is a pivotal regulator of cellular stress responses, playing a crucial role in enforcing cell growth arrest, inducing senescence, and initiating apoptosis in response to various forms of cellular stress.2, 3 Its ability to suppress the propagation of cells harboring damaged or potentially mutagenic DNA is vital for maintaining genomic integrity. The p53 protein mediates these protective effects primarily through a transcription-dependent mechanism.4, 5 A central feature of p53 biology is its tight regulation at the protein level, as cellular p53 concentrations are a key determinant of its function. In unstressed cells, p53 is maintained at low levels due to its rapid degradation, with a half-life of 5 to 30 minutes, primarily controlled by the ubiquitin ligase MDM2.2, 3 Upon exposure to stress, p53 levels are swiftly elevated, allowing it to exert its tumor suppressor functions effectively. Structural studies of the p53-MDM2 complex reveal that MDM2’s amino-terminal domain binds to p53’s transactivation domain (TAD) within a hydrophobic pocket.6 This interaction involves residues 25–109 of MDM2 forming the HDM2 NTD and a 15-amino acid amphipathic peptide in p53, with key binding sites located at residues 18–26 of p53.7, 8, 9 Residues PHE19, TRP23, and LEU26 of p53, which bind to the hydrophobic pocket of HDM2, play crucial role for this protein-protein interaction. These interactions are essential for the regulation of p53’s tumor suppressor activity, as HDM2 binding leads to its functional inhibition.7, 10 The interaction is characterized by a precise key-lock fit, with p53’s amphipathic \alpha-helix fitting into a hydrophobic cleft in MDM2. THR18 in p53 stabilizes this \alpha-helix, while MDM2’s binding cleft, formed by residues 54-74 and 94-104, features a groove lined with hydrophobic and aromatic residues. Conversely, mutations at GLY58, GLU68, VAL75, or CYS77 in MDM2 can disrupt its binding to p53.11 Figure 1 illustrates the native HDM2-p53 interaction sites, highlighting the hydrophobic cleft and the crucial binding residues of p53. The binding affinity of p53-MDM2 complex ranges from 60 to 700 nM, depending on the number of residues of the p53 protein involved.12, 13, 14 Such binding inhibits p53’s ability to activate transcription by physically blocking its interaction with the transcriptional machinery. Figure 1: (a) Cartoon representation of the native HDM2-p53 interaction sites and the hydrophobic cleft. p53 (residues 10-30) is colored blue and HDM2 (residues 25-111) in green. (b) Residues PHE19, TRP23, and LEU26 of p53, represented in stick model and colored orange, binding to the hydrophobic pocket of HDM2. Phosphorylation also plays a key role in regulating this interaction. While phosphorylation of SER15 and SER20 does not affect p53-MDM2 binding, phosphorylation of THR18 weakens the interaction by 10-fold, indicating that THR18 phosphorylation is critical for disrupting p53-MDM2 binding.13, 14 DNA damage-induced disruption of this complex in vivo specifically requires THR18 phosphorylation, though the stabilization of p53 after ionizing radiation involves a phosphorylation cascade beginning with SER15, which facilitates subsequent phosphorylation of THR18. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies reveal that p53 binding induces significant conformational changes in MDM2 that extend beyond the binding cleft. Overall, conformation and hydrophobicity are key determinants of the p53-MDM2 interaction. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, MDM2 is primarily responsible for tagging p53 for degradation, thus controlling its cellular levels.15, 16 MDM2 features a self- and p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase activity located within its evolutionarily conserved COOH-terminal RING finger domain, which is essential for its function. This domain is responsible for transferring ubiquitin to lysine residues in the COOH terminus of p53, marking it for degradation. MDM2 and p53 regulate each other through an autoregulatory feedback loop which is essential for cellular homeostasis and effective response to various cellular stress.7, 17, 18 p53 induces the expression of MDM2, which in turn inhibits p53 by promoting its degradation and nuclear export. This feedback mechanism ensures that p53 activity is tightly controlled. Also, various DNA-damaging agents and oncogenes can activate p53 by inducing phosphorylation of both p53 and MDM2, leading to disruption of their interaction and stabilization of p53, thereby allowing it to perform its tumor-suppressive functions. Due to the well-characterized structural and biological nature of the hydrophobic interaction between p53 and MDM2, designing small lipophilic molecules that disrupt or inhibit this interaction has become a promising therapeutic approach. Notably, the MDM2 protein presents structurally well-defined binding sites, whereas p53 undergoes dynamic conformational changes upon phosphorylation. This suggests that inhibitors should more closely mimic p53 rather than MDM2. Additionally, the p53 interface consists of a single short contiguous sequence of amino acids, making it a suitable target for small-molecule inhibitors. The interaction between p53 and MDM2 involves only three hydrogen bonds, with the most critical bond being formed by TRP23 on p53. The relatively small contact surface between these two proteins further supports the idea that small inhibitory peptides or molecules could effectively disrupt their interaction. Previous studies has suggested that azurin and its derived peptides possess significant anticancer properties, demonstrating the ability to inhibit the growth and proliferation of various cancer cell types.19, 20, 21 Some works have shown that the p28 peptide (a small peptide derived from azurin having residues LEU50-ASP77 of azurin) can stabilize the p53 tumour suppressor protein, preventing its degradation and thereby arresting cancer cell growth.22, 23 By binding to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of p53, p28 effectively shields it from cellular mechanisms that lead to its degradation.24, 25, 26, 27 Another study has shown that the binding of azurin to p53 significantly decreases the association rate constant and binding affinity between MDM2 and p53, without blocking MDM2’s access to p53’s binding pocket.28 Building on these findings, our study aims to investigate the molecular interactions between the azurin-based peptide p28 and the cancer-related protein HDM2. Specifically, we seek to uncover the mechanisms by which azurin exerts its anticancer effects, particularly through disrupting the HDM2-p53 interaction, a critical pathway in tumor suppression. By focusing on the binding affinity and conformational dynamics of these complexes, we provide deeper insights into the therapeutic potential of p28 as a promising peptide-based anticancer agent, contributing to the development of novel treatments targeting HDM2-associated cancers."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06973v1,"The orientational structure of a model patchy particle fluid: simulations, integral equations, density functional theory and machine learning","We investigate the orientational properties of a homogeneous and inhomogeneous tetrahedral 4-patch fluid (Kern–Frenkel model). Using integral equations, either (i) HNC or (ii) a modified HNC scheme with simulation input, the full orientational dependence of pair and direct correlation functions is determined. Density functionals for the inhomogeneous problem are constructed via two different methods. The first, molecular density functional theory, utilizes the full direct correlation function and an isotropic hard-sphere bridge functional. The second method, a machine learning approach, uses a decomposition of the functional into an isotropic reference part and a mean-field orientational part, where both parts are improved by machine learning techniques. Comparison to simulation data at hard walls and around hard tracers show a similar performance of the two functionals. Machine learning strategies are discussed to eliminate residual differences, with the goal of obtaining machine-learning enhanced functionals for the general anisotropic fluid.","Classical fluids made of particles with strong directional bonding (associating fluids) are an important class of systems relevant for the understanding of polymerization, self-assembly in molecular and colloidal systems and phase behavior of proteins. A simple model system for associating fluids are spherical patchy particles made of hard spheres with N_{\mathrm{p}} localized spots (patches) on their surface, which lead to strong attraction when they overlap. Specifically, patchy particles with N_{\mathrm{p}}=4 patches are interesting model systems for tetrahedrally coordinating particles and thus the system has also some relevance to molecular fluids such as water [1]. Patchy particles are becoming increasingly popular as colloidal models to explain certain features of protein solutions. An example is the phase and adsorption behavior of bovine serum albumine (BSA) in solutions with trivalent cations [2, 3, 4]. In these systems, the proteins bind at specific sites with the cations acting as a bridge, and can be described as ion-activated patchy particles. Regarding bulk thermodynamic behaviour we note that the equation of state and consequently the phase diagram of these patchy particles can be understood very well using a statistical theory of bonding developed by Wertheim, namely first order thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT1), which only needs the pair correlations in a reference hard sphere system [5]. Gas–liquid binodals from TPT1 and simulations agree on a semiquantitative level [6, 7, 8]. The dynamic properties of the fluid phase (relaxation) are strongly different from the ones in simple fluids, due to the formation of transient networks and have been mainly studied by simulations addressing the time-dependent bonding statistics [9]. Although patchy particles (if besides the attractive spots no other isotropic attractions are assumed) are in some sense “maximally anisotropic” in their attractions, the intrinsic orientational order in the equilibrium fluid has not been investigated very much in the past. As described, Wertheim’s TPT1 does not need it and simulations focus on the bonding statistics which is easier to access but is of course a consequence of the orientational order. Explicit account for orientational structure appears to be necessary when discussing solvation. Solvated objects such as solute particles or surfaces [10] may impose very strong directional constraints. Theoretical methods for the description of the orientational structure in anisotropic fluids can be roughly classified into integral equations (IE) and classical density functional theory (DFT) approaches. The theoretical background for IE’s has been worked out in the 1970’s [11, 12], mostly with the aim of describing molecular fluids. Applications to realistic associated fluids such as water dates from the late 1990s [13, 14]. Such applications to patchy fluids have not been undertaken to the best of our knowledge. For patchy particles, an alternative IE approach is the “multidensity” formalism which considers orientationally averaged correlations but resolves them with regard to the binding state (i.e. number of bonds) of the particle, see Ref. [15] and references therein. Classical DFT methods for patchy particles specifically have focused on functionals of the orientationally averaged density, taking into account the orientational association behavior in an averaged manner, based on Wertheim’s association theory [16, 10]. Recent work [17] has shown that at hard walls, a 4-patch Kern–Frenkel fluid shows strong orientational correlations close to hard walls, which cannot be captured by orientationally averaged DFT, for a similar finding see also Ref. [18]. Therefore, resolving the orientational dependence in the density profile appears to be necessary to correctly account for solvation properties of patchy particles. RPA-like functionals (which are second-order in the density) do not work well for patchy particles [17]. An alternative is to use Taylor-expanded functionals around a reference bulk fluid, which in their second-order term need the full orientation-resolved direct (pair) correlation function as input (which must be provided by an IE approach). Higher-order terms (“bridge functional”) may be approximated by the corresponding bridge functional of an isotropic system. In the past years, this approach has been developed and applied successfully for aqueous systems (“molecular DFT” [19, 20, 21, 22]) but the methodology can also be transferred to patchy particles. In this work, the orientational correlations of a model 4-patch fluid are investigated for the bulk and close to a hard wall. For the bulk pair correlations and the density profile at a hard wall, Monte Carlo simulation data are obtained as a reference. Direct correlation functions (DCFs) cannot be simulated directly but are obtained via an IE scheme developed in Ref. [23]. These DCFs are input for the molecular DFT approach which is then applied to the solvation problem of hard walls and hard solutes. Results are compared to an improved approach along the lines of Ref. [17], where the functional is split into an orientationally averaged and a mean-field part taking into account the orientational correlations. In Ref. [17], the kernel of the mean field part was determined using machine learning (ML) methods and the reference part was the fundamental measure theory (FMT)–based “Stopper–Wu” functional of Ref. [10]. Here, the FMT weight functions in the reference functional are improved by ML methods. Overall, we find rather good agreement of both DFT’s with the hard wall simulation data, with “molecular DFT” performing better (and in excellent agreement with simulations) for the orientational correlations, and ML-improved “Stopper–Wu” DFT performing slightly better for the orientationally averaged density profile. The comparison between the two DFT’s offers also some insight into the orientational expansion of the direct correlation function. The paper is structured as follows: Sec. II defines the model (a symmetric 4-patch Kern–Frenkel model), introduces orientational expansions for density profile and pair correlation functions tailored to the symmetries of the model and briefly describes the simulations. In Sec. III, the IE methods are introduced and results for pair correlation and bridge functions in the supercritical region are discussed. Sec. IV discusses two approaches for the construction of an orientation–resolved density functional for the general inhomogeneous problem. The first (molecular DFT), is based on a functional Taylor expansion and requires as input the fully orientation-resolved direct correlation function. The second approach employs a machine-learned reference functional depending on the angular–averaged density and an orientation-dependent remainder parameterized in mean–field form. The density functionals are applied to hard wall inhomogeneities. Finally, Sec. V summarizes and concludes the work."

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06961v1,"Azimuthal variation of apparent contact angles on structured surfaces featuring micrometric ramps, pyramids and staggered cubes at two different inherent wettabilities","As new manufacturing methods enable manufacturing of microstructured surfaces with varying structure geometries, questions remain on some effects on the wetting behavior and the resulting apparent contact angles. In this study, we report the manufacturing process using 3D Direct Laser Writing (3D-DLW) and hot embossing for Poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA) surfaces with micrometric pyramids, cubes on a staggered grid and two types of ramped structures. We measure the azimuthal variation of the apparent contact angle of sessile droplets on the surfaces. Using plasma polymerization or no treatment of the surfaces, two different inherent wettabilities are studied. We find that while all structure types cause an azimuthal variation of the apparent contact angle, pinning at the ramp tops increases the contact angle more strongly on one side. On pyramid structures, pinning lines can occur on the structure axes and diagonals similarly. For cubes on a hexagonal grid, the strongest contact angle increases are observed along the primary structure axes, where pinning is preferred while smaller peaks are seen on the secondary axes at 60^{\circ} and 120^{\circ} to the primary axis.","The wettability of a surface is an important parameter in a variety of applications, such as spray cooling, spray painting or spray coating, making it a focus in surface engineering research1. The wettability of a surface can intentionally be modified by varying the surface material or chemistry or varying the surface roughness2, 3, 4. Similarly to surface roughness, microstructures can be introduced on the surface, which can alter the wettability even anisotropically5, 6. Most research on the effects of microstructures on sessile and dynamic droplets, however, has either considered isotropic roughness7, 8 or simple structure elements such as cylinders9, cuboids10 or grooves11. Asymmetric surfaces such as inclined pillars12, 13, 14 or differently shaped surface structures such as ramps and pyramids have been studied only rarely. As such, there is a notable gap in the understanding of how such structures can affect wetting and imbibition into such structures. On ideally smooth surfaces, the surface chemistry determines the contact angle of a droplet, resulting in a spherical cap-shaped droplet if the droplet is small enough15. The resulting equilibrium contact angle is also called Young’s contact angle \theta_{Y}. This contact angle directly follows from the balance of surface energies acting on the contact line. Figure 1: Definition of Young’s static contact angle \theta_{Y} on a smooth surface using the liquid-gas \gamma_{LG}, solid-liquid \gamma_{SL} and solid-gas \gamma_{SG} surface energies. As illustrated in figure 1, they depend on each other through the relation \gamma_{LG}\cos\theta_{Y}=\gamma_{SG}-\gamma_{SL} (1) where \gamma_{LG} is the liquid-gas surface energy (the surface tension), \gamma_{SG} is the solid-gas surface energy and \gamma_{SL} is the solid-liquid surface energy. In the scope of this study, the measured apparent contact angles on flat portions of the surface \theta_{FS} are treated as an estimate for Young’s contact angle \theta_{Y}. Using similar energetic arguments for an equilibrium state, two different macroscopic apparent contact angles can be derived for two different states. In the Wenzel state, which is defined as the liquid wetting the complete surface area, the apparent contact angle \theta_{W} in the Wenzel state16 is modified as \cos\theta_{W}=r\cos\theta_{Y} (2) through a roughness factor r=A_{total}/A_{proj}, which is the total (rough) surface area A_{total} divided by the projected (equivalent flat) surface area A_{proj}. In the Wenzel state, the apparent contact angle is smaller than the equilibrium contact angle \theta_{W}<\theta_{Y} for \theta_{Y}<90^{\circ} and larger than it \theta_{W}>\theta_{Y} for \theta_{Y}<90^{\circ} as it amplifies the inherent wettability of a surface. Whether the Wenzel state is stable depends on the structure and inherent wettability. Bico et al.17 define a critical contact angle for transition from the Wenzel state to a Cassie-Baxter state as \cos\theta_{Y,crit}=\frac{\Phi_{S}-1}{r-\Phi_{S}} (3) where \Phi_{S}=A_{top}/A_{proj} is the area of the pillar tops divided by the projected surface area. In the Cassie-Baxter state, the droplet only wets the pillar tops and the gaps between pillars are filled with air. In this state, the droplet assumes an apparent contact angle of18 \cos{\theta_{CB}}=\Phi_{S}(1+\cos{\theta_{Y}})-1, (4) On regularly structured surfaces, additional variations of the apparent contact angle of a sessile droplet can occur due to pinning at structure elements10. To characterize the effect of the surface structures on a static contact angle, Foltyn et al. 19 developed a method to measure the contact angle at varying azimuthal angles over the full range between 0^{\circ} and 360^{\circ}. In the past, numerous authors used either grooves, cuboid structures or cylindrical structures on square grids 20, 21, 22, 9. This includes Foltyn 23, who used cuboid structures with a height of h=\qty{20}{\micro} and side lengths of \qty60\micro, \qty30\micro and \qty15\micro in addition to grooves with a width and separation of \qty60\micro and a length of \qty500\micro. Along the structure axes and at the groove sides, an increase in the apparent contact angle was observed originating from pinning at the pillar tops. When plotting the apparent contact angles in a polar plot, a rhomboid-like shape was observed for the cuboids, with the sides at 45^{\circ} to the structure axis. For the grooves, larger contact angles are observed at the sides. In regions of larger contact angles, a shorter contact line was observed, which follows from the tendency of the droplet to form a spherical-cap like shape at its top. A shorter contact line can thus only be reached by larger curvature in its vicinity, leading to a larger contact angle. As this study aims to study the effect of the structure shape, comparable structure sizes as those used by Foltyn et al.10 are chosen. In this work, we study ramps and sharp-tipped pyramids, structures which do not feature a flat pillar top that allows symmetric pinning at this area. Additionally, we use micrometric cubic pillars in a staggered arrangement, corresponding to a hexagonal grid. In the following, the surface structures, their manufacturing process and characterization is described in detail. Subsequently, the measurement method for the azimuthal variation of the contact angle is given and both the contact angle variations and contact lines are given and discussed."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06464v1,Tetratic Phase in 2D Crystals of Squares,"Melting in 2D is described by the celebrated Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory. The unbinding of two different types of topological defects destroys translational and orientational order at different temperatures. The intermediate phase is called hexatic and has been measured in 2D colloidal monolayers of isotropic particles. The hexatic is a fluid with six-fold quasi-long-ranged orientational order. Here, the melting of a quadratic, 4-fold crystal is investigated, consisting of squares of about 4\times 4\;\mu\mathrm{m}. The anisotropic particles are manufactured from a photoresist using a 3D nanoprinter. In aqueous solution, particles sediment by gravity to a thin cover slide where they form a monolayer. The curvature of the cover slide can be adjusted from convex to concave, which allows to vary the area density of the monolayer in the field of view. For low densities, the squares are free to diffuse and form a 2D fluid while for high densities they form a quadratic crystal. Using a four-fold bond-order correlation function, we resolve the tetratic phase with quasi long ranged orientational order.","Melting in 2D is described by the celebrated Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Starting with an idealized mono-crystal, topological defects like dislocations can be created in pairs with antiparallel Burgers vector. The dissociation and diffusion of unbound dislocations marks the point, where shear elasticity disappears and the ensemble enters a fluid phase. On the crystal side, a six-fold director field can be associated to each particle given by the positions of the nearest neighbours. For isotropic particles, this is given by the fact that the closed packed crystal structure is hexagonal, thus each particle has six nearest neighbours. Dislocations are most easily detected by Voronoi tessellation, marking a pair of particles having five and seven nearest neighbours. Those arrangements stem from thermal excitation and a local displacement of the lattice. Since dislocations can be excited everywhere within the 2D bulk (not only at the surface/border of the crystal) the transition is predicted to be continuous. As pointed out by Nelson and Halperin, this fluid phase is not yet isotropic on temporal averaging the positions of the particles under Brownian motion. Dislocations effectively destroy the translational order but not the orientational one: the local director field can be correlated as function of distance and one finds a rather slow decay being best fitted with an algebraic function. This algebraic decay of orientational order is named quasi-long ranged and together with the short ranged translational order, the thermodynamic phase of this anisotropic fluid is called hexatic. A second class of topological defects, namely disclinations have to appear to destroy orientational order completely. Based on Voronoi tessellation, this is when dislocations dissociate into isolated fivefold and isolated sevenfold coordinated particles at higher temperatures (or lower 2D-density, respectively). Those disclinations cause the bond-order correlation to decay very fast, best fitted with an exponential function and the very fast decay of the orientational order marks the isotropic fluid. The two step melting in 2D with an intermediate hexatic phase was tested in simulations [7, 8, 9] and experiment. The latter almost exclusively with colloidal ensembles, where the particles can be monitored in time with video microscopy [10, 11]. Long ranged dipolar particle interactions are completely in line with theoretical predictions [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] while short ranged interactions, e.g. for hard discs show a weakly first order hexatic to isotropic transition [21, 22], in line with computer simulations [23, 24, 25]. Besides this, the picture does not change qualitatively under small anisotropy of the crystal given by an outer in-plane field [26, 27, 28]. The question naturally arises what happens with the KTHNY-scenario if not hexagonal crystals are molten: interestingly in his awarded work, Mike Kosterlitz started the renormalization group analysis with a square lattice [2]. Will an analogon of the hexatic phase, namely a tetratic phase as thermodynamic fluid phase with four-fold quasi-long range order show up upon melting? Square lattices are most easily made of squares and in computer simulations of rather small systems consisting of 196 and 784 particles, a tetatric phase was indeed observed [29]. The results were not completely conclusive about the first or second order characteristic of the tetratic–isotropic transition. They did also not completely rule out a columnar phase, where strict periodicity is only given in one direction but perpendicular to this, displacements of fractions of lattice spacing between columns are allowed. This phase is not easily distinguished from defect-rich cubic crystals known in 3D, where vacancies are allowed to dislocate about several lattice spacing in one direction due to the shape of the cubes [30]. An experiment with about 500 macroscopic particles (roughly 8\times 8~{}\mathrm{mm}^{2}) on a vibrating plate again indicated a tetratic phase but no columnar phase. A colloidal ensemble of 2\times 2~{}\mathrm{\mu m}^{2} squares fabricated of an UV-illuminated photoresist with a structured mask showed a completely different scenario: the author report a rotator crystal, where the squares are occupying the sites of a hexagonal crystal but orientation of the square (body-orientation) is random in space and time [31]. Even more surprising, at larger packing fractions they report a rhombic crystal out of squares. Here, the symmetry of the body is not reflected in the symmetry of the crystal. However, shortly later this puzzle was resolved: Using the concept of hypercubes with rounded edges it was shown in simulations that rhombic symmetry and rotator crystals are functions of shape when a perfect square is degenerated to a circular disk [32]. Tetratic phases can also be build of domino shaped particles with aspect ratio 1:2 where two rectangles form a square [33] or wider aspect ratios [34]."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06461v1,A fast transferable method for predicting the glass transition temperature of polymers from chemical structure,"We present a new method that successfully predicts the glass transition temperature T_{\!\textrm{g}} of polymers based on their monomer structure. The model combines ideas from Group Additive Properties (GAP) and Quantitative Structure Property Relationship (QSPR) methods, where GAP (or Group Contributions) assumes that sub-monomer motifs contribute additively to T_{\!\textrm{g}}, and QSPR links T_{\!\textrm{g}} to the physico-chemical properties of the structure through a set of molecular descriptors. This method yields fast and accurate predictions of T_{\!\textrm{g}} for polymers based on chemical motifs outside the data sample, which resolves the main limitation of the GAP approach. Using a genetic algorithm, we show that only two molecular descriptors are necessary to predict T_{\!\textrm{g}} for PAEK polymers. Our QSPR-GAP method is readily transferred to other physical properties, to measures of activity (QSAR), or to different classes of polymers such as conjugated or bio-polymers.","Polymers are remarkably versatile materials, and the combined control of monomer chemistry and chain length allows for superior tuneability of physical properties. As a polymer melt is cooled, the time-scale \tau_{\alpha} characterising its structural (\alpha) relaxation increases dramatically, and in the absence of crystallisation the structure freezes into an amorphous solid, a glass, at the glass transition temperature T_{\!\textrm{g}} [1]. Since molecular motions are controlled by T_{\!\textrm{g}}, this is a key parameter for understanding and predicting material behaviour, and it is thus essential to develop methods for accurately predicting T_{\!\textrm{g}} directly from the chemical structure. For long-chain polymers, T_{\!\textrm{g}} is molecular weight (M) independent [2, 3, 4, 5], but strongly affected both by intramolecular dihedral barriers [6, 7] (chain flexibility) and intermolecular packing effects, both of which are chemistry-specific [5]. Importantly, it has been shown that the \alpha relaxation, which defines T_{\!\textrm{g}}, is linked to relaxations on a relatively ‘local’ sub-monomer length-scale [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], which in turn suggests that models that predict T_{\!\textrm{g}} from monomer structure should be achievable. In this paper we present such a model, and apply it to the poly(aryl ether ketone) (PAEK) family of polymers. Predictive models that relate structure-based properties and T_{\!\textrm{g}}, and are suitable for small data sets with low chemical variability, have been proposed for polymers [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 5, 20, 21]. For instance, an approximate correlation has been found between T_{\!\textrm{g}} and monomer-scale properties such as the molecular weight per conformational (or flexible) degree of freedom of the chain (M_{\phi}) [16, 18, 5, 15, 17], where M_{\phi} captures both chain flexibility and chain bulkiness (reflecting molecular packing). As one example, Schut et al. [18] correlated T_{\!\textrm{g}} with the mass per flexible bond for a data set divided into three polymer classes by introducing flexible groups into both the main chain and the side chains; an out-of-sample mean absolute error (MAE) for T_{\!\textrm{g}} of \lesssim 6\,\textrm{K} (per polymer class) was obtained. In another example, Xie et al. [19] assigned an ad-hoc mobility factor to each atom based on the chemical group it belongs to (e.g., alkyl, phenyl or thiophene). The monomer’s mobility was then averaged over the atomic contributions, followed by a regression of T_{\!\textrm{g}} on the monomer mobility. For a family of 32 conjugated polymers, a RMSE \simeq 13\,\textrm{K} was attained for in-sample T_{\!\textrm{g}} predictions. These methods are easily applicable and intuitive; e.g. by linking a relevant physical property, such as a molecular weight or volume, to each ‘flexible bond’, where ad-hoc rules are often introduced to quantify the influence of different bonds. However, the approaches are typically tailored to specific data sets and are not generalisable to a wider set of polymer structures [20]. Conversely, a more generalisable approach is the so-called group contribution, or group additive properties (GAP) method [22, 23, 24]. It assumes that a polymer property can be expressed by a composition-weighted average over contributions from sub-monomer motifs (fragments). The fragment contributions can be determined directly from data by a linear regression. van Krevelen [24] applied GAP to predict various polymer properties, such as transition temperatures, solubility, mechanical, optical and electrical properties; while Weyland et al. [23] quoted in-sample MAE \simeq 10\,\textrm{K} for predictions of T_{\!\textrm{g}}. Despite their broad applicability, a fundamental flaw of GAP models is that they cannot be used to make predictions for polymers containing fragments outside of the data sample [25, 26, 21]. A method that addresses some shortcomings of GAP models is the so-called quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) approach. QSPR-based methods use molecular descriptors [27, 28], which quantify electronic, topological or geometric properties that are calculated from atomistic representations of molecules. For polymers, QSPR methods are normally applied either to the monomer [21, 29, 25, 30] or to oligomers consisting of a few monomers [31, 32, 33], and statistical or machine learning (ML) techniques are used to determine the relationship between the descriptors and the investigated property (such as T_{\!\textrm{g}}) [34, 35, 30]. For QSPR methods applied to T_{\!\textrm{g}} predictions, RMSEs typically vary from \simeq 4-35\,\textrm{K} [21, 36, 37, 25], depending on the chemical variation within the data set. Models on larger data sets [38, 39], with higher chemical variation, typically yield prediction errors exceeding 25 K [36, 40]. A significant drawback of QSPR models is that accurate descriptor calculations can be computationally costly, especially for large monomers or oligomers. GAP and QSPR methods have usually been applied separately [21, 29, 19, 20]. However, Hopfinger et al. [26] proposed a linear regression-based model for predicting T_{\!\textrm{g}} based on a GAP-like averaging scheme, combined with associating physical properties (conformational entropy and mass) with individual bonds. Inspired by this approach, we suggest extending QSPR methods to a smaller structural scale than the monomer unit, assuming interactions between these sub-monomer motifs negligibly contribute to the property of interest. Here, we resolve the shortcomings of both the GAP and standard QSPR models, by developing a hybrid QSPR-GAP method: a molecule is divided into sub-monomer fragments for which molecular descriptors are calculated, and various linear regression methods are used to link T_{\!\textrm{g}} to the fragment structure. Our approach significantly accelerates the descriptor calculations and addresses the weakness of GAP methods, also providing accurate predictions for polymers containing fragments outside the data sample. We apply our new QSPR-GAP method to a data set of 146 linear homo- and copolymers of poly(aryl ether ketone) (PAEK) – an important class of linear polymers characterised by alternating stiff (aryls such as phenyls or biphenyls) and flexible linker (such as ethers or ketones) moieties, as shown in Fig. 1-A. The properties of PAEK polymers are highly tuneable by varying these moieties, making them suitable for a wide range of applications including smart-phone speakers, electrical insulation, automotive gears, medical implants and aircraft components [41]. To design PAEK polymers with optimised properties for specific applications, reliable structure-property relationships are essential. We use our QSPR-GAP method to predict T_{\!\textrm{g}} from the monomer structure, with an RMSE \simeq 5-12\,\textrm{K} (out-of-sample). In cases where the GAP model is known to fail (i.e., predicting polymers containing fragments outside of the training set), the model makes accurate predictions. Moreover, by identifying the molecular descriptors most important for predicting T_{\!\textrm{g}}, we reach new insights into how local molecular structure relates to the glass transition temperature in polymers. Our findings offer a pathway to predict the properties of highly complex polymer structures using small data sets, thus circumventing the need for more elaborate ML methods, which typically require larger data sets. Our method is readily generalisable to both a wider range of polymer properties (such as mechanical, optical, or electrical properties), and different classes of polymers."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06270v1,Model-free hydrodynamic theory of the colloidal glass transition,"We present a phenomenological, model-free theory for the large-distance hydrodynamic response of a viscous fluid hosting colloidal particles. The flow of the host fluid is affected by the presence of the particles, thus reflecting their liquid or solid state. On the liquid side of the glass transition we identify a dynamic length scale \ell beyond which the host fluid’s response is that of a viscous fluid with increased effective viscosity \eta. As the glass transition is approached, \ell increases indefinitely as \ell\sim\eta^{1/2}. At the transition the large-distance response changes qualitatively, marking the host fluid’s loss of translation invariance. On the solid side of the transition we identify another dynamic length, \ell_{s}, beyond which the host fluid responds as a viscous fluid of increased effective viscosity \eta^{+}, confined in a porous medium of effective pore size \ell_{s}. As the glass transition is approached from the solid side, \ell_{s} grows indefinitely, more sharply than (\eta^{+})^{1/2}. We discuss various experimental implications of the results and their possible relation to microscopic theories of the colloidal glass transition.","A suspension of collidal particles in a host fluid solidifies above a certain density or below a certain temperature. The solid may be ordered (a colloidal crystal) or amorphous (a colloidal glass), depending on intricate factors such as small polydispersity of particle size or weak external stresses [1, 2]. Colloidal glasses have been used as convenient model systems to study the elusive glass transition [1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The main advantage over ordinary glasses is that the constituents, the colloidal particles, can be optically visualized and tracked. It is unclear whether the existence of a host fluid affects the essential features of the glass transition [8, 10, 9]. This question is tied to the fundamental issue of whether the mechanism underlying the transition is structural or dynamic [11, 12]. In the present work we turn the spotlight to the host fluid. We investigate changes in its hydrodynamic response to a localized force, caused by the solidification of the suspended particles. In Sec. II we construct, based on symmetry arguments, an expression for the hydrodynamic response of a generic complex fluid. The response is captured by a set of phenomenological coefficients, one of which serves as an order parameter for the glass transition, i.e., it vanishes in the suspension’s liquid state and is nonzero in its solid state. We show that this critical behavior reflects the breaking of translation invariance of the host fluid upon the suspension’s solidification. The other coefficients are found to be related to the suspension’s global viscosity and to dynamic characteristic length scales. We then use this representation of the host fluid’s response to infer properties of the glass transition as it is approached from the liquid side (Sec. III) and the solid side (Sec. IV). In Sec. V we summarize the predictions of the theory, discuss their experimental implications, and suggest possible relations between the results and microscopic theories of the colloidal glass transition. In the Appendix we demonstrate the emergence of the phenomenological coefficients in a simplistic microscopic model."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06231v1,Solid-liquid interfacial free energy from computer simulations: Challenges and recent advances,"The theory of interfacial properties in liquid-liquid or liquid-vapour systems is nearly 200 years old, and includes the contributions of great personalities like Young and Gibbs. The advent of computational tools has greatly advanced the field, mainly through the use of Molecular Dynamics simulations, which allows the precise study of interfaces between different systems at the atomistic level. Despite the successes and advances in the theory of interfacial phenomena for liquid-liquid systems, the study of solid-liquid interfaces still remains a challenge both theoretically and experimentally. The main reason why the treatment of solid-liquid systems has fallen behind that of liquid-liquid systems is that there are complications that arise whenever an interface involving solid systems is considered. These complications involve both the theory of the solid-liquid interface and the calculations of related properties using Molecular Dynamics simulations. An example of the former is that, contrary to the liquid-liquid case, the interfacial properties of solids depend on the lattice orientation. The main complications in the calculation of interfacial properties arise from the fact that for solids the “mechanical route”, which requires a single calculation to determine the distribution of stresses in the sample considered, cannot be used. To overcome this problem, several numerical approaches were proposed to tackle the calculation of interfacial properties in solid-liquid systems. The main purpose of this review is to provide an overview of these different methodologies and to discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We classify these methodologies into two main groups: direct and indirect methods. Direct methods are those that are able to calculate directly (although in a more convoluted way) the properties of interfaces, while in indirect approaches the properties of the interface are not the primary result of the simulations. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of solid-liquid interfaces, we also included a discussion on the origin of the difficulties in considering solid interfaces from a thermodynamic point of view. In the second part of the review, we discuss two key related topics: nucleation theory and curved interfaces. They both represent an important problem in the study of interfaces and in particular in the context of solid-liquid ones for which the research is still extremely active.","One of the famous quotes attributed to Pauli describes a surface in a really unflattering manner, portraying it as aligned with chaos and darkness, unlike the order and rationality of the bulk 111As reported in [1], the quote reads “God made the bulk, surfaces were invented by the devil”. Although it is true that surfaces can be difficult to deal with (and we will describe why in this review), it is also true that they are often more interesting to describe and study than the bulk because several interesting phenomena occur only at the interface between two (or more) phases. This is especially true for solid-liquid interfaces. The detailed knowledge of the structure and thermodynamic properties of interfaces that separate a solid and other coexisting phases is the basis for many physical phenomena and technological processes, making it a matter of primary interest in several different fields. We dedicate the first part of this review to describing these problems and applications and, as will be made clear in the rest of this work, to showing why so much effort has been dedicated to the creation of reliable methods for the determination of interfacial properties. A central challenge (and the theme of this review) is the accurate calculation of the interfacial free energy (IFE). Among the physical phenomena dependent on the interfacial properties, the formation of a new (solid) phase from a liquid one has several different and important applications. The formation of a new solid phase from a liquid describes two different but related phenomena: in freezing (or solidification) we have the formation of a new solid phase from its melt, whereas in crystallization the new solid phase is created from a solution in which the solid is dissolved. These two processes are related by the fact that the physical process allowing the formation of the new phase is nucleation [2, 3, 4, 5] on which we will have an extensive discussion in the subsequent sections. One of the most studied systems undergoing freezing is probably water [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], not only because of its theoretical importance, but also for its wide spectrum of applications. For example, a fundamental understanding of ice formation is essential, as it plays a crucial role in atmospheric science for the accurate representation of world climate [11, 12], and for the design of functional materials, such as materials with anti-icing properties [13, 14]. Such materials will have a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from increasing safety in aviation [15], where ice formation on wings is one of the main safety concerns, increasing the performance of wind turbines in cold climates [16, 17], to reducing damage on overhead power lines [18, 19]. In solidification science, solid-liquid IFE controls the formation of solidification microstructures in metallic materials [20], from which, in turn, the quality of the final product in casting [21] depends. In particular, the dendritic growth velocity depends on the anisotropy in solid-liquid IFE [22, 23]. This anisotropy will be discussed in more detail in the next sections, and it is important in several systems, e.g., the Al-Cu alloy [24, 25] and the solid-liquid coexistence in Ni, Cu, Al [26] and Ti [27]. In fact, when a solid is in contact with a liquid, the value of the IFE depends on the particular orientation of the crystal phase in contact with the liquid. A different arrangement of the atoms in the solid will result in a different arrangement of the layers of the liquid closer to the solid [28], making the surface energy dependent on the orientation of the crystal structure. This effect highlights one of the difficulties that concern solid interfaces in general (not only in the context of the solidification process), which we will discuss in the next section: when solids are involved, the IFE is not a single quantity but assumes different values depending on the particular structure of the solid-liquid interface. In the process of formation of a new solid phase from a solution, the role of IFE between the solid and liquid phases in the nucleation process is well established [29] in different systems, from polymers [30, 31] to biomineralization [32]. The impact of the surface properties on the formation of the new solid phase through nucleation is related not only to the formation of the new phase but also which polymorph will be formed [33, 34]. A given substance exhibits polymorphism if there is more than one solid crystalline arrangement of the molecules of that substance. The prediction of which polymorph can be formed is important for biological processes [32] but also in the crystallisation of pharmaceutical products where the formation of the right polymorphs of drugs is essential for their effectiveness and safety [35, 36]. The importance of surface properties in the pharmaceutical industry is not limited to the prediction of the most stable product in drug production but encompasses several key aspects. In fact, the behaviour of such industrial products, (including both excipients and active pharmaceutical ingredients) with respect to binder-drug adhesion [37], granulation performance [38, 39, 40], powder flow, and compaction [41, 42] can be related to the surface properties [43, 44, 45, 46]. An application that has become extremely important in recent times, in which interface properties play a pivotal role, is the design of next generation graphene-based energy storage devices such as electrochemical double layer (super)capacitors (EDLC)[47, 48, 49]. Compared to standard energy storage devices, the new systems (using materials such as graphene [50, 51, 52, 53], porous activated carbon [54] and carbon nanotubes [55, 56]) have higher charge storage capacities, favourable specific energy-to-power ratios (owing to rapid charge-discharge cycling [51] controlled by changes of an applied potential) and lifetimes that can reach millions of cycles [54]. Energy storage in graphene-based supercapacitors is based on a reversible non-Faradaic physisorption of ions in the electrical double layer [57]. With its high surface area, graphene can in principle guarantee a higher capacitance than amorphous carbon-based electrodes. However, the area offered by the electrode is not the only parameter that enters the quantification of the capacitance. In order to be successful, the electrochemically active surface area of the electrode should be easily accessible by the electrolyte. This, in turn, depends on the ability of the electrolyte to wet the electrode surface. This is another manifestation of the solid-liquid IFE. In addition, the ability of the electrolyte to wet the graphene surface changes as a function of the potential applied to the electrode, a phenomenon known as “electrowetting” [58]. To capture the behaviour of graphene in contact with electrolytes, a more detailed account of electrostatic interactions is needed [57]. The development of such improved descriptions of the interactions requires quantum mechanical/molecular dynamics (QMMD) models [59] and more accurate force-fields, possibly based on machine learning [60]. The combination of such advanced descriptions with the methodologies presented here will surely be at the forefront of the investigation of such systems. Another interesting area where knowledge of interface properties in solid-liquid systems is essential is thermal transport across solid-liquid interfaces, in particular when the size of the system considered is microscopic and therefore the interface/volume ratio of the system involved becomes large [61]. The control of thermal transport at the nanoscale is important for medical applications, water purification, and microelectronics [62] (see [63] and the references therein for a more detailed account of the different applications). The interfacial thermal conductance is related to the affinity between the solid and the liquid at the interface. This effect was observed for the first time by Kapitza [64], and is now known by its name -“Kapitza resistance” (although it refers to conductance rather than resistance) and state that the stronger the attraction between the two phases is the lower the thermal resistance becomes [63]. A measure of the strength of this attraction is the wettability of the solid interface with the liquid and previous works show that there is a direct relation between wettability and thermal conductance [65, 66]. In turn, as we discussed in the case of electrochemical devices, we can consider the wettability as just another manifestation of the IFE, and the ability to obtain a reliable value of this property in a variety of systems becomes essential. Until this moment, we have talked about “surfaces” and “interfaces” without providing a proper definition, appealing instead to their common meaning. From now on, we will more rigorously define these concepts and put them into the context of thermodynamic theory for quantitative analysis and discussion. Indeed, the analysis of the properties of interfaces is deeply rooted in thermodynamics, as shown in the pioneering work of J. W. Gibbs, one of the earliest contributors to this topic, but also one of the founders of modern thermodynamics. In his work [67], he defined the interface between two different phases as a zero-width plane (later called “Gibbs dividing plane”), to which he ascribed the excess of the thermodynamic quantities which characterise the presence of an interface between two phases. One of these quantities is the IFE, \gamma, which represents the reversible work required to create a unit area of interface at the coexistence conditions for the two phases. We introduce here some of the notation that will be used throughout the rest of the work, by explicitly stating what are the two phases in contact through the interface. The liquid can be either the melt corresponding to the solid phase or a solution in which the solid phase is the solute. Where both cases are applicable, we shall refer to the IFE as \gamma_{sl}. When we consider only the solid-melt interface, we shall use \gamma_{sm}, and if we are considering only the solution-solid interface we shall use \gamma_{sx}. The Gibbs approach was later generalized by Cahn, with a formulation which avoids the need to locate the position of the dividing surface [68]. As we shall discuss in the following sections, the definition of interfacial properties, while straightforward for liquid-liquid systems, involves some subtleties when the system contains a solid interface. Such differences between liquid-liquid and solid-liquid systems are the main reasons for the different way to approach the calculation of interfacial properties using Molecular Dynamics simulations in the two kinds of systems. Whereas in liquid-liquid systems it is possible to leverage rather simple relations to calculate the interface properties using MD simulations (such as using the stress within the system as a proxy for the energy required to create the interface) such shortcuts are not possible for solid-liquid interfaces. In the latter case, more complicated calculations are needed, as one often has to resort to using very basic thermodynamic relations. For instance, the energy needed to create an interface is calculated by literally creating a new interface in a simulation box, which is an operation that is much more complicated than just calculating the force acting between atoms in the system. This review is organized as follows: we will first introduce the surface-specific quantities in solid-liquid systems starting from their thermodynamic definitions. We provide a brief account of the reasons why solid-liquid interfaces are different from liquid-liquid ones. From this we will move on to the presentation of the different methods devised in the literature to access the interface properties for solid-liquid systems. Here, we choose to partition the different techniques into two main groups, which we label as direct and non-direct methods, based on the way the interfacial properties are computed. This is the most extensive part of the review. Although such methodologies have been applied to several different systems, there are some systems which can be considered as “benchmarks” against which the results of any new extension of existing methodologies or the development of new ones should be compared: the hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones models. For this reason, we include a detailed description of such systems, along with a detailed comparison of the different approaches against the benchmark. We then discuss in some detail the calculation of interfacial properties for more realistic systems, namely water and hydrates. We selected these systems both for their importance and also because they exemplify the kind of complications one has to face in considering a realistic system for the description of the IFE. We then describe the importance of determining surface properties in the theory of nucleation and devote a section to curved interfaces. These last two sections (sections 10 and 9) must be considered “open”, in the sense that, despite being long-known problems (the first appearance of the problem of curved interface is in the work of Young in 1805 [69], and the theory of nucleation is now a century old [70, 71]), they have not reached the maturity which we can find, e.g., in the study of liquid-liquid interfaces (a problem which was completely solved by Gibbs well over a century ago [67]). In the last part, we draw some conclusions and give some perspective on future applications and ideas related to the methodologies described here."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06093v1,Granular flows over normally vibrated inclined bases,"We investigate granular flows over an inclined rigid base, which is vibrated externally in a direction normal to itself, through the discrete element method. We vary the base’s inclination angle \theta, vibration frequency f, and amplitude A to study changes in the granular flow’s profile and the mass flow rate Q. We find that the flow velocity profiles for the vibrated bases are non-linear, unlike their fixed-base counterparts. Our study reveals that Q may be maintained nearly constant in flows over vibrated bases utilizing appropriate combinations of \theta, A, and f. At the same time, by vibrating the base depending on the inclination angle, we may increase the mass flow rate by 25 to 100 times, compared to the values for the fixed base. Finally, we characterize Q in terms of a non-dimensional number S, which is the ratio of vibrational and gravitational energies.","Granular flows over inclined surfaces are common in industries and nature [1, 2, 3]. Such flows exhibit a variety of phenomena, including pattern formation [4], and segregation driven by gravity [5], temperature [6] and density-difference [7]. Besides particle-level parameters, such as grain size, shape, friction, and inelasticity, boundary conditions play a crucial role in controlling the dynamics of inclined granular flows [8, 9]. For instance, for boundary-driven flows, the base topography may drive the flow to ordered, disordered, and oscillating states [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Such boundary effects are observed to penetrate deep into granular flows [13] and alter their characteristics. A variety of phenomenology emerges when energy is injected into the system through base vibrations, e.g. development of various patterns like stripes, oscillations, squares, kinks and zippers [15, 16]. It is common to characterize vibrated granular systems using vibration frequency and amplitude [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Soto [20] employed kinetic theory to study vibrated granular systems and found that the flow is controlled by the product of vibration amplitude and frequency, and not by these parameters alone. Eshuis et al. [24] systematically performed experiments to study a shallow, vertically shaken quasi-two-dimensional horizontal granular bed and constructed a phase diagram in which the outcomes were distinguished by the presence of features such as bouncing bed, undulations, Leidenfrost effect, convection rolls, and granular gas as the fluidization increases. They characterized various phases of fluidized grains in terms of the number of layers, and dimensionless numbers S=A^{2}\omega^{2}/gd and \Gamma=A\omega^{2}/g, where d is the grain diameter, A is the amplitude of vibration, g is the gravitational acceleration and \omega=2\pi f, with f being the vibration frequency. The phase diagram presented by the authors clearly distinguishes the regimes governed primarily by S and \Gamma. Pak et al. [25] in their experimental study employed \Gamma>1 as a necessary condition for defining the sustained flow. Studies related to vertical discharge through horizontally vibrated hoppers also examine the dependence of depth-averaged mass flow rate Q on \Gamma [26, 27, 28]. The number S was found to regulate granular temperature, i.e. velocity fluctuations, and fracturing regimes in vibro-fluidized systems comprising coarser grains [21] and fine cohesive powders [29], respectively. Gaudel and co-workers [22] studied inclined granular flows using a transversely vibrated base in their experiments, and obtained vibration-driven flows at inclinations where the gravity is insufficient to induce flow. A scaling law was proposed based on minimum \Gamma required to activate the flow at low inclinations. This work was later supported by discrete element method (DEM) simulations of Gaudel et al. [30], where the gravity-driven flows at large inclination angles were found to be consistent with the Bagnold rheology [31]. However, the vibration-driven flows for inclinations below the critical angle were observed to deviate from Bagnold curve. Recently, d’Ambrosio et al. [32] found experimentally that base vibrations not only help reduce inter-particle friction and control the flow, but also promote segregation of fine particles that decrease basal friction and, thus, act as a lubricant [32]. It is worth remarking that such empirical observations help develop appropriate boundary conditions for theoretical treatments [33, 34, 20] of vibrated granular systems. Earlier, Zhu et al. [35] numerically studied granular flows on inclined surfaces under normal vibration to investigate earthquake-induced landslides, and also observed that mobility of flows is enhanced by low-frequency vibration. Niu et al. [36] recently discussed the effect of ground acceleration on thick granular flow under different gravity conditions. They found that vibration has a greater impact on the flow under low-gravity environments and low inclination angles. We note that the interplay of inclination angle and vibrational parameters is not well understood for grains flowing over vibrated inclined surfaces. In this work, thus, we examine through DEM simulations granular flows over inclined bases vibrated in a direction normal to itself; see Fig. 1. We study relatively thin flows with depth of about ten particle diameters, which require a narrow range of vibrational amplitude and frequency due to their higher susceptibility to base vibrations. For such systems, we characterize the flow rate in terms of S and \Gamma, offering a way to control granular flow on vibrated bases. To the best of our knowledge, such a correlation between the flow rate and these dimensionless numbers has not been explored for inclined granular flows. The organization of this paper is as follows. We present details of numerical simulations in Sec. II. The flow profiles on the fixed and vibrated bases are discussed in Sec. III, including scaling of the flow rate. Finally, we conclude in Sec. IV."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05891v1,Impacts of poroelastic spheres,"We study experimentally the impact on rigid surfaces of different soft porous solids saturated with liquid: hydrogel balls and liquid-saturated foam balls. The static contact of such soft solids with the substrate is well described by Hertz contact theory. However, their rebound behavior can only be explained by invoking a variety of dissipation mechanisms. We find that the restitution coefficient of soft porous balls generally increases with the impact velocity. We propose that this behavior can be explained by a combination of three ‘wet’ dissipation mechanisms: capillary adhesion, viscous dissipation in a liquid film between the ball and the substrate, and poroelastic dissipation due to porous flow inside the ball. While the first two dissipations are known, we present a new theory for poroelastic dissipation, and show that it allows experimental data for saturated foam balls to be reduced to a master curve against a suitably normalized impact velocity. The understanding of this dissipation mechanism with its dependence on both permeability of the porous solid and liquid viscosity can open the way towards engineering a new generation of shock absorbers and cushions.","In an elastic collision, kinetic energy is transformed into stored elastic energy, which is then transformed to kinetic energy again. However, collisions are imperfectly elastic and energy dissipation due to different mechanisms occurs. Here we study such energy dissipation in bouncing spheres: our objective is to unravel the intricate interplay of different energy dissipation forms in the particular case of wet poroelastic spheres, specifically liquid filled foam balls and hydrogel spheres. Bouncing of hydrogel balls have been first studied in 2003 by Tanaka [1, 2] who revealed that hydrogel spheres can undergo strong deformations upon impact without cracking and measured a strong variation of the coefficient of restitution with the impact velocity: Part of the initial kinetic energy is dissipated during the deformation. He also measured the reaction force of a deformed hydrogel sphere and showed that it deviates from Hertz’s law for strong deformations. Later, Waitukaitis et.al [3] studied bouncing of hydrogel spheres upon a hot surface and measured restitution coefficients which can be higher than unity. They explained these measurements by the coupling between the elastic deformation and the Leidenfrost effect coming from the evaporation of the water film covering the hydrogel. As the hydrogel is filled with water and is permeable, the evaporated water film is regenerated between each bounce and remains present for multiple rebounds above the hot surface. Conversely, impacts of filled open-cell foam balls have not yet been studied to our knowledge. However, deformations of foam materials have been studied previously under different conditions due to their applications in shock absorbers. In 1966, Gent and Rush [4] first proposed a theoretical description of the energy loss of a filled foam material under mechanical oscillatory deformation. They revealed that the liquid flow plays a major role in the energy loss as it is being forced to go in and out of the foam during a cyclic deformation. Later, Hilyard [5] studied impacts on a liquid filled foam material and in particular the contribution of the fluid flow on the impact behaviour. As the impact velocity increases, Hilyard observed an increase followed by a decrease of the ratio between the dissipated and stored energy within the elastic liquid filled foam. More recently, another study of the contribution of the fluid flow in porous material has been proposed by Dawson et.al [6]. In this experimental work, they also studied the contribution of the fluid to the elastic response of a liquid filled foam cylinder under slow compressive strain rate. They showed that in the elastic regime, the liquid flows through the porous material and induces an additional pressure which follows Darcy’s law. However, the energy dissipation due to the internal flow of the viscous fluid within the porous medium has not yet been investigated. In the experiments we report here, we study impacts of fluid filled poroelastic spheres and find remarkable agreement with Hertz contact theory for small deformations of the sphere upon impact on a solid surface: the elastic energy stored during the impact is not affected by the presence of the internal fluid. Still, the restitution coefficient strongly depends on the impact velocity. This allows to use a simple approach in which porous flow within the sphere is driven by the gradients in elastic pressure predicted by Hertz’s theory allowing to calculate analytically the effect of the poro-elasticity on the restitution coefficient of the spheres impacting solid substrates. This theory is then compared to experiments and very good agreement is found. In 1881, Heinrich Hertz published his pioneering work [7, 8] on the contact of two elastic ellipsoids. He gave an analytical expression for the force on a deformed elastic sphere in contact with a rigid surface. In elastic collisions, the initial kinetic energy (E_{k,0}\sim m{V_{0}}^{2}) is entirely restored as kinetic energy in the rebound (E_{k,r}\sim m{V_{R}}^{2}). This is so if there is no dissipation of energy during the impact, giving rise to a restitution coefficient e=1. The coefficient of restitution e is defined as the ratio between the rebound and the impact velocities V_{R} and V_{0} respectively. We preferably focus on the square of the coefficient of restitution which corresponds to the relative kinetic energy left after the impact. e^{2}=\frac{{V_{R}}^{2}}{{V_{0}}^{2}} (1) In reality, collisions are inelastic and a fraction of the incident energy is dissipated (E_{k,r}=E_{k,0}-E_{d}) during impact [9, 10], so that e^{2}<1. The kinetic energy of a dry ball impacting a surface can be dissipated through different mechanisms including plastic deformation [9, 11, 12, 13], frictional contacts due to the surface roughness [10], propagation of elastic waves [14, 15] and adhesive forces [16]. The ratio between the energy dissipated from the solid phase and the kinetic energy before the impact, denoted \alpha_{dry}=\frac{E_{d,dry}}{E_{k,0}}, is not investigated here but is taken into account by defining e_{ref} as follows : {e_{ref}}^{2}=1-\alpha_{dry} (2) When a liquid film covers the surface of the ball, additionnal dissipative effects are involved in the bouncing behaviour. In 1997, Johnson, Kendall and Roberts [17] modified the Hertz theory by incorporating the effect of adhesion. This is known as the JKR theory and is of interest for understanding aggregation problems or pull-off forces between two bodies. When the substrate and/or the ball’s surface is wet, the presence of a liquid film between the ball and the substrate affects the rebound of the ball as energy is required to overcome capillary forces during separation of the ball from the substrate. An expression for the role of the capillary adhesion force between two spheres has been proposed by Gollwitzer et.al [18]. This expression involves an adhesion force proportional to cos(\theta) with \theta being the contact angle of the liquid bridge in contact with the surface. During the approach phase, we can assume that the contact angle is around 90° as the liquid film spreads over the surface so the capillary force mainly plays a role during the rebound phase. Therefore, the energy cost needed to separate the ball from the surface is equivalent to the energy needed to create two new liquid-air interfaces is E_{\gamma}\sim\gamma{D_{max}}^{2} [17], where \gamma is the surface tension of the liquid-air interface and D_{max} is the maximum contact diameter of the ball with the substrate. If we assume that adhesion forces only affect the rebound phase and that D_{max} can be estimated using the Hertz model, the coefficient of restitution e is found from the equation of energy conservation after taking into account the energetic contribution of the capillary adhesion: e^{2}\sim{e_{ref}}^{2}-\frac{4\gamma\pi R\left(m/k\right)^{2/5}}{m}V_{0}^{-6/5} (3) In equation (3), R and m are respectively the radius and the mass of the ball and k={16\sqrt{R}E_{0}}/{15\left(1-\nu^{2}\right)} is a constant that depends on the elastic modulus E_{0} and the Poisson ratio \nu of the ball. For convenience we rewrite equation (3) as: e^{2}={e_{ref}}^{2}-\alpha_{Adh} (4) Below we shall call equation (4) the ‘capillary adhesion’ dissipation model. Details of the model are given in Supplementary Information. During the contact of the wet ball with the surface, the thin liquid film formed between the surface and the ball is squeezed resulting in additional viscous losses: This situation is known as elastohydrodynamic collision [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Based on lubrication theory, Davis et.al [23] proposed a simple model to account for the dissipation in the viscous film. They showed that the rebound of the sphere depends on the Stokes number St=mV_{0}/(6\pi\eta R^{2}) where \eta is the viscosity of the liquid film and that no rebound occurs below a critical Stokes number St_{c}. They found that e is given by e^{2}=\left(1-\frac{St_{c}}{St}\right)^{2} (5) The critical Stokes number St_{c} is defined as St_{c}=\frac{x_{0}}{x_{r}} with x_{0} the initial film thickness and x_{r} the minimum distance between the solid sphere and the surface during the contact which depends on the liquid film properties (thickness, viscosity) and the elastic properties of the ball [19]. Details of the model are given in Supplementary Information. We shall henceforth call equation (5) the ‘viscous film’ dissipation model. For convenience, we rewrite it as: e^{2}={e_{ref}}^{2}-\alpha_{Film} (6) The total effect of capillary adhesion plus viscous film dissipation is obtained by combining equations (4) and (6). e^{2}={e_{ref}}^{2}-\alpha_{Adh}-\alpha_{Film} (7) Impacts of wet spheres have been studied previously [19, 17, 23, 18, 24, 25] and different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the bouncing behaviour of such spheres. In addition to previously well-studied dissipation mechanisms such as capillary adhesion [11, 25] and thin-film viscous dissipation [19, 23], we propose a new model for the dissipation due to the coupling between the porous ball’s deformation and internal flow within the poro-elastic material. The third dissipation model we shall consider is a ‘poroelastic’ model. If the ball is porous and fluid-filled, its deformation during impact will induce pressure gradients that drive internal porous flow, producing additional viscous dissipation [26, 27, 28]. The derivation of this model is given below in the Results section. As we shall show, poroelastic dissipation is important and even dominant in some cases."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07141v1,"Cell bulging and extrusion
in a three-dimensional bubbly vertex model
for curved epithelial sheets","Cell extrusion is an essential mechanism for controlling cell density in epithelial tissues. Another essential element of epithelia is curvature, which is required to achieve complex shapes, like in the lung or intestine. Here we introduce a three-dimensional bubbly vertex model to study the interplay between extrusion and curvature. We find a generic cellular bulging instability at topological defects which is much stronger than for standard vertex models. To clarify the underlying mechanism, we analytically calculate the energy landscape for a single bulging cell in a mean field tissue. We find that extrusion is energetically preferred at topological defects due to a redistribution of Gaussian curvature into the defect. We show that it can be driven both by a decrease in apico-basal tension or by contractile line tensions. We also show that extrusion can be suppressed by luminal pressure and interfacial bending rigidity, allowing for additional control of this important process. Our theory suggests that epithelial curvature naturally leads to cell bulging and extrusion because the interfacial curvature of individual cells at the defects strongly amplifies buckling effected by tissue-scale topological defects in elastic sheets.","Epithelial tissues are close-packed and sealed cell layers that form the barriers between different compartments in the body, for example in the lung or the intestine. In order to regulate their cell density, they have to achieve a balance between cell division and cell death. Recently it has become clear that both processes are strongly connected to mechanics: cells divide more if they are stretched by neighboring cells at low cell density, and they stop dividing and die if the epithelium becomes too crowded [1, 2, 3]. In order to make sure that dying cells leave the tissue without disrupting its barrier function, they are expelled by extrusion, which means they are squeezed out of the epithelium without the generation of any voids [4, 5]. Extrusion is especially prominent in the intestine, where the epithelium renews itself every 3-5 days [6]. Here cells proliferate in the crypt regions and then move in a constant stream to the tip of villi, where they are extruded [7]. The exact mechanisms of extrusion are not clear, but one important element seems to be the presence of specialized actin structures on the lateral and basal sides [3]. For flat model epithelia, it has been shown that cell extrusion occurs preferentially at topological defects in the nematic orientation field of the cells [8, 9, 10]. In general, cells in non-stratified epithelia tend to have hexagonal order, because this is the close-packed optimum in two dimensions, similar to the situation in sphere packings and foams. Hexagonal order is also dominant in curved epithelial sheets [11, 12, 13, 14]. However, now some pentagonal defects are required to generate curvature [12]. Due to Euler’s polyhedron theorem, 12 pentagonal defects are required to achieve the topology of a sphere, with the possibility of additional pentagonal-heptagonal pairs. Thus topological defects occur naturally in curved epithelia, while in flat cell layers, they arise rather a in stochastic manner from the movement of cells. Because epithelia are often curved due to their biological function, for example in the crypts and villi of the intestine, the question arises if they might use the naturally occurring topological defects to promote cell extrusion. While previous theoretical models have addressed such extrusion in a flat configuration focusing on fluid-like epithelia [15] or neglecting the three-dimensional nature of the problem [16], the coupling of curvature, defects, and shape instabilities has hardly been addressed before. Defects in such a setting have been linked to extrusion in flat epithelia on a substrate in phase field models of tissues [15] and to shape instabilities in vertex models [17], but the underlying mechanisms and their relation to curvature have not been addressed yet. Recently, we have reported on a morphological instability at topological disclination defects in curved hexagonal epithelia in the three-dimensional vertex model (VM) [18]. This buckling instability arises because spherical epithelia are effectively elastic shells, similar to viral capsids [19, 20] or buckyballs [21], for which such an instability is known since the pioneering work by Seung and Nelson [22]. However, the standard VM does not consider that cells might adapt their own interfacial curvature to their mechanical environment, which must be the first step toward bulging and extrusion. Here we investigate this aspect by using the bubbly vertex model (BVM). In contrast to the normal VM, which describes multicellular systems with flat interfaces, in the BVM the interfaces are curved [23, 24, 25]. Such interfacial curvature leverages the three-dimensional nature of the cellular system and allows for different mechanisms than the usual VM-approach to epithelia. Here we show that the BVM for curved epithelial sheets naturally explains why and how cells can extrude preferentially at topological defects. We start in Section II by showing with computer simulations that the curved interfaces in the BVM strongly amplify the buckling at defects in curved sheets if compared to the standard VM with flat interfaces. To understand the underlying instability theoretically, we consider the representative case of a shell with icosahedral symmetry in which interfacial curvature leads to a significant lowering of a previously described icosahedral buckling threshold [18, 19, 22]. In Section III we develop a continuum description of a defect cell in a mean field tissue, which allows us to analytically understand the underlying instability. We find that the possibility of curved interfaces results in a local decrease of the saddle splay modulus, thus leading to localization of Gaussian curvature in the defect. This analytical model captures the numerical shapes of icosahedral vertex model shells. Generalizing it in Section IV to shells without such strong symmetry properties, allows us to generally formulate a model for cell extrusion at pentagonal and hexagonal cells in a curved epithelial sheet. We find that both lowering the apico-basal surface tension and a supracellular actin ring may initiate bulging, while only the former allows for a transition of a partially extruded geometry toward full extrusion. Our model predicts a lower energy barrier for extrusion at topological (pentagonal) defects. Further, we show that this tendency can be reduced by increasing luminal pressure or rigidifying cellular interfaces. We close in Section V with a discussion of our results, including the relation to experimental observations."
https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06818v1,Mechanism of the Nonequilibrium Phase Transition in Self-Propelled Particles with Alignment,"Self-propelled particles with alignment, displaying ordered collective motions such as swarming, can be investigated by the well-known Vicsek model. However, challenges still remain regarding the nature of the associated phase transition. Here, we use the landscape-flux approach combined with the coarse-grained mapping method to reveal the underlying mechanism of the continuous or discontinuous order-disorder nonequilibrium phase transition in Vicsek model systems featuring diverse noise characteristics. It is found that the nonequilibrium flux inside the landscape in the density-alignment degree phase space always rotates counterclockwise, and tends to delocalize or destabilize the point attractor states, providing the dynamical driving force for altering the landscape shape and the system state. Furthermore, the variations in the averaged flux and entropy production rate exhibit pronounced differences across various noise types. This not only helps to reveal the dynamical and thermodynamical mechanisms of the order-disorder transition but also offers a useful tool to recognize the continuity of the transition. Our findings present a novel perspective for exploring nonequilibrium phase transition behaviors and other collective motions in various complex systems.","References Bechinger et al. [2016] C.

https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06732v1,Short-range depinning in the presence of velocity-weakening,"Phenomena including friction and earthquakes are complicated by the joint presence of disorder and non-linear instabilites, such as those triggered by the presence of velocity weakening. In [1], we provided a theory for the nucleation of flow and the magnitude of hysteresis, building on recent results on disorder-free systems described by so called rate-and-state descriptions of the frictional interface, and treating disorder perturbatively. This theory was tested for models of frictional interfaces, where long range elastic interactions are present. Here we test it for short-range depinning, and confirm that (i) nucleation is triggered by avalanches, governed by a critical point at some threshold force f_{c} close to the minimum of the flow curve and that (ii) due to an armouring mechanism by which the elastic manifold displays very little plasticity after a big slip event, very slowly decaying finite size effects dominate the hysteresis magnitude, with an exponent we can relate to other observables.","Elastic interfaces pinned by disorder are found in various systems, including crack fronts in fracture [2], frictional interfaces [3], domain walls in magnets [4, 5], sliding charge density waves [6] or vortex lattices in superconductors [7]. In the absence of temperature, the interface is pinned by impurities, but undergoes a depinning transition [8, 9, 10] at some critical force (or stress, or magnetic field). When inertia is not present, the physics is well-understood: the interface moves via large reorganizations called avalanches, and the velocity of the interface grows above the depinning threshold where it vanishes with some critical exponent. In other systems, such as frictional interface [11, 12], crack fronts in brittle materials [13] or wetting on rough solid surfaces [14, 15], a sufficient inertia or other effects can induce the flow curve to be non-monotonic [16, 17, 18]. Indeed, in the presence of inertial effects, flow generates acoustic waves, that can make it easier to jump over local barriers induced by disorder, in turn accelerating flow. Such positive feedback can lead to velocity-weakening as sketched in Fig. 1a, causing instabilities and stick-slip. How such instabilities are triggered as the force is slowly increased is a central question to various fields, including earthquake science and tribology. Understanding it remains a theoretical challenge, as one needs to deal both with disorder and the presence of non-linear instabilities. This question relates to what controls the magnitude of hysteresis effects apparent when comparing the starting point of the flow upon increasing the applied load to its stopping point upon decreasing it again. At least three scenarios have been proposed for how the depinning transition is affected by inertia: Scenario A: The depinning transition becomes first order as soon as inertia is present. For a finite amount of inertia, motion is triggered by small avalanches, and the hysteresis loop is of finite magnitude in the thermodynamic limit. This picture was obtained by treating inertia as a perturbation around the usual depinning behaviour [19]. It does not occur in mean-field [16] nor in more recent numerical observations [17, 18, 20, 21], where for mild inertial effects evidence of a continuous transition exists. Scenario B: For small inertia, the flow curve is still monotonic with some modified threshold force f_{c}^{\downarrow} [22]. Flow is critical at f_{c}^{\downarrow}, and in the same universality class as when inertia is absent. The hysteresis loop vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, but very slowly, due to a combination of two effects. First, nucleation of flow emerges from rare avalanches exceeding a size \ell_{c}\sim(f-f_{c}^{\downarrow})^{-\tilde{\nu}}, where \tilde{\nu} is a critical exponent characterizing the depinning transition in the absence of inertia. Second, only rare sites can yield under loading after a slip event and trigger an avalanche. Limitations of this approach are the following. Limitation B1: It was supported by an automaton model where inertia is modelled as a brief overshoot of the force change in sites surrounding rearrangements. In [23], it was argued that for more generic automaton models, a finite hysteresis should be present, while flow is still governed by a continuous transition at f_{c}^{\downarrow}. These results indicate the need to go beyond automaton models and model inertia more accurately. Limitation B2: This approach focused on small inertial effects, and did not capture macroscopic velocity weakening. Limitation B3: The nucleation picture could not be tested precisely because in systems of limited size, flow is triggered far from f_{c}^{\downarrow}. Scenario C: In a recent work [1], we addressed these limitations and focused on the case where velocity weakening is present (thus scenario C needs not contradict scenario B, as these could each apply at different levels of inertial effect or damping coefficient). We built on the rate-and-state description of homogeneous frictional interfaces which includes from the start velocity weakening of the interface [24, 25], and treat disorder pertubatively. A result of the rate-and-state literature [26, 27] central to our approach is pictured in Fig. 1: for a pure system, there exists a threshold force f_{c} (very) slightly above the minimum f_{\min} of the flow curve v(f), where a frictional interface can be destabilized and rupture – a result that holds both for short and long-range elastic interactions [27]. In [1], we argued that in the presence of disorder, f_{c} controls nucleation, triggered by avalanches whose extension goes beyond some length: \ell_{c}(f)\sim(f-f_{c})^{-\nu}. (1) The exponent \nu in the presence of velocity-weakening differs from \tilde{\nu} observed in its absence. Nucleation is revealed by a bimodal distribution of event sizes 111 Such a bimodal distribution for earthquakes on a single fault was argued based on seismic data in [28]. , corresponding of both avalanches and system-spanning events, as sketched Fig. 2c. Thus, nucleation from the static phase is controlled by a critical point at f_{c}, as pictured in Fig. 2. In this scenario, there exists a tiny finite hysteresis in the thermodynamic limit because f_{c}>f_{\min}, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The flow regime, by contrast, displays a first order transition when the load is reduced. In this scenario, the hysteresis magnitude displays very slowly decaying finite size effects, for reasons similar to those put forward in scenario B and [22] (except that hysteresis magnitude does not decay to zero as f_{c}>f_{\min}). In particular, after a large slip event, the system is depleted of weak regions about to trigger an avalanche (i.e. “yield”). The density of such regions was argued to vanish at a small local yield threshold x as a power law P(x)\sim x^{\theta^{\prime}} in [29, 30], an effect we called “armouring” of the interface. Such a power-law distribution is refereed to as pseudo-gap in the literature [31, 32]. It leads to a scaling law for the excess hysteresis magnitude as a function of system size. These results were tested in [29, 1] using a finite element model where inertia is treated by actually solving Newton’s equation, and where disorder is modelled with a random potential acting on each element, inspired by a previous model by Jagla [33]. A central idea to test this picture of nucleation was to trigger avalanches at various force levels 222 More precisely, stress levels. [29], as the spontaneous triggering of avalanches under loading around f_{c} is too rare to allow for statistical analysis. These studies focused on long-range interactions, where additional effects (such as “radiation damping”) make this scenario slightly more complicated to test. In the present work, we test scenario C for a one dimensional elastic line pinned by disorder, with short-range elastic interactions. We first verify our prediction on nucleation in Eq. 1, which requires both to access the non-monotonic flow curve, used to extract f_{c} (approximated as f_{\min}), as well as to study the statistics of avalanches artificially triggered at different forces along the stick-slip cycle. Secondly, we confirm our predictions for how the magnitude of the hysteresis cycle depends on system size. Thereto, we combine the avalanche and nucleation properties with the density of regions about to yield, P(x), through the associated pseudo-gap exponent. (a) (b) Figure 1: [Sketch] LABEL:sub@fig:nonmonotic:a When the flow curve (force f vs velocity v) is non-monotonic, with a minimum at f=f_{\min}, there exists a threshold force f_{c} beyond which the static phase is unstable to system-spanning events. LABEL:sub@fig:nonmonotic:b A finite hysteresis is predicted in the thermodynamic limit, such that a system driven quasi-statically through a weak spring displays stick-slip. Thereby, power law distributed avalanches protect the interface from building up a load f>f_{c} where it is unstable. After the instability, the interface unloads to f=f_{\min} while slipping (see corresponding cycle in panel LABEL:sub@fig:nonmonotic:a with the same colour coding). (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 2: [Sketch] (LABEL:sub@fig:pre:flow-LABEL:sub@fig:pre:stick-slip) In a quasi-statically loaded finite system with disorder, avalanches occur as the force increases. They nucleate slip once their extension \ell>\ell_{c}\sim(f-f_{c})^{-\nu} if f>f_{c}. The force at which nucleation occurs fluctuates, we denote by f_{s} its means (and study below how the magnitude of hysteresis \Delta f=f_{s}-f_{c} depends on L). LABEL:sub@fig:pre:bimodal The corresponding distribution of event extensions, P(\ell), during a quasi-static cycle is bimodal, with avalanches up to a scale \ell_{\max}(f_{s}), and system-spanning events (\ell=L). See Appendix B for numerical evidence of bimodality. LABEL:sub@fig:pre:ellc To study the properties of avalanches in an infinite system, and to quantify \ell_{c}, we trigger avalanches at different forces f. The distribution of their linear extension \ell is scale free at f_{c} while at f>f_{c} avalanches transition to system-spanning events if \ell>\ell_{c} (system-spanning events are excluded from the shown distributions)."
